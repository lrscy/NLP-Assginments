We should aim in fact to lead, rather than harness, the globalisation process.
In these circumstances it is essential for the Union to develop a coherent, over-arching strategy which will better define its strategic priorities in the 21st century for the world outside, and that must begin with this budget.
Secondly, interlinked with the first priority, is that of ensuring security for European citizens in areas such as freedom and security and justice, as well as the specific sector of energy supply that we have just been discussing.
No less important for us is the third priority, dealing with internal policies.
Here we must focus on those areas that are key to Europeâs competitiveness and our future prosperity. These include research and innovation, innovative measures for SMEs, support for lifelong learning for renewing skills and key infrastructure projects.
In the light of limitations on the Unionâs financial resources, we must examine more closely the quality of European Union expenditure.
The beginning of a new financial perspective offers a significant opportunity for starting a rolling programme for assessing the performance of EU activities.
Through cost-benefit analyses we will take steps to assess whether specific actions achieve their objectives, what their impact was compared to the quantity of expenditure allocated, and what European added value they contributed.
We are convinced that such a focus on quality is essential in order to compensate for a lack of quantity in budgetary means.
This would mean deleting programmes if they no longer produce value for money and creating programmes that are more relevant to a changing global environment.
It should also mean avoiding the use of public funds, for example in information policy, where EU-financed actions could replace viable, ongoing private initiatives.
We believe that Parliament must take the initiative to begin preparations for the mid-term review of the next multiannual financial framework planned for 2008.
This will allow us to drive forward the comprehensive reassessment of the EUâs revenue and expenditure and shake up the system in order to create momentum for adapting our political priorities.
In conclusion, the 2007 budget procedure, as the first budget of the new financial perspective, represents a real opportunity for a broad mobilisation to adjust to the new policy challenges of a fast-changing world.
This fits in, Madam Commissioner, with the Commissionâs focus on policy by results, but a broader global vision is needed.
Let us be open to new ideas and provide a strong focus on policy priorities, while improving the EUâs accountability.
Finally, I will warmly welcome contributions from the outset from all parliamentary committees to establish the sectoral priorities for this budget.
I believe we have a great opportunity to shape our future policies together and respond effectively to the demands of European citizens.
Â Â  Under Rule 142(5) MrÂ Elles did indeed have the right to speak first, so let me congratulate you, Commissioner, on your accurate knowledge of the Rules of this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is not only a case of knowledge but of respect.
I wish to thank Mr Elles for a very good start to the process in which we are engaging in the first year of the new financial perspective, after the successful signature and vote today in Parliament.
Today we are starting a process in which we will be engaged seriously in preparation for the first year of this financial perspective, a symbolically important year.
In the report on the APS, policy priorities have been set and we think that the core goals and priorities of the Commissionâs five-year strategic objectives are reflected in the 2007 budget proposal.
On prosperity, growth and employment, about 43% of our preliminary draft budget is to be devoted to the Lisbon Strategy through Headings 1a and 1b.
The Commission is also committed towards close cooperation with the EIB on new financial instruments to increase the leverage effect of the EU budget for Lisbon-related priorities, including trans-European networks and support to SMEs.
On solidarity, security and freedom, which are important priorities mentioned in the APS, we have already included EURÂ 291 million for solidarity and management of migration, including the External Borders Fund and the Fund for Integration of Third Country Nationals.
The Commission proposes a 17% increase for environmental policies, including the extension of the Emissions Trading Scheme to the new Member States.
On external relations, we agree that Europe, as a world partner, needs to support this area financially.
The key action for 2007 is the start-up of new programmes, such as the Instrument for Pre-Accession and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.
We must also continue to strengthen relations with our partners in the developed world.
On EU governance and human and financial resources for 2007, I should like to point out that we have already requested 610 new posts in relation to the last enlargement, and 230 to prepare for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
The Commission proposes the redeployment of about 600 staff between its DGs to serve priorities other than enlargement-related needs.
On value for money, I am fully in favour of a wider, more macroeconomic approach towards the assessment of how European financial resources are used.
I am satisfied that the new part III of the IIA on sound financial management is, and will be, effectively and fully implemented.
I have proposed the introduction of an early warning system to ensure more accurate forecasts and close monitoring of budget implementation.
We will listen very carefully and take into account all your opinions expressed today and in the future.
We are always ready to cooperate with you and the Council in an open-minded manner, and we hope to have a very good result: a favourable budget by the end of this year.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me make some remarks from the point of view of development cooperation.
In my view, the Commission is seeking to amalgamate various budget lines.
If it succeeds, it will no longer be possible for this Parliament to take decisions on how much is allocated to important sectors such as combating HIV/AIDS.
Parliament should not allow its powers to be curtailed in this way.
Secondly, the Commissionâs APS document does not refer at all to the Millennium Development Goals or sectors important for poverty reduction, particularly education and poverty diseases.
What is more, I have to insist that the âsimplificationâ of the legislative context for external action for the period from 2007 to 2013 must not result in a loss of transparency in the use of development policy resources and that the breakdown between budget lines for geographical regions and thematic sectors for the 2007 budget must allow for at least the same level of visibility as the 2006 budget.
In addition, let me mention the importance of the Commission monitoring the Member States and their official development assistance levels, because of the problem of some Member States overstating ODA levels by taking into account funds that are not actually part of ODA.
Linked to the ODA level is aid effectiveness and quality.
The Commission must continue to implement the Paris Agenda on aid effectiveness and show the public that EU development aid makes a difference.
Finally, I want to underline the need always to put the fight against poverty at the top of the EU agenda and, therefore, the need to strive for a substantial share of aid to go to the LDCs.
Â Â  . Mr President, the global challenges facing the European Union have never been greater, yet we will have to face these challenges with limited resources.
It is therefore vital, as the Commission rightly says, that these resources are clearly targeted at our priorities.
The Committee on International Trade fully supports the Commissionâs efforts to improve policy coherence between the Communityâs external and internal policies.
In our opinion, all new policy initiatives regarding the internal market should be carefully assessed in the light of their external impact.
The International Trade Committee supports the rapporteur in calling for the Commission to target resources at the new global challenges we face, particularly the rise of India and China.
It wishes to emphasise the contribution that a successful Doha Round could make to freeing up resources.
Firstly, the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidy by 2013 would bring significant budgetary savings.
Secondly, a successful round would lead to growth of the European Union economy as a whole and therefore help the EU budget grow.
A key component in making a success of the Doha Round is to persuade the developing countries to sign up for Doha.
In this respect, the EU has recognised that for them to get something out of Doha, they need to be linked into the world trading system.
At the G8 Summit last July, President Barroso promised EURÂ 1 billion a year in trade-related assistance.
If this is not delivered, the cynicism displayed by the developing countries at WTO talks will simply grow.
The International Trade Committee believes that this cannot just be a cosmetic re-labelling of existing aid.
It has to be genuinely new money.
We would like to suggest both to the rapporteur, in terms of the conclusions the committee draws from this report, and to the Commission, that the latter should report to us annually on how it is spending the EURÂ 1 billion that Mr Barroso promised on trade-related assistance, so that we can see that being delivered on a transparent basis.
Â Â  . Mr President, at noon today we finished the preparations for the new financial perspective, while this evening we return to the routine of annual budgets.
However, the experience of this parliamentary term tells us that while procedures may be repeated, there is no such thing as a budget that may be repeated in its entirety, so there is no budgetary routine, as each of the budgets we have had up until now has had its specific characteristics.
2005 was the first year in an enlarged Europe, the 2006 budget was a bridge between the old and the new financial perspective, while 2007 and the 2007 budget will be the launch of a new generation of multiannual programmes, and that is the real characteristic of the 2007 budget.
Our rapporteur, MrÂ Elles, presented the priorities and gained the support of the majority of the Committee on Budgets for these priorities.
Knowing his powers of persuasion, he will obtain a parliamentary majority.
However, the real context for the debate on budget strategy for 2007 is no longer the Commission guidelines on strategy, but the figures presented for 2007 by the Commission, as they are clearly influenced by this new generation of programmes â as can very easily be seen in chapter 1a, in chapter 3a and in the chapter on foreign policy.
I also believe that an effective launch for the new generation of multiannual programmes is one of the basic ways of measuring the success of the 2007 budget, while respecting the priorities presented to us by MrÂ Elles.
If we can launch the programmes well, we can return to the annual routine, which will once again turn out to be not so routine after all.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as PresidentÂ Lewandowski said, we have been aware since this morning of the definitive framework for the European budgets for the next seven years.
Since this morning, we have, then, been aware of Parliamentâs need to remain modest, and even humble, with regard to the proposals it may allow itself to put forward.
Even if this framework is in itself new, there will also, I hope, be another new feature, namely that this will be a budget for 27 Member States.
As coordinator for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am keen to champion respect for the commitments we have made to Europeans.
With regard to our priorities, these will remain, in the first place, the internal policies that are to support the Lisbon Objectives, not forgetting the environment and rural development. Only in this way will a balanced approach to territorial planning be guaranteed.
The promotion of sustainable growth and job creation in the EU implies not only that the Member States will properly implement legislation, both that in force and that proposed, but also that we will propose more ambitious objectives in these areas.
2007 will also have to be the year in which our policy for communicating with our citizens is overhauled.
In the same way, I would urge a balanced approach to administering the EUâs external borders, as we cannot be content with a unilateral, security-based approach.
Policies linked to immigration must be counterbalanced by the integration of third-country nationals and by solidarity in administering borders.
Let us not forget that security is also about protecting individual freedoms.
We therefore need to develop policies in favour of refugees.
Where external policy is concerned, our watchwords are not only development, democratisation and human rights but also respect for the Millennium Goals, which constitute an absolute priority.
The EU must provide itself with the appropriate tools to enable it to make its presence felt on the international stage.
Finally, I would take the liberty of coming out in favour of co-funding by the European Investment Bank of programmes crucial to giving practical expression to the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies.
These would be constructive arrangements.
I wish, however, to point out the need to guarantee public funding on a scale large enough to create the leverage conditions expected by the EIB.
Loan guarantees and other such measures are in no position to replace the new money that only the EU can guarantee.
I should like to tell you, Commissioner, that I read with great interest that the Commission was banking on an acceleration of European growth in 2006.
This means high growth, since a 2.6% increase is anticipated.
Your communiquÃ©s state that Europe would be in a position to create 3.6Â million jobs.
Apart from the fact that these forecasts remain less than completely reliable, particularly in view of the fluctuation that is a predominant feature of the oil markets, do you think that this growth is sufficient to provide Europe with the financial resources necessary to its development?
To conclude, I wish MrÂ Elles good luck.
He must, in turn, try to inject some ambition into this budget. I think, however, that, with such a rigid and narrow budgetary framework, it will be difficult for him to find the resources for the ambitious policy expected by Europeans.
Â Â  . Mr President, first I want to thank the rappporteur, MrÂ Elles, for a very constructive report concerning the Commissionâs annual policy strategy.
It clearly sets out those priorities that Parliament has identified and advocated in the negotiations on the financial framework.
My group wishes to stress in particular the importance of unhindered traffic in the workings of the internal market, and for that reason it has tabled two amendments.
The EUâs greatest challenge is reducing unemployment. That is why programmes which promote growth and employment are very important.
These are, in particular, the Seventh Framework Programme, which concerns research and development, and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme for small and medium-sized enterprises.
They should be quickly brought to completion.
Structural and cohesion policy will be among the major challenges facing the EU in the forthcoming programming period.
Considerable sums have been set aside for these in the financial framework, especially for the new Member States.
It is important that these funds are used.
That is why the programmes must be made ready quickly and efficiently.
Ideally, they should be adopted some time this year, but in any case no later than next year, otherwise the funds that have been granted will remain unspent, as they were in the first few years of the Agenda 2000 programming period.
That delayed the implementation of projects and at the same time caused a considerable backlog of outstanding commitments, which has still not been cleared.
Parliament needs to prepare for the mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework and the agricultural reform in good time.
In this connection, the subject of compulsory cofinancing of direct agricultural aid must be clearly raised.
That would reduce the EUâs budgetary expenditure, even out the differences in the Member Statesâ net contributions, increase Member Statesâ responsibility for spending funds and do more to safeguard the livelihood of farmers within the context of the current ceiling for expenditure.
Our group supports this.
With these observations we are prepared to give the report our support.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, our rapporteur has done a very careful and very thorough job.
It is no criticism of him to say that the value of the exercise to which we are devoting ourselves this evening is, however, fairly limited, indeed very limited, particularly by the outcome of the vote taken by our Parliament this morning.
Since Parliament had stated that the amount of the financial perspective had to be increased considerably and since its idea was to obtain a three-figure extension, I, for my part, was hoping for at least a two-figure extension.
Instead, we voted this morning in favour of a small, one-figure, extension: EURÂ 2Â billion plus EURÂ 2Â billion.
All future policy initiatives will therefore see their margins for manoeuvre severely limited, to the point of being almost non-existent.
Thus, our rapporteur states, in his first paragraph, that the 2007-2013 financial perspective is backward-looking and therefore poorly placed to respond effectively to the challenges concerned.
He also points out, in paragraph 2, that the Annual Policy Strategy does not reflect the urgency with which such challenges should be addressed.
I rest my case.
In these circumstances, my group is obviously trying to define a few priorities.
The first, which is along the lines of the rapporteurâs own thinking, is about achieving maximum impact.
When you do not have much money, you have to make good use of such money as you do have.
Some serious studies therefore need to be carried out on the cost-efficiency ratio, particularly in relation to the Lisbon and Gothenburg Strategies.
There is a tendency to forget that these strategies are not only about competitiveness but also about the social and employment dimensions.
In the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is a good thing to invest in sustainable development.
The second priority concerns the rendezvous clause.
MrsÂ GrybauskaitÄ, we believe - or, rather, we still try to believe - in the rendezvous clause, which we also voted in favour of this morning.
Thanks to this clause, we shall be able perhaps finally to show new margins, particularly where agriculture is concerned.
All the same, I am sorry that our friends from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have decided to delete the passage on aid that might be given to agriculture, possibly at national level.
This morning, we left a few doors open with the help of the rendezvous clause.
This evening, we see that these doors are very narrow, in spite of the high-quality work done by our fellow Member.
Please, let us leave them as they are.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, our group has demonstrated its dissatisfaction with the financial frameworks for the period 2007-2013 by voting against the adoption of MrÂ BÃ¶geâs report on todayâs plenary.
The main reason was that the low level of appropriations did not reflect the needs that our group saw as vital to developing positive European programmes.
The new financial frameworks are thought to be backward-looking in MrÂ Ellesâ report too.
We want to see more cohesion, more science and research, more concern for the environment, and more social welfare.
Our group, however, does not feel any need to militarise the EUâs Foreign and Security Policy.
Militarisation was one of the Councilâs main areas of focus in the new financial frameworks and the Council also secured financing for it in the new Interinstitutional Agreement with Parliament.
Although the EU Constitutional Treaty was rejected, the Commission and the Council may start to develop a common foreign affairs administration for the Union.
That would mean an increase in the powers of the Union at the expense of the Member States.
Sovereignty in foreign policy is one of the main hallmarks of an independent state.
Regarding the Lisbon Objectives, our group has condemned their limited scope regarding social welfare.
They only address the needs of companies, and not the needs of their employees.
The Commissionâs proposal for a special Globalisation Fund is a disappointment, in that a condition of Community aid is mass lay-offs, where at least 1Â 000 workers lose their jobs.
Neither does our group support the Commissionâs approach known as the information policy.
The Unionâs institutions are using money for the dissemination of information for propaganda, instead of looking in the mirror and trying to find out what the problem is when the public criticises the Union.
There will be nothing wrong with the mirror, either.
We must set about preparing to draft and implement the multiannual programmes fast; otherwise the year 2007 will see a dramatic underutilisation of many appropriations.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on Budgets provides an elegant overview of its subject, highlights a large number of important issues for developing countries, discusses the importance of being economical with EU funds and stresses the importance of strict prioritisation.
Is anyone against any of this?
No.
Yet the problem with the report is this â it fails to take a view on the question of at what level these important questions ought to be dealt with.
Should this be at EU level or at national level?
It fails to take a view on how the regulatory system should be changed in order to push forward this improved economy and it fails to take a view on what it is that is to be done away with or cut back in order to make it possible to prioritise other things.
Let me put forward some suggestions.
A very large part of what is proposed for the stimulation of growth in order to meet the requirements of globalisation in terms of adaptation and the like consists of matters that are best tackled by the Member States themselves, in worthy competition with each other to find solutions that work.
This applies to almost the entire Lisbon Agenda, the small businesses policy and research activity.
It is difficult to come up with any reasons to regulate these matters at EU level.
Things that do constitute important tasks to be performed at EU level are, for example, regulating the trading of emissions rights for carbon dioxide.
The EU leads the world in this area, and it would be a disaster if this system, into which Russia and Japan are due to enter in a couple of yearsâ time, were to collapse over time.
The trading of emissions rights must now be restructured.
One important step could be for the governments of the Member States to be able to sell emissions right to companies at auction.
What is more, emissions rights must be extended to cover greater areas of the economy and more and more countries.
This is an essential task for the European Union, and one of a global character.
We speak all the time of the principle of subsidiarity, but when things get serious this principle is nowhere to be seen.
According to the report, nearly every problem is something for the EU to get to grips with.
Regulatory systems in need of amendment are, amongst others, those relating to agricultural policy.
In this area we need to steer development in the direction of renationalising the costs of gradually creating political opportunities to carry out a liberalisation of the whole system.
Finally, we must discuss in detail what needs to be done away with or cut back so that other things may be prioritised.
We must earnestly begin to analyse and discuss which of the EU institutions should be abolished.
We should, for example, put an end to the European Economic and Social Committee and to the Committee of the Regions.
These two institutions have outlived their purpose.
We must at last reach the point where we make Brussels the seat of the European Parliament and allow the building in which we now find ourselves to become the seat of an EU University, for example.
This would be extremely advantageous not only for Parliament but also for the city of Strasbourg.
It would mean that the cityâs service providers â hotels, restaurants, taxis and the like â could be steadily busy over time and through the year rather than being overloaded for a few days a month and facing underoccupancy the rest of the time.
Â Â  . It has been said that if you cannot change matters on the basis of principle, then at least take aÂ principled attitude towards them.
It appears that many principled approaches were taken in the approval process for the 2007 budget proposal.
On 3Â May the European Commission adopted aÂ provisional Budget for 2007.
In doing so it took the first step towards establishing aÂ budget for the first year of aÂ seven-year period, but I hope that it will not be as painful each time over the years 2007 to 2013.
If the Commissioner regards the proposed budget as a minimalist budget, IÂ will have to agree with her.
On the other hand, it is hard to see that this budget will make aÂ fundamental contribution to supporting European competitiveness.
It is rather a conventional budget.
It is true, however, that the compromise we have achieved on the budgetary ceiling for the 2007-2013 financial framework will not leave the Commission much room for manoeuvre. This can be seen by the data on the overall increase in payments compared with 2006.
The overall 3.9% growth in payments actually seems quite moderate.
If we take into account anticipated inflation of 2% in 2007, this leaves aÂ mere 1.9% more in the real funding for the needs of European policy in that year. And this at aÂ time when 30Â million Bulgarians and Romanians will be joining the European Union in January 2007.
There have been changes in the structure of the budget that IÂ regard as positive.
Expenditure on natural resources and agriculture will only increase by 1.2%, while funds earmarked for competitiveness and the cohesion policy for growth and employment will grow by more than 12%.
However, the effective use of this funding will be aÂ key issue.
Knowledge transfer within the economy should be supported with further cash earmarked for programmes on competitiveness and innovation, the development of trans-European networks and lifelong learning.
AÂ new element is the globalisation fund of EUR 500 million to help workers made redundant as aÂ result of industrial restructuring.
However, the effective use of this funding will again be an issue.
We can continue to debate questions to do with adding aÂ little bit here and taking away aÂ little bit there.
With its proposal the Commission has set aÂ fairly strict, but not unrealistic level.
It will be difficult for the European Council to lower this budgetary hurdle, and for the European Parliament to raise it.
The budgetary compromise for 2007 should therefore remain very close to these levels.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that the first thing we should talk about is the actual function of this debate on annual strategic priorities, since in principle the intention was to establish a proper communication with the European Commission in terms of setting its budgetary priorities.
Nevertheless, once again we have the preliminary draft budget a few days before MrÂ Jensen presents his report on the annual strategic priorities in plenary.
In any event, we are getting quicker and possibly, before this term in office comes to an end, we will manage to hold this debate on the annual strategic priorities at the same time that the Commission is drawing up its preliminary draft budget.
Furthermore, I would like to say that we fully support the rapporteur, MrÂ Elles, both now and during the complicated times ahead when we really have to squeeze the financial perspective that we have approved as far as possible â this very backward looking financial perspective, as the rapporteur himself has said, and I agree with him â because much remains to be seen.


The Council must demonstrate that it believes in its own commitments: firstly, it should be attending this debate â though I see that it has not had time to remain; secondly, the Commission must be capable of convincing a very wary Parliament that it is going to be able to maintain an acceptable level of spending in order to maintain and fund the Communityâs programmes; and thirdly, it is also going to be necessary for Parliament to be very vigilant in terms of the quality of spending and the Councilâs attitude to the size of the budget.
Let us hope that this budget, in relation to which the rapporteur proposes some very interesting things and which is the first of the seven budgets of this financial perspective, is modified and that some progress can be made on issues of budgetary procedure, for example, at the first conciliation and, in particular, Mr President, on the prioritisation of Community programmes by parliamentary committees.
There are fewer resources and each committee is therefore going to have to face its own responsibilities.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Elles for the Annual Policy Strategy report.
I would like to highlight three areas.
Speaking as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, firstly, I would like to say that I support the rapporteur in urging the Commission and Member States to focus on areas that are the bases of healthy and thriving modern economies: research and development, innovation, knowledge, skills, telecommunications and energy.
Effective investment in those areas pays excellent dividends in the long run.
The EU cannot be short-sighted and still compete globally and reverse the brain-drain leading to slower economic growth than might otherwise be the case.
Secondly, I also back the rapporteur when he calls for Member States to implement existing and proposed legislation to help complete the single market.
The Lisbon Strategy has not been sufficiently prioritised, despite the fact that it seeks improvement in areas where citizens want progress, like creating growth in jobs.
As President Barroso told this House in his first address in July 2004, we must show our citizens that Europe can deliver what it promises.
Thirdly, speaking as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I have to say that I disagree with the emphasis the rapporteur has placed on our strategic partnership with the United States.
I believe the EU must build solid and constructive relations with all global players to an equal extent, especially since a very disappointing cut in funding in Heading 4 has been proposed by the Commissioner in the PDB.
That means that our traditional priorities and commitments are being reduced.
As well as that, there will be no extra money for new agreements that we have entered into, including an increasingly important strategic partnership with India.
Since resources are scarce, I ask the Commission to make sure that no money is wasted.
So can the Commission guarantee that the appropriate measures and mechanisms are being put in place, as Mr Virrankoski highlighted, to ensure effective implementation and full take-up?
We do not want to return millions of euros to the Member States at the end of the year.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to thank our rapporteur, MrÂ Elles, for his visionary proposal regarding the work on the 2007 budget.
It is visionary because he thinks several years ahead, because importance is attached to complying with the new framework for external policy and because focus is placed on that part of the budget designed to secure economic growth and strengthen the EUâs global competitiveness.
I would particularly draw attention to the new cost-benefit thinking in the budget whereby, year by year, we are to assess the value of the individual programmes in relation to their costs.
The information we gather in that way will, of course, form part of an evaluation and mid-term review of the multi-annual budgetary framework for 2008-2009.
Now is the time for us to prepare the ground for reconfiguring the budgetary framework so that its focus is on new needs and no longer on things that do not work properly.
Efficiency and a certain âquid pro quoâ must be the watchwords for the EU budget.
All of this work must take place in close cooperation with the specialist committees.
We shall thus be further developing the ever closer cooperation of recent years with the specialist committees in developing the annual budget.
In the foreign policy area we must now comply with the new sets of rules whereby Parliament is involved in developing strategic frameworks and thus obtains a basis for monitoring the policy conducted.
We shall thus be able to see whether we are achieving the goals laid down by means of the budget.
The method of working to be used in this connection must, of course, be developed, and it is important that the work get off to a good start.
The new budgetary framework means that there will be respectable growth in that part of the budget that goes on research, innovation, education and transport.
I should like, however, to emphasise that the appropriations for investment in transport are not at all in keeping with the Member Statesâ own ambitions for the trans-European networks.
The Commission has pulled out all the stops to ensure far better implementation of the projects, and now the Council must show that it intends to comply with its own decisions.
It is the Member States that are responsible for coming up with the funding if they do not wish to pay via the budget.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have considerable risks to contend with for the 2007 financial year: in terms of both the figures and the procedures for implementing the multi-annual programmes based on the Financial Regulation.
The new programmes have a potential that can only be properly harnessed by improving procedures.
It is important to everyone concerned, particularly programme users, that the legislative process relating to the Financial Regulation, its implementing regulation and the multi-annual programmes now be concluded as quickly as possible, to enable prompt handling by the Commissionerâs staff.
We are eagerly awaiting the transmission of the revised Commission proposal on the reform of the Financial Regulation.
When our draft was adopted, the Commission promised to incorporate a large number of our amendments.
At that time, in a roll-call vote resulting in a majority hardly ever achieved in this House, Parliament placed particular emphasis on important points.
Faster, leaner, more efficient â those were the points we made with regard to the procedures, to enable profitable, value-added investment of European funds.
It is also particularly important to us that Parliamentâs rights be guaranteed.
We shall examine the revised Commission draft, which is on our agenda for tomorrow, accordingly; but in order to carry out a thorough analysis we need to see the full picture â not just the outline, but also the shading.
Parliament needs to know what points the Commission and the Council want to see incorporated into the implementing regulations if we are to see the extent to which our opinion has been implemented â in both documents, that is.
I should like to assure the Commissioner that the best efforts from all our quarters will go into ensuring that the proposal is adopted promptly in this House.
I would ask the Commission to now present the complete works, comprising Financial Regulation and implementing regulation, as quickly as possible, to enable us to start the new programmes with the new procedures in time for the new programming period.
I would also appeal to the Council to maintain its constructive cooperation, so that Europe, and its citizens, Member States and institutions, are able to achieve better and, above all, cheaper administration.
Â Â  â Commissioner, MrÂ Elles, I too should like to congratulate you on your excellent proposal.
I was especially pleased to see reference made to transatlantic relations, a major priority that is often overlooked but that was happily highlighted by our rapporteur.
I feel, in any event, that the major issue here is that the proposal before us falls short of what was put forward last year and of the limit imposed on us by the financial perspective.
I believe that in the new framework about to get under way, we must not, under any circumstances, allow the practices of the past, whereby we did not use all of the financial framework, to prevail today.
I feel it is crucial that, given a financial framework that we all know is extremely limited in terms of European ambitions, we have to be able to use it to the full.
In this regard, I feel that the Commission has a key role to play, and should like to call on the Commission not to go back to submitting projects that fall short of the ceilings of the financial frameworks.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your words and your congratulations, MrÂ Deprez, but you should also offer your condolences to the rapporteur.
Â Â  Mr President, the new financial framework has only just been finalised today, and we are already faced with is deficiencies.
The Commission could not solve the impossible, and within this framework, the European Union will not be able to achieve a breakthrough in the areas of competitiveness, research or innovation, which had actually been marked as priorities by the Council and the Commission themselves.
The annual political strategy of the Commission does not promote an economic reform able to meet challenges.
It seems that the competition imposed on the world and Europe by the emerging Asian economies is ignored.
Acting together, Member States may be able to meet these global challenges, but if they are on their own, it is certain that they will lose out in the expected processes.
The 2007 budget will cause disappointment, because it should be strategic, but it is, in fact, straining within its narrow limits.
According to the indications, this budget will primarily please new Member States.
The three-year waiting period is over, and they will, at last, share development resources to the same extent as the others.
They can now start to develop vigorously if they outgrow their childhood illnesses and do not get stuck at the current 20-30% resource utilisation level.
Finally, I would like to thank MrÂ Elles, our rapporteur, for his critical and prudent work.
I hope that the position of Parliament will still be able to influence the final form of the budget.
Â Â  Mr President, 2007 will undoubtedly be a very challenging year for Europe and its citizens.
The enlargement of the Union by another two countries, the ongoing process of ratifying the Constitutional Treaty and, most of all, the start of implementation of the new financial perspective must be supported by effective implementation of European Union policies in such a way as to meet global challenges and the expectations of our citizens.
Setting out priorities for the coming year is, in view of all this, strategically important for each of the seven years covered by the new financial perspective.
That is why it is surprising and worrying that there are already visible discrepancies between the global challenges which the Community faces and the measures that are supposed to ensure an increase in the competitiveness of its economy.
Furthermore, when identifying the challenges, the European Commission seems to have failed to notice the dynamic changes occurring in the global economy, especially in the fastest developing markets such as the Chinese or Indian markets.
In terms of internal policy, and according to the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission should, at a Community level as well as at a national level, unequivocally support elements of a modern economy such as scientific research, innovation and information society technologies.
In the face of increasingly fierce global competition it is also vital to formulate a strategy that enables employers and workers to adapt to the changes taking place.
In this respect the Globalisation Fund being discussed today may be a first step in the right direction, and the EU budget revision scheduled for 2008 will be a real instrument for adapting multiannual financial plans to a rapidly developing world.
It is the only way of maintaining a strong political and economic position and of overcoming the internal crisis the European Union is currently experiencing.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking MrÂ Elles for his work.
The Annual Policy Strategy for the 2007 budget will be decisive in shaping the further positive development of Europe.
The support for the two internal policies â the Lisbon objectives and rural policy â seems to me to be particularly worth mentioning in this connection.
In view of demographic developments and globalisation, it makes perfect sense to pay greater attention to our reformed agricultural policy and our rural policy.
In this case, in particular, the Lisbon objectives can and must be used to solve current problems such as unemployment and economic stagnation.
The common agricultural policy, the EUâs only communitarised policy, has been constantly subjected to reform in recent decades compared with other policy fields.
Agricultural policy-makers and farmers have repeatedly proved their willingness to make sacrifices and accept change for the sake of a European community.
Players in European agriculture have demonstrated that they are amenable to reform.
It is now time to honour this.
Sustainable agriculture, our European model, needs planning security, and establishing the budget until 2013 â that is to say, for the next seven years â has given it just that.
It must also be beyond doubt, however, that, as decided in the course of CAP reform, the budgetary resources will apply until 2013 without cutbacks.
We have carried through the reforms, and now we farmers have reached our pain threshold.
This is as far as we will go.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, as we begin preparing the 2007 budget, I share the concern, expressed by MrÂ Elles in his report, about the gulf between, on the one hand, the ambitions that the European Union has set itself for the future and, on the other, the budgetary regime to which it has, this very morning, resigned itself for the next seven years.
Nonetheless, the indications are that, in 2007, the budgetary estimates should enable us to continue with our current policies, while at the same time launching the new generation of European programmes, relating in particular to regional policy.
The fact is that, alongside the new financial perspective, new programmes aimed at regional development will be implemented, and we are gradually going to have to familiarise ourselves with these.
We go on repeating that cohesion policy is essential to Europeâs overall dynamism.
It must enable the regions, diverse as they are, to complete their transformation and to prepare for the future in the best conditions and, in that way, to achieve an optimum level of development.
What is more, Europeâs regions occupy a central place in the Lisbon Strategy, and the new structural policy will always have to be in a position to strengthen economic and social cohesion and to reduce the gap between the levels of development of, on the one hand, the new Member States and, on the other, the old ones.
It is in order to achieve these objectives that it must be provided with the appropriate financial resources.
It is therefore important, as emphasised by MrÂ Elles in his report, to make sure throughout the budgetary procedure that the funds appropriated to this policy are commensurate with the challenges to be met.
In preparing the draft budget for 2007, we shall therefore make sure that these priorities are respected and that adequate resources are allocated to them.
Â Â  â Mr President, we wish to initiate the financing of new priorities.
However, the amount of the preliminary draft budget, with payment appropriations which do not exceed 0.99%, unfortunately reflects the glaring inconsistency between the challenges in the sector of research, innovation and competitiveness and the narrow margins allowed by the budget.
Nonetheless, development and employment must be our main objective, the main contribution to the achievement of which must be the Lisbon Strategy, with policies which need to act complementarily and be adapted to the new dynamic environment which is the consequence of globalisation and interdependent economies.
I agree with the Elles proposals on ensuring the qualitative value of every last euro, especially in view of the new nature of the challenges, which we have met so far calmly and without vision. I refer to the challenge of emerging economic behemoths, especially China and India.
However, the relaxed and 'flabby' stand being adopted by the Commission in the preliminary draft exacerbates our concerns about the reduction in the level of interventions.
The restrictive framework illustrates our inability to combine objectives and financing possibilities.
Unfortunately, Commissioner, 0.99% in payments for 2007 raises once again the tragedy of narrow margins for the realisation of our European vision.
I wonder if the next Presidency will, at long last, have the power to surmount and join us in our efforts to overcome this perpetual European financial Calvary.
I hope so, but I also doubt it.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to congratulate you on the fact that your country won the European Cup this evening, although, since Barcelona has a Dutch trainer, perhaps some of this credit could also go to my own.
I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report, because it is a hard-hitting document that gets its priorities right.
What is more important, though â and I am, this evening, primarily speaking as shadow rapporteur for the agricultural budget on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â is that this report is like a warm bath for European farmers and horticulturalists compared to what the British Labour Government gave them during its presidency.
I should like to congratulate MrÂ Elles on this.
As for agriculture and horticulture, it is all hands on deck, for the Councilâs easy way-out, allowing countries to transfer, on a voluntary basis, 20% of the premiums to rural development, could well prove to be a stab in the back for hard-working farmers and horticulturalists.
Not that I am opposed to rural policy, but given the voluntary nature of this proposal, there is the real risk that farmers from the different Member States will be faced with a playing field that is anything but level, which will have an effect on the single market.
Similarly, the possible voluntary transfer of 20% of the premiums will probably, due to the financial emergency brake applied during the interim review, represent yet another attack.
After all, pledges to candidate countries Romania and Bulgaria may eventually result in yet another 15% in reductions for agriculture and horticulture in the old Member States.
In that way, Europe is at risk of losing control over the common agricultural policy, for a 35% reduction in the level of premiums will consign the common market firmly to the history books.
As guardians of the common market, Parliament and the Commission will need to pull out all the stops in order to avoid this.
Moreover, I am also shocked at former CommissionerÂ Bolkesteinâs remarks, because as Commissioner for the Internal Market, he recently rejected once again the Prodi Commissionâs agricultural reforms and their funding, which he had originally approved, adding that agricultural policy should be abolished.
I urge the present Commissioner for the Budget to be wary of the common market and to prevent European agricultural funds and European agricultural policy from being eroded still further, for let us be honest: Europeâs export refunds have been pared down by 80%, 60% of agricultural export to developing countries is already being channelled to the EU, and we have an agreement with the worldâs 48 poorest countries.
I do not know another continent that has done more for liberalisation of agricultural policy than Europe, and we have done quite enough.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Constanze Angela Krehl, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on preparing for the assent procedure for the Communityâs strategic guidelines for the period 2007-2013 (Cohesion Policy in Support of Growth and Jobs) [2006/2086(INI)] (A6-0175/2006).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, with its adoption of the Financial Perspective today, the European Parliament has taken an important step towards enabling the structural programmes to begin in the regions of the EU as early as possible, in 2007.
We shall take a further important step tomorrow by adopting our proposals on the strategic guidelines for cohesion policy.
I should also like to take todayâs opportunity to make it clear once more that Parliament accelerated the procedure tremendously by dealing with these guidelines in parallel with the negotiations on the Financial Perspective and the regulations on the funds, and I should like to thank all my fellow Members who are present for this debate, too.
I apologise for the late hour, but it was the only chance of adopting this report before the end of the May session.
Doing it any other way would have meant further delays to the overall handling of cohesion policy.
The Commissionâs proposal is comprehensive.
Nevertheless, I have some important proposals to supplement and strengthen the policy approaches.
These are based on the fact that EU enlargement inÂ 2004 has exacerbated the disparities between the regions and on the fact that we have to use the scant resources available in a strategically intelligent and efficient manner.
That is why we must also make more intensive use of the opportunities for private cofinancing in the coming years.
What do I wish to emphasise in particular in my speech today?
Firstly, in my view, we must make it clear that cohesion policy should naturally support the Lisbon Strategy, but we must not forget sustainable development of the EU in accordance with the Gothenburg objectives in the process.
Secondly, as we know, 80% of the European population lives in cities or urban areas, which means that we have to place greater emphasis on this dimension of our strategy.
Thirdly, we must enhance the element of territorial cohesion in our planning: a demand also rightly made by the Committee of the Regions.
Within the Commissionâs three guidelines â making Europe and its regions more attractive for investors and labour, promoting knowledge and innovation for growth, and more and better jobs â we support the development of a durable transport infrastructure, including in border areas.
In this connection, we attach particular importance to the implementation of environmental priorities such as Natura 2000, the Water Framework Directive and the sustainable prevention of natural disasters.
We should like to draw attention to the particular prospects offered by the use of renewable energy and, with it, the development of new technologies in this field.
The development of research infrastructures and the utilisation of the research results for SMEs is an important concern in our strategy, as is access to modern information and communication networks.
All of these points are related to the development of an economy that creates more and, particularly, better jobs in the EU.
However, another very important prerequisite for jobs is that people living in the EU be as highly qualified as possible.
In this connection, the lifelong learning strategy is central to our report, and we support programme approaches for children and young people and for the training of workers, and the access of the elderly, too, to education.
I should like to make it clear that discrimination-free access to the EU cohesion policy must be guaranteed for the future in respect of all the priorities set out in the report, including, but not limited to, persons with disabilities.
We want to be able to further use and develop the positive experiences gained with the old Community initiative EQUAL in the next subsidy period.
Social partners, and also organisations, associations and regional players, must be involved much more actively in drawing up the programme at regional level.
Discussions with the Commission have revealed that a large number of our proposals can be incorporated into the Commissionâs final proposal.
This will enable us to take new strategic approaches to the work of the next seven years, which I warmly welcome.
I should like to thank my fellow Members from the political groups for their broad support, and it only remains for me to call on the Council to adopt the whole package on cohesion policy as soon as possible.
This way, we hope to reaffirm and reinforce the confidence of the European public in the solidarity of European policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, I very much welcome the draft report adopted by the European Parliamentâs Committee on Regional Development on the Commission communication on Cohesion Policy in Support of Growth and Jobs: Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-2013.
In particular, I should like thank Mrs Krehl for her hard work in drafting the report.
The draft Community strategic guidelines for cohesion reflect the two key principles of the European Unionâs future cohesion policy. These are the strengthening of the strategic dimension of regional and cohesion policy to ensure that Community priorities are better integrated into national and regional development programmes, and ensuring that there is greater ownership of the policy on the ground with a better partnership between the Commission, the Member States and the regions, including social partners.
With the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy, cohesion policy has become the primary financial instrument at Community level to ensure that its resources are used for the implementation of the growth and jobs strategy.
This is reflected in the priorities contained in the draft Community strategic guidelines for 2007-2013, which seek to provide a balance between the twin objectives of the growth and jobs agenda and territorial cohesion.
In line with the growth and jobs agenda, the guidelines call for the next generation of programmes to target resources on the following three priority fields.
Firstly: enhancing the attractiveness of Member States, regions and cities by improving accessibility, ensuring adequate quality and level of services, and preserving their environmental potential.
Secondly: encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of the knowledge economy through research and innovation capacities, including new information and communication technologies. Thirdly: creating more and better jobs by attracting more people into employment or entrepreneurial activity, improving the adaptability of workers and enterprises and increasing investment in human capital.
In sum, the guidelines provide a variety of priorities, with sufficient flexibility, which can be taken into account when designing investment strategies that differ across Europeâs regions.
On the other hand, the guidelines also focus on a limited number of priorities to ensure that a genuine concentration of resources takes place in order to increase the effectiveness of investment and to make the growth and jobs strategy a reality.
To conclude, the Council has come to a political agreement on the Structural Funds regulations for 2007-2013.
For the Commission, the next step is to draft the final version of the Community strategic guidelines for the Council to adopt.
The draft report adopted by the Committee on Regional Development will help to shape the final version of the guidelines, along with the comments submitted by the Member States and the results of a public consultation exercise held last year.
Â Â  Mr President, as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport, I was surprised to hear that this topic has been included in the agenda.
Perhaps the hectic and accelerated events and the debate on financial directives and funds have also contributed to the fact that we have not been informed earlier of the compromises arrived at by the Committee on Regional Development with regard to the excellent report of MrsÂ Krehl, compromises that will be submitted to vote in this House tomorrow.
I am the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport, which gives high priority to the cohesion of the extremely heterogenous European Union, and to the infrastructural and tourism developments, which constitute the instruments for achieving cohesion.
We admit that, due to the relatively strained Community resources, each investment must represent European added value, and must induce additional economic growth.
We are giving priority to road and primarily cross-border railway developments, because this is where business inertia and reticence are at their highest levels.
Apart from railways, we would also like to give priority to the development of inland navigation, because these are instruments that protect the environment and increase competitiveness at the same time.
We must give peripheral areas high priority, because the provision of access to such areas cannot be solved with a market-based approach, and regional development is a precondition of their competitiveness and of ensuring that the population does not move away; within the provision of access, we must also create bypasses and interconnecting roads.
When we are financing TEN-T, we must understand that we cannot only accept TEN-T centres in old Member States, and the cohesion fund cannot solve every problem, for instance those in the Baltic States.
Additionally, we, the Committee on Transport, have supported the development of complex urban transport systems, the integrated development of suburbs, and Community assistance for this type of rolling stock.
There is also a demand for the development of tourist areas, because this is what keeps people there, and we must keep tourism-generated revenue in Europe.
For this reason, in our opinion, we urged that Community assistance be granted to regional airports.
Let us not have any illusions: in new Member States, the involvement of private capital is not a magic remedy for market-based infrastructure development, especially in peripheral regions, because solvent demand is low, and the return on the investment is slow.
This is why I support the utilisation of structural funds in PPP constructions, too.
This may actually make investments efficient.
I congratulate the draftsman of the report, I would like to thank you for your attention, and congratulations on the Barcelona victory, Mr President!
Â Â  . Mr President, the signing of the interinstitutional agreement today allows the legislative work related to the implementation of cohesion policy in the 2007-2013 period to continue.
In accordance with the mandatory procedures, the European Commission will present the strategic framework after the package of regulations related to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund has been adopted.
The European Parliament should expect the European Commission to identify priorities and courses of action in such a way as to maintain the essence of European cohesion policy while creating the conditions for implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
The strategic guidelines should, as the rapporteur rightly points out, flesh out the framework described in the regulation rather than replacing or changing it.
We are aware that the strategic guidelines will be the basis for the final versions of the National Strategic Reference Frameworks drawn up by the Member States.
That is why it is necessary to formulate them in such a way as to avoid problems with their interpretation.
In view of this I would also like to point out a few elements in particular which should feature in the Strategic Reference Frameworks.
The challenges related to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy mean that the urban dimension of cohesion policy is gaining particular significance.
It should become one of the main elements of the strategic guidelines.
It will only be possible to achieve the aims of the strategic guidelines once there is better transport access, and that is why building transport networks, especially the transeuropean networks, is one of the basic tasks at hand.
It will not be possible to reach the goals of the Lisbon Strategy if we do not create the conditions for implementing research and innovative development as well as support for the Seventh Framework Programme, which means that cohesion policy should create the right conditions for research and development.
The strategic guidelines must be clear and easy to read and understand.
That is something which the European Parliament has a right to expect.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is appropriate to have a joint debate on how to derive real and measurable benefit from EU regional policy programmes.
Channelling the EUâs regional policy funds into projects which help improve development in more disadvantaged regions, as well as economic growth and competitiveness throughout the EU, is the background to the guidelines to be drawn up.
I wish in particular to thank the rapporteur for addressing this challenge and making a vibrant addition to the strategy document on Parliamentâs behalf.
It is quite right to be unbending when it comes to certain important principles.
For that reason I am in favour of clawing back funds that have already been paid to the regions and Member States, if necessary, unless important key principles relating to European Union policy, such as sustainable development, equality, non-discrimination and the implementation of environmental legislation have been taken into account satisfactorily in the programmes.
On the whole, it is important to concentrate the dwindling funds that are available in such a way that the outcome is use of aid that is as effective as possible and achievement of European added value.
An important aspect of this is the channelling of aid, for example, to sustainably renewable energy sources.
Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of another matter.
How might we administer regional projects by reducing bureaucracy, all the while ensuring that there is adequate financial control and supervision?
Many projects unfortunately do not get implemented because the bureaucracy is more expensive than implementing the project itself.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, to begin with, to quote one of the phrases contained in the excellent report by our fellow Member, MrsÂ Krehl: âThe European Parliament is confident that the Commission and the Council will take on board the suggestions of the European Parliament; this is necessary if it is to give its assent to the strategic guidelines.â
You have listened carefully, Commissioner, as I too listened carefully to you just now when you gave your introductory address. Although you mentioned the regions several times, the word âcityâ appeared only once in your speech.
That is why, three weeks ago at the plenary of the Committee of the Regions, MrÂ HaÃŒpel, mayor of Vienna, replied âThat is unfortunately to be fearedâ to a journalist who had asked the following question: âThe urban dimension has been integrated into the objectives in terms of convergence and competitiveness.
Do you fear that, unless something more specific is stated, it will fall by the wayside?â
That is why the Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion are of crucial importance.
Personally, I recommend adding a fourth priority to the Communityâs strategic guidelines. This would be focused on cities and conurbations and on the role played by these.
I am anxious to point out that by âcitiesâ our Committee on Regional Development means not only cities or urban areas but also, as MrsÂ Krehlâs report emphasises several times, any territory that includes a city centre, outlying urban areas and all the rural areas that depend on the city, as the city depends on them.
All these territories indisputably constitute not only the places where 80% of our populations are concentrated but also places essential to the development of our Europe through the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
MrsÂ Krehlâs report accords an important place to cities.
The objective of my speech at this time is to point out, while regretting that the Presidency-in-Office is not represented, that the members of our committee or intergroup have on several occasions urged the Council to put pressure on the Member States with a view to their all taking account of the urban dimension on the grounds that it will not be possible to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives if the urban sectors do not play their full role within the framework of the cohesion policy.
While regretting that the Council is not present, we anticipate your total commitment in this regard. The cohesion policy needs to be able fully to bear fruit as a result of the urban sectors participating fully in it.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am obliged to MrsÂ Krehl for her constructive cooperation.
It has proved possible to orient the guidelines towards the principle of sustainable development.
I wish to emphasise this point in particular, because the Commission has now moved away from according due importance to this.
Earmarking, which has now been integrated into the general regulation through the back door as a competitor to the guidelines, causes problems in that it destroys the comprehensive approach of the guidelines, which is both horizontal and vertical at the same time.
Separating the Lisbon Strategy from the Gothenburg Strategy means that industrial regions and cities are the winners and rural areas the losers.
I do not want to compete with the previous speaker, MrÂ Beaupuy, in saying that, as he is talking about the problem regions in the cities, in particular, but this separation calls into question cohesion in many regions â with disastrous consequences.
I shall simply give the example of the country the Commissioner knows best.
Following the earmarking, Riga and the surrounding area will obtain all the money, but the Latvian region fundamentally in need of support is Latgale, the poorest region in the EU at the moment.
This will receive only the remainder of the subsidies, which cannot be right.
In my view, these problems of the Commissionâs own making can only be solved retrospectively if, in the operational programmes, the Commission ensures that, in all dimensions and for all areas â both urban and rural â sustainable development receives equal attention in the economic, social and environmental approach, that is to say, in a balanced development approach.
Whilst the Commissionâs attention is insufficiently focused on this, there can be no real cohesion in Europe.
I want first of all to thank Mrs Krehl for her report and for the open and inclusive way in which it was produced.
There are some elements I disagree with, but the report goes some way towards bringing a measure of social and environmental balance into the strategic guidelines.
It is important for the European Parliament to argue strongly for a more balanced set of guidelines and explicitly to reject earmarking and the thinking behind that approach, which would only compound the imbalances inherent now in Lisbon and in the present Commission guidelines.
The championing of Lisbon over Gothenburg and of some elements of Lisbon over others in the Commissionâs original guidelines is worrying.
We must direct the guidelines in a way that reflects the principal function of cohesion policy and the holistic development of Europeâs regions, not just business growth.
I particularly welcome paragraph 9 of Mrs Krehlâs report, with its demand that sound partnership between all parties be enshrined in the regulations and guidelines and its support for the strengthening of civil society.
I was particularly glad to hear Commissioner Piebalgs recognise that here this evening.
Thanks once again and congratulations to Mrs Krehl on her report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by saying a word of thanks to MrsÂ Krehl for her sound report and excellent cooperation on this issue.
The economic disparities between the regions of the EU will only increase in the coming programming period â particularly as a result of the forthcoming enlargements â with no increase in Structural Fund appropriations â if we did not know that before today, we do now.
In the light of this, it is now necessary to use the scant resources available in an intelligent and efficient manner, always bearing in mind that cohesion policy cannot solve all the structural problems or be a substitute for the efforts of the Member States.
I endorse the critical appraisal of earmarking, for example, which puts us in fetters.
There is a danger that the regions will not have the flexibility they need in developing the programmes to meet their local and regional requirements.
I should like to emphasise the particular consideration for the urban dimension, of which the Commissionâs proposal takes insufficient account.
Owing to their economic and social disparities, conurbations are in particular need of increased assistance.
The use of private cofinancing to aid the implementation of all the programmes is very important.
This needs to be emphasised time and again, particularly at a time when public funds are scarce â and this opinion is in fact shared by the majority of all the members of our Committee.
It is essential to promote private cofinancing at project level.
Public-private partnerships are, unfortunately, too little used in connection with the Structural Funds, since they raise a host of legal questions that have to be resolved.
A welcome development is that the negotiations on the Financial Perspective succeeded in largely harmonising the different standards within the framework of cohesion policy for the old and new Member States.
Â Â  This report is enormously important because it deals with the idea of growth reaching all of our corners of Europe.
I support MrsÂ Krehlâs report and would like to thank her for a truly excellent job and for her constructive cooperation.
I wish to raise a couple of matters and particularly to emphasise the significance of the social economy and the development of the infrastructure for IT.
I also wish to emphasise the development of the infrastructure for IT.
The social economy as a model for sustainable development, with its capacity to reconcile the economic and social fabric in the regions by coupling the spirit of entrepreneurship with social purposes, combating passive dependency on social welfare systems, needs to be recognised and taken into account in social and territorial cohesion policies and frameworks at European, national and local level.
The reason is that a social economy brings entrepreneurship and creates job opportunities at local and regional level.
A social economy targets socially excluded goups, for example the long-term unemployed.
A social economy means innovative entrepreneurship for minority groups and it increases empowerment and strengthens civil society.
I also wish to emphasise the importance of the development of the infrastructure for IT.
IT and its infrastructure have exactly the same importance today as roads and railways have long had and continue to have for growth in Europe.
If new companies are to be able to work in all the regions, there must be IT and infrastructure in place to make it possible for them to work effectively.
It must not be allowed to be the case that it is not possible to work out in the regions because of an underdeveloped IT infrastructure.
I therefore think it good that this is emphasised in the Commissionâs document and in MrsÂ Krehlâs report.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the issue of rules for the structural funds, there is no time to lose.
The process of implementing common rules for these funds is an arduous one, and those of us from the new Member States still have fresh memories of what happened in 2004 when we had to deal with months of delays, time that has been difficult to make up.
I would therefore call for an agreement on the directives on the structural funds to be concluded at the earliest opportunity.
I feel it would be unfortunate if the agreement were to run aground or be postponed as a result of Parliament insisting on certain requirements right up until the last moment, cost what it may.
An agreement needs to be reached as quickly as possible so that adequate time is set aside for operational programmes to be drawn up at national level.
The last bone of contention between the Council and Parliament is the issue of the Community reserve.
I should like to point out that the Council has agreed that some Member States, including the Czech Republic, will have their structural fund allocations adjusted in 2010 as a result of updated economic growth estimates.
It would therefore only be fair to address the issue of the reserve from this point of view, because economic growth in some countries has evidently been underestimated.
The report before us is, to my mind, a well-balanced text that will contribute towards an agreement with the Council.
I agree with the criticism that has been levelled at the earmarking of resources for the aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
As things stand, and given that the Commission in particular is insisting on the principle of earmarking, I at least welcome the fact that this is not intended to affect the new Member States, which will have to invest mainly in infrastructure and in combating unemployment, in light of the backwardness of many of their regions.
I also feel it important to point out that the urban dimension has not been catered for sufficiently.
Cities face a range of problems.
That being said, I welcome the fact that the Commission is in favour of lifting the current ban on using money from the fund for housing.
In the new Member States especially, there are many neglected, run-down high-rise estates, the renovation of which is taking a great deal of time on account of the lack of public resources.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for this report and would recommend its adoption.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent and detailed work and by thanking her for her willingness to meet and hold intensive dialogue with national representatives of differing levels of responsibility with regard to structural and cohesion policies.
Thank you, MrsÂ Krehl.
Today, following the approval of the multi-annual budget for the European Unionâs challenges for 2007-2013, which come at a time of some stagnation and confusion following the effort of enlargement, these guidelines make more sense than ever, since they represent an effort to focus the scant financial resources effectively and intelligently, in order to achieve the maximum added value, as the rapporteur herself has said.
We are therefore doubly grateful for MrsÂ Krehlâs great sensitivity towards the diversity of the different needs of the regions and the flexibility of their solutions, with particular attention for regions â from mountain regions to the outermost regions â suffering structural disadvantages, such as depopulation, ageing or difficult access.
We are also grateful for her insistence on actively promoting equal opportunities between men and women as a transversal condition.
There can never be too much of that.
Furthermore, we welcome the innovative and modern restoration of the Delors growth and investment approach, with the call for sustainable transport infrastructures â railways, collective transport and maritime transport â their accessibility and the optimisation of traffic management and road safety and, above all, the need to complete the trans-European networks, particularly where there has not been sufficient development at the borders between States, as in the case of the Pyrenees in my country.
We also accept its call for the sustainable use of natural resources, particularly water, and the development of sustainable energy sources combined with savings and efficiency.
I would like to highlight MrsÂ Krehlâs ability to understand the requirements of the specific relationships between cities and their surrounding areas, taking the approach of an integrated economic area, which in my city, Zaragoza, we call 'the fourth space'.
I would also like to stress MrsÂ Krehl's argument that we need to reduce the technological gap between regions and Member States, through the enhancement of technological cooperation networks, and her particular sensitivity towards promoting the development of SMEs and innovation potential, in terms of R+D.
I would finally like to thank her for all of her efforts aimed at improving employment and the integration of immigrants, and also her view that the situation of workers must not be worsened under any circumstances.
Â Â  MrÂ President, like all my fellow Members who spoke before me, I would pay tribute to the quality of the work done by MrsÂ Krehl, and I should like to join with her in emphasising the major importance of the objective of territorial cohesion, which I think is crucial to the future of our European Union.
In my view, this is not made clear enough in the Commissionâs proposal.
What is more, the earmarking of appropriations under the Lisbon Strategy, which has been introduced surreptitiously by means of an annex to the Structural Funds General Regulation, is in danger of further exacerbating inter-regional or sub-regional disparities which, I believe, have in no small measure contributed to the constitutional deadlock in which we at present find ourselves.
That would, moreover, particularly be the case in countries and regions in which a premium is placed on the objectives of competitiveness and employment.
Indeed, the obstacles to development vary, and are different, according to the geographical situation of the regions.
In particular, I should like to emphasise that accessibility remains an indispensable prior condition of the more or less peripheral or isolated regions becoming competitive and, therefore, of their perhaps subscribing to the Lisbon Strategy.
Earmarking, under the terms of the annex I mentioned, would, if applied rigidly, hamper these regions by preventing them, in particular, from funding vital transport infrastructure.
What is more, we are talking here about highly technocratic arrangements which, I believe, would make the EUâs regional policy still less transparent and still more incomprehensible to our fellow citizens.
Is that really what we want?
Obviously not.
That is why, Commissioner, it is important for it to be clearly confirmed to us that there will be acceptance of the necessary flexibility, both in the National Strategic Reference Frameworks and in the regional operational programmes.
Having discussed the matter a little with MrsÂ HÃŒbner, I got the impression that she was alert to this issue, but, really, I should like the Commission to take due account of it.
Â Â  Mr President, following enlargement, up to 46% more citizens are living in convergence objective regions, while available resources have not increased proportionately.
This trend is about to strengthen with the forthcoming accessions of Romania and Bulgaria.
It is therefore obvious that the question as to how to spend these resources in the most efficient way is of the utmost importance.
The new Member States, which are the main beneficiaries of cohesion policy, have specific socio-economic needs that need to be appropriately taken into account.
Therefore, I warmly welcome this document and the work of our rapporteur, Mrs Krehl, who committed herself to ensuring that the available resources will be used in an intelligent, efficient and concentrated manner.
I particularly welcome the rapporteurâs recommendations on links between the cohesion policy and the Lisbon Strategy, as they will bring sustainable economic growth and lasting, quality employment.
I also welcome the links between the partnership principle and the territorial dimension, as well as the emphasis on more environmentally sustainable transport, national resources management, equal opportunities, lifelong learning and urban development.
It is paramount that we ensure that all Member States will be able to adopt their national strategy frameworks in time, so that programmes can start as soon as 1Â January 2007.
What is at stake here is the Unionâs objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion.
Despite the legitimate disappointment on the level of available resources for cohesion policy, it will be possible with appropriate rules for spending and programme implementation to achieve a great deal of improvement with regard to helping those regions which are lagging behind to catch up in socio-economic terms.
Finally, I would like to add that I am optimistic and am quite sure that this report will attract broad support during the vote tomorrow.
Â Â  â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate MrsÂ Krehl on her outstanding report, which expresses Parliamentâs concerns regarding the definition of Community strategic guidelines that should govern the application of the economic and social cohesion policy for 2007-2013.
I wish to say a few words on one issue that particularly concerns me, namely the risk that we run of subordinating cohesion policy to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
The risk is a real one and should not be overlooked. Otherwise we may to some degree warp the concept of solidarity and of balanced, harmonious development of the territory â concepts that lie at the heart of cohesion policy.
If the predominant factor of the Lisbon Strategy is competitiveness, we run the risk of channelling structural funds as a matter of priority to the least favoured regions with the greatest potential for development, to the detriment of regions with less development potential.
This is particularly true of the nine new Member States, whose territory is made up entirely of convergence objective regions.
I therefore call for the necessary balance between competitiveness and solidarity.
Â Â  . I should like to thank the rapporteur again for an excellent report.
The Commissionâs final version of the Communityâs strategic guidelines for cohesion will be clear and transparent.
I assure you that the report and todayâs debate will provide valuable input in shaping the strategic guidelines for cohesion.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
- A6-0152/2006 by Mr Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on natural disasters (fires, droughts and floods) â agricultural aspects (2005/2195(INI));
- A6-0147/2006 by Mr Gerardo Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on natural disasters (fires, droughts and floods) â regional development aspects (2005/2193(INI));
- A6-0149/2006 by Mrs Edite Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on natural disasters (fires, droughts and floods) â environmental aspects (2005/2192(INI)) and
- A6-0123/2006 by Mr Rolf Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (COM(2005)0108 â C6-0093/2005 â 2005/0033(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the Committees on Regional Development, the Environment and Agriculture and the respective rapporteurs, Mr Galeote Quecedo, MrÂ Berend, Mr Capoualas Santos and MrsÂ Estrela, for their hard and constructive work.
Recent trends seem to indicate a growing vulnerability of the European Union to disasters, and natural disasters in particular.
The incidence of extreme weather events and related natural disasters is increasing, perhaps fuelled by the effects of climate changes.
This year again, floods have raged in central and eastern Europe with four countries â Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria â requesting assistance through the Community mechanism for civil protection.
I am proud to say that European solidarity and generosity has once again mitigated the affliction those countries had to suffer.
The four reports rightly point out the human, environmental and financial costs of such disasters.
The Commission therefore very much welcomes the European Parliamentâs initiative to examine the various aspects involved, with a joint effort by no less than three parliamentary committees.
The jointly organised hearing earlier this spring has certainly made a valuable contribution to this process.
The reports rightly consider a whole range of measures aimed at improving risk prevention and the response to crises.
The Commission agrees with the recommendations regarding the need to adjust action in the area of prevention and management of natural disasters, as well as the need to coordinate Community instruments.
In fact, the reports reinforce the Commissionâs integrated approach to its policy on disasters, which includes instruments regarding prevention, immediate response and more longer-term, solidarity-based action.
This approach is intended to strengthen the EUâs capacity and effectiveness in preparing for and responding to major disasters, while avoiding duplication of effort.
Some of the proposals contained in the reports have already been endorsed through the Commissionâs action.
We are now proposing even more concrete ways to act.
Our recast of the Council Decision establishing the Community mechanism for civil protection is the legal embodiment of a number of proposals put forward in these reports.
These proposals are consistent with the Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument.
The recent Barnier report also explores certain forward-looking suggestions for our response to disasters.
The Commission also welcomes the progress on the negotiations for the proposed floods directive on the assessment and management of floods and the positive vote in the recent ENVI Committee meeting.
The Commission would equally welcome strong support from this House for a directive that gives all citizens a right to the same approach and level of ambition for flood risk protection, prevention and preparedness, regardless of where they live in the Community: in transboundary or national river basins, or in the coastal areas of the Community.
Not only are floods on the increase with changes to our climate, but droughts have become more prevalent in Europe.
At the request of a number of Member States, the Commission is analysing the issues of water scarcity and droughts.
Options are under consideration and we expect that a Commission staff paper will be available shortly.
Another relevant instrument for the future could be Life+, the new financial instrument for the environment.
It aims, , to support the efforts of Member States in the field of forest fire prevention, mainly through the implementation of knowledge-related measures such as training and awareness-raising campaigns.
Equally, the Commission is prepared to cofinance prevention measures under the cohesion and rural development policies.
Member States are invited to include appropriate actions in their programmes for the forthcoming period, where prevention will be one of the priorities.
Under the rural development pillar, Member States can also implement specific measures to restore the potential of forestry or agricultural production.
Under the rural development programmes, they can also request that a âsevere natural disasterâ be recognised as , in order to derogate from certain conditions under the âagri-environmentâ measures.
Those possibilities continue in the new programming period from 2007 to 2013.
We must not forget, though, that natural disasters are not the only threat the Union is faced with.
It must be prepared for and able to respond effectively to challenges.
Major man-made disasters, major threats to public health and acts of terrorism might require just as much of a common European response.
For the Commission, it is sometimes difficult to explain why the Union should be absent in some circumstances.
The lack of a concrete expression of Union solidarity has already been a source of embarrassment to the Union during some of the traumatic events of recent years.
The Commission is therefore particularly grateful for the widespread support expressed in Mr Berendâs report for extending the EU Solidarity Fund to non-natural disasters and for enlarging the scope of eligible operations accordingly.
The Solidarity Fund created in 2002 has generally worked quite successfully, if judged against the objectives and conditions set out in its legal basis.
Aid has been granted in 21 cases, concerning 15 Member States and candidate countries.
Those who criticise the Solidarity Fund as being ineffective or too slow have a point.
However, experience since 2002 has also led the Commission to the view that the existing fund has a number of shortcomings and that modifications to the current regulation are necessary.
That is why we have proposed a new Solidarity Fund Regulation.
The new proposal is based on the current Solidarity Fund, while introducing a number of modifications aimed at widening its scope, making the fund more transparent, and introducing a number of operational improvements, in particular the possibility of making advance payments so that the fund reacts more quickly and effectively.
The Commission nevertheless considers that the fund must remain limited to public emergency intervention.
Insured or private damage, including agricultural damage, should not be compensated.
The âpolluter paysâ principle and third party liability must continue to apply.
As with the current fund, the new proposal is based on the subsidiarity principle.
The EU should intervene only when a state is considered to be no longer in a position to tackle a disaster alone.
Consequently, there should be a relatively high threshold for European intervention.
Today this threshold is defined in terms of direct damage, which must exceed EURÂ 3Â billion, or 0.6% of GNI.
With the new proposal, the Commission has therefore sought to improve the transparency and simplicity of the criteria governing the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund.
That would help the national authorities to have a clearer idea of when the fund is likely to be able to support them in recovering from a disaster.
Alongside the enlarged scope, a major element of the proposal is therefore a new definition of the criteria for triggering the fund.
The operationally complicated regional criteria would be abolished in favour of only quantitative criteria.
In compensation for the loss of the regional criteria, the quantitative threshold would be reset at EURÂ 1 billion, or 0.5% of GNI, whichever is the lower.
This would increase the predictability of the European Unionâs Solidarity Fund decisions, thus reducing the workload in the Member States in preparing applications for support that have little or no chance of success.
Solely in the case of truly unexpected and exceptional situations, such as those where physical damage is limited, for instance terrorist attacks or major public health crises, the new fund could be mobilised by a political decision of the Commission, to be confirmed by the European Parliament and the Council.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by expressing my gratitude for the positive contributions of many Members from the various political groups, and the helpful support of members of the Committee on Agriculture who worked with me on this report.
The huge scale of some disasters in recent years, and last year in particular, has led Parliament to give due consideration to this issue.
Three committees have been set up to provide solutions, from their particular perspective, for preventing disasters or for offsetting the impact thereof when it is not possible to prevent them.
I have worked on this report for some six or seven months and, having spent that time listening to many MEPs, specialists, economic agents, local, regional and national authorities and the communities affected, I found the experience highly rewarding.
I was also able to go to the six worst affected Member States last year, namely Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, France and Italy.
I was delighted with the welcome accorded to us everywhere we went and I have no doubt that in bringing Parliament closer to the citizens, we performed useful work for our institution.
I also worked hard to establish as broad a consensus as possible on the proposals that I shall present to you.
I was able, in fact, to accept all the amendments that were tabled â 53 out of 60 â and the few exceptions were for formal reasons of redundancy or duplication and not because of their content.
The report before us is based on three main ideas.
Firstly, agriculture and forestry are activities that are closely bound up with the natural world and are therefore at the mercy of climatic phenomena, and exposed to bio-sanitary risks resulting from air, water and ground pollution and from increasing globalisation.
Secondly, the exodus from the countryside is one of the main causes of the increase in forest fires in southern Europe, especially acute during times of drought, as the year 2005 sadly proved.
The EUâs budgetary limits must, however, be respected.
The proposals therefore submitted fall within the financial perspective that we adopted yesterday.
The main thrust of my proposal is therefore to optimise the existing political instruments, for example the Solidarity Fund, the European Agriculture and Rural Development Funds, the Veterinary Fund, regional policy instruments, the future Life+ Regulation, by improving them and adapting them within the context of genuine disaster and risk management systems.
In the case of the latter, this will be done by communitarising a system of insurance and reinsurance to be cofinanced by the farmers, the Member States and the EU via the EAFRD.
The Solidarity Fund will need to be broader in scope and more flexible, to cover disasters that unfold over time, such as drought, which is currently not included.
In order to make it more effective, a flexibility clause should be attached to it to ensure the provision of adequate financial resources when they are needed, from common agricultural policy headings that currently go unused.
The funding priority of EAFRD, on the other hand, should be actions aimed at the forestation and reforestation of burnt areas, along with all possible prevention measures, such as upkeep of forests, the use of biomass to produce energy, the training of economic agents involved and the supply of information to them, and awareness raising on such problems, all made possible with greater cofinancing from national rural development programmes.
This is just a brief summary of a few points, which illustrate the importance of Parliament addressing the agricultural aspect of such disasters, and I hope that Parliament will lend its fullest possible support.
I hope that the Commission and the Council will give due attention to these proposals, taking account of the urgent nature of the circumstances.
Â Â  . â Mr President, over the last eight months we have visited the areas affected by natural disasters in many of the Member States and we have held a public hearing at which some of the people who have not had the opportunity to speak in their own national Parliaments have been able to speak.
Today we are presenting concrete proposals, which the other institutions cannot allow to be thrown into the litter bin.
Some Members could legitimately be pleased with the work done in this area.
It is more than the public administrations directly responsible in some of the Member States have done.
Nevertheless, I believe that we should ask ourselves whether we are more prepared now than we were eight months ago to prevent and combat this kind of disaster and whether we now have more effective mechanisms for helping those suffering the consequences of fire, water or drought.
I am not sure.
In any event, I would like to thank all of the parliamentary groups for their commitment and dedication over these months of intensive work.
I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for taking an interest in who was going to attend the hearing, although I must admit that I would have preferred him to show his support by immediately visiting the areas affected, avoiding the bureaucratic procedures that delayed us for four months and resulting in us missing the opportunity to demonstrate the solidarity of all of us â I am sure â with the victims straightaway.
I would like in particular to thank Parliamentâs services for the professionalism they have shown.
They were subject to all kinds of pressures before, during and after the visits made.
I am delighted that we have been able to vote on these reports at the same time as the reform of the European Unionâs Solidarity Fund, because we have noted general dissatisfaction with the application of this Community instrument in each and every place we have visited, MrÂ Piebalgs.
I believe it to be essential that the Council accept Parliamentâs amendments, in particular those that demand, on the one hand, that the Fund assist all of the victims and their families, and on the other, that the Fundâs limits of applicability be reduced and that this Fund can be applied when certain areas are completely destroyed, as in the case of Riba de Saelices, which we have visited.
Ladies and gentlemen, on these visits we have seen the deficiencies in the information campaigns aimed at prevention and the lack of coordination amongst the competent public administrations in the Member States, including, as we have seen, in Pampillosa da Serra, for example.
We have also seen the dissatisfaction of the population in broad sectors of society, in NGOs and amongst representatives of civil society.
I therefore hope that the proposals contained in the reports being submitted for Parliamentâs consideration today receive wide support and send a clear signal to the governments of the Member States.
I would like quickly to summarise what we are asking for by means of ten points.
First: a European strategy to combat natural disasters; secondly: the involvement of regions and local bodies; thirdly: flexibility in the redistribution of the funds available; fourthly: a Community forest-fire protection programme; fifthly: a specific proposal, MrÂ Piebalgs, for a directive for fire prevention and management in the European Union; sixthly: that the Seventh Framework Research Programme, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and the Galileo system be applied in order to assist in prevention and early warning; seventhly: information and educational programmes and campaigns agreed with the Member States; eighthly: a Community civil protection mechanism; ninthly: that additional financial instruments also be applied, such as EIB loans or State aid for regional purposes; and tenthly: that the European Parliament continue to carry out its duty of control with regard to the shortcomings in the fight against fire and all of the problems relating to it.
For all of these reasons, I would call upon everybody to put aside the party-political differences that may have divided us so that we can create a broad parliamentary consensus, which is what the European citizens are demanding of us and which we owe in particular to those who have suffered the consequences of these natural disasters: their victims.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have mentioned the methodology used to draw up these three reports.
I refer in particular to the visits that we made to the six countries affected by natural disasters and the public hearing that took place in Brussels.
In our own countries too â at least this was the case in Portugal â we held public hearings to gather suggestions, information and proposals put forward by the various stakeholders.
I should also like to thank the Members for their backing, their suggestions and their amendments, and the experts who helped improve my report.
The climate is changing.
The year is no longer divided into the traditional four seasons.
Days of unbroken drought alternate with days of torrential rain and with heat waves.
Climate change lies at the root of the natural disasters â be they floods, extreme droughts or fires â that have been occurring with increasing frequency throughout the world and have caused terrible damage in terms of human loss, environmental deterioration and reduced economic activity.
This is one of the major problems of our times.
2005 began with the world in shock at the scale of the tragedy caused by the Asian tsunami.
The process of identifying the dead and looking for survivors went on for a number of months.
In the summer of that year, a series of fires destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest in Portugal, France and Spain, and violent floods spread devastation and death in countries such as Germany and Austria.
Outside Europe, Hurricane Katrina wreaked unprecedented destruction in a number of North American States, and before the year was out, Afghanistan was hit by a violent earthquake.
In addition to earthquakes, seaquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods and fires, there are other phenomena associated with climate change and global warming that cause sea levels in coastal areas to rise and beaches to disappear.
Studies published in magazine reveal that sea levels could rise six metres by 2100, given that the ice of the Arctic and Antarctic is melting increasingly quickly.
In order to prevent the worst case scenario, serious measures must immediately be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to honour the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol.
Commissioner, you referred to the water shortage.
Indeed, water must also be used more sustainably, more sensibly and more efficiently.
More than 1Â billion people fight for survival every day because they do not have drinking water, 400Â million of whom are children.
Water-related diseases kill a child every 15 seconds and are linked to many other diseases and malnutrition.
The distribution of resources between the different domestic, industrial and agricultural users needs to be studied and debated, and waste must be combated.
It is crucial to encourage the citizens to help prevent these disasters, by reducing greenhouse emissions, as I have said before, by protecting the forests and by not building in high-risk areas.
Natural disasters cut across borders and their environmental consequences also affect neighbouring countries.
Given that Community action should complement that of the national authorities, in terms of prevention, planning and intervention, rehabilitation and follow-up, it is essential to step up coordination at all levels, to improve the existing mechanisms and to develop early warning systems.
Although each region has its own characteristics and each case is different, there are common needs to be addressed, such as defining risk assessment mechanisms and drawing up maps of areas of drought, forest fires and floods.
My report contains a number of other proposals, which I naturally hope will be endorsed, first and foremost, by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, examples of which include the definition of prevention systems to facilitate the fight against the causes of natural disasters; improved urban planning, especially in coastal areas and high-risk areas; the preservation of natural ecosystems; increased cooperation on civil protection between the Member States and at EU level in order to ensure the availability of additional resources for rapid action to address emergency situations; and the simplification of the rules on implementing the instruments, such as the Solidarity Fund and the Forest Focus Programme.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the ever more frequent occurrence of natural disasters â for example the many forest fires and floods, not least in the summer of 2005 â there is an ever-growing demand for European solidarity.
The solidarity fund set up in the aftermath of the devastating floods in 2002 and designed to run until 2006 is intended to give the European Union greater freedom to act in the event of major disasters or crisis situations, thereby playing a substantial part in enabling the EU to do more and target its efforts better in those areas in which the public expect the European Union to act.
As you, Commissioner, mentioned earlier, it was extremely difficult, not to say sometimes and in some situations impossible, to use the existing instruments at EU level as a means of responding appropriately to major crises, not all of which, it has to be said, were of natural origin.
One can take as examples of this industrial accidents â such as the wreck of the tanker , or the bomb attack on Madrid in March 2004.
In addition, the current threshold for the mobilisation of the solidarity fund is set extremely high, so that exceptional conditions and arrangements abounded.
The new solidarity fund regulation now rightly makes provision for the extension of its scope, in other words, no longer limiting major crisis situations to natural disasters, but extending the category to include industrial and technological calamities, except where the âpolluter paysâ principle is applicable or where the damage can be covered by insurance.
There is also a need for immediate action in the event of public health crises and when terrorists strike, although â and this is the crux of the matter â the budget must remain unchanged.
The definition of a âmajor disasterâ has also been revised, so that a disaster is regarded as major if it causes damage estimated at in excess of EURÂ 1 billion or over 0.5% of the gross national income of the State concerned.
One is talking here about damage in the public sphere rather than to private property or damage covered by insurance.
As has been said, the threshold was formerly fixed at EURÂ 3 billion or 0.6% of gross national income, which threshold values had been proposed by the Commission and by this House, but not accepted by the Council.
Finally, it is also intended that a new political criterion be introduced to enable the Commission, should extraordinary circumstances in a specific part of the territory of an eligible state sufficiently warrant it, to declare a disaster situation to be major, even if the quantitative criteria have not been fulfilled â a criterion that is likely to apply to acts of terrorism.
It needs to be emphasised that the European Unionâs solidarity fund is not a means for taking preventive action, but that it instead responds to disaster situations.
That, for example, excludes the possibility of the fund being used to provide protection in advance of pandemics or to facilitate other preventive action.
The solidarity fund cannot engage in preventive health care, nor is it meant to; health policy remains a matter for the nation states, and by that is meant specifically the deployment of vaccines and medicines in the initial response to disasters, medical and psychological emergency care and measures to deal with the risk of contagious disease, for example as a consequence of flooding.
As before, the fundâs financial assets amount to a virtual budget of 1 billion marks, the significance of âvirtualâ being that these funds can be drawn on only in the event of a disaster, and must first be mobilised by the Commission and Parliament; it follows that they cannot be transferred elsewhere.
I would like to conclude by extending warm thanks to all who have worked with me on this report â to the Bureau, to my colleagues, and to the Members of this House, irrespective of whatever groups they belong to, with hearty thanks to the Commission, too, for its good cooperation.
Â Â  Mr President, the boulevards of Szeged, a city in Southern Hungary, were named after the large cities of Europe.
This does not reflect sister city relations, but the fact that the city had been destroyed by a flood over one hundred years ago, and was rebuilt by an effort of solidarity involving the entire Europe.
It was not us, it was not the European Union who invented European solidarity, and it has been in operation long before 2002.
Obviously, this does not mean that the Committee on Budgets does not support the existence of the Solidarity Fund and the currently planned modifications to its regulation.
Our Committee wishes to see an efficient Solidarity Fund, and not one that narrows down artificially the scope of those eligible for assistance.
We agree with the mitigation of damages suffered, and we pressed for the rapid activation of the system.
We believe that it is important for the Fund to be situated within the flexibility instrument.
The Solidarity Fund represents a significant opportunity for the European Union to make its citizens aware of its existence in a manner that can be understood by all.
The European Union can show, in a tangible form, that Brussels is not just a bureaucratic hydrocephalus, but also a helping hand.
Numerous ungenerous rather than helpful proposals have been made during the debate, and I consider them to be a mistake.
I thank the rapporteur for his thorough work, and hope that we will only need to use this Fund rarely or perhaps never, but not due to bad regulations inspired by selfishness, but to the absence of disasters causing damages.
I know that my natural optimism is a mistake, but please support these funds.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though the European Unionâs Solidarity Fund has been in existence only since 2002, it is already in need of revision.
Founded upon the principles of solidarity and aid in a crisis, it has proved its worth in dealing with the after-effects of natural disasters, but it has also become apparent over recent years that its scope cannot be limited to dealing with these.
It has become more and more plain that industrial and technological disasters and the potential crises resulting from terrorist acts or â something that is of particular importance to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety â a public health crisis, make it necessary that we should be in a position to respond and help by means of solidarity and financial resources.
Just so that it is clear to everyone, once and for all, I am not talking here about preventative measures, which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, fall within the remit of the Member States.
Our concern is with help, on the basis of solidarity, in dealing with the spreading of diseases, with pandemics, or with accidents such as the one that happened at Chernobyl.
We want to be able to help without in any way overloading the European budget with unnecessary functions, not even when natural disasters need to be dealt with.
It is for that reason that I expect the House not to give its backing to the renewed demand â made in another report â for an observatory to report on drought, desertification and other effects of climate change, for these tasks are already being dealt with by the Commission anyway.
It must be clear to us that every additional agency â or whatever else we want to call these things â restricts the financial elbow room available for our policies, and just how tight that elbow room is was the subject of a resolution yesterday.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs, MrsÂ Estrela, MrÂ CapoulasÂ Santos and MrÂ GaleoteÂ Quecedo on their outstanding work.
In some respects, an even more positive solution could have been reached, which was proposed in Parliament but which ultimately was not taken forward.
Parliament must address the natural disasters that have lain waste to Europe in recent years â drought, forest fires and floods â in terms of their impact on agricultural activity.
As MrÂ CapoulasÂ Santos correctly pointed out, agricultural and forestry production, unlike other economic activities, is closely bound up with nature and is therefore more fragile when natural disasters strike.
I therefore feel that following recent experiences, there needs to be a fresh approach to European farming in terms of preventing and responding to natural disasters.
Current national mechanisms are often inadequate and one-off supranational response mechanisms are often inefficient.
I wish to highlight the Solidarity Fund, which has already been mentioned today and which we will certainly continue to speak about.
The Fund is currently under review and it is hoped that drought can be included in its scope.
At a time when climate change is already being felt and when the vulnerability of farmers in the face of such dangers is becoming increasingly apparent, I feel that it is vitally important to draw up a Community strategy to combat natural disasters.
Accordingly, in the next financial framework a Community forest and flood protection programme should be created with the appropriate funding, with a view to encouraging awareness raising activities, and fire risk prevention and management.
This Community programme could be funded by a specific regulation, by its own funding or by its own budget heading under EAFRD or LEADER+, in accordance with an oral amendment that is to be tabled.
Parliament must therefore provide a clear response for the communities it represents, who have suffered as a direct result of the natural disasters and who are naturally expecting our support.
Â Â  . â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years Europe has been affected by natural disasters, which have caused hundred of deaths and terrible economic and environmental damage.
For Portugal in particular, in common with other Mediterranean regions, 2005 was the driest year in the last 105 years.
In December, around 87% of Portuguese territory was suffering from extreme drought.
This was particularly serious in the Algarve region, where the climatic conditions were exceptional â a combination of high temperatures and the dryness of the air.
In the Algarve region, the natural disaster of the drought of 2005 and the devastation caused by the 2003 forest fires had a terrible impact on local infrastructure, on the natural and cultural heritage and on farming and tourism.
The water supply to the communities concerned was markedly affected in terms of scarcity and compliance with required quality standards.
Natural disasters are known to occur when extreme weather events affect a vulnerable area.
It is therefore crucial that the fragility of these regions be reduced.
European cooperation on civil protection must be stepped up, in order to ensure rapid response for the affected areas.
There must also be increased prevention and a rapid response preparedness instrument for emergency situations.
This is what these own-initiative reports seek to do and to coordinate.
Even so, the Solidarity Fund has a long way to go before it is fully developed, which is why we are discussing it.
It should therefore be acknowledged that almost all the affected areas are classified by the EU and that following the devastation we cannot simply say that we have fulfilled our civil responsibility.
The restoration of lost ecosystems is vital for the balance of these areas.
To this end, solidarity is also crucial.
It is also crucial to enhance information and awareness raising among the communities and regions that are vulnerable to natural disasters, so as to reduce the risks and the impact of those disasters and so that the people know what they can do to preserve the natural resources in the region.
Solidarity has been a key word in the EU ever since the Treaty of Rome.
Let us make sure, however, that it does not become just another empty word in the Community vocabulary.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced here with some extremely sensitive issues.
The various disasters that have taken place, the distress they cause - which we share with the victims insofar as we are able, as outsiders - and the discontent that is expressed show just how sensitive these issues are.
Throughout our debates, we have listed what these various natural disasters might have consisted of: fires, cyclones, tidal waves, earthquakes, floods, health crises, terrorist attacks, droughts, shortages of drinking water, industrial and technological disasters, agricultural disasters and undoubtedly many more.
That is a long list that affects our Union and that calls on it to shoulder its responsibilities.
Yet, as we were able to recognise in our debates, those responsibilities are shouldered by a variety of partners.
First and foremost, they are sometimes shouldered by those responsible for the disaster, or for a fire, for example.
Yet they are also shouldered by insurance companies, which are obviously affected, by the Member States and by the various organisations.
What is the European Union's role, what is its mission, in this general context?
For, as my fellow Member, MrsÂ Madeira, just said, if we are responsible for solidarity, then we must shoulder that responsibility within the context of our powers.
Yet, what are these powers, before, during and after these natural disasters?
I think that, after having heard our fellow Member, MrÂ Galeote, draw up a fine list just now, there is a need, Commissioner, for total clarity regarding this responsibility of the Union, before, during and after disasters.
With regard to prevention, as with regard to protection measures, I believe that we do in fact have a power to exercise and a role to play in the fields of research and coordination.
As regards the retrospective measures, which draw on our Solidarity Fund, our fellow Member, MrÂ Berend, has done a very fine job, but much remains to be done because it will always be very difficult to find ideal solutions, given the variety of situations and funding.
We have a huge amount of work facing us.
What I am asking you to do, Commissioner, is to find a better solution and to ensure that the European Union responds very clearly in the wake of these disasters.
Our fellow citizens need a European Union that is very clear in terms of the measures it takes.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time now, we have been subsidising a development in the agricultural, industrial and transport fields that has damaged the environment and brought about the alarming situation that we are currently experiencing, and we are paying the price for it: natural disasters are the witnesses to those mistakes.
It is now a matter of facing up to the damage caused by those disasters, and we all agree on the need to support the victims and to help them get back on their feet and rebuild their lives after the disasters, as well as the need to support the âDisaster' fund in order to show solidarity with all of the victims and to demonstrate that the European Parliament takes an interest in, and cares about, its fellow citizens.
However, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we also call for investment in the areas of prevention and restoration, instead of the focus being merely on curing the ills.
Even though we broadly support the analyses of the proposals drafted in various resolutions tabled, in particular, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and by the Committee on Regional Development, I am disappointed by the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is refusing, as it were, to assume its share of the responsibility for the speed with which these phenomena are occurring.
What shocks me is the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting that the aid not be deducted from the CAP resources.
We have just spent a year witnessing a significant struggle aimed at obtaining a fund to preserve the biodiversity falling under Natura 2000, and we have failed.
Yesterday, we all took note of that failure.
As rapporteur for LifeÂ +, I will be unable to agree to this programme â which is already well and truly dwindling away â serving as an insurance policy for disasters that are less and less the result of nature.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is in reality our cultivation methods that we must change.
The flooding of the Danube can be mentioned by way of example.
The dams had to be knocked down because the Danube delta, which is prone to flooding, had virtually dried up.
We now need to pose this crucial question: what kind of agriculture and what kinds of transport do we hope to have in the future if the Kyoto Protocol is regarded as the key element where climate change and the fight against this change are concerned?
We must seek out the causes of these disruptions, and we, as Members of the European Parliament, know what they are: they are changes in modes of transport.
I am in favour of a Solidarity Fund and of giving aid to the victims, but let us genuinely seek out the causes, otherwise we are just going to make changes to a never-ending problem.
Â Â  . â We have tabled amendments to the report on the Solidarity Fund, because we feel that in its current form it does not address areas that we believe to be highly important, including maintaining the criterion of regional-level disasters.
The new proposal for the Solidarity Fund needs to respond to the difficulties that have been experienced in relation to its application since it was created in 2002.
We feel that the Fund should be adapted to the specific characteristics and the actual needs of the different countries faced with a very wide range of different disasters, as in the Mediterranean area.
We therefore tabled a proposal aimed at reintroducing the concept of exceptional regional disasters, as laid down in the current regulation governing the Fund.
Let me say that this is a view voiced in the opinion delivered by the Economic and Social Committee, which deems it necessary to continue to address disasters with a serious regional impact.
I also wish to point out that the report by the Committee on Regional Development before us today takes the view that the Fund should be applied when the majority of the population in a region has suffered from a disaster with serious and lasting impact on their living conditions.
Similarly, the Portuguese Parliament adopted a resolution aimed at maintaining the possibility of providing support in the event of regional disasters with a significant socio-economic and environmental impact in the least favoured regions of the EU.
We also tabled proposals intended to ensure that both the promotion of support for reinstating production activity in areas affected by disasters and making land and air equipment immediately available to fight against forest fires should figure among the eligible actions.
Lastly, we proposed that, as laid down in the regulations of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, a level of economic and social development in a region or Member State should be taken into account when financial assistance is granted under the Solidarity Fund.
Among other aspects that form part of the new proposal for a regulation, I should merely like to underline our concern at the broadening of the scope of application of the Fund without the financial ceiling being increased.
In other words, we believe that priority should be attached to natural disasters.
We also oppose the idea of reducing the mobilisation threshold whereby the EU Member States with the highest GNI stand to benefit most.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe MrÂ CapoulasÂ Santosâ report is excellent and much needed by farmers.
However, I would like to highlight the rather perfunctory treatment of the damages caused by frost, which is also a form of natural disaster.
I understand that natural disasters such as fires and droughts are issues somewhat closer to the rapporteurâs heart because he lives in the Mediterranean region.
In Central and Northern European countries, frost causes very serious financial losses in the agricultural sector, especially in orchards and in the field of soft fruit production.
When working on this draft, we should create a systemic solution that could apply to all regions of the European Union and all types of natural disasters.
That is why the elements that have so far been omitted should be incorporated into the report in order to make it complete.
Another issue that was greatly emphasised in the report was the question of migration from rural areas and farmers abandoning their farms.
This is partly caused by the lack of viability and the high cost of forest management.
Serious losses in the forestry sector are caused by inappropriate forest management, monocultures across large woodland areas as well as the planting of inappropriate species of trees.
I would just like to point out that, during discussions concerning this forestry strategy in Parliament two months ago, Members failed to mention the huge areas of forest where forest management is carried out in an exemplary fashion.
I am referring here to state-owned forests, including those in Poland, where fires and hurricanes also cause significant damage.
Â Â  â Mr President, that 2005 was a year of disasters is something that many scientists attribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect, while others see the cause as lying in the natural cycle of disasters; in any case, the fact is that we are not completely blameless when such calamities occur.
For example, an increasing number of flood plains have been lost in the course of centuries, and experts believe that we in Europe have, by the building of dykes, pretty well exhausted the possibilities of technological protection against flooding, so that we will, in the near future, have to have ever greater recourse to what are termed âretention areasâ.
It would appear that respect for the forces of nature is disappearing altogether.
There is â as is well known â increasing settlement and industrialisation in exposed areas, for example on the coastline and in the flatlands of rivers, and so natural disasters, under such circumstances, can be prevented only with great difficulty if at all, but we can make the effort â by means of a solidarity fund such as this one â to alleviate the consequences in so far as possible.
It has to be said, though, that the development and extension of early warning systems is essential in this respect; it is in this area that much remains to be done, and I regard this as an area in which the European Union, in particular, must act.
Â Â  What we want to achieve with these reports is a greater proximity to citizens and a greater sense of Community Europe, which is something that the public both understands and welcomes.
We can certainly make a number of improvements in terms of better coordination and the exchange of good practice.
However, in the case of largeâscale natural disasters, according to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, we need higherâlevel arrangements for financial and technical operational help.
âHe who gives promptly, gives twice over,â as they said in ancient Rome. .
Although we deal exclusively in these reports with the consequences of natural disasters, we also need to pay great attention to preventative measures.
In this respect, our policies relating to agriculture, forestry, water management, town planning and regional development policy also need to come under scrutiny, as they could have a substantial impact on the scale of the consequences of natural disasters.
Take, for example, intensive animal husbandry, which is subsidised by the European Union, but which also leads to greater desertification in certain areas.
With regard to monitoring climate change and its consequences, I advocate closer cooperation between existing research and scientific institutions and the financing of new community programmes.
New community institutions, however, usually require a lot of money â they are easy to establish, hard to dismantle â and I also advocate that, in addition to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, we also take very great care to respect the principle of proportionality.
Let us establish new institutions only where they are genuinely needed.
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall begin by thanking all of the Members who have participated in these reports, in particular MrÂ Berend, who has made a great effort to create a majority in relation to the Solidarity Fund, with regard to which there are divergent interests amongst the Members.
It has not therefore been an easy job to achieve a common position that makes it possible for this Parliament to act strongly and firmly in the coming negotiations.
I would like briefly to stress certain important elements relating to natural disasters, since I believe that we must enhance the European Unionâs measures for dealing with them, given that Community interventions have so far proven themselves to be insufficient.
It is therefore reasonable for this Parliament to ask the Commission for a European strategy for combating natural disasters, and furthermore one that acknowledges the specific characteristics of those of a Mediterranean nature, such as droughts and forest fires.
We must provide resources aimed at the victims of these disasters.
Furthermore, the creation of a European Monitoring Centre for Drought and Desertification are important initiatives that we must promote.
I would like to stress the main innovations incorporated into the Solidarity Fund, which are going to make it possible to respond more quickly and effectively to disasters that the Member States cannot tackle alone.
Together with natural disasters, admissibility is also extended to industrial disasters, terrorist attacks and emergency public health situations.
We in this Parliament must be firm with regard to the proposal to lower the threshold for mobilising the Fund from EUR 3Â 000 to 1Â 000 million in damage caused.
Thanks to this measure, it will be easier to use the Fund than it has been up to now.
We cannot lose sight of the fact that it is necessary to determine which emergency operations are essential for the re-establishment of the infrastructures and equipment affected, as laid down in the Regulation.
The provision of air and land resources and the administration of drinking water are clear examples of this, without forgetting the technical assistance that the Commission will facilitate.
This instrument must respond quickly and effectively, with financial aid, to extreme situations of drought, fire and floods, without forgetting the victims of these disasters who need immediate help and assistance, and who Europe must not turn its back on.
We are talking about the Solidarity Fund and we must not lose sight of this notion, because the European citizens expect us to respond to their demands.
We are talking about a Fund that is a political instrument and, as such, it must resolve the difficulties faced by the areas affected and the people living in them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and also Commissioner Piebalgs for his presence in the House, while at the same time highlighting the importance of a joint debate on these issues, precisely so that we recognise that they are all closely related problems.
The reason why we now find ourselves having this debate is because of a new development that constitutes an even more serious challenge to our territory: climate change due to global warming.
There is therefore a need to identify long-term prevention measures, which can be summed up using the concept of integrated land conservation.
Let me explain: since land is subjected to a variety of challenges, a form of conservation is needed that will address all of the aspects in question together: flood safety, by increasing the retention times of our rivers; geological safety, by draining slopes that are characterised by an unstable equilibrium and that can cause numerous casualties, as the recent events in Ischia serve to remind us; and fire safety, through forest-based activities aimed at reducing the risk of fire, without excluding, of course, the possibility of using biomass for energy purposes.
There is also a need for short-term prevention, especially against floods, which should consist of a radar network that is capable of calculating precipitation and, thanks to river modelling, can guarantee a reaction time that is sufficient to protect the civil population and properties too.
As MrÂ Beaupuy has already pointed out, this is what we must do at EU level: draw far more attention to the matter, because that is the only way in which we will actually be able to address these risks.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the solidarity fund.
As the rapporteur has already said, it was the devastation wrought by the floods in 2002 that prompted this House, the Commission and the Council to set the Fund up.
This is a second-generation regulation, and the clear and tight framework set down by the rapporteur makes it a really useful and flexible instrument that we can fully support.
It is indeed the case that the fund is a reactive rather than a preventative instrument, but we believe it is irresponsible, when taking reactive action, to make the same mistakes that brought disaster in the first place.
Take the example of the rivers that destroyed homes and property; never again must they be so tightly hemmed in; preventing them from being so is the only responsible way of using European taxpayersâ money.
At the same time, I would like to point out that some Member States have a tendency to simply pocket the European funding and tell the public that it is they themselves that are putting the aid measures in place.
That is something I regard as unacceptable; we know that the European Union has a credibility deficit, and it is by this instrument that the EU shows that it stands by ordinary people in a credible way.
The source of aid funds must not be concealed; instead, the Commission must ensure that it is clearly affirmed and that every locality to which it goes receives a report stating what proportion is derived from European funds.
Those are the main amendments that our group has tabled in the hope of further improving this report.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteurs; however I note with regret that we are talking about dealing with natural disasters as if they are a phenomenon which can be resolved purely by taking corrective action.
We are overlooking the fact that the policy for dealing with natural disasters should not be confined solely to the formulation of internal policies to address and prevent them.
It is equally important for the European Union to assume its share of the very heavy political responsibility for tolerating the causes of serious climate changes over recent decades.
We need a stricter policy against European and any other industry that has contributed to them, inside or outside the Community borders, so that not only do they have to pay for the damage they have caused, but also â and much more importantly â they have to take measures of limitation and prevention in their future activities and bear the cost of such measures themselves.
The European Union should also exercise its influence directly on the United States, which is completely ignoring and infringing the Kyoto Protocol and continuing its destructive action, which affects both European citizens and the citizens of the rest of the world.
Foreign policy is therefore an equally important dimension.
The geographical scope must be reviewed, in order to ensure support is extended to other countries beyond our immediate neighbours.
This fund should apply to the various states involved, even to states who are not even candidate members, if they have been hit by an incident which has been caused by or originates in the geographical area of the Community or candidate states.
In this way, other neighbouring countries will be entitled to solidarity from Europe, either through the fund or through the other mechanisms which apply to international cooperation.
Our solidarity should not be confined to our borders.
The fund regulation does not appear to take account of cumulative disasters or prolonged events during which a disaster develops gradually, such as drought.
Cumulative disasters can also be addressed even if they took place when the fund did not exist, if they have visible consequences.
Finally, I recognise the importance of the existence of this fund and the significant extension of its scope.
This does not mean that the regulation, as it stands, satisfies us or that the policy for addressing natural disasters should be limited to it.
We expect far more, not only as the European left, but also as European citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, the Solidarity Fund was introduced after devastating floods in the summer of 2002.
An attempt is now being made to include terrorist attacks in the list of supposedly natural disasters covered by the fund.
As usual, there is an ulterior motive at work here: it appears that disaster relief is to be politicised.
Mr Berend suggests in his report, in the context of terrorist attacks, that the EU should be able to use the fund in such cases as a political signal of solidarity.
Pandemics are also included, presumably to make the proposal acceptable to a public that is worried about things such as bird flu.
It is all a long way from the original intention of the fund.
Who, therefore, decides what qualifies for it?
Even Mr Berend says that it is incomprehensible that the Commission can make an arbitrary political assessment, thus calling into question the credentials of the institution that has produced this proposal.
Once again, we see the confusion and incompetence of the EU in practice.
Communities that have suffered disasters â natural or manmade â have their national governments to step in and assist.
Even more likely to come to their aid, in cases of extreme disasters such as the tsunami, is the incredible generosity of the general public.
The last thing they need is for that perpetual disaster â the EU â to turn up and make things worse!
Â Â  Mr President, it is laudable that the European Parliament is addressing the issue of natural disasters and their impact on the environment and on farming, something I particularly appreciate.
Although disasters on a larger scale occur on other continents, Europe is no stranger to them either.
Forest fires frequently occur in southern Europe and floods are a regular occurrence in the central part of our continent.
People affected by these disasters cannot be left without aid, and Member States should not be left alone to deal with the problem.
It is laudable that, in MrÂ CapoulasÂ Santosâ report, the problems in the agricultural sector are so clearly perceived, as it is a sector that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters.
The problem of natural disasters has quite rightly been linked to another issue that could be described as a socio-economic disaster. It is something that threatens European farming in the context of what has been happening at the WTO, namely sudden market liberalisation and the abolition or weakening of protective mechanisms for European agricultural markets.
Considering that market protection is being reduced, it is good that we at least have the prospect of aid in the event of a natural disaster.
That is the greatest merit of the reports we are discussing.
The draft under discussion is an important step on the road to building true European solidarity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ CapoulasÂ Santosâ report seems comprehensive, and I regard the link between the recitals and the articles calling on the Community institutions to pay the utmost attention to the agroforestry sector as systematic.
The report adequately summarises the way in which agroforestry production is closely connected with nature and, therefore, with its extremes and accidents.
Articles 2, 3, 9 and 12 outline the measures needed to restore the balance.
The common goal â as MrÂ Prodi also highlighted â is to design the Community strategy to cope with disasters, both by means of prevention measures and by planning the mechanisms for using the Solidarity Fund and the various State aid regimes.
As regards the development policies, I am in favour of the requested increase in cofinancing amounts.
I also welcome the articles highlighting the need for the activities aimed at raising awareness and training the parties involved to keep pace with research on the ground, and therefore documentation and mapping.
Lastly, I agree with the proposals for directives in Article 25 and subsequent articles, which are aimed at making better use of the relevant Community instruments.
Â Â  â Mr President, at a time when Euroscepticism is intensifying in certain Member States, I believe that the European Union cannot remain indifferent towards the problem of natural disasters and indifferent towards the citizens affected by them.
I think that its presence has added value in three sectors: prevention, immediate suppression and restoration.
As far as prevention is concerned, a typical example is flooding from rivers which do not concern just one Member State, but often many more, including candidate states.
In Greece, for example, we have precisely this problem with the River Evros, which flows through Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece.
Consequently, we need a global strategy for addressing such problems.
As far as immediate suppression is concerned, a typical example is fires, where solidarity is needed between the Member States, which is why I believe we need a European civil protection force, as proposed in the Galeote report, which deals with such matters.
Thirdly, the Berend report deals with the problem of restoring damage through the Solidarity Fund which has existed â and rightly so â since 2002.
However, I believe that we need to lower the thresholds for the eligibility of actions, as MrÂ Berend quite rightly proposes, and extend the scope to include technological disasters, such as major shipwrecks or 'flu epidemics, so that we can supply the populace with vaccines and address the matter adequately.
The matters which we examine in the Berend report will proceed under the codecision procedure and, consequently, Parliament will fight to the end; however, on the matters addressed in the Galeote report, I think that Parliament should not lower the flag either.
They are important to the citizens, they are matters which concern their daily lives and we need to fight to the end and put pressure on the Commission and the Council to proceed in the direction that we are calling for.
Â Â  â Mr President, the citizens affected by natural disasters, by nature itself, should not find themselves up against the indifference of national and Community governments or the absence of integrated support programmes.
Most importantly, they cannot constitute a battle field, a field of political expediencies within the framework of the Member States.
The policies of the states for materially addressing them have, in principle, two stages: prevention and response.
Firstly I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs and to say that the report by MrÂ CapoulasÂ Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is balanced as regards the way in which the problems and proposals are formulated.
However, I should like to highlight certain points: firstly, the question of paragraph 16, on the basis of which the creation of a public cofinanced insurance scheme and a reinsurance scheme within the framework of the CAP are proposed, and on paragraphs 17 and 19, on the basis of which the establishment of a new risk management instrument and a system to stabilise the prices and incomes of farmers affected by natural disasters are proposed.
Above all, we must emphasise floods, a matter which exists â and we have experienced it â in Greece, in the Prefecture of Evros where, due to the absence of national measures, the area is affected every year.
I should like to emphasise that the state needs national and cofinanced projects to protect citizens' property and must be denounced by all of us when it is unable to protect citizens' lives.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in SeptemberÂ 2003, following the unprecedented forest fires of the summer that, as you will recall, affected Portugal and a whole host of regions in southern Europe, we took the floor in order to urge the European Union to equip itself with a permanent rapid reaction force.
We appealed at that time, and we continue to appeal, in the four excellent reports presented to us, not only, I would say, for a little less national self-interest regarding civil protection, but also, as MrsÂ Estrella proposes in paragraphs 3 and 4, for example, of her report, for enhanced European cooperation regarding civil protection.
MrÂ Wojciechowski broadly addressed this precise point.
We need enhanced European cooperation for at least two good reasons.
Firstly, the impact of climate change on the frequency of natural disasters, the torrential rain in northern and eastern Europe, drought and the fires that wreaked havoc last year are there to remind us of the crucial need to act, and to act quickly, on this matter.
Secondly, the financial cost of these disasters is increasing, and our Member States are having more and more difficulty in meeting it by themselves.
This is, of course, where the Solidarity Fund comes into its own, as it is designed to cover these emergency costs, such as the provision of water, energy and housing, or the repairing of basic infrastructure.
I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank MrÂ Berend, who wants to make it easier immediately to access part of the payments and who also proposes to extend the benefit of the Fund to other types of disaster such as drought or even â as he mentioned â biological or chemical terrorist threats or attacks.
The European Union will never, of course, succeed in preventing all natural disasters, but our duty is to help the Europeans who are hit by these tragedies and to coordinate our efforts more effectively in such cases.
That is why, despite the reluctance of some Member States, we must also support the creation of a permanent European civil protection force, the famous âGreen Helmetsâ.
Let us also support the less controversial creation of an operations centre for the management of major crises.
As you can see, Commissioner - and, in saying this, I am responding to a fear expressed by MrsÂ Haug, which I share - we are not calling here for more Europe, but for a better Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate all of the rapporteurs and, in particular, MrÂ Galeote and MrÂ Berend, on the precision of their reports and the quality of their listening skills.
I am delighted to observe that an agreement has been concluded between our Parliament and the Commission so as to ensure that the scope of the next Solidarity Fund will from now on cover not only natural disasters, but also industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and major public health crises.
I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for having supported my amendment, the aim of which is to specify that special attention will be paid to remote or isolated regions, such as island and outermost regions.
This specification guarantees that, as from 2007, this Fund can potentially be used in the French Overseas Departments - even if they do not fully meet the general eligibility criteria - so that they can take advantage of emergency aid when a major crisis occurs.
The own-initiative report by the Committee on Regional Development highlights the devastating effect of these disasters on the economy, employment, national and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism and rightly emphasises the need for effective measures regarding warnings, civil protection and aid for the regions and populations affected.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for having included my amendments concerning the outermost regions in the European strategy that he so earnestly desires, in the knowledge that, due to their geographical situation, those regions are exposed to natural risks of a specific character and intensity.
Faced with the numerous threats that regularly place a strain on those regions, from tsunamis to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes to cyclones, and, from now on, the reactivation of mosquito-borne viral diseases, such as chikungunya in RÃ©union or dengue in Guyana, the overseas populations are awaiting a suitable response from Europe in terms of security, prevention and solidarity.
Our Parliament is proving today that it has well and truly listened to them.
Â Â  Mr President, in my part of Europe floods are the most frequent natural disaster, but this report rightly covers other kinds of natural disasters as well.
As far as floods are concerned, neighbouring states should act together, as floods, like pollution, do not stop at borders.
The flood prevention programme, like flood risk maps, should be set up not just for national states but for whole river basins.
Since the same kinds of disasters happen year after year, we have to make more effort in forecasting and prevention.
The Solidarity Fund does not work in its present form.
A new regulation is needed and it should help prevent environmental pollution as a consequence of natural disasters.
We should not forget that environmental pollution is a very dangerous consequence of natural disasters in general.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the limited amount of time available to me, I would like to focus in particular on fires.
As you know, a delegation visited Spain and Portugal and we were able to witness the scale of the ecological and human tragedy on the ground.
We were able to hear directly from the sectors affected how the progressive abandonment of rural areas and of traditional activities creates a fertile environment for these disasters.
We heard complaints from people accusing the competent administrations of abandoning the forests.
For our part, we must condemn the lack of a genuine policy for fire prevention and the leniency of the penalties relating to the causing of fires.
If we are to be absolutely thorough in our observations, we must point out that, unfortunately, we have witnessed a lack of coordination between the public administrations responsible, and that, in the case of Guadalajara, this has undoubtedly aggravated the disaster.
Ladies and gentlemen, the victims of these disasters deserve their own chapter.
In the case in question, they have felt ignored in their own region.
From a democratic point of view, it is unacceptable that a committee of enquiry should be set up in Castilla-La Mancha but that the families of the victims should have been excluded.
It has been the European Parliament that has had to come along and put that unspeakable political behaviour right.
At the hearing held in Brussels to that end, therefore, a representative of the victims spoke and the European Parliament was able to hear their fair demands as the passive victims of a tragedy that has affected their lives.
At least they have been heard.
The courts will now decide whether anybody needs to take responsibility, in addition to any political responsibility, which will undoubtedly have to be taken.
I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Development for approving an amendment that I presented on the victims and I hope that plenary will vote in favour of it.
That amendment urges the Commission to provide the resources necessary to alleviate the suffering and meet the material needs of all of the victims of natural disasters and their immediate families, by means of the European Unionâs Solidarity Fund and other Community instruments.
Finally, I am very much in favour of the reform of the Solidarity Fund and I hope that the Commission, following the mandate from this Parliament, will present a proposal for a directive for the prevention and management of fires within the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the resolutions that we will approve this morning reflect the truth about the important work that Parliament has been doing on the natural disasters affecting the people and territories of the European Union.
These texts, which represent Parliamentâs opinion in this field, state what we have always expressed: the need to draw up and implement European policies for the prevention of those disasters, for immediate intervention capable of combating them effectively and for compensating for the damage caused.
We hope that the Council and the Commission will now take Parliamentâs proposals into account and respond accordingly, and we shall apply pressure in order to ensure that that happens.
Nevertheless, the texts that we will approve also highlight the lies and agitation that, in my country specifically, have been demonstrated with regard to this action by the European Parliament, in certain cases and from certain political forces and sectors, even misleading people with regard to its very nature.
Here today in this very debate we have heard untrue statements â half truths are always untrue â which are entirely contrary to Parliamentâs opinion, which is expressed by means of the texts we are to approve and nothing more.
There is an insistence on a partisan and self-interested approach to dealing with disasters and the pain they cause for so many people, in my region, Castilla-La Mancha, for example.
This kind of behaviour speaks for itself, and perfectly illustrates the nature of the people indulging in it.
I have no doubt that our citizens will be able to identify the culprits.
We are sad about the effects of disasters that have struck us hard and we are sad that we have not dedicated enough time, energy and courage to rejecting this regrettable manipulation.
Nevertheless, our confidence in our men and women, our commitment to the truth and our dedication to making the proposals that Parliament will approve today a reality will be our best legacy.
That is what we have worked for, that is what we are still working on, and we will continue to do so.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is true that in a time of climate change the risk of natural disasters is growing year on year.
The Union should of course address this situation, but how do we go about this?
I do not feel that the right response would be to create a single European policy to combat natural disasters, as proposed in one of the reports before us.
I do not share the view that, once a problem is discovered, the reaction must be to regulate at Union level.
As an advocate of consistent implementation of the subsidiarity principle, I take the opposite view, namely that changes to the law at Union level should only be carried out if the Member States are not able to resolve a given problem effectively by themselves.
Natural disasters cannot be understood as homogeneous phenomena with single strategies and a single legal framework.
Rather, the right way forward is to diversify.
Floods are of a completely different nature to, say, fires or droughts.
The formulation of a European strategy should be restricted to those types of natural disaster for which there can be added value attached to joint action at Union level.
Otherwise, a joint strategy and directive would be meaningless and would be tantamount to excessive regulation without any positive consequences.
I believe that the call to the Commission and the Council to table a proposal to harmonise compulsory measures aimed at punishing those who start fires is a glaring example of a violation of the subsidiarity principle.
Just as fires do not usually have a European dimension, the Member States on their own should be responsible for punishing arsonists.
On the other hand, I welcome the use of the proposed Galileo system for pre-empting and monitoring natural disasters across the Union, which is an important and positive aspect.
As regards the Solidarity Fund Regulation, I particularly welcome the fact that financial aid will be made more accessible in the event of natural disasters, since instead of the current EURÂ 3Â billion or 0.6% of GDP, billion-euro losses or 0.5% of GDP will be sufficient.
Furthermore, where losses are lower, the Commission will, according to the proposal, be authorised to assess the situation.
The Solidarity Fund will be able to help to repair any damage caused, which may for example help to improve the Unionâs image in the eyes of Europeâs citizens.
For this I thank all of the rapporteurs.
Â Â  Mr President, natural disasters, such as floods or droughts, often affect regions in more than one Member State.
That is why it would appear to be indispensable for the EU to take joint action either to prevent disasters or to mitigate their impact.
The Solidarity Fund should therefore have a broader scope than it does at present.
This would permit a faster response to crisis situations resulting from natural disasters as well as those caused by industrial or technological disasters, or by terrorist acts.
Furthermore, it is also necessary to formulate a European strategy for dealing with the impact of natural disasters, in addition to appropriate Community prevention measures, the tailoring of Structural Funds spending to disaster prevention and closer coordination with other Community instruments.
Once we have secured the necessary flexibility with regard to the distribution of available resources from various funds, we can then increase their efficiency in the event of a disaster.
In addition to this, both individual Member States and the European Union institutions have to focus in particular on making the existing early warning systems more effective in order to minimise the impact of disasters.
Even the largest Solidarity Fund imaginable, let alone the actual level of funding available over the next seven years, would not be able to cover all the costs incurred by European Union citizens each year as a result of the damage caused by unforeseen disasters and catastrophes.
Â Â  Mr President, I am from Ireland.
These proposals relate to natural disasters, such as fires, droughts and floods.
In Ireland, thankfully, we do not have forest fires or droughts; we have lots of rain â sometimes too much â but no major floods.
Therefore, the Galeote Quecedo report is of little relevance to Ireland: it is heavily oriented towards the Mediterranean. I have no problem with that.
If we are a European Community we must support each other, while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
European solidarity is the spirit that should underpin all our responses to initiatives such as the reports we are debating today.
The Solidarity Fund is crucial.
These reports are well drafted.
In the Galeote Quecedo report the emphasis is on prevention, research and risk management.
It also proposes identifying vulnerable areas so that preventive measures can be put in place well in advance.
What is crucially important is that the environmental issue should be taken into consideration.
Many of the environmental problems we are now encountering are caused by climate change and they are self-inflicted.
Droughts and floods in particular are the direct result of environmental neglect and mismanagement: they are manmade.
The EU is supposed to be leading the way in terms of environmental change, but at the same time the reality is that we are still destroying the worldâs environment and we are doing it on a daily basis: greenhouse gas emission levels, for example, are being ignored by many EU countries, including, sadly, my own country.
The sooner we, as a world community, wake up to this reality, the less will be the need to produce and to adopt the crisis-management measures that we are debating and, hopefully, adopting today.
I congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Berend once again on a job well done.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Parliament sometimes deals with matters that really only concern an elite group, but it mainly handles issues that concern everyone.
Natural disasters belong to the latter group.
Frequent floods, such as those in the region I come from, namely Central and Eastern Europe, but also the fires which are typical in the southern part of our continent, are real challenges for the international community, including the European Parliament.
It is important in this context that, instead of increasing the funds set aside for such matters in the 2007-2013 budget, we should make them more flexible and remove the red tape which makes it impossible to use the funds in line with the types of disasters that occur.
A good example is the situation in Poland in 1997, before enlargement, when my country was affected by major flooding and these funds were reallocated.
Finally, we must make use of both the Structural Funds in order to minimise the effects of disasters, as well the European Solidarity Fund to help the victims of such disasters.
As MrÂ Wojciechowski said a short time ago, this is an example of European solidarity.
Â Â  . Mr President, we all recognise the importance of being prepared for disasters.
We all wish for a better response to emergency situations.
Significantly, we all recognise the need to work together.
The resolutions passed by Parliament last year, these commendable reports and the Commissionâs proposals all aim to achieve the same purpose.
The call for increased cooperation in civil protection clearly reflects the Commissionâs line of thought.
To react effectively to a disaster, we need to have all our available resources in a state of ready deployment.
When these do not suffice or are unavailable, the Commission needs to be empowered to find alternative means.
As regards the agricultural aspects, I should like to emphasise that the Commission will do its utmost to optimise the use of existing instruments.
It is clear that, at this stage, solutions or assistance for the agricultural or forestry sector in the event of natural disasters will have to come via existing instruments under the rural development and forest policies, state aid and the possibilities that exist under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy.
I would be more cautious as regards greater budgetary flexibility to ease the problems for the agricultural sector.
We are tied to the funds available.
I see major difficulties in using underspent budget lines for disaster relief purposes, but the Commission is prepared to analyse the feasibility of any suggestions.
One difficulty, for example, is that we will only know with any certainty late in the budget year whether there is any margin left in the budget.
Finally, it should be remembered that in the future we will be more likely to have to apply financial discipline, which will reduce the likelihood of underspent amounts.
The Commission is also examining whether risk and crisis management instruments to support the agricultural sector could be a way forward.
I am particularly grateful for the great expression of support the Commissionâs proposal to adjust and improve the EU Solidarity Fund has received today.
With the new fund, the EU will have an instrument at its disposal that allows it effectively to assist Member States and candidate countries whenever a crisis situation arises.
An act of European solidarity can be counted on, no matter whether in response to a natural or another kind of serious disaster.
This will be good not only for the European Unionâs image but also, more importantly, for the Union, the Member States and acceding countries and their regions and, in particular, for the people affected by such disastrous events.
The rapporteur and other honourable Members have spoken in favour of all major elements of the Commission proposal.
This represents invaluable support in steering the proposal through the remaining steps of the legislative procedure.
In the light of this far-reaching agreement between our two institutions, the Commission appeals to the Member States and the Council to rethink their position which, up to now, has certainly been much less favourable than that of this House.
I note that you have proposed to grant Solidarity Fund assistance to candidate countries only if the same disaster also affects a Member State, even if this issue has not been discussed today.
While I understand the underlying reason â i.e. not to financially overburden the fund â this proposal puts candidate countries in a worse position than they are currently in.
At present, they are on an equal footing with Member States as regards eligibility for the fund.
I would ask honourable Members to reflect again on whether politically this is what they really want.
I also note that the use of the Solidarity Fund for preventative measures has been proposed.
There can be no doubt that prevention is an extremely important part of a comprehensive policy in relation to disasters, a view the Commission fully supports.
But it cannot be the role of the Solidarity Fund, which has been designed to bear some of the emergency costs incurred by Member States in dealing with disasters.
At EU level, prevention and reconstruction measures can be supported by the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, or by agricultural funds.
In fact, risk prevention is one of the European Rural Development Fundâs priorities for the period 2007-2013.
In addition, rural development measures under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund can finance the restoration of agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and the introduction of appropriate prevention instruments, including risk prevention for forest fires.
We need to strengthen all of the European Unionâs existing instruments for the benefit of our environment and, more importantly, for the safety and wellbeing of our citizens.
I agree with those Members who said that actions of solidarity and actions taken to prevent disasters and deal with their consequences will bring Europe closer to its citizens.
These issues are extremely important in order to get the European citizensâ full support for our work.
