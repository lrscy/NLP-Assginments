I would like to draw your attention to an additional, very important consideration: whereas the directive appears to be based on the approach of preventive protection of the environment, that is protection which takes place before the environment is completely destroyed, the framework decision proposed by the Council would, in actual fact, only impose criminal sanctions once the environment has already suffered destruction or, at any rate, irreparable damage.
Here, we do not, of course, have enough time available, but in committee we have already outlined this difference of approach quite clearly.
I therefore stress that we must endorse both the framework decision, which has already been approved in committee, and the directive, for, as they stand, these two documents complement each other.
If, however, we were to adopt a decision which was inconclusive as regards the basic approach or, worse still, if we were to adopt Amendment No 28 to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report, which completely rejects the Commission's proposal, we would cause the two documents to be totally inconsistent.
We therefore need to agree on the complementary nature of these two instruments and adopt them both in their current forms.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Environmental Crime Directive will provide a new European legal instrument which is to contribute towards a more effective enforcement of the European environmental laws transposed and implemented in the Member States.
The topic is an exciting one.
Exciting, because the judicial system which is being selected is sound, but also because it will provide much material for the European legal experts in years to come.
The view that the Member States must have at their disposal the option of criminal sanctions as a way of enforcing European environmental law is unreservedly shared by the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
However, we are divided about the way in which such a system of criminal sanctions for serious environmental offences must be formulated and introduced, and about the question as to who can be involved in the codecision process.
Along with Mr Di Lello Finuoli of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I side with the European Commission and support an Environmental Crime Directive under the first pillar.
With what is known as the Danish initiative, the Council has opted for measures under the third pillar.
The members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are right to reject this decision.
The thing that unites the Council, Parliament and the Commission is that we all wish to act upon the very explicit request expressed at the European Council of Tampere in October 1999 for common definitions, administration of justice and penalties aimed at a limited number of sectors of special significance, but where explicit reference is made to environmental crime.
Since the choice of legal basis in the first pillar still elicits questions on the part of the Council, and on the part of some colleagues of my group, as I found out a moment ago, I will make a few enlightening observations which I hope, incidentally, will also convert the cynics.
I will break these down into a few points.
Why do we opt for the first pillar, and why do I recommend that the first pillar be chosen?
Firstly, with regard to the Danish initiative, the Council refers to Article 31, introductory line and letter e) of the Treaty on European Union whereby the authority for common action on judicial cooperation in criminal matters is given, and whereby e) provides for progressively adopting measures establishing minimum rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the fields of organised crime, terrorism and illicit drug trafficking.
This clause is included in title VI.
However, in accordance with Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the provisions of this title apply 'without prejudice to the powers of the European Community?.
But also in Article 47, it is stated that the Treaty on European Union does not prejudice the Treaties establishing the European Communities.
In other words, criminal law does not exclusively fall within the remit of the European Union.
Case law of the European Court of Justice, to which, incidentally, I also make reference in the report, confirms that the Treaty on European Union cannot constitute a barrier.
Secondly, the question which subsequently arises, now that there are no general barriers to arriving at criminal measures within the scope of the Treaty on European Union, is: what is the EC specifically capable of doing and what is it allowed to do?
If we look at Article 280(4) of the Treaty on European Union, which corresponds to Article 5 which enshrines the subsidiarity principle, then I note that in the field of environmental criminal law too, it should be ensured that EC legislation does not prejudice the organisation of the national administration of justice.
Thirdly, it is therefore crucial that this directive should not be about specific provisions concerning criminal law, but that criminal law is used to make environmental policy effective.
After all, the application of criminal law is in many areas an important coda for the enforcement of the rules, whereby, taking into consideration this subsidiarity, a certain level of harmonisation of criminal law enforcement can be useful for the implementation of Community provisions as a whole.
Fourthly, the environmental crime proposal is based on Article 175(1) of the Treaty on European Union, which stipulates that the Council, according to the codecision procedure of Article 251, affects all measures which can help the environmental objective of Article 174, provided that this process is not hindered by subsidiarity.
Fifthly, the proposal for a directive is based on environmental directives and regulations laid down on the basis of Article 175(1) and merely adds a criminal-law aspect to this legislation.
The existing line is therefore extended, whereby the directive requires Member States to provide for criminal sanctions for activities which cause substantial damage to the environment.
I based my assessment of the proposal and the submission of amendments on the aforementioned criteria.
I did not alter Article 1 of the directive, which aims to lay down minimum standards for punishable offences.
This enables Member States themselves to determine the punishment.
In the definitions of Article 2, I also included incitement as an environmental offence, for which, incidentally, I used the Danish initiative as the basis.
Thirdly, I included in Article 3 punishable offences which are now mentioned in the annex, with two minor changes.
I unreservedly condemn Amendment No 22, because I am of the view that there is no legal basis for it.
Fourthly, I have clarified the term 'framework' in Article 4.
Instead of allowing the Member States to determine the punishment, it is preferable to use the term criminal sanctions.
I have adapted Amended No 25, because subsidiarity plays a role here too.
We can only invite the Member States to introduce measures such as confiscation if this element is specifically provided for in the Member States' own legal systems.
This directive amounts to a fine balancing act.
We, as the European Parliament, must be very specific, because I assume that the European Court will verify the facts, and we, along with the European Commission, will possibly head in that direction too.
Finally, I should like to thank my fellow MEPs, not only those from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the rapporteur of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and all shadow rapporteurs.
We have worked in unity and, even if the contribution now appears very technical, it is founded on extensive policy, which is not only important to the Commission, but certainly also to the European Parliament.
We are serving a worthwhile goal, namely improved environmental protection.
Mr President, I simply wish to say that at 7.30 p.m. an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs will begin, for an urgent consultation that the Council has requested.
I have asked for the floor in relation to the two subsequent reports and I believe that the same is true for several members of that committee who are here at the moment.
I have taken the floor so that our reason for leaving the Chamber may be recorded in the Minutes and to say that, as coordinator of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the committee, I have no choice but to leave, and I hope this demonstrates that we should avoid this type of situation.
We fully understand your situation and this will be noted in the Minutes.
Mr President, in thirty years there has been a huge increase in the number of standards relating to the environment, with more than fifty times the number of national agreements, protocols and similar instruments in this area.
Within the UN we have more than five hundred of these sorts of agreements, and there are more than a hundred directives within the framework of EU Community law.
In general they are flawed in that they are not sufficiently specific and their implementation has been inexcusably ineffective.
In the end we need criminal sanctions and for that reason it is now important that we should lend our support to this Commission proposal for a directive.
It is considerably wider in scope, more coherent and will prove more effective than the Council framework agreement, which suffers from the usual weaknesses in environmental regulation and whose legal basis is furthermore clearly flawed.
The proposal for a directive, which is based on the EC Treaty and Article 175(1), is the correct instrument in this instance and, pursuant to Article 47 TEU, the Community legal instrument under the first pillar must clearly take precedence, as the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has stated in more detail in its opinion.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on their excellent work on uniting efforts to create instruments that will enable us to combat the increasing volume and the frequent cross-border effects of crimes against the environment.
I must also highlight a recent survey published by Eurobarometer, which confirms that the environment, together with security, health and unemployment, is one of the main issues of concern to the citizens of the European Union.
We therefore have an obligation to help to find solutions that can respond to these concerns and that can guarantee the protection of the environment and of our citizens' health, in an attempt to improve the quality of everyone's life.
We have, on the one hand, an initiative presented by Denmark in 2000 with a view to adopting a Council framework decision on combating serious crimes against the environment, which proposes that Member States adopt joint measures to protect the environment under criminal law, including effective investigations and prosecutions, and effective cooperation in police, criminal and administrative matters, in other words to establish an acquis in the field of criminal sanctions against environmental crimes.
On the other hand, we have a Commission initiative from 2001 with a view to producing a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law on the basis of Article 175 of the EC Treaty.
This proposal is intended to apply to activities that breach Community legislation on environmental protection and/or rules adopted by Member States to complement such legislation.
We must commend the strategy pursued by both the rapporteurs, Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, of attempting to make the two reports as consistent as possible, thereby enabling the European Parliament's position on the two initiatives to be clear and coherent.
They both seek to give a clear indication of Parliament's unequivocal preference for the Commission's approach, in other words, for the adoption of a first-pillar instrument, because legislating on environmental matters falls within Community competence.
It would be appropriate at this point, however, to point out that criminal law is not the exclusive responsibility of the European Union. By this I mean that the issue here is that the current system of sanctions is not sufficient to guarantee compliance with Community law, and this being the case, it is crucial that minimum rules are guaranteed, requiring the existence of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, with the adoption of more rigorous rules and sanctions in this field nevertheless remaining at the discretion of the Member States.
Mr President, the two excellent reports before us are abundant proof of the need for thorough institutional reform integrating the Union's responsibilities in matters of judicial, criminal and police cooperation, which currently fall under the third pillar, into the Community framework.
This European Parliament has been calling repeatedly for this and I hope the Convention on the future of Europe itself and, therefore, the Intergovernmental Conference on reform of the Treaties, will put forward such a proposal.
Only thus will it be possible to avoid future counterproductive disputes and institutional conflict, and, most importantly, will we be able to act effectively to protect the citizens of the EU.
Quite clearly, some of these rights - such as the right to a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment, which is enshrined in Article 37 of the Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, are not being adequately safeguarded by the Member States for lack of effective Community intervention.
None of the Member States has ratified the 1998 Council of Europe Convention on the protection of the environment through criminal law.
Even the many Community directives on the environment fail to provide sufficient protection because of failure to apply them and frequent failure to comply with them encouraged by the lack of effective penalties.
The Commission's proposal for a directive requiring the Member States to introduce penalties therefore deserves our full support with the incorporation of the useful amendments advocated in the Oomen-Ruijten report.
Although the Commission, Parliament and the Council Legal Service itself have, on several occasions, stressed that the protection of the environment is a fundamental Community objective pursuant to Articles 3 and 6 of the Community Treaty, that the proper legal basis for the protection of the environment through criminal law is Article 175 of the Treaty and that Community law prevails over Union law, the Council is attempting to adopt a framework decision on the same subject that does not just integrate the proposal for a directive but interferes with it, limiting its field of application and scope and making the issue no longer subject to the procedure of codecision with the European Parliament.
The Di Lello Finuoli report quite rightly states that this framework decision must be consistent with the directive, must wait for it to be promulgated and must refer to it, without repeating points already covered by the directive but, where necessary, incorporating them.
I hope that Parliament will adopt both reports and I call upon all the Members to reflect on the need to avoid similar damaging disputes in the future and to achieve full communitisation of the third pillar.
Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party also welcomes this proposal for a Commission directive, in the same way as it welcomed, equally favourably, the draft framework decision by the Council in December 2001.
The Liberal Group would, of course, like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello as well.
These two initiatives are a practical response to one of the people's major concerns: 88% of European citizens want the European Union to take practical measures to protect the environment.
This is one of the findings of a Eurobarometer survey carried out less than a year ago and which my fellow Member Mr Coelho mentioned earlier.
In response to acts of ecological delinquency, the Liberal Group supports the position defended by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, namely that the Community framework under the first pillar is the most suitable.
We believe that a directive is the most appropriate tool for establishing a European list of environmental crimes and a common foundation of criminal sanctions.
As for the more specific content of this proposal, I believe, as most of my colleagues do, that incitement, as well as the act itself to breach European environmental legislation, must be punished.
Similarly, we should use general terms when referring to breaches of the law, in order to avoid ecological crimes from being swallowed up in a potential legal loophole.
Having said this, and due to the dispute on the legal basis between Parliament and the Commission, on the one side, and the Council, on the other, I believe it is crucial that we take swift action, that we reassure our citizens by taking repressive measures against these modern-day polluters, because, today, and it seems with regard to the environment in particular, the reason why the law is toothless and benefiting unscrupulous individuals is that it is not being implemented.
To take an example, most of our Member States have strengthened their criminal weaponry.
This is a positive step.
At the same time, it is worrying to note that in the same Member States, criminal cases involving the environment represent only 2% of the total number of all litigation.
That is why we must use this dissuasive tool at Community level to ensure current regulations are applied, but also so that we are more effective in combating the organised networks which have made pollution their chosen new weapon.
Mr President, criminal law concerning environmental offences is still a bit of a mockery in the Member States.
As a result, it cannot possibly be used to fight the deliberate pollution of our environment effectively.
One of the reasons is that the European directives are not implemented, observed or enforced.
Experience has taught us that the present sanctions for infringements of European and national environmental legislation are inadequate, to put it mildly.
It appears that criminal sanctions are the only instrument that can act as sufficient deterrents in order to ensure that environmental legislation is observed.
European environmental legislation is there for a good reason, since we are facing cross-border effects in the case of, for example, air and water pollution.
In addition, the transportation of waste to locations where waste is not processed in an environmentally responsible manner has many negative implications.
The internal market could also be distorted as a result.
For these reasons, I am endorsing an international approach to environmental crime.
I take the view that the present directive is a suitable and effective instrument in order to achieve this.
This is convincingly supported in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report.
The question remains whether we need a framework Council decision for this.
Finally, I shall be voting in favour of the directive, but I am tempted to vote against the draft framework decision, unless Commissioner Vitorino can convince me that the framework decision is absolutely vital for the entry into force of the directive.
Mr President, the Commission is today proposing a directive which requires the Member States to provide for criminal sanctions to punish a number of particularly serious breaches of Community environmental law.
No one is denying that we must improve our protection of an environment which is suffering increasing degradation and that we must use severe preventive measures.
The problem, in our view, however, is the Commission's intention to use the Community instrument - namely, the directive - based, in this case, on Article 175(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community - to do this.
This Article provides for several joint actions to protect the environment, but it fully respects, in accordance with the general spirit of the Treaties, the autonomy of the Member States in the area of criminal law.
The claim that the right to provide for criminal penalties is implicit in the Community responsibility for environmental protection on the grounds that it is an essential part of its implementation and cannot therefore be separated from it is utterly unfounded.
If criminal penalties are implicitly provided for in Article 175(1), why are they not also implicitly provided for in all the other articles of the Treaty which allow Community law to be drafted in a number of areas?
We will eventually reach a situation where we are disregarding a fundamental principle of the Treaty, namely national competence in the area of criminal law.
And if we disregard this principle, we will edge slightly further towards the concept of a centralised Union which is not what we want.
This does not mean that we must take no action at all - quite the opposite, in fact!
The Danish Presidency presented a draft framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law, which proposed enforcing stricter penalties whilst also respecting the freedom of the Member States to establish their legal basis on the third pillar, which is on the purely intergovernmental part of the Treaty.
This option is much more suitable and this is the option, Mr President, that we should choose.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why are the proposals now put before us so important?
Some Member States have indeed so far neglected to adequately back up Community regulations on environmental protection with the threat of sanctions.
It was thus that the number of violations in the environmental field identified by the Commission rose from 612 in 1999 to 755 in 2000.
As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to add that such cases are increasingly brought to light as a result of petitions being submitted.
It is our EU's citizens themselves who have developed a feel for environmental concerns and who increasingly report such offences or who turn to us in search of help for frequent lack of protection on the part of their Member State.
It would, then, be great if governments could demonstrate something like the same degree of environmental awareness as do their citizens.
In 2000, the Commission took Member States to the European Court of Justice in connection with 39 cases, and so it is time for us to respond on an EU-wide basis.
In doing so, it is not our intention to annul national criminal law - the directive applies only to activities in defence of Community environment law and the regulations by means of which the Member States have hitherto transposed it.
We are laying down only minimum requirements for the protection of the environment through criminal law, so that the retention or creation of stricter safeguards is left to the Member States.
What this directive combats above all is environmental pollution that is attributable to private individuals or corporate bodies, in which respect inducement must incur a penalty in the same way as active behaviour and failure to act where there is a legal duty to do so.
Environmental offences still appear to be regarded as excusable peccadilloes in some Member States.
That must come to an end.
The directive, like the framework decision, is necessary, appropriate, and proportionate to that purpose.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are numerous European directives and regulations that aim to protect the very many diverse aspects of the environment.
We all know, however, that a number of these texts are 'dead letters' due to a lack of effective penalties.
The general public believes that, most of the time, the use of the polluter pays principle to impose financial or material sanctions is insufficient and it is all too aware that these penalties are a poor deterrent given the enormous profits which can be made from the activities that cause the greatest amount of pollution.
We also know that some environmental damage is completely irreversible and cannot be made good.
These considerations therefore justify the adoption by the Member States of provisions to penalise non-observance of European environmental requirements through criminal law.
That is why - together with my fellow European Socialists - I am fully supporting the Commission's initiative.
However, we must not underestimate the main difficulty that we must face here, in other words, the problem of the legal basis.
For my part, I support the point of view that this matter falls squarely within the Union's areas of competence under the first pillar and therefore requires the adoption of a framework directive endorsed by the House.
This is also the meaning of the recommendation adopted by Parliament in November 2001.
It is worth reminding the Council that, had it finalised its draft framework decision under the third pillar, this would have certainly have been against the political will of the European Parliament.
Furthermore - and because we are committed to strengthening environmental legislation by applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions - we must adopt a sound text, which is above all legal argument and which is unlikely to be condemned by the Court of Justice.
This means that we must pay particular attention to the subsidiarity principle and the rules on competence that are laid down by the Treaty.
Although the Community has the power to require the Member States to adopt criminal sanctions if substantial Community standards are breached, it does not, however, have the power to define the types and levels of sanctions to be applied.
That is why we must show particular care when referring to concepts such as extradition, which specify how serious the offences and sentences are.
I am, however, reassured by the wording which was adopted more recently by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
By the same token, the Community has no competence to adopt provisions whose efect is to approximate national criminal provisions.
Therefore, to mention the concept of incitement - which does not exist in all the Member States' legislation - is to seek to bring the national provisions closer together, which, in my view, considerably weakens the legal validity of this text.
Aside from these comments, I would like to reiterate my full support for the adoption of this text and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
We believe that this text sends out a strong political signal in respect of a crime that our fellow citizens regard in an increasingly poor light.
Mr President, following the events of 11 September there was a real international will to streamline and improve systems of extradition in connection with terrorist crime.
Whilst it is true that terrorism may have an environmental impact, for example the release of pathogens or the deliberate poisoning of water, this report goes much further than terrorism.
I agree with Mr Berthu that we must resist attempts to extend the EU's sphere of influence into the judicial area, environmental or otherwise.
I am particularly worried about the amendments which talk about extradition or about the surrender or confiscation of profits as first pillar powers.
The advice of Parliament's legal services is that there is no legal base under Article 175 for this measure.
Why do we pay these lawyers to give us advice and then ignore it?
I am keen to see Member States cooperating to adopt measures under the third pillar to combat environmental crime, for example in common definitions of criminal offences; but the British Conservatives will vote for rejection of this report as amended because it has no legal base.
It talks a lot about subsidiarity in the recitals, but the articles themselves fly in the face of the principle of subsidiarity.
The European Union would be better advised to divert its energies to an area where it does have legal powers to bring errant Member States before the European Court of Justice for non-compliance with existing directives, as Mr von Boetticher suggested earlier.
Mr President, if the Community wants to take seriously the task of protecting the environment, it cannot and must not limit itself to the mere enactment of protection standards.
It must also make it its business to see that the relevant regulations are complied with.
If the machinery of mere sanctions is not sufficient, it must be possible to bring the big stick of the criminal law to bear - only, of course, in important and exceptional cases and with due regard for the division of secondary responsibilities, both in matters of environmental protection and - indeed, above all - in matters of criminal law.
Thus far, almost all the groups in this House approve this Commission proposal and the amendments to it by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which we can warmly thank the House's rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
Some of us fear that this proposal opens the door too wide, paving the way for uniform European law on the environment and perhaps eventually even for a European environmental agency with powers comparable to those of the FBI.
Such concerns are groundless.
None of these things is envisaged.
The right tool has been chosen - a directive to be transposed by the Member States - and an array of amendments ensures that it does not trespass upon the core area of the competence of the State and of the civil and criminal courts.
These are virtually the words used by Amendment No 30, which makes explicit reference to extradition, for example, being envisaged only where there is provision for it in the Member State's own legislation.
By this modus operandi, we are using the right instruments in pursuit of an important Community objective.
The proposals made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy should therefore be approved.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello Finuoli for their excellent work on two texts that cover the same subject: the proposal for a directive and a draft framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law.
Both reports contribute significantly to an important European-Union-level debate.
The extraordinary European Council meeting in Tampere in 1999 agreed in that common definitions, common incriminations and common sanctions should be established in a limited number of sectors of particular importance, and among those sectors it highlighted the environmental crime issue.
As the House will recall - and several Members referred to it - in 2000, Denmark presented an initiative for a framework decision on combating serious environmental crime.
This framework decision is based on the rules of the Treaty on European Union and therefore belongs to the third pillar.
In 2001 the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on the same subject, which is based on Article 175 of the European Community Treaty.
Both proposals pursue the same objective.
They seek to improve the implementation of Community environmental law and have the same starting point: we all recognise that there is a lack of effectiveness in the protection of the environment in our Member States.
Nevertheless, the Commission has taken a more ambitious approach by proposing a directive.
The Commission has pursued this line for a number of reasons.
The Community has, within given competence parameters, the power to regulate behaviours in order to achieve a Community objective.
The Commission has never contested that, as regards concrete criminal sanctions, the Community cannot purport to act in the criminal area in isolation.
However, to the extent that this is necessary for the achievement of Community objectives, the Commission is convinced that the Community can oblige Member States to provide for criminal sanctions where criminal law guarantees that Community law is enforced effectively.
The Commission believes that the sanctions currently established by Member States are not enough and that they do not guarantee full compliance with European Union law.
The Commission is not seeking an interinstitutional conflict.
The key aim of our proposal is to create an additional guarantee of impartiality and to give authorities greater scope for cross-border investigations of environmental crimes.
Mr Blokland, this is the reason why it is necessary to have a framework decision together with the directive.
We can provide for the provision of criminal sanctions in the directive, but the concrete scope of those criminal sanctions must be included in the framework decision. The framework decision has the leverage to allow the judicial authorities of the Member States to pursue cross-border investigations on environmental crimes.
Whether measures concerning criminal law should be based on the rules of the European Union Treaty or of the European Community Treaty, is not just an interesting legal question for European lawyers, it is of fundamental institutional importance, in particular as regards the role and powers of the European Parliament, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice and the legal effects of European legislation in this area.
I can fully subscribe to the arguments that have been put forward by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
I would like to inform you that the Commission has never called into question the fact that matters of judicial cooperation belong to the third pillar.
The draft framework decision is therefore to be seen as a complementary text to the directive.
All the amendments tabled seek to transform the draft framework decision into a complementary instrument to the Commission proposal for a directive.
All the fundamental aspects of the issue are covered by the Commission proposal for a directive.
The Council framework decision will deal with three relevant matters: liability of legal persons, jurisdictional competence and issues concerning extradition and prosecution.
We respect subsidiarity because the framework decision put forward by Denmark very closely follows the Council of Europe Convention concerning environmental crime.
To date, nobody has accused the Council of Europe Convention of being against the principle of subsidiarity.
The reports by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello Finuoli follow exactly this same line.
On behalf of the Commission, I therefore welcome the opinion on the draft framework decision by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
As far as the specific amendments to the proposal for a directive are concerned, I am glad to inform you that the Commission can accept all the amendments suggested with the following exceptions: Amendments Nos 8 and 9, 10, 11 and 13, 19, 20 and 27, 21, 24, 25, 28 and 29.
Overall, I am very grateful for Parliament's significant contribution to improving both texts on which the House is going to vote.
I would like to thank again the rapporteurs, as well as Mr Wuori, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, for their valuable input and support, especially as they all had to work within very tight time limits on a very complex matter.
I hope that the reports will receive across-the-board support tomorrow from this House.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
. (NL) I should like to ask the Commissioner a question.
I gather from the committee meetings that it actually would be possible for the European Commission to accept all the adopted amendments.
I should like to find out from the European Commission tomorrow morning why it does not in fact adopt certain elements.
This marks a slight departure from the usual procedure, but since the question is interesting and if the Commissioner would like to give an answer, I shall give him the floor.
Mr President, I could specifically mention each of the amendments that the Commission cannot accept, but if the honourable Member agrees, I will give her in writing the reasons why we cannot accept the list of amendments I have just read out.
There is at least one amendment for which this is easy to understand: Amendment No 28.
It rejects the Commission's proposal in its entirety.
This is one which, I am sure, the Commission will never accept!
There is your answer.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The next item is the joint debate on:
report (A5-0085/2002) by Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision adopting an action programme for administrative cooperation in the fields of external borders, visas, asylum and immigration (ARGO) [COM(2001) 567 - C5-0553/2001 - 2001/0230(CNS)]
report (A5-0078/2002) by Mr von Boetticher, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Spain and the French Republic with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Decision amending Article 40(1) and (7) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at the common borders [11896/2001 - C5-0563/2001 - 2001/0820(CNS)].
Mr President, the topic of the ARGO proposal is a very interesting one.
However, it struck me during the reading of the Commission proposal that the draftsmen had already covered themselves quite well against any kind of resistance that might be expected from the Council.
In other words, it is my feeling that, in transferring tasks from the third pillar to the first pillar, too many concessions are already being made to technical devices - or even gimmicks - designed to organise things in such a way that the Council bureaucracies still remain in command, while the powers of the European Parliament and the European Commission remain a mere formality.
This is a hesitant attitude which, in my view, befits a Council Secretariat more than a federal government in the making.
The Commission is the guardian of the treaties and of European values and, in my opinion, it should fulfil this task in an assertive manner.
I, with the help of the Parliamentary committee, have tried to strengthen the Community dimension of the proposal on a variety of scores.
We therefore want to give the Commission a boost, especially where the Commission's right of initiative is concerned.
The implementation of ARGO cannot only be a task of national government offices.
It is, for example, very odd that in the case of the enormously successful Odysseus, NGOs etc were able to contribute, but not in the case of its successor, ARGO.
This is why I value the reinforcement of the Commission's right of initiative.
This must be emphatically underscored for, via the Commission, others too can share in the success of ARGO.
In addition, ARGO cannot simply be a case of collaboration by national bureaucracies.
It requires Community guidance, so that the intentions of the directives can be monitored as objectively as possible.
Once again, the Commission is the guardian of the treaties and of everything it has presented in directives.
I was also somewhat annoyed at the way in which both implementation and control are being relinquished, particularly under the pretext of transparency.
In my view, transparency hardly ever has anything to do with clubs of officials, but always with representatives of the people.
Using the word in another way undermines it completely.
That is something we must avoid at all costs.
So, on the basis of transparency, we cannot justify monitoring of the procedure by clubs from the national bureaucracies, while the national parliaments and the European Parliament remain outside.
I would make particular reference to Article 3, point e).
According to normal parliamentary and rule-of-law principles, the key points of the policy should be indicated and drafted by the executive power, the Commission, and should be approved and monitored by the representative of the people, the European Parliament.
After all, we also have powers in the field of the budget.
The implementation details can then be given shape by means of national recommendations, as suggested in the proposal.
Moreover, a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities is needed to establish who monitors what.
In my view, the Commission and the European Parliament should be responsible for the Community aspects, while the national authorities and parliaments should take care of national aspects.
Finally, I should like to say something about the EU's external borders which will very shortly be moved to coincide with the external borders of the underprivileged candidate countries.
In my opinion, ARGO should actually think ahead and should do the groundwork for bringing about communitisation, or common responsibility for the external borders, and preferably on time, for these countries will be joining in only a few years' time.
I have also seen an amendment with which we struggle.
This is the amendment from liberal quarters, which concerns people who are persecuted, but not by government bodies.
In most cases, we only talk about those who are persecuted by their own governments for their political beliefs.
I think that this, in general, is only fair.
If people are persecuted in their own countries by non-government bodies and they can still live safely elsewhere in the country, then they need not necessarily be brought to Amsterdam. They can simply stay in Turkey or Russia.
In addition, we would always argue in favour of regional reception.
Accordingly, I do not endorse the amendment tabled by Baroness Ludford which favours reception in the European Union, via asylum legislation, of those who could also be sheltered elsewhere in their own countries, and we set great store by making this clear.
Finally, the European Parliament is asking the European Commission to adopt an assertive stance, and I hope that the latter will interpret this as a shot in the arm.
Should the Council refuse, there is still time to broadcast the fact at home.
rapporteur. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dismantling of our internal borders and the police cooperation associated with it, as well as the securing of our external border, will be among the greatest challenges to face the European Union in the new century.
Mr Oostlander, in his report, has earned our gratitude by referring in his report to the need for a common immigration policy on the external borders.
My report, though, covers the future development of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement in the area of cross-border surveillance.
Where the internal borders have already been dismantled, the national police are able, after consultation with the police of a neighbouring state, to observe suspects who are active on both sides of the border.
Together with hot pursuit, the instrument of cross-border surveillance has thus to date, offered the most effective option in enforcing the law across borders.
It was only last week that it became clear in Germany just how necessary such an arrangement is, when hostages were taken following a bank robbery and the culprits fled over the border into Poland and then into the Ukraine.
Although there was good cooperation in this instance, an arrangement such as the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement would certainly have made enforcement even easier.
The Council proposal is intended to extend the range of offences liable to cross-border surveillance by adding to them organised fraud, offences in connection with the trafficking in human beings, the laundering of proceeds from organised crime and dealing in radioactive materials.
The question remains in my mind as to why we do not also fall back on the catalogue of terrorist offences that we adopted only a few months ago, which I see as having been a very important decision, and one that we should incorporate into this proposal.
I therefore felt that Mr Buijtenweg's proposal, and the proposals made by other Members, had something positive to add.
We otherwise find ourselves increasingly lost in a thicket of innumerable and different regulations on judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
We will in the future have to work at standard penal frameworks significantly more than we have done in the past.
At the same time, the fact is overlooked that the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement has to date suffered not only from a narrow scope of application, but also from bureaucratic obstacles.
I have therefore proposed a number of systematic clarifications, which met with wide-ranging support in the committee.
We should, then, have the courage to achieve real new developments and move forward with the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.
The number of times that cross-border surveillance has been used has tripled in the time since it was introduced.
The most frequent obstacle, according to the officers engaged in its implementation, is often the lack of a right of arrest.
Officers carrying out surveillance duties on foreign territory have hitherto had to watch impotently as crimes were committed.
They are not permitted to intervene, but can only inform their colleagues with jurisdiction in that state, who tend themselves to be stretched to their full capacity already.
By the time they, in their turn, intervene, the culprits are, as a rule, over the hills and far away.
I therefore propose that it should also be possible for foreign police officers engaged in cross-border surveillance work to detain culprits until police officers of that state arrive, if, firstly, an extraditable offence has been committed and, secondly, if that State's own police are no longer in a position to prevent the offence being committed.
It is no doubt impossible to get our European citizens to understand why foreign police officers may observe, but are unable to intervene when the situation becomes critical and a crime is being committed.
In this respect, we should be significantly better at adapting our laws to the realities of this Europe of ours, which is growing together.
The Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, however, continues to develop, it is my firm conviction that there is a need in a Europe that is growing together, for the European Union to have real police competences.
Within the framework of the Convention, which, as is well known, is looking to reshape the Treaties, we will not only be able to discuss what competences we might have to relocate in the Member States, but we must also specify the areas in which we additionally need primary competences at a European level.
The combating of organised crime, and across borders at that, is one such area, one where we as a Parliament must emphatically make the point that, in order to facilitate control by Parliament and by the public prosecutors, we need a primary police executive for a limited sphere of activity.
Mr President, I believe that the administrative cooperation programmes within the immigration policies and connected areas are of great importance.
Today we are debating the ARGO programme, the ultimate aim of which is to provide a guarantee of homogenous treatment for third-country nationals.
I would like to point out that, in the fields fully or partially covered by this programme, there are very many directives, regulations and other instruments in force, and that this Community acquis must be applied consistently, guaranteeing equal rights to third-country nationals.
There are some extremely important aspects which the programme should take into account: it is essential that we implement actions to prevent illegal immigration, actions against the counterfeiting of documents and essential actions in the field of consular cooperation.
The objective of establishing a common policy in this area is a great challenge and its success largely depends on the Union becoming an area of security and freedom.
In a few years, my country has gone from a country of emigration to a country receiving a large number of immigrants and at the same time is experiencing problems resulting from its status as an external border of the Union.
Although it is not an innovation - since it continues the previous Odysseus programme, with certain new approaches - the ARGO programme is a key element.
An increase in appropriations is a sign that we are taking a serious approach to the effort we must make to ensure that the national administrations act homogeneously, applying best practices.
I agree with the approach of the rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, and I congratulate him, because his report contains proposals which improve the text and make it very clear that the Commission and Parliament must play a leading role in the implementation of the programme.
Mr President, much has been achieved in this field under Commissioner Vitorino, but there is still a very long way to go.
It is therefore right and proper that the objectives of the current Presidency include making progress with the Tampere and Laeken commitments on asylum, immigration and border control policies.
This requirement does not only stem from the present reality of immigration in the Union, but also from the citizens' desire for a genuine political Union.
Mr President, I greatly welcome the ARGO action programme.
It is my firm conviction that it is only through greater cooperation between the authorities of individual States that the existing discrepancies in the application of Community regulations can be removed.
Proof that the inequality of treatment in the Member States has to be done away with is provided above all by the great number of petitions addressed to Parliament.
In recent years there have been 468 petitions alone on the subject of inequality of treatment in this area.
It really is time to do more about this issue.
Another improvement in comparison with the present Odysseus programme is the explicit inclusion of the visa issue, another area that has seen the submission of numerous petitions.
The electronic exchange of data is of particular importance to cooperation across Europe, and I call for the creation of a common database for the whole of Europe, a database that must be accessible to the competent authorities in the Member States - if need be, to third countries as well - and also to the competent agencies of the European institutions.
In this context, the protection of privacy and the confidentiality of information must be safeguarded unconditionally and to the fullest extent.
Alongside that, we must ensure that the authorities in the individual States provide information within an appropriate period of time when asked to do so by the Committee on Petitions.
This obligation is the sole protection for the petitioner's legitimate expectations.
Delays in passing on information, which have occurred up to now, cause petitioners unacceptable detriment, something which can, in my view, be prevented only by the Committee on Petitions being enabled, in cases of urgency, to bring negative conduct by the authorities to the public's notice.
Bad publicity is no doubt something that every public body wants to avoid.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what these reports and this action programme show is that the EU is on the right road, the road towards being a union of security, and is demonstrating that security begins at the border.
If we want our internal borders to be open, our external borders need surveillance systems that work, and we also need compensatory elements along the lines of cross-border surveillance.
That is underlined here with broad strokes of the pen.
It is for this purpose that we need the new ARGO action programme.
This is not only because the money from Odysseus has been used up. It is also because it must be our objective to build up and create an equal level of security on all our external borders, including those we will have in the future, in order, on the one hand, to safeguard ourselves against illegal immigration, organisations that traffic in human beings, and international organised crime, and on the other, to have available to us opportunities for monitoring, assistance and legal immigration and also for preparation for the grant of asylum.
It seems to me particularly significant that such measures as the establishment of unitary standards for the use of information technology are highlighted, or that emphasis is laid on the fact that, at the end of the day, we are endeavouring to create common core training, that is, to achieve a common standard of training and qualifications.
We should also be trying to tackle our future need for border security operations composed of experts from several Member States.
I consider it significant that - as formerly with Odysseus - the possibility is envisaged of the candidate countries also being able to participate in the programme, whereby we are guaranteeing that they will be optimally prepared for greater security in the greater European Union that we share.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to concentrate on the ARGO programme and begin by thanking Mr Oostlander for a good report.
At the committee reading, a number of proposals went through which further strengthened the programme's common dimension.
Mr President, it cannot be emphasised enough how important it is for the EU to acquire a common approach when it comes to asylum issues.
It is important, then, for the administrative routines to operate similarly everywhere.
Those who try to come to Europe must be treated respectfully, humanely and equally.
They must not be shunted like mere objects between the various Member States, as unfortunately often happens at present.
Events in recent years indicate very clearly the need for common programmes and common funding within the sphere of asylum.
Just as other MEPs have stated, there is a need for education, the exchange of experiences and the development of common practice.
The candidate countries, which will form the EU's new external borders, are also important in this context, of course.
Unfortunately - and this, I think, is something that deserves to be pointed out - the EU's refugee and asylum policy has in recent years been characterised mostly by directly opposite tendencies.
The Member States have often acted short-sightedly and without proper consideration, with catastrophic human suffering as a consequence.
Sometimes, the thought arises as to whether certain Member States have competed in setting aside humanitarianism and the rule of law.
As Mr Oostlander pointed out, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled an amendment concerning a further definition of what precisely constitutes a refugee under the Geneva Convention.
The latter certainly constitutes the mainstay of asylum and refugee policy, but it makes sense to adapt one's practice to changes in the real state of affairs.
As Mr Evans pointed out, experience in recent years has shown that this is so.
Refugees must be able to seek protection both from the State and from persecution in their own countries, and a further definition is therefore needed.
We therefore propose such a definition, and we hope that this House can also accept our proposal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ARGO programme is supposed to ensure that the EU's external borders continue to be secure against intruders.
The model for this fortification of the EU's borders is Germany's system of bulkheads on its border with Poland.
This strategy comprises well-trained police officers, high-tech apparatus, the efficient cooperation of the various authorities, and, to an increasing extent, the involvement of private security companies and informers among the population. I know you will think that crazy, but I will tell you what I think of it in a moment.
The ARGO programme is meant to ensure the establishment of the same level of fortification on the EU's new eastern border prior to removal of controls on the newly-created internal borders in accordance with the Schengen Agreement.
It is no secret that apologists for a European policy of repression see this as the nucleus of a European border police force.
The action programme aims at the creation of effective bulwarks against the migration into the EU of unwanted refugees, who can scarcely find a way in without the help of smugglers.
Greater sealing-off will - as is intended - lead to higher prices being charged in the market for this sort of assistance and make it more hazardous.
All the stances taken up in favour of refugees but against people-traffickers are, at best hypocritical and at worst help to close off borders with fatal results.
The planned amendments to the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement are also in line with the ARGO programme's objectives.
The re-armament of the police on the external borders is accompanied by ever more competences for the police in the interior.
Where, as in this case, it is cooperation by the repressive authorities that is at issue, it is interesting that the role played by borders is relegated to the background.
In principle, the planned amendment of the Schengen Agreement envisages nothing other than to hand over more powers to foreign police officers in cases involving cross-border surveillance.
In future, it will not only be suspects that will be under observation, but also their friends.
The initiative is therefore pursuing the European government's objective of making a priority of the implementation of repressive security measures rather than the guaranteeing and securing of human rights and freedoms.
Mr von Boetticher and the Commission thus furnish a further example of the folly of believing that security can be created by more repressive police action.
Both initiatives thus contribute to a development that directly leads from a neoliberal state characterised by competition to a police state bearing the stamp of authoritarianism and an obsession with security.
They represent a further step on that road - the road that leads towards a European panopticon.
Mr President, a few comments on the Oostlander report.
I too would like to thank the rapporteur, but I feel I have to express a few comments on the subject of the right to asylum, a humanitarian principle that no civilised person could fail to support but whose bounds must be very clearly set if we are to avoid the severe, real danger of it being used for the totally unacceptable purpose of facilitating the entry of illegal immigrants into European Union territory.
The document before us states that it aims to avoid asylum applicants being moved between States within the Union, but we harbour some doubts as to whether this can be achieved with minimal standards such as those contained in the proposal, considering, not least, the right accorded to the States to provide greater assistance for asylum applicants.
In this regard, I would like to point out two of the proposal's shortcomings.
Firstly, recourse to the judicial authority is provided for in many cases for the concession or refusal of subsidies, housing, healthcare etc., and this means making an infinite number of people dependent on state welfare and binding the host State by law to providing facilities which, in many cases, it does not even provide for its own citizens.
Secondly, application of the principle of the free movement of the applicant and their family will then clearly lead to asylum applicants having less chance of being granted asylum and being more likely to attempt to cover their tracks, with the number of untraceable illegal immigrants increasing as a result.
These are serious, practical problems.
In effect, many rules treat the situation of the applicant as if this status had already been ascertained, for example by regulating access to longer-term activities such as professional training.
To sum up, the effect of the document needs to be modified so that it does not become a hindrance instead of being a directive providing practical, effective protection of people who have the right to asylum.
This is what we fear, that it might become an obstacle to preventing illegal immigration, which is a serious, disturbing phenomenon.
Mr President, the proposal for the ARGO action programme falls short on crucial points.
It is, though, to be welcomed that the proposal for Odysseus' successor programme allocates funds, among other things, to improving the training of officials, but what use is a programme of training, exchange and cooperation if no change is made to the overall conditions that have prevailed to date?
The situation cannot go on in which asylum seekers are turned back at the EU's external borders by the relevant border authorities, as they have been hitherto.
The situation cannot go on in which they run the risk of going down a chain of deportation and ending up back in the country where they were persecuted.
As the Commission proposal for a Council Directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States envisaged, their applications for asylum must be examined by an independent authority in the Member State in question.
Asylum seekers must be able to have recourse to the law when administrative decisions go against them.
That is the least that we can expect of a state founded on the rule of laws such as our own.
Let us not forget that border officials can be as well-trained as you like, but all that good training is of no use if they are entrusted with tasks that cannot but overwhelm them, such as deciding on the welfare or otherwise of asylum seekers.
Mr President, cross-border surveillance is a strictly regulated procedure, which enables the police officers of one Member State who are keeping a suspect under surveillance, to continue their work, if necessary, by crossing a border into another Member State, having made a request to the latter for assistance.
The draft decision before us today on the proposal by Belgium, Spain and France improves this procedure, notably by adding to the list of offences which justify its use.
The responsible committee of the European Parliament is also proposing to add terrorism to this list, which seems wise.
We are, however, somewhat perplexed by the parliamentary report.
By tabling other proposals for amendments such as that seeking to extend the right of surveillance to some private locations or to allow police officers, in some cases, to bypass surveillance and arrest suspects, the committee responsible appears to be giving the impression that it wants to transform cross-border surveillance into the beginnings of a right to multilateral intervention within the framework of a Union that has no internal borders.
This kind of move must obviously be rejected, Mr President, as it would, in time, cause confusion as regards responsibilities and the disadvantages would be far greater than any anticipated benefits.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Oostlander and Mr von Boetticher, for their excellent reports.
The first proposal before us today is a proposal for a financing programme that aims to promote cooperation between the national administrations responsible for implementing Community rules under Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty.
The ARGO programme will supplement the legislative initiatives that have already been launched or are due to be launched on the basis of Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty.
I agree with Mrs Kaufmann in recognising that the programme must be examined along with the legislation, and I hope that we will be able to agree on legislation.
However, we must also acknowledge that in areas such as these, European legislation and its transposal into national law are not enough to harmonise practices.
A very important area is the practices that the national administrations follow when they are monitoring the external borders, issuing visas or examining asylum applications and immigration issues.
As several of you pointed out, the ARGO programme will replace the Odysseus programme.
However, there are considerable differences between the two that need to be very clearly defined.
First of all, ARGO is a programme for administrative cooperation.
That is why it focuses in greatest detail on the national administrations and the services responsible for implementing Community legislation based on Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty.
It is wrong to claim that these are simply programmes for cooperation between police forces because, in the area of asylum and immigration, there are extremely important tasks which fall to the civilian administration services of the Member States.
In this case - and I must stress this, as it may be an issue on which Mr Oostlander and myself do not agree - the national administrations are the key players in this programme.
Indeed, when we have reached agreement on legislation, the national administrations of the Member States will have primary responsibility for applying the European legislation.
However, this programme does not rule out the national administrations which receive ARGO funding being able to delegate responsibilities for implementing the programmes in question to non-governmental organisations which propose implementing projects and programmes on the basis of the programme's objectives.
The legal basis of ARGO not only establishes general objectives, it also defines more precise objectives in each of the following areas: external borders, visas, asylum and emigration.
ARGO envisages new forms of action such as the definition of better practices, techniques for collating, analysing and disseminating information and actions in third countries.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, as regards the monitoring of external borders, the Schengen acquis was split, within the framework of the European Union, with important aspects coming under the first pillar and also important aspects coming under the third pillar.
Hence the difficulty in correctly distinguishing between the Community aspect and the intergovernmental cooperation aspect, a distinction that is necessary if we are to target them properly.
In any case, I would like to thank Mr Oostlander for the support he has given to the Commission's proposal and to assure him that we can support, in spirit, many of the amendments that have been proposed, particularly those that seek to strengthen the role of the Community and those seeking to supplement or to strengthen the administrative cooperation objectives.
Our priority is to ensure that the Council adopts the programme as soon as possible, so that the Commission can, this year even, launch the procedures necessary for the implementation of the programme and the proper implementation of the budget allocated for this year.
With regard to the second proposal, which relates to the amendment to Article 40 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, an amendment proposed by Belgium, Spain and France, its objective, as Mr von Boetticher points out, is to grant, under certain conditions, the police force of the Member States the right to continue to keep under discreet surveillance a person suspected of being involved in an extraditable offence if that suspect crosses a border.
I hope that this stresses the improvement - which I believe is significant and practical - that this amendment represents for the work of the law enforcement services.
As the rapporteur has noted, cross-border observation is an instrument to maintain public order and safety which, with the removal of common borders between Schengen countries, will become extremely important.
I would also like to stress that, whilst the proposed change will facilitate enquiries, it will not change the legal framework applying to them, since the national authorities will, of course, only be able to act within their own national legislation, as well as that provided for by the Schengen Convention.
I am sorry, but we have a long way to go before we become a totalitarian State.
To sum up, the two initiatives and proposals before us and on which considerable work has been done by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs should enable a great deal of progress to be made in areas which I believe are crucial for the area of freedom, security and justice which is gradually taking shape.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0081/2002) by LuÃ­s Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (COM(2001) 447 - C5-0403/2001 - 2001/0182(CNS)).
Mr President, when someone knocks on Europe's door, fleeing violence, war or civil war, that person is a refugee under the terms of the Geneva Convention and is applying for asylum in the name of fundamental human rights.
That person cannot, in all honesty, be told that he or she has got the wrong street or the wrong house and that it is not here but somewhere else, somewhere in another country, whose name someone will give them, if they insist and insist and if they ask...
It is to put an end to these and other situations that we frequently see in Europe that the Commission has drafted this timely proposal for a regulation, a type of road map for the right to asylum, which states, for each situation and specific case, who must provide an answer and where, which country must examine an application for asylum and, when all is said and done, what door will open to the anguish of a refugee who wants only to see someone with whom they can speak.
The very nature of the problem explains the scope of the initiative.
We will not be resolving the entire asylum issue, but we are certainly taking a step forwards.
As rapporteur, I take pride in having done everything I could - and my conscience is, therefore, clear - to ensure that this initiative would be approved, supporting the Commission in the fight that it will still have to engage in with some Member States. Not many, I hope.
I therefore wish to thank the Members of this House and my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and most particularly and with great feeling, Mrs Eva Klamt, the draftsman, without whose effort and understanding it would have been extremely difficult for us today to hope for the approval of this Commission initiative.
Thank you very much, Mrs Klamt.
The fact is, Mr President, that we have been lawlessly adrift in a sea of good intentions.
There have certainly been laws, ratified by those countries that want to, and which apply in some places and not in others; some doors open and others close, and it is this murky area in which a little law is mixed up with no law at all that gives rise to dubious dealings, tricks, skilful manoeuvres and escape from the authorities.
And this is how illegal immigration and the organised networks start, with the growth of mafias and crime, involvement in which is inexcusable but which is only possible because States, consisting of well-intentioned individuals, have never agreed on minimum standards for actually making one State responsible for examining an asylum application.
The Commission proposal is a brave one.
First of all, it guarantees that an application will actually be examined; it will prevent the confusion caused by multiple applications and refugees being left in limbo, and subjects these laws to its own vigilance and to monitoring by the Court of Justice.
Basically, it is grounded in the principle that each Member State is responsible for the illegal entry or stay of a candidate for the right to asylum in its territory, thereby forcing each State to improve its mechanisms for combating illegal immigration.
This responsibility, based on objective facts, can only be overridden by additional criteria concerning the importance attached to family group unity.
Consequently, minors accompany the asylum application of the adult and unaccompanied minors are transferred, according to the wording that I propose, to a State where they have any relative willing and able to look after them.
Similarly, entry or residence criteria can be dispensed with in order to guarantee the unity of the family group when one member has already applied for asylum in a given Member State.
Finally, Mr President, what we are looking at in the initial proposal and in the feasible amendments, and whatever the result of the vote on these may be, is the broadest possible concept of the family: it covers marriage and de facto unions, where the law of any State recognises such arrangements.
This would eliminate discrimination on the grounds of gender, recognising a family link for elderly relatives and minors and extending it to other children and other relatives where it can be proved that they lived with or were dependent on a successful applicant in the country of origin.
And also, for humanitarian reasons to do with health or other matters, the asylum applicant can, according to the wording approved in my report, go to any relative as long as the State in which the application is made accepts this.
Mr President, the important thing is to ensure that the application for asylum and the refugee who makes this application are given an answer and that the European legal system serves the rights of applicants and Member States' obligations and prevents a lack of legislation leading to an upsurge in racism and xenophobia.
This initiative ensures that we will meet these three objectives and, therefore, I believe that it will be endorsed.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur. Next, I would like to point out, in a spirit of realism, that the Member States have often chosen to forget a very simple but obvious fact: that throughout history, no matter what the geographical circumstances, no barrier has been able to prevent people in search of refuge finding a way to cross the border or the barrier itself.
I feel, however, that this report does justice to the problem and seeks, first and foremost, to find a sufficiently sound solution, not least with a view to finding a better alternative to the Dublin Convention itself.
This is therefore an important contribution which will undeniably improve on the regulation.
I have to say that, with regard to the current situation, the report seeks to find a balance between two conflicting requirements: on the one hand, it attempts to prevent abuse of asylum procedures and, on the other, it attempts to provide effective access to the procedures for determining the refugee status of those who genuinely need it.
At the same time, there are new criteria and new derogations that we welcome, aimed particularly at preserving family group unity in one Member State.
The same applies to the responsibility placed on a Member State which does not take effective action against the illegal presence of third-country citizens on its territory, making liability equivalent to that of a Member State which fails to control its borders properly.
We therefore feel that the Council must introduce a 'fair and efficient' asylum procedure and a 'clear and workable' method including these new provisions on the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application.
Lastly, we welcome, in particular, the fact that Article 27 of the regulation, Mr President, bans any discrimination based on sex, race, skin colour or even age, a criterion whose introduction we feel to be necessary and particularly progressive.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commission for their balanced and pragmatic proposal and Mr Marinho for his report and for his willingness to cooperate in a constructive manner.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs adopted this report by a large majority and thereby confirmed the rapporteur in his views.
The Commission proposal represents a perceptible advance on the Dublin Convention and is thus an important step towards the establishment of a common European asylum system.
The most important innovations are:
Firstly, the emphasis laid on the responsibility of the individual Member States when such Member States permit persons who have entered them illegally to remain in their national territory.
Secondly, the adaptation of the procedural time limits to the time limits for the granting and revocation of refugee status, ensuring that applications for asylum can be processed speedily.
Thirdly, the introduction of provisions aimed at maintaining the unity of the asylum seeker's family.
The procedures for determining which Member State is responsible are also intended to serve the purpose of sharing burdens fairly.
The making of the application in a specified Member State must not, therefore, create a fait accompli; that is, it must not determine responsibility.
This requirement is taken into account by the measures intended to simplify procedures and simultaneously speed them up, while maintaining the principle of responsibility, as does the planned less onerous burden of proof when determining which Member State is responsible.
It was thanks to a compromise with the rapporteur that we in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs were able to adopt a report that disregarded impractical and unacceptable amendments.
This opens up the possibility of the Commission, Parliament and the Council finding together a rational way of deciding on the responsibility of Member States in asylum matters.
The excluded amendments, which envisaged a widening of the family circle and the deletion of essential parts of the Regulation, were now reintroduced.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejects these amendments, particularly as regards their indiscriminate extension of the family circle, which would include, for example, dependant family members outside the nuclear family.
In the same way, when we vote tomorrow, we should give a clear rebuff to the idea of deleting essential parts of the Regulation.
Let me repeat: the Commission proposal is realistic and balanced.
It offers an array of improvements in comparison with the Dublin Convention.
There are no grounds for trying to recast this draft in a form that will, at the end of the day, benefit neither the applicants for asylum nor the Member States.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the content of his report and the way in which he has worked and established a dialogue with other groups in the House, which I believe has been positive, and I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its initial proposal.
We must remember that we are saying to refugees that only one country of the European Union is going to consider their application for asylum.
This is equivalent to saying that fourteen of the fifteen European countries are not going to appear on the relatively short list of democratic and prosperous countries in which a persecuted citizen can legitimately request asylum.
I believe that this gives the countries of the EU and the Union itself the serious responsibility to offer, in exchange, firm guarantees of security to these people in various respects, which must take the form of respect for them and their families, the rapid adoption of a decision which is favourable to asylum seekers, the prohibition of all forms of discrimination and guaranteed access to justice for those people, with a view to referring that decision to the State responsible in order that their case may be re-examined.
I also believe that this proposal is a necessary step, which requires others in order to make full sense.
I believe that we can state that this House must support this proposal so that progress can be made in the direction indicated previously.
We can see that the European Council has problems making progress with this harmonised and European asylum policy and that it finds it difficult to take these steps and I believe it is very important that tomorrow this House gives strong support to the proposal in the way I have indicated so that, amongst all of us, we can urge the Council to assume the responsibility it accepted in Tampere.
Therefore, as the rapporteur has said, my group and I are going to ask for this report to be approved with the amendments which have already been approved in committee and with a few of those that will be tabled in plenary.
Mr President, Commissioner, last week I visited Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Serbska.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is only ten years since the atrocious killing and massacring of innocent people was begun in the middle of a Europe which we had all promised would never again see mass graves containing desecrated corpses.
That was not to be the case.
Mass graves are being found today and the remains of corpses identified.
I myself saw the remains of 500 people laid out in a line in industrial premises.
Mr President, never before have the EU's shortcomings been more evident.
When the refugees began streaming in, the EU acted slowly and was completely powerless to act.
What was lacking was a common approach.
Mr Marinho's report, like the Commission's proposal, is therefore extremely important.
I want to praise the rapporteur for the work he has put in and for the sensitivity he has shown.
We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party accept the basic principle contained in the proposal, relating to the way in which asylum seekers are to be regarded, how the issue is to be dealt with and what exceptions there are.
However, we wish to make the rules more predictable and to increase the consideration given to the wishes of the individual.
A number of the proposals were also very properly accepted by the committee.
Allow me to mention a number of important points.
Increased account must be taken of individual wishes concerning the country of asylum.
These are people we are dealing with!
The rules determining which country is responsible must be characterised by the rule of law and by predictability.
In the case of an asylum seeker who is still a minor, a person other than a relative and who has close links with the minor must be able to obtain custody of the child if it is in the latter's interests.
The country of asylum responsible can therefore be decided in terms of such factors.
It must be possible for asylum seekers who have family members in a particular Member State to have their applications examined in that country.
Appeals concerning which country is responsible for examining the application must have a delaying effect so that asylum seekers are not moved to another Member State during the waiting period.
It must only be possible to release personal data concerning asylum seekers to the Member States concerned and not to all the Member States, as proposed by the Commission.
Allow me to highlight especially Amendment No 12, which Mrs Klamt also touched upon.
It is our view that partners and cohabitees, irrespective of gender, should be counted as family members in Member States which treat unmarried and married couples equally.
The Commission is unclear about this point, and clarification is needed in this area.
It is my hope that the House will be able to support this proposal tomorrow.
In conclusion, I want to put a direct question to Commissioner Vitorino.
In my view, the type of abuses that go on at Sangatte near the Channel Tunnel, with people shunted about and responsibility divided between different Member States, should be rendered impossible by the proposal you have produced.
What are you doing to ensure right now that there can be no repetition of the events at Sangatte?
What are you doing, in conjunction with London and Paris, to ensure that this proposal can become a reality straight away?
Mr President, part of the answer to that last question would be that, if there was a legal method of entering the UK to claim asylum, a lot of the problems would be solved at Sangatte.
In dealing with the Marinho report before us, however, my group has criticised the Dublin Convention for a very long time for a number of reasons, not least because to us it mixes immigration controls with the claiming of asylum, and the two things are not necessarily the same at all.
We are well aware that people choose a particular Member State as their country of destination for a large number of reasons.
It may be a country they have heard of.
They might have family links there.
There may already be a considerable community of people from their own region in the area.
The country might have a reputation for dealing fairly with asylum seekers rather than treating them as potential criminals and keeping them restricted.
It might offer work opportunities.
It might be because of former colonial ties.
There might be a language link.
There are all sorts of reasons.
There is extensive research showing that asylum seekers settle better, enjoy better mental health, acquire the language of the country of residence more quickly - especially the children - if a number of the above conditions apply.
But we know that asylum seekers generally want to contribute to the societies that admit them and do not want to feel like unwanted jetsam condemned to live on charity and tolerance.
Positive motivation, then, is extremely important to a successful asylum policy.
For us, Dublin seemed to be based on the premise that the first 'safe' country was good enough.
It was also based on the premise that the government then had a duty to deal with those asylum seekers and effectively keep them there.
We know that there have been all sorts of problems, both administratively and in terms of human rights, as a result of the Dublin Convention.
The new proposals at least recognise the importance of the family, even if the criteria for definition of 'family', does not go far enough; my group has tabled amendments because we do not believe that the nuclear family is the only viable model.
However, the proposals are still based on the premise that a Member State is somehow answerable to all other Member States for their failures to control entry and borders.
Not surprisingly, countries with extensive sea or land borders close to countries of origin will be the major points of entry and are thus expected to bear the major responsibility for asylum seekers, bailed out presumably by the refugee fund.
My group does not agree with this approach which is why we have tabled amendments designed to de-link immigration controls from dealing with asylum applications.
If we are really fulfilling the duty that Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ spoke of and we are creating a high-standard, effective and fair common asylum policy - which sometimes I doubt - then the positive factors determining the country where the application is lodged can only act in an additional positive way.
If we are not creating that, then people should have the right to choose where they seek asylum.
Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the Commission proposals and support the rapporteur and the report as it was voted on in the committee.
However, I find the amendments tabled by the Greens and others absolutely unacceptable and counterproductive.
If accepted, they would bring about the rejection of the whole report, and so I hope that it will be the original report that will be supported, with the Commission proposals.
I will also tell you why in a few points: You Greens want to extend the concept of the family as far as it will go, far beyond the nuclear family and to the point of including de facto family members and friends.
By doing this, you will only promote immigration.
What this is about is help for refugees.
You also want to introduce options for applicants for asylum, so that they will be able, as it were, to decide for themselves in which Member State the procedure is to be dealt with.
By this, you are offending against the principle that the first Member State with which the application is lodged is to be responsible for examining it and the principle that burdens should be shared, something that we can achieve indirectly, and you would end up exacerbating the situation in countries which are, in any case, already struggling with the greatest integration problems.
You also want to do away with the instruments provided by the Commission and the rapporteur to combat abuses in situations involving false or invalid documents, expired visas and so on.
In doing that, you would not only be accepting abuses, but even promoting them and, with that, promoting non-compliance with existing legal standards.
Under no circumstances could we accept that.
If, in addition to that, you make all appeals have suspensive effect, you would thereby be hindering speedy and sure decisions and good solutions.
In this House, as in the committee, I can definitely tell you once again that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support the Commission proposals and those made by the rapporteur.
If, though, your amendments get a majority, or if even just one of them does, we intend to vote down the whole report.
Mr President, I wish first to pay tribute to the work put in by our rapporteur, who has made very great efforts to live up to the ideal of optimising the EU's asylum policy.
His guiding concern was, unmistakably, the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice.
He has taken very seriously the task enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I only hope that we will all do likewise.
I think it right to speak at length about the Member States' responsibility in receiving applications for asylum and about which Member State should process them.
All this not only benefits the EU's citizens, but also the refugees, who then know exactly where they stand.
The increased threat of terror and the general rise in movements of refugees worldwide mean that we must at last give people a clear picture of what possibilities there are for them in the European Union.
It is therefore right that we should give careful thought in this draft Regulation to what is meant by families joining their head, and make this quite clear.
It is also very much the right thing to help bring families together, and it is important that this should be done.
Both these things contribute to a coherent policy on asylum.
We want every State to have the right to act in accordance with its national legislation, but this is not meant to stop anyone learning from other Member States.
We want to share in granting asylum and preventing abuses.
Not everything has to be the same from one State to another; we should be learning from one another how to protect refugees and how abuses can be prevented.
Another reason for us now to be discussing the apportionment of responsibilities among Member States is that the first candidates for accession will be joining the EU in the foreseeable future.
One thing is clear, namely that the EU must, as far as possible, have its policies on internal affairs, asylum, and immigration well in hand before the new members join.
We cannot face the new members with an incomplete asylum policy.
Much in the accession process will be difficult enough for them.
It is now, even before the first new States join us, that we need to create rules across the EU on precisely what Member States' responsibilities are towards refugees.
If we manage to get all the Member States to adhere to common rules, our work on this report will have given the project of an enlarged European Union and a common judicial area greater certainty and more success.
This proposal for a Council regulation gives us the chance to evaluate our experience of the Dublin Convention and let it have an influence on new legislation.
I hope we will all succeed in doing that.
Mr President, it is certainly necessary to improve the workings of the Dublin Convention and to transpose it into European Community law, with European Court and Parliament oversight.
We must stop the problem of refugees 'in orbit'.
Asylum seekers are not parcels to be passed around: they are real human beings who may or may not be entitled to humanitarian protection but, in any case, need to be treated with respect and dignity.
Most will be exhausted, many disorientated, frightened or frail.
It bears repeating time after time that the chief responsibilities of Member States are to process asylum claims expeditiously, to rapidly integrate those who are accepted and to remove those who are not.
This does not mean cutting corners since cases decided sloppily or unfairly risk taking longer in the end because of appeals.
This is not, in turn, to challenge the right of claimants to make appeals.
One of my group's amendments would make appeals have suspensive effect.
If they do not, and the claimant is transferred, they will not be able to keep in contact with the procedure or their lawyer, which is unfair.
My Group also aims to further strengthen the provisions on family unity.
One of our amendments would give greater rights of reunion to unmarried, including same-sex, couples.
We are also sympathetic to the amendment from the Green Group, although I fear that this has less chance than ours.
There must be further progress by a convergence of family law developments at national level, and EU immigration and free movement rules, in recognising unmarried partners as family, especially, but not only, those in registered partnerships.
I very much hope the Socialist Group will support the very reasonable ELDR position.
I understand the motivation of those wanting individual choice of the applicant to be the determinant of where an asylum claim is processed, rather than the State responsible for entry.
But, alas, it cannot be feasible until there is a fully functioning common asylum and immigration system in which there are no artificial distortions influencing that choice.
It also confuses asylum with immigration.
The asylum system is based on urgently needing protection.
If it is determined exclusively by choice of destination, we risk ultimately undermining its integrity.
This new proposal has a clause which would oblige a Member State to take responsibility where it had knowingly tolerated people illegally on its territory for at least two months.
This would cover the Sangatte Centre near Calais.
I urge the French Government to recognise the logic and imperative of this, though I understand they are resisting it in the Council.
We are going to have to face up sooner rather than later to the need to have an immigration route as well as an asylum route into the EU, as well as tackling the traffickers.
But the situation at Sangatte cannot be allowed to fester.
The Centre cannot be closed: that would be inhumane and just displace the problem.
But it is disruptive and dangerous and the UK needs to recognise that this is its problem too.
There must be a bilateral solution, urgently required, supported by the new Dublin II but reached through pragmatic bilateral agreement.
Mr President, we must be aware that this is a proposal for a directive which only establishes minimum application criteria. That means that its greatest merit is certainly the great flexibility it gives the Member States in allowing them to apply part of their national legislation and part of the Community legislation.
However, it could be said that this directive is a case of shutting the door after the horse has bolted.
In many countries, particularly Italy, indeed, this type of action has been in use for a long time now in the face of what is in fact a genuine immigration crisis.
In this regard, I feel that, once again in a debate of this kind, not everyone has a clear understanding of the distinction between the three types of asylum application and therefore between the persons lodging the applications: in actual fact, there are political exiles, refugees fleeing emergency situations and the usual immigrants seeking work.
Clearly, these are three very different cases and the solutions needed to regulate these situations will therefore also be very different.
This directive also refers to ARGO and Odysseus: two programmes, father and son, with the same goal, programmes which combine - successfully I am glad to say - legality with a rigorous approach.
I have heard some decidedly excessive views expressed in this debate.
Someone even went so far as to say that we could move towards a police state.
Quite frankly, this is not so: I heard no such fear was expressed in the debate before that.
However, it must be said that if a rigorous approach means not a police state but, first and foremost, a guarantee of the proper implementation of procedures for granting asylum; if being rigorous means first and foremost distinguishing between irregular immigrants and illegal immigrants and criminals, distinguishing between honest immigrants and drug smugglers and slave traders, well then, if this is the case, I welcome the rigorous approach, a carefully considered rigorous approach; not least because the well-meaning people have nothing to fear from us being rigorous and asylum seekers will receive only a welcome, understanding and help.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of asylum has come to occupy a prominent place on the political agenda of the European Union and of its Member States, especially following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which conferred new competences on the Community, opening up new possibilities for action on a European scale.
The proposal that we are debating here today is part of the dynamic of establishing a common European asylum system based on the full and broad application of the Geneva Convention, which is intended to create a clear, more simple and workable method, for determining which State is responsible for examining an application for asylum submitted in a Member State by a third-country national in the context of an asylum process that is intended to be fair and effective.
The proposal lays down innovative provisions that are designed to end a process that has proven to be extremely slow, by stipulating shorter deadlines for procedures and making them more effective by improving cooperation between Member States, attempting in this way to create a system that is fair and humane for asylum seekers, which is of the utmost importance, not only for asylum seekers but also for the Member States themselves. Also by creating a uniform set of regulations, directly applicable throughout the European Union, thereby guaranteeing that each and every request for asylum is actually examined, and at the same time preventing multiple applications being made in a number of States.
I welcome the efforts made by the rapporteur, LuÃ­s Marinho and by Eva Klamt, who have sought to produce a text that is balanced and which fulfils the stated objective.
What is needed now is for us all to work together to prevent woolly amendments being adopted that could negate the balance of the text reached in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Mr President, it is very easy to feel powerless faced with the asylum situation we have in Europe.
It is easy to feel powerless faced with the fact that so many people need this protection, but also faced with the inability we have in many quarters to integrate asylum seekers and immigrants into our Member States.
That is a very important question, and I therefore wish to begin by thanking my colleague, Mr Marinho, for all the work he has put into this report.
I also wish, of course, to thank the Commission for its proposal.
I want to emphasise what Mr Marinho said about how important it is for the Member States to take this issue seriously now and to exchange words for action.
The proposal concerning responsibility for asylum applications is a small, but very important, step in developing a common asylum policy in the EU.
In spite of the Schengen Agreement and the removal of borders within this area, there are big differences between the Member States when it comes to the ways in which refugees are received and to asylum seekers' ability to obtain residence documents.
It is therefore especially important to asylum seekers themselves that there should be a shared approach to receiving refugees and to processing applications.
It is therefore gratifying that the EU can now go a step further than the Dublin Convention did.
Shorter processing times reduce the risk of lengthy waiting periods, with all that these entail in terms of uncertainty for asylum seekers.
The proposals for strengthening the rights of children when it comes to their own families are especially important.
Children who are left alone to flee from war and oppression must receive all the support we can give them.
An important contribution to this is the extended concept of the family which we now have the opportunity to take a decision on.
Finally, I want to point out that it is important that we have respect for the choices people make as to their family circumstances so that, in this area too, we try to put different forms of partnership and cohabiting on an equal footing.
Mr President, it is important that the excellent Dublin Convention, which is the basis of the proposal for a regulation, should be updated so that it corresponds with the Treaty of Amsterdam.
There may, however, be a danger that we will not be improving the situation, but destroying what has been achieved.
There have to be clear rules regarding which Member State is responsible for examining any given asylum application.
When dealing with applications it is important that the deadline is as short as possible.
The more efficient the European system is, the better for all concerned.
It is not right that genuine asylum seekers should have to wait around for a long time for their applications to be dealt with solely on account of bureaucracy.
Member States must be able to handle applications for asylum and requests for reception more efficiently.
One month is the absolute maximum in humane terms.
The custody of minors is not always a straightforward matter if the biological parents are unable to take charge themselves.
It is not necessarily a good thing for the child either if just any relative can volunteer to take charge of him or her.
This could also aid unlawful entry and thus also jeopardise the interests of genuine asylum seekers.
The concept of custody must be clearly defined.
There are great differences between the south and the north regarding the notion of family.
What is the nuclear family?
Is it the parents and children, or all possible relatives extending as far as second cousins?
The debate on the directive on family unity is still continuing; it is therefore unreasonable to define what constitutes a family separately in each directive.
The directive on family unity must be swiftly implemented.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation to replace the Dublin Convention with an instrument of Community law is, as laid down by Article 63 of the Treaty, part of a series of measures requested at Tampere and which includes, in addition to this regulation, three proposals for directives on, respectively, common minimum standards on asylum procedures, common minimum conditions on the reception of asylum seekers, and the admission criteria to refugee status or on subsidiary forms of protection and the content of the refugee status.
Before these proposals were drawn up, broad consultation was carried out, on the basis of the working document issued by the Commission services, in conjunction with the Member States, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and non-governmental organisations.
Thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Marinho, whom I would like to congratulate, the European Parliament will also contribute to this dossier.
It is true that if we worked within the framework of a single, fully harmonised asylum system, the most practical solution would perhaps be to recognise the responsibility of the State in which the application was made.
However, we do not have this single system.
We are currently working within a framework where harmonisation is based on common minimum standards.
We must acknowledge the fact that since harmonisation is, at present, very limited, the most practical and most effective solution is to accept that the State responsible for the entry of refugees onto the European Union's territory must be the State which has the final say on the asylum application, and this must be done in a spirit of solidarity and loyal cooperation.
The Commission's proposal is therefore based on the same principle as the Dublin Convention.
The responsibility for examining an asylum application lies with the Member State which played the greatest part in the applicant's entry into or residence on the territory of the European Union, subject to exceptions designed to protect family group unity.
We must acknowledge, however, that the Dublin Convention has not had the effects that we anticipated.
We must take on board the lessons of the past.
That is why the proposal includes a number of innovations, such as new provisions emphasising each Member State's responsibility vis-Ã -vis all its partners in the Union when it allows illegal residents to remain on its territory; much shorter procedural deadlines to ensure that applications for asylum are processed rapidly in the interests of genuine asylum seekers, and so that applicants will not have to wait too long before they receive a decision on their asylum application; extended deadlines for implementing transfers of those concerned to the Member State responsible so as to allow for the practical difficulties arising in connection with such transfers and new provisions aimed at preserving the unity of asylum seekers' families, in so far as this is compatible with the other objectives of asylum and immigration policy.
In answer to Mr Olle Schmidt's question, first of all, this allows for the existence of clear rules on the responsibility of the Member State; secondly, it gives clarification, which has been added to our proposal, on the standard of proof required for determining the State responsible, and finally, it stipulates rules on the subsidiary responsibility of the State which is negligent.
The Commission is aware that no system used for determining responsibility in asylum matters can claim to be perfect.
As Mrs Sbarbati points out in her report for the Committee on Petitions, we have attempted to find a balance, which is fairly difficult, I admit, between, firstly, the legitimate interests of the Member States in combating the phenomenon of 'asylum shopping' and the same individual submitting multiple applications in order to remain on European Union territory for as long as possible and, secondly, the interests of asylum applicants to have their application examined within reasonable time limits and so that they are not kept apart from their family members for lengthy periods, when there is no real reason why their application should not be examined in the same Member State.
The Commission is able to accept the amendments which were proposed by the rapporteur and which, in our view, improve the text. They also make the Commission's intentions behind this text more effective.
It will come as no surprise, I am sure, when I say that the Commission is not in favour of the amendments that were inspired by another logic, which, however respectable, mar the proposal and contradict the Commission's clear intention to draft a practical, reasonable, effective text in the shortest time span possible.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
Thank you very much, Mr Di Lello Finuoli.
I have taken note of your comment.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, the Minutes are correct but I should like to make a comment.
Yesterday I was present in Strasbourg, and from the moment I arrived I had meetings through till after 9 p.m.
I did not, therefore, sign the register in the plenary chamber, so when we look at the Minutes my name is not there.
Some organisations publish details of Members' attendances; however this is a classic example of how sometimes when they say that Members have not attended the plenary part-sessions it is simply that they have not signed in in the Chamber on that day.
I should like this put on record.
Members should bear this in mind when those records are published and it appears that the record of attendance does not correspond to the reality of the situation.
Thank you, Mr Wynn.
Your comment will, of course, be included in the Minutes.
Madam President, on a point of order, I should like to ask you to ask the President of Parliament to register our complaint to the French Government, to the Mayor of Strasbourg and indeed to Air France: some of us were unable to get to the start of the plenary session yesterday because Air France cancelled one of the only direct flights from the UK to Strasbourg.
That meant a lot of us had to fly via Nantes and did not arrive until 9 p.m.
We were the lucky ones.
I understand the President of Parliament was also affected.
If the French Government insists that we meet here for 12 sessions a year - and I have not been one of those complaining about it - please let us get to the plenary session and indeed get home from the plenary session after the votes at 6.30 on Thursday evening!
It is absolutely ridiculous that Members of the European Parliament cannot take part in debates.
I was due to speak in one of those debates yesterday, as I know other people were.
Would the President please contact the officials and ask them to do something about it?
Mrs Lynn, I will, of course, pass on your complaint.
President Cox was also affected by this incident, as you know.
We shall notify the French Government.
Having said that, it appears that, rather than a single party being responsible for this problem, which we all condemn, several parties are to blame.
We shall therefore pass on your complaint to all those responsible for this incident to prevent it from happening again.
(The Minutes were approved)
Madam President, we can agree to this request for urgent procedure if this is dealt with at the second April part-session, when we will also know how the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market interprets the law.
Although we do not agree with changing the legal basis, we are prepared, subject to these conditions, to discuss this at the second April part-session.
Madam President, this proposal for a Regulation implements Resolution 1390, adopted on 16 January of this year by the United Nations Security Council, pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.
With regard to the 30 days required for signatory States to adopt the measures that correspond to the implementation of the aforementioned United Nations Resolution, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs yesterday voted in favour of the urgency procedure and for there to be a procedure without report, that is to say, that it should pass directly to plenary with time for amendments to be tabled by the political groups.
I would ask the Presidency to set a long deadline for the tabling of amendments to take account of these circumstances.
I would like to make two further observations.
The first is that, in order to implement Resolutions such as Resolution 1390, the European Union should take two different types of action: one which corresponds to the second pillar, common foreign and security policy, and another within the framework of the EC Treaty.
Yesterday, the Commission almost unanimously came to the conclusion that Parliament should work on the development of instruments in the second pillar, in other words, the development of the common position that is being adopted at this time.
And, if Parliament is not involved, it should at very least be kept informed, for what is laid down in the Treaty is one issue, and common sense and the idea that this House is the true representative of citizens' interests is quite another.
My second observation is that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has expressed a great deal of concern in this regard and will formally request that the Council and those Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council make use of those procedural mechanisms needed to correct possible non-justified inclusions of names of natural or legal persons in these lists.
This is currently the cause of much public concern in EU Member States.
Finally, we would ask the Commission not to force us to take this kind of action.
Parliament cannot seriously be expected to support this decision with only five days notice, for it is not really a question of issuing an opinion, but of supporting this United Nations Resolution, when the Resolution was passed on 19 January.
We would ask that in future we be more rapidly involved in the process of drawing up this type of Regulation in order that this Parliament can provide its support with full knowledge of the facts and not, as in this case, in a truly unbalanced effort.
Mrs Frahm, you asked to take the floor.
Are you speaking for or against the request for urgent procedure?
Madam Palacio, I do not understand why you have let the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs accept this procedure.
I do not understand why the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is to deal with a list of names without knowing how this list has been drawn up and without knowing how it can be altered.
If the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs had taken its tasks seriously, it would have refused to deal with such a matter until it knew how the list of names could be altered.
To win the respect of the Commission, it is not enough simply to agree to work at the Commission's pace.
This is something that should have been rejected.
Is there a Member to speak in favour of the request for urgent procedure?
Madam President, in support of the urgent procedure, and to specifically respond to this point, I would like to repeat that this is not a case of Parliament giving its opinion on a list. The matter in hand here is whether Parliament should support a decision made by the United Nations Security Council.
This is an act adopted by the United Nations Security Council that the signatory States and the European Union - as representative regional power in some cases of signatory States - should support, but in which it cannot participate.
Chapter VII(40 and41) of the United Nations Charter makes reference to the fact that the Security Council can implement any measures it deems necessary and that the signatory States must - for this is a mandatory act - apply them.
Therefore, any amendment of these lists falls to the Security Council.
What the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is asking - and we will implement it - is that the Council, as representative of the European Union, and the Member States that form part of the Security Council, keep an eye on the arbitration of procedures and mechanisms within the United Nations Security Council with the aim that, if there is any natural or legal person included in this list that should not be there, an exception can be made.
Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the members of Committee on Budgetary Control for their kind cooperation with me in preparation of this report, both individually and by group.
I want also to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her regular attendance at our meetings and for the help and expertise that her staff provided.
I especially want to thank the staff of our own Committee on Budgetary Control who were most diligent and expert and generous with their time, despite being moved around a lot recently, which is not very helpful.
Nevertheless, I could not be more full of praise for them.
I also want to thank Mr Bourlanges, who laid out the strategy for this report.
We started out with 65 paragraphs and ended up with 95.
I am not going to try to summarise the report because it would take far too long.
I am going to mention its principal features.
The main feature of this report on the budget for the financial year 2000 was the surplus of EUR 11 billion (or 14%).
That figure requires some explanation.
Firstly, more than EUR 2 billion came from revenue.
I do not think that any national government would apologise for having taken in too much revenue.
Another factor is the reserve of EUR 800 million.
Again, the reserve is there not to be spent if possible. It should not be included in the surplus.
When other details are taken into consideration, we had a real surplus of around 9%. Of that 7.2% could be said to come from the Structural Funds.
If the Structural Funds are taken out of the calculation, there was no problem with the rest of the budget.
On the Structural Funds, the regulations were completed in mid-1999.
The new Commission came in at that time.
It was never a possibility, considering the detail and the complications of this regulation, that our objectives for spending in the year 2000 could be achieved.
This brings us to the point of the difficulty of these regulations.
Most member governments did not submit their framework plans until the year 2000 itself.
Some of them were not admissible at that time because of the difficulty of understanding the regulations.
So, there was a problem.
I would like to underline the fact that a German official told me that in the six-year programme ending in 1999, there were 60 000 projects in Objective 1 areas of Germany alone.
That gives us some idea of the extent of the problem of administering these funds, and there are about 500 staff members in the relevant Commission Directorate-General.
The question of the Structural Funds has to be looked at in depth.
All the institutions of the Union have to apply themselves to simplifying the regulations by which we implement European regional policy before the new programme comes in and before enlargement in four years' time.
My next point is the topical question of fraud and irregularity.
It is the duty of the Committee on Budgetary Control to identify failure in administration and propose solutions.
That is why the message from the Committee on Budgetary Control must always be critical and risk sounding rather negative.
The final responsibility for failure always rests with the European Commission, but the national governments spend most of the money.
When we talk about the failure of the Commission, we are talking about its failure to control the national governments and the regional authorities, which is not always an easy task.
The EU at all levels is a partnership with the national governments.
If the Commission can be blamed for anything it is for failing to do its own public relations work, to stand up for itself and to stand up to the national governments when they are in breach of the regulations.
In the discharge procedure we expect to make a political decision on the performance of the Commission.
We in the Committee on Budgetary Control do that on the basis of a report from the Court of Auditors and the Commission's annual financial statement.
The Committee on Budgetary Control passed the discharge by a vote of something like 17 to 4.
That is a resounding vote of confidence in the work that the Commission has done in the year 2000.
However, we have not overlooked the weaknesses in the system and our motion for a resolution proposes changes and improvements both in planning and administration.
We are looking for better cooperation between the Court of Auditors, Parliament and the Commission in the implementation of European policies and more efficient spending of European money.
The last point I want to address is the failure of the Court of Auditors to give a statement of assurance.
We should point out that it gave a statement of assurance in relation to revenue and administration.
We have set out our solutions in paragraph 44.
We would like to see figures for the rate of error.
We would like to see figures which would enable us to compare one year with another.
But we would like the statement of assurance of the Court of Auditors in relation to the revenue side of the budget and administration to be clearer.
The only information we have about the rate of fraud and error comes from the Commission's statement for the year 2000.
It would appear that the rate of fraud and error is about EUR 2 billion, or about 2.5% of the entire budget.
Of this, about 10% of traditional own resources seems to involve a serious problem.
If that is taken out of the calculation, the rate of fraud and error, as best we can make it out, is about 1%.
I tried to establish how other States deal with this problem and I find the only comparable systems are in the United States and the Netherlands.
By the standards that they apply, I want to state categorically that the Commission would pass with first-class honours: our rate of fraud and error is below what is acceptable in those countries.
So while we have readjustments to make and recommendations for improvements, at the same time we do not want to overemphasise the negative aspects of our report.
Finally, I would like to see us aim for a situation where the Court of Auditors would present us with a statement which could be read in reasonable time by members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
We could then prepare a statement that could be read and understood by Members of this Parliament, by members of national parliaments and students of European politics.
We have failed to do that so far.
I hope that my successors will achieve something that can be understood by European citizens.
Madam President, I should like to recommend that we give the Commission discharge for the Development Fund, and I should like to ask Mrs Schreyer to communicate this to Mr Nielson, as I can see that he is not here today during this important debate.
I threatened along the way to have the discharge decision postponed if the Commission could not supply any results. In fact, it has done so.
There are still a few problems, but we shall have to look at those in a follow-up report.
I have focused in particular upon quality in the form of the number of follow-ups of audit results this year.
What concerns me is that the Commission has no overview of how many audits have been carried out, where and by whom.
One of my first questions to the Commission was: 'How many audits did you carry out in the year 2000?'.
The first answer was twelve, and that - I think - was extremely few, considering that there are 70 ACP countries.
The Commission then found a few more reports.
The thought occurred to them that a number of reports had no doubt been produced out in the delegations, and Mr Nielson assured the committee that 73 audits had been carried out in 2000.
I then asked for a list of these audits.
It proved to be a list containing very sparse information, which did not leave me much the wiser.
However, it provoked a lot of amusement - especially in the Court of Auditors - when it was seen what was being presented as audits.
Moreover, almost half of them were from Malawi, and it turned out that these were to be deducted from the number of audits, leaving 52 and not, as Mr Nielson had promised us in the committee, 73.
It may well be that 52 audits are enough, but it is worrying that the Commission does not have a better overview of how many audits are carried out and by whom.
There are no central records, and there is no general view of the activities 'out in the field'.
The Commission has nonetheless convinced me that it is not necessary for the audits to be carried out from the headquarters in Brussels.
I have therefore withdrawn my original demand for at least 50 audits. However, the more financial responsibility that is farmed out to the delegations, the greater the demands that are made in terms of oversight and coordination to be exercised by headquarters.
I have also asked the Commission to give me a better explanation of why the remaining millions of euros mentioned in the Court of Auditors' annual report have still not been claimed back.
It is two years since this was noted, and still nothing has happened.
I asked DG AIDCO's director-general if, on the basis of the auditing system and the information received from the delegations, he could issue a statement to the effect that the EDF funds are used in accordance with the principles of 'sound management'.
I have still not had an answer to this question.
I could have put the question to Commissioner Nielson if he had been here today. However, it may of course be that Mrs Schreyer can help me.
There has been a lot of criticism of the way in which the ACP's secretariat has operated.
Extremely critical audit reports have been prepared, and there have unfortunately also been some court cases in Belgium leading to convictions for not complying with legislation.
That is not, I think, something that we can live with in the EU.
New management is now in place, with which I have had some incredibly productive meetings.
I hope that matters are improving, which is why I have said that we are now waiting to see what the outcome of the Court of Auditors' decisions will be, whereupon we shall have to address the issue again.
I also wish to make a couple of observations about Mr McCartin's report on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
I think it is a splendid result, and I should like to commend him for having listened to my many amendments and for the fact that they have been incorporated.
That is one of the ways in which we can persist in following up the previous discharge decisions, and that is something extremely important to do.
There are, however, two important matters I have been left in ignorance of. When will the disciplinary proceedings taking place at the Stockholm office be concluded, including on the part of OLAF?
And the same question applies to the IRELA case from Spain, which we have talked at such length about.
I should also like to say a couple of words about the discharge decision where Parliament is concerned.
Mr Virrankoski has carried out an outstanding piece of work that is both incisive and well balanced.
In connection with the discharge decision where Parliament is concerned, it is not easy to understand our asking for transparency.
Everyone here is on the ball, especially when it comes to their own money.
I should like to say that I am deeply disappointed at the secretary-general of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who has written round to all the other groups, saying that it would be a disaster if there were to be transparency in connection with our accounts.
We criticise the Commission for not being open but, when it comes to ourselves, we close our eyes.
I really do think that the PPE-DE Group's Secretary-General should be deeply ashamed of ringing round and asking for there to be total secrecy concerning taxpayers' money.
That is something we cannot live with.
I should also like to say that one of the things that strikes me is the desire to close down the Finance Inspectorate.
When the figures for 2000 are examined, it can be seen that there were errors in seven per cent of the documents.
I think this shows that it must be possible for the impending internal audit to be independent.
However, I would still say, forget about closing down the Finance Inspectorate.
With regard to the discharge decision where the Council is concerned, I should like to say that we stand by the committee's observations and decision.
I cannot countenance some members of a group being made to toe the line, with the result that we have to change the decision we voted in favour of in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
All things considered, I am going to recommend, however, that we give discharge in all the areas.
Things are going well, in fact much better, and that is something we can only be pleased about.
Madam President, the work of the European Coal and Steel Community in recent years has been guided by the knowledge that it would cease functioning this summer.
It has been decided that the work of the ECSC should be discontinued: half a century is enough.
In its final years of operation the ECSC functioned like a bank.
It borrowed and lent money.
The Commission was responsible for administering its finances, and it is now the Commission's task to discontinue the bank's work, call in its loans and pay off its debts.
Its credit balance exceeds its debts.
It would appear that there will be a surplus of approximately 1.1 billion euros after the ECSC has been wound up.
In accordance with decisions taken earlier on, this surplus is to be invested profitably in the financial markets.
Some of the assets are to be used to set up a separate Coal and Steel Fund, out of which money will be allocated for research in these areas, in accordance with the principles proposed by the Commission and approved by the Council.
The yield from assets is intended to benefit the coal and steel sectors, which had to pay levies to the ECSC to fund its work.
That is only reasonable.
In this connection we have to remember that the money in the research fund was collected from the old Member States, and that it must first and foremost be used for research in these countries' coal and steel sectors.
However, if we consider how very important these sectors are in the economies of many of the applicant countries, it is only reasonable to call on the Commission to initiate talks with the old Member States in order that the new members might also share in the information obtained from research in this way.
The Commission must invest the assets left over after the ECSC ceases to function to ensure it obtains the greatest possible return.
If choices have to be made between safe investments and taking risks, then risks should be avoided.
It is important to be able to predict what sort of return the Commission can expect on its investments.
For the first time, in connection with this year's accounts, we can have information on yield from the investment of the ECSC's assets.
In 2000 the average rate of yield was 4.72%.
This sort of information is an important step in the right direction, but further steps have yet to be taken.
With regard to subsequent years there is every good reason to state a benchmark target rate of return, on the basis of which the auditors can assess how successfully the target has been achieved.
Similarly it will be important in the years to come to assess whether the ECSC's old activities are being wound down in the way that was planned.
The Commission intends to keep on more than thirty officials to be specifically employed in the distribution of the ECSC's estate.
That would seem to be a large number.
In the years to come Parliament must monitor the situation to ensure that the assets left over from the European Coal and Steel Community are not used to maintain needless bureaucracy on the part of the Commission.
The Court of Auditors has submitted a statement of assurance in which it recommends the granting of discharge.
Parliament can endorse their opinion.
Madam President, there was a very high level of implementation of the European Parliament's budget for the financial year 2000.
The utilisation rate was 99.28%, and the ratio of payment appropriations to all commitments was 91.05%.
The high degree of implementation was partly the result of the end-of-year mopping-up transfers, where funds were transferred to pay for Parliament's buildings.
In this way we were able to reduce the future costs of renting.
In the future this sort of practice should be done away with and we should budget strictly for actual estimated expenditure.
Parliament's accounts are abstruse, however.
For that reason, the report proposes that the way they are presented should be clarified and that, more specifically, there should be a clear breakdown of capital investment with regard to buildings.
The main points of focus in the budget for 2000 were the promotion of activity based management and better allocation of human resources.
Activity based budgeting and management has begun to improve, but, as the report states, the results are still modest.
Power of decision and responsibility must be delegated further downwards, and each member of staff's personal responsibilities must be clarified.
We furthermore have to change to a form of administration in which it is the results of actions that are assessed and not so much the way the administration is organised.
Only in this way can we make the administration more efficient and make savings.
In this respect the recommendations of the Rome-PE report should be implemented and internal financial control improved.
We must be able to redeploy human resources more flexibly and put an end to functions that are unnecessary.
The current system is too rigid and set in its ways.
This is also linked to the question of inequality between women and men.
The European Parliament is still a very old-fashioned place to work in.
In the last eighteen months eighteen people have been appointed to posts in categories A1 - A3.
Of them, just one was a woman and seventeen were men.
The report criticises this and calls for the introduction of quota arrangements until a normal state of affairs is reached.
Political groups are also connected with the matter of administration.
It is in accordance with the principles of activity based management that the groups' internal autonomy should be developed.
For that reason the report requests that this special feature should be taken into account in one way or another when the Financial Regulation is amended.
The report insists that the groups should present their balance sheets and financial statements more clearly and that they should be published.
Furthermore, there must be improvements made to asset management and inventories.
In addition, the responsibility of the group as party to agreements in general and as employer in particular must be legally clarified so that the European Parliament is not always ultimately accountable.
Regarding Parliament's two places of assembly we state that just the variable costs of meetings alone at Strasbourg are 33% more than in Brussels.
In addition there are considerably higher costs mainly due to the fact that there is double the number of buildings in Strasbourg.
Shortening the length of a part-session produces savings of just 1%.
This matter would perhaps be worth looking into by the Convention dealing with Treaty reform.
The biggest single problem is the cost of the Louise Weiss building in Strasbourg.
No agreement has been reached concerning the final investment costs with the project's promoter, SERS.
The dispute concerns the completion date and that is to be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
In addition there are disputes over work, additional work and unnecessary work.
There are also disputes between the promoter and the subcontractors.
It may take as long as ten years to resolve the argument completely.
Considering that Parliament did not want two meeting places, but agrees to meet in Strasbourg under great pressure from France in particular, we must insist that the dispute over the construction costs of the Parliament are resolved immediately.
The city of Strasbourg and the Alsace Region have the controlling interest in SERS, owning 60% of the shares in all.
They must therefore wield their power.
Furthermore, France must take responsibility for seeing to it that the European Parliament does not need to be party to the disputes and can pay for its work premises immediately and acquire title accordingly.
It is unfair that Parliament should continually have to remain vigilant to ensure that it is not being billed for costs that are unjustified.
With these observations the report proposes granting discharge to the Secretary-General in respect of the implementation of the 2000 budget and to the Accounting Officer in respect of the accounts for 2000.
. Madam President, with that long list you make it sound as though I have been extremely busy.
I would like to concentrate on those institutions that you have just mentioned.
The exercise, of course, considers the expenditure, and assesses the effective use of European taxpayers' money relating to those institutions.
There is also reference in this report to the Council, which I will touch on later.
Generally speaking there were no great concerns relating to the Court of Justice although we will clearly be following up some of the requests we have made to it on more detailed issues.
We grant discharge to the Court of Justice.
The Court of Auditors seems still reluctant to name Member States found wanting, and I warn the Court again that we will not rest until this request is complied with.
More consumer-friendly reports would be welcome, as would a declaration of interests by the Court on the Internet, as is currently carried out by most of the other institutions.
The Court must never feel itself to be too grand to conform to the standards we have learned to expect from other high-profile public servants.
We grant discharge to the Court of Auditors, however.
The new Ombudsman budget is very small, so any money not spent will perhaps be disproportionally reflected in percentage figures, but it is something that the Budget Committee needs to keep an eye on when they are setting the Ombudsman's budget.
We grant discharge to the Ombudsman.
The Committee of the Regions is also a relative newcomer to the European scene.
It is good to see some shared expenditure with the Economic and Social Committee although at times this does not go far enough.
A future report by the Committee on Budgetary Control may perhaps examine the value for money and impact assessment of this institution.
Both the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions performed quite well in relation to the Belliard and Montoyer buildings and played quite a good game with the poor set of cards that were dealt to them unfairly by Parliament.
We grant discharge to the Committee of the Regions.
I turn now to the area where the report's focus lies, and that is on the Economic and Social Committee: a committee which has been in existence since the beginning of this great project.
Whilst the report recognises the Economic and Social Committee can act as a forum for interest groups which would otherwise not be able to make their voices heard in the EU context, developments over recent years - including, for example, the social protocol - must now be considered.
Do we see some duplication here for example?
We have concerns that the information does not filter down to the grass roots.
The massive costs of financing this institution, which will reach almost EUR 100 million after enlargement, also gives us great concerns.
Even amongst some trade unions, which are recognised by and which use the Institution, there is criticism.
One prominent British trade union was prepared to say 'that the Economic and Social Committee appears to be redundant; we would be content for it to be abolished'.
Another worrying aspect of the ESC came in their reaction to this report which claimed that the concept of value for money of a body established by the European Treaties is highly questionable and politically unjustifiable.
Try telling that to the taxpayers of Europe!
I think it is pretty obvious, when you see reactions like that, there is not much accountability going on within the Economic and Social Committee.
The Budgetary Control Committee is recommending that discharge be refused to the Economic and Social Committee for the years 1996 and 1997.
This is a historic move and it is not taken lightly.
Only on two occasions before has the discharge been refused; once of course which led to the forced resignation of the Commission in 1999.
It may perhaps seem strange that we have waited until now to assess the accounts and expenditure for 1996.
However, it has taken until now to receive objective clarification on irregularities relating to payments of members' travel allowances.
The whole sequence of events from the fraud itself involving 59 members of the Economic and Social Committee amounting to over EUR 1 million, to the scandalously relaxed attitude of Economic and Social Committee managers and their efforts to cover up the problem, to the botched and unprofessional approach of OLAF, the European Fraud Office, all reeks of incompetence, procrastination and amateurism.
It has taken six years to get to the bottom of this fraud that occurred in 1996.
This situation is a disgrace.
It has meant that there has been no chance of prosecuting those involved, as the Courts have said that too much time has elapsed.
There have been improvements since then however, which is why we do grant discharge to the Economic and Social Committee for 1998, 1999 and 2000.
It is important that the Convention on the Future of Europe should take heed of the message in this report.
I turn finally very briefly to the Council.
Traditionally we have lumped this together with the Commission expenditure.
This year, however, the Court of Auditors has prepared a critical report on the workings of the common foreign and security policy.
This again is a fairly new area for the Council.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has asked for answers and clarification on some of the issues on which the Court of Auditors has concerns.
The Council is discussing that this morning, so we are waiting for the results from the Council before we take a vote on this.
I hope you will bear that in mind when it comes to the vote.
I hope that the Economic and Social Committee will deal with the fact that we have not given them discharge with the gravity that this issue deserves.
Madam President, I should first of all like to echo the words of thanks to the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control and to Mrs Schreyer.
In my view, cooperation has been excellent this year.
I should also like to thank the two draftsmen of opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, common security and defence policy, for their very pleasant and smooth cooperation.
Finally, of course, I should also like to extend a word of thanks to the representatives of the decentralised bodies to whom we can grant discharge today.
This discharge does in fact concern three bodies: the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) in Thessaloniki and the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo, based in Thessalonica and Pristina.
The Court of Auditors has closely examined the financial accounts of these three bodies, and in all three cases it has reached the conclusion that the annual accounts for the financial year 2000 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular.
As your rapporteur, I have been looking into what we said in the discharge report for 1999.
In the first two cases, we recommended that an external evaluation be implemented and an Action Plan be submitted.
As far as the Foundation in Dublin is concerned, we enquired last year whether it would not be preferable to work more closely with the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work.
We asked CEDEFOP for verification of how cooperation with the European Training Foundation in Turin could be improved.
Now I have to inform you that the Foundation in Dublin has faced some delays in implementing this request.
The external evaluation has just been completed, the Action Plan has only recently been discussed, but the request has now been complied with, it has been presented for discussion and I, as rapporteur, will naturally remain in contact with the representatives of the Foundation in Dublin to ensure that the discharge report for 1999 is carefully observed.
As far as CEDEFOP is concerned, this exercise has been fully completed and I have good news on this front.
It is nice to have some good news on a discharge for a change.
CEDEFOP has indeed fully complied with our request and a cooperation agreement has now also been concluded with the Foundation in Turin.
In my view, it is partly thanks to the pressure exerted by our institution, the European Parliament, that considerable progress has also been made on behalf of the European taxpayer in this area.
Finally, I also have positive news about the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo.
We must remind ourselves of what the situation was like.
The challenge in Kosovo after the war was enormous.
Not only due to the trail of material damage and human suffering left by the war in Kosovo, but mainly due to the damage which the Milosevic regime caused in Kosovo for more than a decade, which was typified by a chronic under-investment in resources and permanent violations of human rights.
And I should like to emphatically praise our people in the field, the people of the European Agency for Reconstruction, but also the people of the Kosovo task force who went out there immediately after the war.
The work they did there, sometimes under very difficult circumstances, was incredible.
The Court of Auditors and everyone who reads the annual reports and the three-monthly reports can see for themselves how incredibly efficient our management has been over there.
We have learnt from our mistakes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course, and this too is a positive message.
I was your rapporteur for a special Court of Auditors report about the actions taken by the EU in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
We made mistakes there, we learnt from these, and this is how we managed to take effective action in Kosovo.
I should like to finish off with a remark about the situation in Kosovo. The energy sector is the most important area in which we are investing, yet it is also typified by an inherent paradox.
An incredible amount of money is being poured into the supply of energy, and yet electricity failures occur almost on a daily basis.
This is a paradox for the population, and in my report, I urge for more efforts to be made in order to make it clear to the people in Kosovo that energy-saving measures will need to be stepped up, and that energy will also need to be paid for in order to achieve a more sustainable policy.
Finally, I have received reports about misappropriations at the Kosovo Electricity company, but it is too early to draw any conclusions.
I have asked UNMIK to draft a report on this, as it is UNMIK that is ultimately responsible, and I think that we will have to incorporate the results of this report in our discharge report for 2001.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the year 2000, EUR 82 billion was spent via the European Budget, made up of hundreds of thousands of different cash movements - payments to researchers and research institutes, grants to students, premiums to farmers for cattle or for set-aside, food aid for refugees, payments for the provision of building materials in Kosovo or for the fight against Aids in Africa, subsidies for the extension of rail networks in the EU, for the building of business parks and so on.
I could keep on adding to the list for a long time.
This shows the heterogeneous and multifarious nature of the European Union's tasks to which these financial resources go.
It shows, too, what varied demands are made on good budget management and proper monitoring.
One might add what Mr McCartin has emphatically underlined, namely that the Commission has central administrative responsibilities only for a small part of this and that in other respects, in the Member States, thousands of payment offices for agricultural expenditure, as well as hundreds of ministries and agencies, are responsible for implementation, that is, for receiving applications for funding, examining them and granting them.
Mr McCartin, your report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the Budget for the financial year 2000 reflects the wide range of the Commission's activities, the risks and sources of error specific to each of them, the measures that need to be taken and also, of course, the deficiencies in the way the Budget was managed.
It is indeed very comprehensive, and the Commission is very grateful to you for the great balance that this report demonstrates.
Let me, too, thank you for your speech and for your committed involvement in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The Commission welcomes the Committee on Budgetary Control's recommendation, by such a large majority, that the Commission should be given discharge in respect of the 2000 Budget.
Notwithstanding that, the report and the resolution, indeed, do anything but quiet the Commission's conscience.
The report makes 144 demands of the Commission, ranging from the demand that it should submit reports on administrative measures it has taken, to the demand that it should amend laws.
I cannot, of course, discuss all these demands now, but I would like to pick out a few of them.
I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Blak, on behalf of the Commission, for your work on the Development Fund and for the recommendation of discharge, which, in accordance with your own tradition - one that I greatly value - comes with numerous demands attached.
You, Mr SeppÃ€nen, have played a positively historic role as rapporteur for the European Coal and Steel Community budget, and I will also thank Mrs Morgan and Mr Virrankoski.
Even though your reports deal with the ways the other institutions implement their budgets, they are elements of the general European Budget.
Mr Staes, your report, which the Commission warmly welcomes, is one that I should like to return to later.
The Commission wishes to express its thanks to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, for managing the whole discussion of the discharge so well, and, of course, the secretariat and the whole committee for their hard work.
One of the 2000 Budget year's results that got a very critical reception from the Committee on Budgetary Control was the large Budget surplus of EUR 11.6 billion, which, however, was welcomed by the Finance Ministers of the Member States.
I have, in fact, nothing to add to Mr McCartin's description of the positive development on the revenue side.
One should naturally welcome a situation in which growth rates are higher than first expected.
What should, in fact, be seen in a more critical light is the issue of how outgoings were less than estimated in the Budget.
We are not talking here about agricultural or administrative expenditure, where expenditure being lower than estimated really does mean that savings have been made.
In the case of the Structural Funds, though, outgoings have been deferred for a period of time.
Not all the regulations that were required could in fact be adopted in time, because it was so late in 1999 that decisions were taken on the agenda, as also described by Mr McCartin.
Even today, though, in 2002, we have to record that the programme has been poorly implemented.
Conclusions must, then, be drawn from this for the next aid period, and even the present aid period cannot be untouched by change.
Mr Blak has drawn attention to the fact that the European Development Fund had, in real terms, a substantially greater turnover of resources in 2000 than in the preceding year, so this represents a positive development.
It is also clear, in view of the immense need in many ACP States that the underutilisation of resources is not about there being any lack of need, but often about a lack of definite projects.
The Commission has, then, in part, gone over to subsidising these countries' budgets to a greater extent. On the one hand, this is right and proper, but, on the other, it does require new approaches to monitoring.
Let me again point out, with reference to the forwarding of information in the discharge procedure, that the Commission always immediately posts on the Internet evaluation reports on the various programmes and the different Budget items, and that the figures on the implementation of the current Budget are sent by electronic means to the Committee on Budgetary Control on a weekly basis.
The Commission is convinced that the agreement with Parliament on the forwarding of confidential information has proved its value.
I must reiterate, though, that both the Commission's and OLAF's reports are covered by the rules on data protection and the protection of the confidentiality of investigations.
The Commission has also, in response to a query from the Committee on Budgetary Control, produced a further breakdown of the reports from the Member States on errors and demands for repayment in connection with the Structural Funds.
Tighter controls have meant that these have been notified in greater numbers, although the Member States are often not yet monitoring to the extent prescribed.
Mr McCartin, you have made critical comments on this in your report.
Your criticism is one that I share.
It is though, very doubtful that those Member States with federal structures will be happy to be told, as is proposed in the report, that they must change the way their competences are allocated as regards the monitoring of European funds, as this is often enshrined in their constitutions.
This really does raise some very serious issues.
One significant topic in discussions during this discharge procedure has been - and still is - the methodology on the basis of which the European Court of Auditors decides whether or not to grant a Statement of Assurance.
The Commission welcomes the Court of Auditors' willingness to discuss proposals for a changed approach to the creation of indicators for financial management that are capable of being checked and compared over a period of time.
Both the report on the Commission's budget and Mrs Morgan's report demand that enquiries be made into the incidence of errors in each Directorate-General.
The Court of Auditors has already made it clear that this is not in accordance with its present method of sampling, as it would require substantially more random samples than the Court of Auditors is able to carry out.
I would, though, point out that the reform of the Commission saw the introduction of new monitoring standards and that the annual reports on the activities of the Directorates-General have to contain details of which standards have been complied with and how this has been done.
We will be checking with the Court of Auditors what amounts can be derived from these reports and from the Directorate-General's statements for the purpose of establishing indicators that can then be compared over time.
Mr Staes, in your report on the discharge of the Director of the European Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, you express your agreement with the Court of Auditors' favourable judgment.
I have several reasons for picking up on this.
One is that experience with the reconstruction agency has shown that decentralised responsibility, meaning more on-the-spot decisions, is the right way to go.
Another is because press reports have, in part, given the impression that accusations of mismanagement in energy supply had already been substantiated.
You have again made clear that this is not the case, but that the situation continues to be unsatisfactory, and have also shown how things stood in the year 2000, when they were absolutely desolate with regard both to this power station and also to the fact that - like everywhere else in the former Eastern bloc - electricity bills were not being paid.
It is also of significance that the position with regard to ownership of the power station was unclear, which meant that it could not be privatised, and that it was of enormous importance in terms of safeguarding jobs.
That, too, had to be taken into account in a very thorny and politically unstable situation, in which there will, of course, have to be further developments.
I am very glad that the Court of Auditors has thoroughly audited the Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, and done so at a very early juncture.
They were on the spot themselves.
The overall result of the audit by the Court is a very positive one, which is significant in so far as this work in the Balkans, and the work in Kosovo, will, in the years to come, be of great importance for policy not only on foreign affairs, but also specifically on the Budget.
I would like to touch briefly on the observation and demand you made concerning the agricultural sector, especially on agricultural export refunds.
Even while the discharge procedure was running its course, it was possible for some understanding on several points to be reached between the committee and my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler, something that also shows that the atmosphere between the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Commission has undergone positive change in the direction of directly critical, but constructive cooperation.
It is not only I, myself, but also, no doubt, most of our citizens, who welcome the way that Parliament is now demanding decisions on the reduction of live animal transports, which are indeed often carried on only to get export refunds.
I hope that this plenary sitting will see the completion of the discharge procedure for the 2000 Budget.
Work is simultaneously in progress on drawing up the 2003 Budget, which is expected to be the last Budget for an EU of fifteen Member States.
When the EU is enlarged, the Budget will once again become more complex and more multifaceted.
Until then, the Commission will use the time available to support the candidate states in their preparations for enlargement and for participation in the European funds, monitoring the introduction of the necessary measures, and itself further reforming its administrative procedures.
That will call for a degree of impetus from Parliament, but especially for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you for your cooperation in the past months and will conclude by alluding to an old saying from the world of football, to the effect that the Commission is very well aware that one discharge being over always means that you have another one to face.
Madam President, for the Committee on Foreign Affairs there are two key issues in this discharge: transparency and implementation.
On transparency, I had an interesting time when I asked Parliament's officials if they could let me have a list of what the Commission had done on the 2000 budget in relation to those items to which Parliament had adopted amendments to the budget, in terms of both amounts of money and also remarks.
