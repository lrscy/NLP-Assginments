As a list of obligations and remedying actions has just been launched on the market it is sheer madness to confuse the issue by adding new public service obligations or imprecise notions regarding a monopoly, which are oddly combined with perhaps some quite interesting business concept, which is to say the European service number idea.
The whole information and communications technology sector has to be regulated until the markets are fully competitive.
That is only fair for everyone.
Let, then, the new service concepts come about in a commercially competitive market where business developers skilled in their field will certainly do their work well.
That is European innovation.
Let us also do our work: let us enact laws that last.
Â Â  . Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the honourable Members of the European Parliament, who have been very consistent in following this file.
I have a few comments.
Interestingly, a couple of studies have been carried out recently which compared levels of productivity growth and development in the EU and in the United States.
One was conducted under the leadership of Professor van Ark of Groningen University.
There, they have studied the industrial and service sectors, trying to spot the areas in which the gaps between the EU and the US have been narrowing and widening.
The communications sector is one area in which Europe has done better than the United States.
The latest issue of the Harvard Business Review came up with the same conclusion.
Even though only two reference countries were used â France and Germany â productivity growth in Europe has been about 15% faster than it has in the United States over the last five years.
Therefore, the liberalisation of telecommunications within our regulatory framework has provided a real boost for innovation and competition.
I am also sure that investment into research and development has been very helpful.
All this shows that the right pressure for competition and a push for innovation also boosts productivity growth, which is a major benefit for the whole sector.
Second, on future issues, I agree with Mr Clegg that in the long term, facilities-based competition encourages investment.
The big challenge in applying these regulations will be how to build a bridge from service-based competition to facilities-based competition.
The only way to do it consistently is via the opening-up of legacy networks, which have hitherto been financed under monopoly conditions.
Where the opening-up of networks will require future investment and may involve risks, these risks must be properly assessed.
Mr Herzog made a very interesting comment.
It is very clear that we need both ex ante and ex post regulation.
Ex ante regulation should be used in cases such as universal services, when there is strong public interest, but once markets are fully competitive, then reasons for broad ex ante regulation will essentially diminish.
Regulation is not the purpose here. The purpose is high-quality services for the citizens at competitive prices.
Finally, Mrs Gill, as far as our measures on the implementation of the regulation are concerned, the Commission is extremely strict when it exercises its role as guardian of the Treaties.
The infringement procedure has three phases.
The first is the letter of formal notice, which we have sent out.
We are waiting for the reply.
When we have received it, we will produce a letter giving a reasoned opinion.
If we are not happy with the reply we will take the Member State to court.
We will be extremely cool and objective in applying these principles, so there is no reason for concern in this respect.
I also noted the comments of both Mrs Read and MrÂ Clegg on the accession countries.
I am ready to have another look at this and will be happy to discuss that issue another time.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  The next item is a report (A5-0383/2003) by MrsÂ Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the introduction of special tax arrangements for diesel fuel used for commercial purposes, this with a view to aligning the excise duties on petrol and diesel fuels [COM(2002) 410 â C5-0409/2002 â 2002/0191(CNS)].
Â Â  . Madam President, on 27 October 2003, after more than six years of negotiation, the Council adopted the energy tax directive.
That directive includes some aspects of the commercial diesel proposal and notably it gives Member States the possibility to apply differential tax rates to commercial diesel and non-commercial diesel.
However, the energy tax directive is still based on the principle of minimum rates only.
Hence, it does not remedy the problem of distortion of competition on road haulage markets, which stems from the significant differences in diesel taxation in the Member States.
Only harmonisation, or at least a greater approximation, of commercial diesel taxation will put an end to those distortions of competition.
Three parliamentary committees, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have broadly supported the Commission's proposals for that reason.
However, the debates in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have also shown that there is wide recognition of the existence of such distortions.
However, that committee does not share the views of the Commission on the need and the means to reduce those distortions of competition.
I recall that, according to Article 93 of the Treaty, provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning excise duties must be adopted to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and proper functioning of the internal market.
It is clear that the distortions of competition resulting from the very significant differences in excise duties applied to diesel by the Member States are a threat to the functioning of the internal market.
I would like to point out that the Commission reacted positively to many amendments contemplated by the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and other Members of Parliament.
In particular, the Commission could in principle have accepted the following three items.
Firstly, the creation of an indexed fluctuation band for excise duties applicable to commercial diesel.
Such a fluctuation band could be considered a 'second best' if a harmonised rate for commercial diesel cannot be achieved.
The second item is the alignment of the present proposal with the terms of the energy tax directive, in particular as far as the definition of commercial diesel and tax rates are concerned.
Third, there is the issue of the implementation of a refund system, as a practical tool for differentiating duties for commercial and non-commercial diesel.
To my surprise, it appeared that these amendments were subsequently not considered by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to be sufficient to allow support for the Commission's proposal.
Finally, the Council, according to the minutes concerning the adoption of the energy tax directive, is clearly committed to pursuing its work on the commercial diesel proposal.
For the reasons I have given, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of this proposal.
I would invite Members of Parliament to consider their position on this issue very carefully before the vote on it this week.
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I cannot share the Commissionâs view that the time is ripe for this proposal, which aims at full harmonisation of excise duties for commercial diesel.
My criticism mainly concerns the following matters.
I will start with the reasoning behind the proposal: is there really a problem?
The Commission mentions two primary reasons for its proposal: protection of the environment and fair competition in the Internal Market.
Whilst being a staunch supporter of both these aspects, I have my doubts as to whether the proposal as drafted will have the desired effects.
First, the environmental effects should be seen in a wider context.
It is questionable whether the proposal will have any environmental benefit worth mentioning.
The Commission, citing evidence which can best be described as anecdotal, contends that trucks make unnecessary detours to fill up their sizeable tanks in countries where excise duties, and hence prices at the pump, are lower.
The proposal contains a reference to a 1997 OECD report, which concluded that âgasoline tourismâ accounted for 20% of sales in Switzerland, for example.
Even if one accepted this figure, there is no way of knowing whether this is a real substitution â that truckers are not filling up before departing from the country of origin â or whether this is a result of drivers making detours in order to fill up in certain countries.
I wonder whether this really is a problem of such magnitude as to merit such a far-reaching measure, total harmonisation, as proposed by the Commission.
Neither am I at all convinced that it is even desirable to eliminate differences in excise duty between Member States.
I am of the opinion that an element of tax competition is very healthy, especially as the proposed harmonisation drive would result in higher taxes in most Member States.
Finally, coming as I do from a peripheral region of the Union, I would say that I consider that regional aspects must also be taken into account.
Scandinavian truckers are unlikely to be affected by gasoline tourism in the same way as German or Belgian haulage companies allegedly are in the congested regions of the Union.
I believe that this proposal has been tabled outside its proper context.
Although there are a number of references to the ongoing debate on a new transport policy framework and the proposal to introduce a charge on infrastructure use, there has been no real discussion of the interaction between these two initiatives.
The Commission has presented concrete proposals on infrastructure charges and taxes, so it would have been better if these measures had been proposed simultaneously. Otherwise, there is a clear risk that an excessive burden will be placed on the transport sector in the form of increased diesel taxes and raised infrastructure charges.
While it is true that the proposed Article 8(e) makes reference to this problem, it only applies during the transitional period, and only to trucks weighing less than 16 tonnes.
How, moreover, will this proposal affect the new Member States, some of which at present apply taxes that are significantly lower than those in force in the EU at the moment?
Is it, as the Commission suggests, realistic to expect a harmonised tax rate to apply to all 25 Member States by 2012?
I fear that massive price hikes in several new Member States would place such tremendous burdens on them â quite apart from increasing inflation at a time when they are striving to bring down their inflation levels to qualify for EMU membership â that this development is not politically possible.
Besides, the candidate countries have already done a lot to adapt to the current minimum tax rate and already the relatively modest increase foreseen in the Directive on energy tax may pose difficulties for some countries.
One of the Commissionâs reasons for tabling this rather complex proposal is to bring the tax rate for passenger cars rapidly in line with the rate for unleaded petrol.
The Commission justifies this sort of tax treatment from the environmental point of view.
We have to consider what impact the harmonisation of these tax rates would have, for example, on R[amp]D for diesel engines.
We must also bear in mind that at the moment, in a competitive market, European manufacturers are market leaders in the area of diesel technology.
We must also consider what impact this will have on the petroleum industry and oil refineries as, with the proposal, diesel consumption is likely to decline.
Finally, I want to say that before the summer recess I tried to make some amendments to this proposal, to make it possible for Parliament to adopt it.
I only received verbal assurances from the Commission, however, that the change Parliament desires will in fact be what the Commission pushes for in the Council.
It is very unsatisfactory that the consultation procedure in Parliament will either have to reject the proposal or give the Commission in its negotiations with the Council.
I therefore hope that in future a new constitutional agreement will allow the use of the codecision procedure and qualified majority decision-making in matters of taxation, making it much easier for Parliament to adopt a Commission proposal with certain amendments and return to the issue at second reading.
Â Â  â Madam President, Europe must take measures relating to car use if we wish to comply with our Kyoto obligations.
It would be shortsighted to try to attain the Kyoto targets at the expense of those who create employment, if no previous attempt had been made to exploit all the opportunities which transport affords for reducing emissions.
The EU has already concluded agreements, for example with European car manufacturers, concerning production of cars which are cleaner and perform better in terms of fuel economy.
The directive now before us is important for efforts to achieve the same end from the demand side by making costs visible to consumers.
It is just a pity that the Commission proposal comes on its own.
For it to be adopted, it ought to be discussed in a broad context: within a decade it is proposed to establish a European tax system comprising charges for vehicle registration and use, an intelligent pricing system for infrastructure, and harmonised fuel taxes.
As it is not possible to adopt such a comprehensive approach now, and as this directive fixes the level of fuel taxes for quite a long time, a decision seems unlikely.
A comprehensive review would be in the interests of consumers and would ensure balanced development of transport in sparsely populated regions where no public transport is available.
In rural and remote regions, people are more dependent on private cars, and the external costs of transport are lower than elsewhere.
People have a tendency to reconsider their choices only when a major change occurs, such as when moving house, transferring to a new place of employment or buying a new car; they may not even realise substantial developments in public services have been made.
Accordingly, big changes in immediately perceptible costs, such as fuel prices or road pricing, are important initiators of choice processes.
In that sense, a linear model for increasing excise on fuel may be too slow and gradual to spur consumers genuinely to perceive the situation in such a way as to change their consumption patterns.
At all events, it is important from the outset to stress in public information the ultimate objective of internalising the external costs of transport.
Diesel vehicles consume less fuel and produce fewer carbon dioxide emissions.
It must, however, be remembered that they emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, which are a serious threat to public health.
It may be considered a justified objective, therefore, to align the rates of excise duty on diesel and petrol.
Â Â  Madam President, I am sorry that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and MrsÂ Kauppi are so negative towards the Commissionâs proposal.
I naturally respect the fact that many are opposed to tax harmonisation on principle.
There is of course a value in countriesâ determining their own taxes because these fund a significant proportion of welfare provision which, as is known, differs from one Member State to another.
Even if it is important as a matter of principle to stand up for the right of individual nations to determine their taxes, this principle should not, however, be honoured to the point at which it becomes counterproductive.
In certain areas, common tax rates have a clear added value.
Diesel fuel tax is one such area.
There are a number of drawbacks to having different tax rates on diesel fuel in the Member States.
Firstly, different tax rates militate against fair competition between EU companies, for which it costs more in one country than in another to transport their products.
It creates an imbalance in competition between companies.
Secondly, this difference encourages what is known as fuel tourism.
I have myself worked in the transport industry, driving heavy lorries.
I know that drivers travel hundreds of extra kilometres to buy cheap diesel fuel.
Not only that, but they attach additional tanks to their lorries so as to be able to fill up with enough fuel to make their journeys that much more profitable.
Naturally, this fuel tourism also contributes to further destroying the environment.
We work an unnecessary number of hours on the roads, and the number of accidents is increasing.
That is the price we have to pay for the large discrepancies that currently prevail in the tax area.
Thirdly, this situation, involving big differences in taxation, creates scope for social dumping. The gap between different transport costs in different countries is widening, and this makes room for social dumping.
The environment, road safety, employeesâ conditions and fair conditions of competition will be the overall losers if we retain an arrangement within the EU involving large differences in fuel costs.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the way in which Mrs Kauppi, in her revised report, has moved away from her negative stance.
MrsÂ Kauppi, you are quite right to say that the Commission proposal leaves room for improvement, but I cannot be satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the lead committee, which rejected it.
With this proposal for harmonising the taxation of diesel fuel used for commercial purposes, the Commission has taken a courageous step in the right direction, one in which the lead committee was not prepared to join it, thus ignoring the recommendations in its favour in the opinions of the advisory committees.
In essence, the Commission proposal has two ends in mind. It envisages disentangling the tax rules on fuels, for commercial purposes on the one hand and for private use on the other, and, secondly, duties on diesel fuel in commercial use are to be harmonised, the object being to avoid distortions of competition.
Competition, though, is distorted not only when rates of duty are not harmonised, but also because drivers work and drive for different periods of time.
That should not, however, be a reason to reject the proposal, but rather a reason for improving it.
After all, Parliament has always encouraged and endorsed measures aimed at opening up markets and making competition fair.
Harmonisation is, moreover, intended to avoid the customary detours and the damage to the environment that results from them.
It cannot be denied that âgasoline tourismâ is commonplace nowadays, and it is partly responsible for the damage to the environment.
So how do things now stand with the outcome?
Firstly, it does not get to grips with the alignment of competition conditions in the transport business, which is so urgently needed.
Secondly, this decision amounts to a retrograde step in terms of environmental policy as well.
This is lamentable, and it is my belief that it would have made sense, particularly at the present time, for the Commission to improve its proposal in order to tackle the deplorable state of affairs to which I have referred.
Â Â  â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have to tell Mrs Wenzel-Perillo that MrsÂ Kauppiâs report, in the resolution of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on page 9, has this to say: âWe call on the Commission to submit a new proposal as a matter of urgency.â
That is precisely what this is about.
We have not rejected the proposal or said that the whole thing is preposterous.
There are very many approaches, and they are all right, but, if we are thinking in terms of the whole picture, there are still very many questions left to be resolved.
I think that the harmonisation of fuel excise duties makes sense, but does that achieve its purpose if we retain differences in taxation, tolls, road pricing and vehicle taxes?
If we are in favour of an internal market, we also have to think about the effects on the environment.
Does it really make ecological sense for us, in this directive, to favour heavy goods vehicles by separating the diesel and excise duty rates for the commercial and private sectors?
Are diesel cars not urgently needed to bring about a reduction in CO2 emissions?
We therefore cannot see any justification for aligning the excise duty rates for diesel and petrol.
Are there not circumstances under which this uncontrolled abundance of divergent diesel tax rates might result in abuses, and lead to an abuse of the trust of all those who took on board higher acquisition costs when they changed over to diesel?
Let me conclude, then, by saying that something remains to be done about tax in relation to the internal market, but many issues still have to be resolved before we can describe the cost-benefit equation as balanced.
I am, therefore, rather surprised that, on page 24 of tomorrowâs communication by the Commission to the European Parliament, it is stated in the working programme for 2004 that this directive is already to be transposed, even though we are today discussing the need for the Commission to submit a new proposal.
Only if the new Commission proposal is quick in coming will we be able to achieve the working programmeâs objective.
Â Â  â Madam President, this directive will not be transposed as quickly as the Commission imagines.
We are dealing here, of course, with a typical case for mainstreaming.
I very much wish the traditional transport sector were as keen on proper Europe-wide regulation as it is on combating distortions of competition.
It is simply that certain things have to be considered as a whole; I mention this just by way of introduction.
Fundamentally speaking, Commissioner, I do of course share the Commissionâs view that harmonising indirect taxes makes sense as a means of guaranteeing the proper functioning of the internal market.
Arguments based on fair competition and the protection of the environment always go down well with the public.
In this instance, though, the subject matter has to be seen in a more nuanced light.
On the one hand, we are dealing with what I would almost call the Commissionâs inability to fashion a more comprehensive policy for the public in the transport sector, and, on the other hand, the finance ministers want to raise more money by increasing duties on diesel fuel.
The way in which road and rail interact demonstrates a policy of isolation rather than one of integration.
In the same way that we need a comprehensive transport concept for Europe, so we also need an overall concept for all taxes on motor vehicles, tolls and the transport infrastructure costs directive.
It has to be seen as a whole, as a single package.
Only in this context would the alignment of diesel tax be sensible and feasible.
In the proposal for a directive, the Commission has also referred to the sharp increase in the number of privately owned diesel cars and regretted the revenue lost to the Member Statesâ budgets.
It describes this as an error in need of correction.
It is regrettable that it had nothing further to say about the owners of these vehicles, which are as a rule cheaper and use less fuel, who have, up until now, been able to drive more economically with diesel.
It is worth examining more closely the question of who drives these vehicles.
As a rule, their drivers are workers who are obliged to travel to work by car every day because no other options are available.
In some states, these vehicles make up over 50% of private cars.
European tax policy meant that it was precisely this factor that had a decisive effect on the car market, and environmental concerns have eventually resulted in improved technology in this sector.
It is, I believe, precisely in this context that this issue needs to be considered more fully.
I do not think that the underlying thinking is wrong or bad, but simply that the proposal needs to be revised or reworked.
As it stands at present, it is not exactly in line with our thinking.
My group recommends that the Commission should submit a new proposal, and advocates the rejection of the one put before us.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, this is a sensitive subject. We see this from the many vicissitudes that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has gone through since we dealt for the first time with the issue of tax on diesel fuel.
Of course, the debate in the House this evening also indicates this.
I wish to thank my fellow MEP, MrsÂ Kauppi, for the typically assiduous and ambitious work she has done.
This time â this once, I hope â I must however inform you that the majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party do not share her conclusions.
Certainly, we can agree that the Commission proposal entails problems, difficult issues and delicate considerations.
My conclusion, nonetheless, is that it is a pity that the committeeâs majority could not have built upon what was good about the proposal and improved it instead of rejecting it in its entirety, something now proposed by both the big political groups.
I therefore share MrÂ Bolkesteinâs opinion on this matter, and I shall explain why.
Firstly, the ELDR Groupâs amendment is about tax coordination, not harmonisation.
We propose allowing taxes to vary and fluctuate within a broad tax band, providing scope for the Member Statesâ own judgments without dispensing with what is good about the proposal.
Secondly, the Commission proposal is of course about improving the environment.
I certainly think that a number of the arguments sound like just a lot of excuses.
Tax competition may, I agree, be a good thing, but not if the environment suffers as a result.
Environmental and energy taxes are the taxes I believe can be decided at EU level.
Thirdly, the big differences between the Member States damage the internal market.
To maintain, as MrsÂ Kauppi does, that there is no diesel fuel tourism is, in actual fact, to put oneâs head in the sand â or possibly in the tank â and not see what is actually going on.
A modified Commission proposal would be good for the environment, strengthen the internal market and improve competition.
That is something to which opposition in this House should be impossible on the part either of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats or on the part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Let us not end up recoiling in fear or engaging in exaggerated rhetoric every time we debate a proposal containing the word âtaxâ.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Bolkestein, it is not the first time that I have pointed out in plenary that my group shares your opinion, that is that we are particularly disappointed by the vote which took place in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which in my view was a reactionary vote.
Before I presented my comments I re-read the Commission proposal, the document of 24Â July, and, both personally and on behalf of my group, I find the proposal made by your services to be of a very high quality, because it gives a very positive diagnosis and clearly explains the impact that we can expect from this proposal.
I would like to once again stress to my fellow Members that the Commission made an extremely progressive proposal, which can be expected to have an impact in 2010-2012 for the candidate countries.
It begins with an extremely weak central rate, which is the simple indexation of the rate that was in force as early as 1992 and, it is true, this means that some States will have to raise these rates.
I also think that the comment from fellow Members, to the effect that an overall package should be proposed, is nothing more than a ploy to sidestep the issue; in other words, agreement will not be reached on the entirety of the measures proposed.
I would also like to sayÂ âÂ and in my view this is one of the reasons why this proposal was rejected by the main political groupsÂ âÂ that you are obviously stressing the issue of distortion of competition but, if you carefully read the Commission proposal, you will clearly see that it seeks not, for example, to increase the overall tax burden of the States, it involves reorganising the national tax systems.
For example, one proposal, which we support, is to reduce taxes on transport infrastructure and instead, to favour taxation according to use, which is the same index as that of the âpolluter-paysâ.
It is clear that States do not want interference in the tax systems, but they are wrong.
I would also like to say that, as regards the plan for sustainable development, the Commission paper stresses, according to the European Environment Agency that the external cost of transport represents 8% of GNP.
I think that the Commission is right to stress that if the Council wants to respect the objectives, in particular regarding reducing pollutant emissions for private cars, then it must follow your proposals.
MrÂ Bolkestein, you have the full support of my group, but I know that this will be insufficient.
Nevertheless, we continue to battle on together; we will get there one day.
Â Â  Madam President, I was driving through Luxembourg this afternoon.
As befits a true Dutchman, I always fill up there, paying Luxembourg prices.
Normally, I fill up in the Netherlands, but if I travel through Luxembourg on my way to Strasbourg anyway, it does work out as more cost-effective.
According to the Commissionâs explanatory note to the harmonisation proposal, countless drivers drive extra miles to fill up cheaper elsewhere.
This strikes me as illogical and certainly not a reason for tabling a far-reaching proposal for harmonisation.
I therefore find this proposal very worrying.
My first objection is that the proposal is not in keeping with other proposals for tackling environmental problems as a result of mobility and transport.
In addition, I regard the proposed harmonisation of excise duty on fuel as an undesirable measure in view of the Member Statesâ sovereignty in the area of taxation.
MrsÂ Kauppi is right to note that any taxation competition is healthy as it is.
I have therefore joined with Mrs Lulling and MrsÂ Villiers in proposing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to reject the proposal, and we have been backed by a large majority.
I urge my fellow MEPs to follow our position and reject the proposal for harmonisation.
Finally, I should like to ask Commissioner Bolkestein what the Commission will do when Parliament rejects the proposal?
I would appreciate a concrete response.
Â Â  â Madam President, I cannot but endorse the rapporteurâs view, as Europe needs more fiscal competition rather than less of it.
The average tax rate in Europe already stands at over 40%, which is markedly higher than in Japan and the USA, and with its consequences we are all familiar.
We have to contend with rising unemployment, fewer enterprises being set up, and declining levels of investment.
The Commission is aware of these facts, yet it nevertheless advocates the introduction of tax increases, taking away the dirty work from the Member Statesâ finance ministers, who increase the taxes and shuffle off responsibility onto the EU.
Doing this would be simple if we were to jointly commit ourselves to making the internal market a reality and were to ensure that the competition rules were not cut back.
As the Member States would have to commit themselves to slimmed-down structures, this would automatically reduce their administrative obstacles and taxes.
If we do not seize this opportunity, Europe will become an ever-expanding giant, but one enfeebled and dried out.
It could also mean a great idea running into the buffers.
This would be a pity, as we need a strong Europe.
Â Â  âMadam President,the Commission has chosen an inopportune time to put before us a complex and completely superfluous proposal for special rules applicable to the taxation of diesel fuel.
Over and above that, it seeks to completely harmonise duties on diesel for commercial purposes by 2010, which would end up amounting, for most Member States, to a tax increase and therefore an increase in the price of diesel.
It is, moreover, proposed â without considering the devastating effects on diesel technology â to raise the tax rate on diesel to the level of that on unleaded petrol.
As our rapporteur has already described, that is completely absurd.
Faced with the Commissionâs regrettably uncompromising attitude towards the amendments proposed in a spirit of goodwill by our rapporteur MrsÂ Kauppi, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of whom I am one, voted by a massive majority â of twenty-three votes and two abstentions â to reject the Commission proposal in its entirety, and it did so for the many good reasons to which reference has already been made.
The result of the Commission proposal would be a complicated system of rebates, one that would be bureaucratic, expensive and practically unworkable.
It would leave us wide open to further tax fraud, with which we are already familiar in the context of VAT, and I personally agree with what our rapporteur has already said, namely that healthy fiscal competition is desirable and helpful in terms of stimulating economic growth; I certainly do not believe that it distorts competition in the internal market.
What is the point of imposing even higher taxes on our businesses at a time when the economic environment has for some years been characterised by stagnation and unemployment?
Such a thing is absurd, and I hope that the Commission will listen to our rapporteur and will put before us a complete and properly thought-out package to coordinate, among other things, the tax treatment of fuel and charges for the use of infrastructures.
Â Â  Madam President, the Commission initiatives on harmonising taxation of vehicles and fuels are broadly justified and are to be welcomed.
They are justified because they constitute an essential factor for the smooth operation of the internal market, by attempting to eliminate or alleviate the anomalous situation of vehicle and fuel markets that are enormously segmented.
These initiatives are to be welcomed because they systematically prioritise an approach that takes account of the environmental impact of traffic.
Transport and mobility are, today, crucial factors for the pricing of goods and services and it is, therefore, crucial that in no way do they constitute breaches of competition.
This does not mean, however, that there can now be complete harmonisation of fuel taxation even if this is spread over time.
A degree of competition in taxation is, of course, perfectly acceptable if it leads to tangible benefits for consumers.
The ultimate aim of all Community initiatives and proposals for initiatives must be to meet the needs of Europeâs citizens, either by making goods available and guaranteeing their quality, by ensuring the environmental sustainability of societies or by gradually reducing the costs of accessing this type of goods.
This proposal, in this specific wording, does not look as though it will help to achieve significant results in the field of environmental protection and could even lead to pressure to raise prices.
Furthermore, an initiative of this nature can only be accepted by the Council if it is integrated and coordinated with the directive on the taxation of energy products and with the proposal for a framework directive on infrastructure charging.
The political complexity of this issue and the difficulties in managing, in the context of this directive, the administrative aspects of its implementation, specifically those concerning the distinction between fuel used for commercial purposes and fuel for private use, and the consequent return or refund of duties, justify the reserved standpoint of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The Commission must view the possible rejection of this proposal, however, as a spur for drawing up a new draft that takes account of the suggestions and proposals made in the European Parliament, respecting the immediate interest of the citizens and contributing to overcoming the inevitable resistance of some Member States.
Â Â  . Some Members of Parliament have spoken about competition in the fiscal area.
Indeed they have spoken about fiscal 'sovereignty'.
I should like to read out Article 93 of the Treaty.
The text I have in front of me is in French.
âThe Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament [âŠ] adopt provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties [âŠ] to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market [âŠ]â.
The English text says that 'the Council shall establish measures'.
The word 'shall' indicates that the Council has no choice but to harmonise the excise duties insofar as they are an obstacle to the internal market.
So do not tell the Commission that this is anything to do with fiscal sovereignty.
Article 93 of the Treaty says that the Council must harmonise excise taxes if they are an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market.
The question is then raised as to whether there is an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market.
Mr Blokland said that he did not think it logical for lorries and cars to go out of their way to go to Luxembourg to fill up with diesel.
Let me give you some figures.
These figures pertain to diesel sales per head of population. They run as follows: 610 litres for Belgium, 531 for Denmark, 424 for Spain and 536 for France.
These figures are all in the area of 400 to 500 to 600 litres per head of population.
Then there is Luxembourg.
Where the amounts in all other Member States do not go over 640 â this is the figure for Austria â in Luxembourg the figure is 3Â 106.
Now why should that be the case?
It is quite simply because the excise duties in Luxembourg are dreadfully low, and therefore it is an open and shut case that there is a distortion of the internal market here. There is not a shadow of a doubt about that.
If Mr Blokland says that is not very logical then I am afraid I cannot follow the logic of Mr Blokland.
In my view it is perfectly logical that lorries and cars go out of their way to line up in Luxembourg.
If you travel to Luxembourg you will see the long line of lorries all trying to fill up with that cheap diesel.
So there is no doubt that there is a distortion of the internal market here.
That is one of the reasons why the Commission is making this proposal, which is to be considered by the Council after Parliament has given its opinion.
The second reason â and Mr Jonckheer was very eloquent in pointing this out â is that the implementation of this proposal will lead to a general reduction in emissions of pollutants, such as NOx, volatile organic compounds, SO2 and particulates.
There will also be a reduction in CO2 emissions.
That is the reason that the environmental NGOs support this proposal.
MrÂ Jonckheer is quite right in pointing this out to his colleagues.
He ended his speech by saying that his support will probably not be sufficient.
I am not so pessimistic.
I think that after this debate many Members of Parliament will realise that there is a distortion of competition, that harmonising excise duties on diesel is good for the environment, and that Article 93 lays the obligation â not the choice â on the Council to do it. That is also what the Commission is trying to do.
Furthermore, it is far from the intention of the Commission to go for an increase in taxes.
That is the last thing the Commission would like to do.
Member States are perfectly free to cut their taxes elsewhere if they have to increase the excise taxes on diesel.
So do not think that the Commission wants to do that. It is certainly not the case.
As regards the situation of the future Member States, may I stress that during the enlargement negotiations, all the future Member States agreed to apply the current minimum rates on motor fuels as of 1 May 2004, the date on which they will become Member States.
Most of them, except the Baltic States, are already at levels above those rates.
Mr Blokland asked me what my reaction would be if Parliament were to reject this proposal.
Once again, this is not something I expect.
However, if that were the case, then, in accordance with the arrangements between Parliament and the Commission, I shall raise the issue in the College of Commissioners in order to consider carefully the Commission's position under those circumstances.
Lastly, on the amendments, as I have already said, the Commission could accept the creation of an indexed fluctuation band for excise duties applicable to commercial diesel as a second-best solution.
It could also accept the alignment of the present proposal with the terms of the energy tax directive, in particular as far as the definition of commercial diesel and tax rates are concerned.
Therefore, the Commission agrees in principle with Amendments 1, 3 to 12 and 14 to 16.
Amendments 2 and 13 are acceptable in part, subject to some rewording when they refer to establishing a connection between this directive and the directive on infrastructure charging.
The Commission does not support Amendment 17 because the proposed rates are not consistent with the energy tax directive.
The proposal may look complicated but it is dead simple.
It is beneficial to the environment.
It goes against the distortion of the internal market as it has to in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty.
Â Â  âMadam President,because Commissioner Bolkestein has used what I have to describe as intellectually dishonest comparisons to pillory my country and has presumed to describe our taxes as far too low, I must, with some regret, put him right on some points.
I do not know how good Commissioner Bolkestein was at geography in primary school, but I have to point out that Luxembourg just happens to be where it is, and when Mr Blokland travels from Holland to Strasbourg, he is not indulging in âgasoline tourismâ if he does so by way of Luxembourg.
That is the easiest way to get here, and it just so happens that he has to fill up his tank .
That, after all, is one of the common marketâs freedoms â free movement of goods, of capital, of people, and so on â and it is one of these fundamental freedoms, the free movement of goods and services, that the Commission is now seeking to jeopardise.
I would also like to point out that, every day, 100Â 000 people cross the border into Luxembourg every day to work, coming from Belgium, Germany and France.
They are entitled to fill up their tanks there.
We are creating jobs for 100Â 000 commuters across national borders, who would otherwise be hanging around on the street in France and in Belgium.
Your arguments, Commissioner, do not hold water, and I find it regrettable that you have presumed to adduce them.
Â Â  . Madam President, what would a debate be without a last intervention from MrsÂ Lulling?
It would not give me the same warm feeling, the feeling that I have now.
Thank you very much for your contribution, MrsÂ Lulling, but would you please explain to me why Luxembourg's diesel consumption is 500% higher than Austria's, the next highest in the list?
If you can explain that to me, then perhaps I will change my proposals.
But you cannot explain.
It is quite simply because the excise taxes in Luxembourg are very low. It is an open-and-shut case.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.

Â Â  â We were all deeply shocked at the tragic news of the bomb attack on the Italian base in Nasiriya on 12 November 2003 and the death toll that now stands at 27 people: 19 Italians, 8 Iraqis and many wounded.
Those young men and women, dedicated , were enthusiastic and committed to their mission, which was to assure peace and relieve the suffering of the population in that war-torn region.
19 have now returned to their homeland in coffins shrouded with the Italian tricolour.
I have already expressed, on your behalf, our sympathy to the families of those victims, to the President of the Italian Republic, Mr Ciampi, to the Prime Minister, MrÂ Berlusconi, to the Defence Minister, Mr Martino, to the police and armed forces, and of course to the people of Italy.
Our hearts also go out to those wounded in this attack, for their personal suffering and the tragic loss of their friends and colleagues.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I express our profound indignation and utter condemnation of this attack.
Let us pay homage on this day of national mourning in Italy, to the bravery, courage and dedication of the Italian and soldiers who laid down their lives in Iraq for peace and freedom.
I ask you to observe one minute's silence in their memory.

Â Â  â The first item is the Commission statement on its legislative and work programme for 2004 and the Oral Question on Eurostat (PPE-DE: O-0067/2003 â B5-0415/2003).
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last time during this legislature that I will address Parliament on the state of the Union.
It is a solemn occasion in the work of our institutions, when, traditionally, we take stock of the situation and cast an eye together over the work the Commission plans to do in the coming year.
I am sad to say that, this year, our hearts and minds are greatly troubled by the tragic events that have dominated the news in recent days.
I am referring to the series of acts of violence that have sown terror and grief in Iraq and Turkey.
At this moment, your and my thoughts are with those mourning in Italy, to whom we extend the sympathy of all the people of Europe at the death of the 19 young men on a peace mission.
Our thoughts are also with those mourning in Turkey and the Jewish communities, and with all those suffering throughout the world as a result of terrorist attacks.
I know I can speak for the whole of the Commission when I express my deepest sympathy for all the women, men and children who have been affected by these tragedies.
Ladies and gentlemen, the problems we experience every day show us that, despite these difficult moments, the Union is in good health, notwithstanding the Eurosceptics and the unexpected critics.
The situation is not easy because we are in a period of transition that is both delicate and complex, but a larger and stronger Union is within our reach.
We have come through two difficult years for the economy but the latest indicators suggest that we are leaving this negative period behind.
There are widespread expectations that economic activity will pick up over the second half of this year and then speed up in 2004.
The worst seems to be over: business and consumer confidence is rising and optimism is, at last, starting to grow among European operators.
Economies are also recovering in other regions of the world outside the Union.
In the United States, monetary and fiscal stimuli and an increase in productivity are keeping growth rates high.
However, there are some concerns about the deficit, which could grow further next year as a result of the tax cuts and the cost of the conflict in Iraq.
In Japan, the prospects, at last, look good and the trend in the other Asian economies remains positive, with growth forecast at 6.7% for next year.
There are also positive signs coming from the countries about to join the Union. In response to the general recovery in Europe and the prospect of enlargement, growth in these countries is expected to reach 3.8% next year.
This is another sign that the political decisions taken to support the unification of the continent were right.
The recovery is still fragile, however, as I said, and we need to speed up implementation of the Lisbon agenda and continue our structural reforms.
The European Initiative for Growth, on which the Commission has been working since the start of the year, has now taken shape.
It provides for public and private investment to spark growth and employment.
Bolstered by the support it received at the October European Council, our initial proposal has become a genuine road map with clearly-defined actions and deadlines for the elimination of the financial and, above all, regulatory and administrative obstacles that discourage investment. The Initiative also includes the quick-start list, which consists of a series of projects that are or will soon be ready for launching.
We have worked closely with the European Investment Bank and identified 56Â projects in the fields of transport networks, energy, telecommunications and research.
When drawing up the list, we applied a number of very clear criteria. Firstly, they are projects at an advanced stage of development that can be launched immediately.
Secondly, all these projects have a significant cross-border impact. Finally, we have selected projects that can have a multiplier effect on investment, particularly private investment, but which will have little environmental impact.
We have also undertaken to promote highly innovative projects in the field of research and development.
As regards funding, total investment â public and private â will come to approximately EURÂ 10Â billion a year between now and 2010.
Private-sector involvement will vary from project to project.
However, as an overall guideline, we expect 60% of the capital needed to fund the projects to come from the public sector and 40% from private investors.
This means that about EURÂ 6Â billion a year will come from the Union and national budgets.
That is the equivalent of approximately 0.05% of the Unionâs GDP, and you will agree that is a very cheap price to pay to give the European economy a beneficial kick-start, a price that is perfectly compatible with the Stability and Growth Pact.
What are the stages of this Initiative of ours?
The first stage is the December European Council, which will need to approve it.
Then the Member States will need to reform their administrations and regulations, which are often the real obstacle preventing these projects from being implemented.
In particular, that will make it easier to involve the private sector.
I therefore call on the Member States to coordinate their national and regional spending plans with the European Initiative to maximise the impact of the investments.
The legislative and work programme for the coming year coincides, ladies and gentlemen, with the major changes for the European Union.
I will just remind you of the key dates for the institutions: on 1Â May, 10 new Member States will officially join the Union, the elections will take place in June and the current Commissionâs term of office will end on 31Â October 2004.
The programme I am presenting to you today is intended to complete the achievement of the strategic objectives that this Commission set itself for its term of office.
In view of the fact that next year will be a special year, it consists of only 73Â new proposals; this may seem a lot but it is far fewer than in previous years.
The proposals cover the political priorities that were discussed in depth in our structured dialogue with Parliament and the Council between March and June.
The main priority is to give shape to the future of the enlarged Union.
It is based on two cornerstone objectives: ensuring the success of accession and preparing the political ground for the new Financial Perspective.
As regards stability, we will need to develop a neighbourhood policy to create a ring of friends around the new borders of Europe.
We must also complete the Tampere agenda by 1Â MayÂ 2004 to complete the area of freedom, security and justice.
With regard to the third priorityÂ âÂ growth â we need to speed up our progress towards the Lisbon objectives.
From an operational point of view, the programme incorporates the objectives contained in the new interinstitutional agreement with a view to streamlining legislative activity.
For example, we have brought our proposals into line with the Unionâs annual and multiannual programming and we undertake to apply the integrated impact assessment process to all the most important initiatives.
As regards stability and security, at the Thessaloniki Summit, we presented a series of proposals on justice and home affairs and laid the foundations for a new neighbourhood policy.
The proposals presented on economic matters concentrated on the Lisbon strategy, on completion of the single market, on research and on trans-European networks.
At this point, we should not forget the recently-adopted legislative framework for the chemical sector.
It has to be said, however, that the workload has been extremely heavy this year and the Commission has not been able to complete all the tasks it set itself.
For this reason, the programme for 2004 includes some uncompleted initiatives.
I would like to express the appreciation of the whole College for the excellent cooperation of the European Parliament in the planning exercise.
The structured dialogue has proved to be an excellent instrument but there is always room for improvement and that is necessary.
Bearing in mind the deadlines that will affect both of our institutions next year, the Commission will work closely together with Parliament to improve our relationship.
In particular, we propose replacing the current methods of dialogue with an exchange of views between the Conference of Presidents and Vice-President deÂ Palacio in April; using the written procedure for the mid-term evaluation for the programme and, lastly, deferring the presentation of the programme for 2005 â which will be the responsibility of the next Commission â until the DecemberÂ 2004 part-session, which will allow us to coordinate our work.
Lastly, we have conducted an initial evaluation of the internal reforms that have modernised our financial and personnel management.
The serious irregularities in past management of the Unionâs statistical office, Eurostat, have given us much food for thought and led us to re-examine the situation, which has resulted in our proposing a plan of action that I would now like to outline to you.
I am sorry this speech is so long, but this is an important section.
On 25Â September 2003, I gave my views on the Eurostat affair to a meeting of the Conference of Presidents.
I gave my assessment of the facts, as revealed by the investigations conducted by OLAF and the extensive work done by the Commission departments.
I did, however, accept that breakdowns in our communication system â between OLAF and the rest of the Commission, and between the Director-General of Eurostat and his Commissioner â had meant that the Commission was unable to take all the necessary precautionary measures earlier.
I therefore promised to present you with an action plan to remedy them.
After that meeting, the internal auditor produced the final report and presented it to Cocobu.
It does not contain anything new which might alter my analysis.
In short, it is quite clear that the most serious events took place before 1999, that the reorganisation exercise started in 2000 and that Eurostat, Financial Control and other sources involved OLAF very swiftly on the main aspects of this affair.
In any case, the Commission was only in a position to act as of May 2003 because of a number of communication breakdowns at various levels, which I have identified.
We took decisive action; we could have moved more quickly, and that is why we are presenting to you an action plan.
The plan is based on the fundamental principles of the reform, and the key points include the functional independence of OLAF, the new Financial Regulation, which came into force in JanuaryÂ 2003, the new Staff Regulations, the provisions concerning rights and obligations and the codes of conduct.
All these reforms have been introduced gradually.
As I stated on 25Â September, it would be unfair to judge the reform, with its successes and its inadequacies, as if everything had been completely operational as early as 2000.
Rather, the period 2000-2003 must be seen as a transitional period.
However, this same Eurostat case is an illustration of just how necessary it was, particularly as regards matters such as mobility for sensitive posts, segregation of operational duties and control duties and the establishment of an internal auditor.
It is therefore a question of building on what has been achieved by the reforms, which are already bearing fruit.
We need to consolidate them, giving the political actors the means of shouldering their political responsibilities.
I would also remind you that we have taken some tough measures this summer concerning Eurostat itself: the Director-General has been replaced; the Operational Director posts have been advertised both inside and outside the institution; a new Resources Director has been transferred; the organisation chart has been overhauled, etc.; lastly, a high degree of mobility has been applied to Unit Head posts.
In the same vein, I felt it was necessary, as a first step, to amend the code of conduct governing relations between the Commissioners and their departments, which dates from 1999.
Although the general principles which formed the basis of the code in 1999 should be maintained, in particular the principle of non-interference in management, more emphasis should be placed on the Commissioners' political responsibility, which covers not only their own actions but also those of their departments.
The revised code of conduct will therefore include a whole series of provisions improving the flow of information to Commissioners to ensure that they are in a position to exercise this responsibility properly, so that they can supervise their departments' work and give them general instructions, including instructions relating to financial management.
The code will also lay down a specific procedure for formally referring matters to the Commissioner, so that the Director-General can immediately draw the Commissioner's attention to any fact or development that might involve the Commissionerâs political responsibility or that of the College as a whole.
Secondly, I would also like to respond to another question thrown up by the Eurostat affair.
It actually seems that certain signals and pieces of information emerged in various parts of our institution concerning this affair well before May 2003.
Taken in isolation, these signals were not such as to alert us to the gravity of the situation.
Had they been centralised and analysed as a whole, we would not have had to wait for the first substantive information from OLAF before taking precautionary measures.
I have therefore decided to introduce a new systemfor collecting and cross-checking all information relating to allegations of fraud, irregularities or wrongdoing, for analysing this information and for informing either the Commission or the Commissioner responsible, as appropriate, so that they can take any administrative, financial or other measures necessary, in particular to protect the financial interests of the Union.
I have decided to take responsibility for the political supervision of this system myself, with the help of Mr Neil Kinnock and Mrs Michaele Schreyer.
The preparatory work will be carried out at administrative level by a group of officials of the rank of Director-General, coordinated by the Secretary-General.
This system will enable us, in particular, to provide better follow-up to information received from OLAF, IDOC and the IAS.
Clearly, the idea is not to carry out additional investigations or to usurp the role of the policy-makers or administrators, who will continue to be responsible for keeping a close watch on management and responding appropriately to the information and investigation reports they receive.
It will serve primarily as a watchdog and early warning system.
Thirdly,I have decided to improve the information channels between the central services and the operational departments, strengthening links, improving certain practices and following up some of the suggestions made in the internal auditor's report.
These are essentially technical measures, but I believe they are very important for improving the flow of information and strengthening the systems of checks and balances. I described these measures to Cocobu earlier today.
To conclude this reflection on the Eurostat affair, I will now come to OLAF.
Everyone acknowledges that the present situation is, in a number of respects, unsatisfactory.
OLAF is a Commission department, but it conducts its investigations in total independence.
It is in complete charge of the decisions it takes in the course of its operational activities.
That is also as we intended.
Nevertheless, the current legal framework remains vague on whether or not it must pass on information to the institutions or persons concerned by an investigation.
This has proved damaging in the Eurostat case.
I want to dispel all doubts with this analysis of OLAF: its Director-General, Mr Brunner, enjoys my full confidence.
I am analysing the way the institution is organised, not criticising the work of the Director-General, who took the right action in this case.
The Commission is in the awkward situation of having to take political and legal responsibility for OLAF's work without actually having the means to exercise that responsibility, and it is also legally responsible for OLAF in any court actions that may be brought against it, for example claims for damages by individuals who feel their rights have been infringed.
I had proposed to Parliament, in connection with the plans for a European Public Prosecutor, that OLAF be given full independence within a clear political framework.
That is still my objective.
Further work on making OLAF an entirely external body must remain on our agenda.
However, in order to resolve the current operational problems swiftly, I would like to propose immediate steps which will entail amendments to the OLAF Regulation, the aim being to have them adopted by the present Parliament. We have to do something to give our successors a legal framework in which they can work with peace of mind.
The need to strengthen the regulatory framework has also been expressed by the OLAF Supervisory Committee and in the work in progress in Cocobu, in particular in MrÂ BÃ¶sch's report. The Commission is taking this into account.
I would now like to lay before you the main aspects of the improvements we are planning. Firstly, strengthening OLAF's operational independence by refocusing its activities as appropriate, particularly with a view to enlargement.
There might be a case here for reassigning to Commission departments certain horizontal tasks that are unrelated to investigations.
Secondly, allowing OLAF to concentrate on its priorities.
To this end, we must lay down and enshrine in the Regulation a principle whereby action is taken as appropriate and discretion is exercised.
This will allow OLAF to pass on to the appropriate authorities the task of following up cases which are of minor significance or lie outside its priority activities and will also make for speedier and more effective investigations.
I would specify here that the decision on whether or not to open investigations must always remain with OLAF.
Thirdly, clearer rules on the flow of information between OLAF and the institutions and bodies concerned.
We shall also have to look into how this information is handled by the institutions involved.
We need to strike a better balance between safeguarding the effectiveness of investigations and protecting the Union's financial interests with precautionary measures.
Light will also have to be shed on the question of ultimate responsibility for decisions taken.
Fourthly, amendments to the Regulation will also cover safeguards for the rights of the defence, an issue of fundamental importance.
Fifthly, at the same time, we need to take a fresh look at the governance of OLAF both in terms of beefing up the role and make-up of its Supervisory Committee and in terms of setting up an interinstitutional Administrative Board.
To sum up, I am proposing to increase the effectiveness of OLAFÂ âÂ as it faces a growing workload in an enlarged UnionÂ âÂ by increasing its staff resources, refocusing its tasks on its investigative function and amending the Regulation, and to make OLAF more accountable.
Mr President, here, then, are the basic lines of the action plan I am proposing to launch in response to the questions raised by the Eurostat affair.
A communication will be adopted by the end of the year.
As for the internal measures within the Commission, I expect to have them adopted as of December.
Moreover, I hope that our contacts with Parliament will be advanced enough for us to table a legislative proposal on OLAF that has a reasonable chance of being adopted by Parliament and which takes us forward towards the idea of the European Prosecutor, which we all continue to support.
Mr President, I began my address by stressing the major challenges that lie before us in 2004.
To these I should, of course, add the Intergovernmental Conference.
Of the many issues on the table, I wish to focus today on just one, the composition of the Commission.
It is claimed in many quarters that a Commission with 25 or more members would be unworkable, but I want to tell you now that, next year, we will be putting that idea to the test because, for a period of six months, we will be welcoming colleagues from the new Member States and the Commission will be composed of 30 members.
Of course, this will be a transitional situation in which no new portfolios will be created and it will last only until the end of this Commission's term of office: from 1Â NovemberÂ 2004 onwards we will have 25 Commissioners.
I am convinced that, whether it has 25Â or 30Â members, the Commission will be able to function extremely well.
In the first place, the Treaty of Nice already guarantees the coherence of an enlarged Commission, and the President of the forthcoming Commission will have increased powers to organise, direct and monitor its work.
In the second place, I do not agree that the Commission's tasks break down to a dozen or so portfolios.
We must not forget that Commissioners also serve as the face of Europe with regard to public opinion in their countries of origin, and this will be even more important for the citizens of the new Member States.
Lastly, the effectiveness of the Commission depends not on the number of its members but on the way in which its resources are used.
The reforms we have introduced over the last few years have already brought positive results here.
Thus, collective responsibility and the consistency of the Commission's work remain central to my concerns, therefore.
An enlarged Commission undoubtedly presents a number of challenges, but the idea of a two-tier Commission, in which half the Commissioners would have a secondary role, does not provide the answer.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken of short-term commitments, but my Commission is already looking further ahead.
Early this year, we launched a wide-ranging debate on the new Financial Perspective.
In 2007, the Union could comprise 28 Member States and around half a billion citizens, and it will have a new constitutional framework.
Clearly, therefore, discussions must start right now if all the instruments are to be operational by the end of 2006.
Past experience has shown us that there is no time to spare.
In preparing for the future, politics should call the shots because, before we begin working out the accounts we have to decide what we want the overall framework for the Union's policies to be.
We must keep our eyes fixed on our objectives: peace, sustainable development, solidarity and freedom.
In practical terms, this means that we must work along the following lines: a road map for the Lisbon and Gothenburg agenda; solidarity between countries and regions to help those who are lagging behind; European citizenship in an area that has developed from a marketplace into a political area; the external dimension of our model and our policy choices, starting with the neighbouring countries with which we must build a ring of friends.
It is important that thislegislature â the legislature that has brought the enlargement process to its conclusion â should be involved in establishing the policy lines for the enlarged Union.
In conclusion, Mr President, 2004 will be a year of challenges, renewal and undertakings.
The European elections will provide an invaluable opportunity to gauge the extent to which citizens are participating in our venture.
Against such a backdrop, the Commission is aware that it acts as a point of reference providing the system with continuity, stability and dynamism.
We are committed to striving together with Parliament, the Council and all the other Union institutions to make a success of our appointment with history.
Together, we can build a greater, more independent, stronger Union.
Â Â  . â Mr. President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, as part of the proceedings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, we listened with great interest to the presentation by the Commission of its Legislative and Work Programme for 2004, which has been formally presented to the European Parliament today by President Prodi.
The major institutional events in the Unionâs calendar in 2004 give this programme a particular significance. Indeed, 2004 will be a year of great changes.
First of all, we have the signing of the new Constitutional Treaty, which will lay the foundations for the future development of the Union.
Next year will also see the European Parliament electionsÂ âÂ which, for the first time, will also involve the citizens and candidates of the 10 new Member States. On 1 November 2004, the new Commission will take up full office.
Finally, next year will see the start of the negotiations for the definition of the next Financial Perspective, which will be decisive in orienting European Union policy in the coming years.
Although the Council has not yet set out its position with respect to the Commission programme, it certainly agrees with â and is ready to subscribe to â the three main priorities identified by the Community executive: enlargement, stability and sustainable growth.
The Council has taken note of the objectives established by the Commission, as well as the initiatives and proposals it intends to present during 2004 in order to implement these priorities.
Taking into account the institutional events of the coming year, the legislative work will need to be as focused as possible, and the Presidency is therefore pleased to note the Commissionâs undertaking to concentrate first and foremost on the initiatives considered to be most essential.
I would also like to emphasise that, even more than in the past, the cooperation between the Council and Parliament will be decisive in ensuring that the Commissionâs legislative proposals are adopted within the hoped-for timescale.
The Council is pleased to note that the Commission has implemented in full the new impact assessment procedure.
Indeed, as the European Council stressed in October, this procedure is extremely important if we are to avoid the situation arising where European Union legislation makes the Union less competitive than other major economic areas of the world.
The Presidency is also extremely pleased to note that the Commissionâs annual programming exercise has been carried out within the framework of the structured interinstitutional dialogue.
The dialogue between the Commission, on the one hand, and the Council and Parliament, on the other, which was initiated on the basis of the Commission Communication on Annual Policy Strategy, makes it possible for these two institutions to ensure that their point of view on the proposals put forward by the Community executive for the following year is taken into account, before the final version of the legislative and work programme is drawn up.
I therefore feel that I must stress at this point that the sooner the Annual Policy Strategy is presented, the more fruitful this exercise is likely to be.
More specifically, its timely presentation would enable the discussion of budgetary procedures to be developed on the basis of the results of the structured dialogue with Parliament and the Council.
Even though, as I have said, the Council has not yet defined its position as regards the Commissionâs work programme, it will, of course, take it into account in drawing up its own work programme.
In this connection, I wish to remind you that, in accordance with the reforms approved by the Seville European Council, the aim of which is to ensure greater continuity and consistency in the Councilâs work, the six delegations that will be holding the Council Presidency over the coming three years are drawing up a multiannual strategic programme that will be adopted by the December European Council.
I would also like to mention here that the future â Irish and Dutch â Presidencies, which will have the task next year of steering the work of the Council on the Commissionâs initiatives for 2004, are already working on drawing up the next annual programme for the CouncilÂ âÂ as, I remember, was done by the Greek and Italian Presidencies for the current year.
Parliament will, of course, be informed at the earliest possible date of the results of this work so that it can put forward its own observations, as envisaged by the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, lastly, I would like, if I may, to take the opportunity provided by this debate on the Commissionâs programme to say a few very brief words on the goals of the Italian Presidency with a view to the December European Council, a subject to which I shall, of course, return with you in more detail during the next plenary session in Brussels.
The decisions adopted at the December Summit will, to a certain extent, reflect the priorities established by the Commission and will, therefore, be able to help us achieve the objectives set for 2004.
As regards enlargement, the December European Council will be called upon, first and foremost, to evaluate the progress achieved in the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, on the basis of the reports and strategy papers presented recently by the Commission, and thus to establish the timescale for the conclusion of the membership negotiations with these two countries.
Again on the basis of the Commission report, the European Council will also be called upon to assess the progress made by the 10 accession countries in the adoption and application of the Community .
As regards the stability objective, as defined in the Commissionâs programme, where internal actions are concerned, the Council will need to assess the progress made in terms of asylum, migration and external borders, especially in the light of the timetable drawn up in Thessaloniki, Seville and Tampere.
As regards external issues, the European Council will be called upon to adopt the European Security Strategy drawn up by the Secretary General/High Representative, to address the question of weapons of mass destruction and to evaluate the progress made in ESDP.
The Heads of State or Government will also approve a detailed work programme for the Commission and the Secretary General/High Representative on relations with the Arab world.
Lastly, on the subject of sustainable growth, the European Council will need to adopt tangible decisions on the Growth Initiative, especially where the quick-start programme is concerned, and will receive a report from the Commission containing proposals for the reinforcement of the production framework, with a view to preventing deindustrialisation.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish to express our sense of grief for the murdered Italian soldiers and and also the Iraqi citizens who fell victim to this hideous crime.
We also wish to voice our outrage at the criminals in Istanbul and convey our respects and sympathy to the families and survivors there.
There are situations in political life when one would gladly avoid making certain statements or adopting a particular type of speech.
Unfortunately, however, I have no choice but to make my views plain, and I do so calmly and objectively, as I do not wish to create even more waves in Italyâs public debate after the events of last week.
Mr Prodi, you deemed it appropriate to launch a political manifesto in Italy last week.
This manifesto, Mr Prodi, is not our problem, although it could be argued that if you present a comprehensive policy programme, this should not be in response to a countryâs domestic political situation; the place for this would have been the European Parliament.
That also needs to be said, ...
... but that is not my main point.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, you will undoubtedly have an opportunity to express your views.
As a democrat, kindly let me express mine.
My main point of criticism, Mr Prodi, is that you have engaged in party politics.
You have called on a specific political movement, namely the Italian left, to join forces, thus creating ...
... the impression that there are on the one side people who are pro-reform and pro-Europe, while on the other side there are those who are not pro-Europe.
Let me say, on behalf of my group, that every single member of our group shares the passion for Europe, and we should not drive a wedge between Europeans, neither in Italy nor in Europe.
Nor can it be claimed that this was a declaration made in a private capacity, for it comes from the President of the Commission.
Anyone who is the Commission President always acts on behalf of all Europeans.
I share the view of our fellow MEP Mr BarÃ³n Crespo: if the Commission President heads the list for the European elections, he must resign from office.
In fact, Mr President, my comments in prompted you, ...
... finally to make it clear that you will remain in office until the end of your term on 1 November 2004.
We welcome this clarification, but even members of your Commission were still saying last week that there were rumours you might be standing as a list candidate in the European elections.
Thankfully, you have now clarified your position.
Nonetheless, this state of affairs â this rumour mill â has also harmed the Commission and I mention it here because it needs to be mentioned.
Anyone who holds high office in the European Union should always bear in mind that every time they speak, they do so for the European Union as a whole.
Indeed, if had called me to ask me about the statements made by the President of the European Council on Chechnya, I would still have said that I did not agree with the sort of declaration you have issued.
We are trying to be objective.
We want to serve Europe, and that is why we must not divide Europe.
Mr Prodi, let me remind you that on 15 September 1999, you were appointed with the support and trust of our group, even though you do not belong to our political family.
We gave your Commission our trust, even though the majority of your Commissioners â contrary to the outcome of the elections â do not belong to our political family.
I welcome the fact that the constitutional draft states that in future, the outcome of the European elections will be taken into account when a candidate is proposed for the office of Commission President.
Commissioner Solbes, I hope to hear a word or two on the stability of the European currency.
I believe this is an issue which you will also be addressing today, Mr Prodi.
I would like to give encouragement to your Commission and thank Commissioner Solbes in particular â whom we regard as the guarantor of European currency stability â for maintaining this course, not only towards the small countries but also the large countries in the European Union.
Mr Antonione, I particularly appreciate the fact that the representative of the Council is here today.
This should be taken as read, but this was not the case in the past.
I welcome the fact that you are here today, and I would like to give you our encouragement and call on you, at the Intergovernmental Conference, not to endorse the ideas floating around in some finance ministersâ minds, namely to reduce the rights of this House on budgetary issues, which we will resist resolutely.
I would ask you to make it plain that you side with the European Parliament on this issue and that we want equality between this House and the Council of Ministers on the European Union budget.
Let me conclude with comments which I make with a great deal of personal regard, as the Commission President is aware, although personal affinity and political issues must be kept separate; criticism cannot be brushed under the carpet out of a sense of personal regard.
It is essential to speak the truth.
Mr Prodi, you are the President of all the Europeans.
You hold the highest office in the European Union.
Give us, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the opportunity to give you our trust until the end of your term in office on 1 November 2004.
If you prove that you can earn it, you will have our support.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group.
I would like to convey our condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives in recent terrorist attacks.
We stand shoulder to shoulder with the families of the Italian servicemen and of the Iraqi citizens who died.
We also wish to express our solidarity with the families of victims of the attacks on the synagogues in Istanbul.
The latter represent the Sephardi community in Turkey.
The word Sepharad means Spain in Hebrew.
It should be recalled that five centuries ago those Jewish communities found a haven of tolerance in the OttomanÂ Empire when my own country was not disposed to accept them.
Moving on, Mr President, I should like to thank MrÂ Poettering for bringing politics into this debate.
It does seem strange that we are unable to speak of politics here.
I did indeed say to the President of the Commission that he ought to resign if ever he decided to stand in the elections to the European Parliament.
I said more besides.
Firstly, the President of the Commission currently enjoys the support of practically all shades of the political spectrum in the House.
He must therefore fulfil his responsibilities.
As a citizen, however, he is entitled to make known his vision of the future of Europe.
I therefore believe that the fact that he drafted this document on the European dream is a positive development.
I should add that I find the document far superior to the speech he gave today.
This said, I detected a degree of pique in what MrÂ Poettering said.
He seemed to resent that someone who apparently belonged to one side should have defected to the other.
As I see it, one has every right to correct oneself and mature as a person as one journeys through life.
I for one welcome the fact that PresidentÂ Prodi has adopted a more socially and politically progressive stance.
There should be abundant opportunity to discuss this in the future.
In any case, between now and the last day of this legislature what we really need is a strong and determined Commission.
I would say that the same applies to the Council.
I believe the most outrageous behaviour we have witnessed during these last few days was when the PresidentÂ ofÂ theÂ Council departed totally from the line taken by the CouncilÂ ofÂ Ministers, the Commission and Parliament.
He made unacceptable pronouncements concerning Chechnya and Russia.
You all have the power to rectify the situation. We could join together when we vote tomorrow on the draft resolution on the RussiaÂ Summit.
I should now like to focus on PresidentÂ Prodiâs speech.
Firstly, I should like to say that I am not about to complain on behalf of my group about there being fewer proposals.
Our difficulty is simply that we do not know what the proposals are.
We have been informed that Vice-President deÂ Palacio plans to meet committee chairmen.
No doubt we shall find out then.
In connection with assessing the Commissionersâ politics I should just like to mention that I shall be sending MrÂ Poettering the statements made on the Socialists by MrsÂ deÂ Palacio.
It has to be said that she does not miss a single PopularÂ Party function in Spain.
MrÂ Prodi is not the only one to be active in politics back home.
We all are.
Mr Prodi resorted to expressions more commonly used by weather forecasters in order to describe growth. He stated the outlook was set fair.
I believe it would be very helpful for him to explain, on behalf of the Commission, how the latter intends to adapt the Stability and Growth Pact to the new situation.
This is a crucially important request.
It goes hand in hand with the need to strengthen economic governance.
I have also been struck by the fact that the financial perspective has been left until last, as if it were an afterthought.
The Delors plan of ten years ago has indeed been revived.
As I see it, it is important to discuss research and development, not just infrastructure.
They are the nervous system energising the whole of the Community.
I have also been struck that so little detail has been provided concerning reform of cohesion policy following the debate on the SapirÂ report and CommissionerÂ Barnierâs statements.
I believe the PresidentÂ ofÂ theÂ Commission should be much more explicit.
After all, this issue is crucial to the new MemberÂ States and also to the balance between current MemberÂ States.
Secondly, MrÂ Prodi devoted practically half of this speech to Eurostat.
I would like to suggest a number of qualifications here.
Firstly, through the CasacaÂ report, the EuropeanÂ Parliament played a decisive role in the Eurostat issue, over and above the many reports drafted within the Commission and OLAF. I believe this must be emphasised, because new instruments are being introduced whilst overlooking the crucial role played by the EuropeanÂ Parliament.
I regret the other groups in the House did not agree to debate the BÃ¶schÂ report on fraud to coincide with the Presidentâs presence.
This report is available and the President himself referred to it.
Regarding Eurostat, I note the proposal to define the nature of political responsibility and the reform of the CommissionâsÂ codeÂ ofÂ conduct.
Nonetheless, I am surprised that a new instrument amounting in practice to a duplication of OLAF is now being proposed.
I fear we may end up in a situation resembling the one illustrated by a cartoon from the Soviet era.
This cartoon showed a citizen being trailed by two KGB agents.
They were in turn being trailed by a further two agents and so on.
The line of people all minding each other went off into the distance.
This is not a case of multiplying the instruments, but of acting in a clear and democratic manner.
There is an important role for Parliament to play here.
I do not think that the situation will be resolved by creating a new power centre within the Commission.
Finding a loophole in every law is a widespread human weakness.
I believe there are sayings to this effect in every language. There is certainly one in Spanish.
It follows that bringing out more and more rules and regulations will not necessarily improve matters.
What is required is the option of specific monitoring.
In my view, the idea of establishing a link between OLAF and the EuropeanÂ Prosecutor could be a way forward.
I would like to hear the Councilâs view on this rather than the Commissionâs, since the main opposition to the EuropeanÂ Prosecutor comes from the governments.
It is not a contentious issue amongst ourselves.
MrÂ President, I therefore feel it is essential to negotiate an urgent procedure to allow these issues to be discussed before the end of this legislature.
PresidentÂ ofÂ theÂ Commission, I would like to enquire whether you were thinking of a compromise solution for the DecemberÂ ConferenceÂ Summit when you referred to 25Â orÂ 30 Commissioners.
If the two figures are added together some countries end up with two Commissioners.
My final point is the following: I should like to know if you are standing by your proposal to distribute portfolios and organise a Commission composed of so-called senior and junior Commissioners.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to join others in expressing our solidarity, sympathy and condolences for the Italian and other victims of the attack in Iraq last week and, of course, the victims of the horrific attacks on the synagogues in Istanbul.
I would like to depart from the political pyrotechnics of some of the previous interventions and focus on the subject at hand today â the annual legislative programme.
I would first like to stress that the ELDR Group defends the right of the Commission President to express himself personally on political issues concerning the future of the European Union.
I must however say that, as a Liberal who treasures the diversity and pluralism of public opinion, I have some personal doubts about the wisdom of advocating two opposing blocks in the European debate either here or, more generally, in the Member States.
Turning to the annual programme, other colleagues will speak on the Eurostat issue later.
The ELDR Group has consistently welcomed the progress made over the last few years in the way in which the Commission has presented this important document.
Only a few years ago it was nothing more than an arbitrary shopping list of legislative and non-legislative proposals.
There has been an attempt, both this year and in previous years, to include some strategic thinking and we welcome some of the recent innovations, such as the move towards more rigorous impact assessment procedures.
However, as President Prodi himself rightly indicated, there is still much room for improvement, and we would like to highlight three areas in which we consider that the document presented to us today is still seriously lacking.
Firstly, the selection of the three strategic priorities â namely enlargement, stability and growth â is fine.
However, those priorities are so open-ended it is almost impossible to imagine anyone disagreeing with them.
It is equally impossible to imagine any legislative or non-legislative proposal that would not fall under those three strategic priorities.
In other words there seems to be no real choice about what the European Commission is proposing this year, and no choice about what the strategic priorities of the European Union should be.
On the contrary, there is a risk of a very open-ended approach towards EU business because of the very open-ended nature of the three priorities themselves.
Secondly, there is no discernible link between those three vague priorities and the lengthy annexes containing legislative and non-legislative proposals.
We understand that one of the annexes â both of which include around fifty legislative proposals â is supposed to relate to the priorities, while the other is not.
Those of you who have examined the lists will have seen that they are interchangeable.
They are not clearly organised according to the priorities, but seem to have been organised artificially into two categories.
In other words, the priorities themselves do not seem to have guided the selection of legislative and non-legislative proposals before us today, which again gives a somewhat artificial tenor to the selection of the proposals presented to us.
Thirdly, as both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council have mentioned, this summer we all signed an interinstitutional agreement explicitly designed to ensure better law-making in the European Union.
The Commission explicitly committed itself, in that interinstitutional agreement, to explain fully today when it presents its annual legislative programme, firstly the choice of legislative instrument for each proposal, and secondly the choice of legal base.
There are some indications on the legal bases, in these lengthy, somewhat impenetrable annexes, but no reference whatsoever to the choice of legislative instrument.
It cannot be that, a few months after the signing of an interinstitutional agreement on better law-making, the Commission fails, at the first hurdle, to honour the promises made in that agreement.
It bodes extremely ill for the improvement of law-making for that to be the case.
This is a terrifically important moment in the political and legislative cycle in the European Union.
It is the moment when the European Commission exercises its supreme privilege and prerogative â namely the monopoly right of initiative.
That right of initiative is only ever defensible if exercised in a fully accountable, transparent manner in which motives are fully explained and political accountability is fully safeguarded.
On the basis of what we have seen today, we do not believe that to be the case.
There is still very significant room for improvement.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on behalf of my colleagues, and especially my Italian ones, in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I should like to express our deepest sympathy with the badly hit Italian and Iraqi families.
We absolutely deplore the dreadful acts carried out by the terrorist groups, and we condemn them most vigorously.
I should like to use the GUE/NGL Groupâs speaking time to talk about Eurostat, and I should like to make it quite clear that my group is not out to have the Prodi Commission dismissed because of Eurostat.
On the contrary, we should like to bring this matter to a close and give the Commission peace to do its work in its last year.
The Commission has a very ambitious work programme for 2004 with enlargement and the creation of stability and growth, not only in the EU but also in the rest of the world.
Unfortunately, the Eurostat scandal will hang like a cloud over the Commission until political responsibility for it has been assigned, so we should like to call upon MrÂ Prodi to dismiss the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat so that the Commission can be given peace to do its work.
We have now obtained the final report on Eurostat from the Internal Audit Service.
It unfortunately confirms what we have known for a long time, namely that the administration of Eurostat has been scandalous.
It has, however, been very difficult for the Internal Audit Service to establish what really went on in Eurostat.
There are no files, and most documents are missing.
It is therefore impossible to say very much about practice after 1999, but we know that the unlawful accounts were open right until the summer of last year and this year.
We know there is a strong likelihood of a considerable amount of money having gone into the wrong pockets.
We know that there is still no database of contracts.
We know that the audits have not been followed up.
We know that almost nothing has been done to tidy matters up.
We know, in other words, that Eurostatâs administration has been scandalous, including after 1999.
Is anyone taking responsibility, however?
No, apparently not.
The Santer Commission fell just under five years ago. It did so because the Group of Wise Men concluded that it was very difficult to find anyone in the Commission who was willing to take responsibility.
Following a host of reforms, we had in actual fact hoped that those times were over, but we have unfortunately been back in rather familiar territory in recent days.
After the fall of the Santer Commission, we have now obtained a new article in the Treaty. It has now become possible for the Commission President to dismiss individual Commissioners.
That is something MrÂ Prodi has chosen not to do, given that the person responsible, MrÂ Solbes, knew nothing.
MrÂ Prodi has, however, conceded that MrÂ Solbes became guilty through having taken no action.
That is, in my view and that of my group, reason enough.
Passivity and indifference are also a form of crime, and one for which responsibility must be taken.
MrÂ Prodi has today presented his action plan for Eurostat.
I am obliged to say this very clearly: my group is sick to death of action plans.
We want to see results.
We have seen a host of action plans and plans for reform over the last four years.
It is, of course, excellent to have plans for new and better procedures, and we shall naturally give our backing to such procedures.
That is just not enough, however.
The culture must be changed.
It will be so only if the President sends a clear signal to his employees.
Irregularities and fraud have consequences.
We do in fact remember some wise words from MrÂ Prodi: zero tolerance for fraud.
Fine words, but patently of no consequence.
Less than a short hour ago, I issued a piece of advice in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
It was that another Commissioner should be found to take over Eurostat in the last year, with MrÂ Solbes otherwise retaining his areas of responsibility.
He gets bottom marks for his administration of Eurostat, however.
With his passivity, he has been a party to maintaining a culture of systematic disarray and irregularities.
He can, in other words, no longer have responsibility for Eurostat, and I now really do hope that the promise of consequences and of zero tolerance for fraud will be fulfilled and someone else found to take care of Eurostat.
Â Â  Mr President, my group, too, would like to express its sorrow and sympathy after the tragic events of recent days.
It was silly to think that an unfounded war could miraculously produce peace and democracy.
The Middle East is a daily reminder that one of the reasons that peace and democracy now seem increasingly distant possibilities is the international communityâs inability to achieve genuine cohesion.
The Commission President started his speech today with an optimistic reference to the economy and told us that the goal of a larger Europe which is capable of responding to the challenges of our time is within our reach.
I agree, but I am afraid that, in some cases, the methods proposed reflect a somewhat conformist political and economic approach which is not centred on the most innovative and bold options open to the Union today.
Mr Poettering, I can assure you that the approach underpinning the work programme is identical to that of President Prodiâs manifesto.
Since our business is politics and we consider ourselves to be a genuinely European political force, our considerations apply to both documents.
As the Commission itself admits, it has pursued only the economic aspects of the Lisbon strategy with any determination.
President Prodi, that is not good enough!
We fear that behind the politically correct concept of sustainable development lurks the concept of continuous development.
The environmental dimension continues to do a disappearing act at the crucial moments where existing practice and instruments are concerned.
As you are aware, we believe the Growth Initiative to be very important, but we really cannot bring ourselves to share the general enthusiasm over the list of roads, airports and high-speed trains costing billions of euro, most of which are still at the planning stage.
Something we see as crucial is the imperative need for greater transparency as regards the European Investment Bank funding criteria and greater involvement of the European Parliament in establishing those criteria.
We are not convinced by the Commissionâs continuing reluctance to launch an energy efficiency plan which turns its back on the nuclear sector completely.
What we lack today is a convincing framework for investment in technologies which can saveresources and focus on social cohesion, education and innovation.
Considering, in addition, the delayed presentation of the Commissionâs proposals on reforming the Structural Funds, we can only harbour some doubts as to the Unionâs ability to respond to the challenges of growth and enlargement in due time.
The success of the Growth Initiative depends, not least, on discerning implementation of the Stability Pact â and we would like to hear your opinion again on this, President Prodi â and on a proper programme for observing the Kyoto Protocol.
If the majority of the Member States do not change course, the Union will not be able to fulfil its obligations.
A few months ago, President Prodi, we proposed the launch of a Climate Stability Pact, but I am afraid that we have not received any response.
We are just a few weeks off the start of the COP9 in Milan and we would like to put this proposal forward once again.
Just as in the matter of the deficit, it is the Commission which has the responsibility of calling to order those Member StatesÂ âÂ in particular Spain, Italy and PortugalÂ âÂ which, as things stand, will prevent us from achieving the Kyoto objectives.
There are some points missing from your legislative programme.
I do not have time to go into them all so I will just mention two.
Commissioner Reding, the European Parliament has been calling for almost two years, genuinely united in its desire, for a proposal for a directive or, at least, a Green Paper, on media concentration and freedom of information.
It is clear from your manifesto that you attach great importance to this issue.
Why, then, can the Commission not manage to take action on this matter?
Lastly, a couple of months have passed since the failure of CancÃºn, yet we have absolutely no idea what conclusions and what lines of action the Commission intends to follow, and there is no link with the Millennium Goals either, Commissioner Lamy.
Lastly, the question of Eurostat.
President Prodi, you said you had learned a number of lessons from the Eurostat affair, but your text fails to mention one that is genuinely important: the Commission must pay greater heed to Parliament.
The recommendations in the discharge reports are not just friendly adviceÂ âÂ they are provisions which require the Commission to act and to do so in useful time.
We used to have an unresponsive Commission and now we have a Commission which is capable of responses, and we do acknowledge this.
Now, you have a year in which to make it capable of adopting decisive initiatives.
We welcome the reform of the code of conduct and the improvement of the information channels between OLAF, the Commissioners and the Directorates-General, and it will not surprise you to hear that we also welcome the recognition of the role of whistleblowers.
Moreover, many of these measures have already been called for by Parliament.
We would remind you, however, President Prodi, that transparency is a good way not just of combating fraud but of preventing it too, and it is my genuine hope that, next year, in welcoming the new Members with open, transparent institutions as well as open arms, we will be able to put the events of recent years behind us.
In any case, President Prodi, I would like to say in conclusion, on behalf of my group, that the report still fails to express awareness of a certain sense of responsibility and to acknowledge the errors made.
As you, yourself, admitted, the initial signs were there before May 2003: it was a question of seeing them, and we feel that this is something we can be forgiven for expecting of the Commission, particularly after the events which marked the term of office of the Santer Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to express sympathy and respect for the Italian police officers who, together with American and British soldiers, have been killed by terrorists in Iraq since Parliament last met.
In the same way, we should like to express our sympathy and respect for those who lost their lives in the attacks on the synagogues in Turkey.
The western world must stand united in combating terrorism.
I should also like to talk about Commission President Prodiâs statement on the Eurostat scandal.
Listening to his statement, as we have done today in the Committee on Budgetary Control, one would imagine that we had all just emerged from the primeval forest and that public administration was still something to be invented.
MrÂ Prodi has reported on everything that does not work, referring to the lack of communication between the Commission and the control bodies, the OLAF internal audit, Parliament etc.
MrÂ Prodi now promises that matters will be improved, but these problems are of course known by all governments with much larger administrations than the Commissionâs.
In all normal democracies, the political systems and administrations are developed in such a way that embezzlement and fraud are prevented or discovered very quickly.
The Commission still has to devise all these arrangements.
This can only be interpreted as an expression of total incompetence on the part of the Commission and as a lack of will in a system characterised by a down-at-heel administrative culture.
That is why the Committee on Budgetary Control has such a lot of difficulty obtaining the analysis reports and has a duty of confidentiality imposed upon it with regard to everything it knows.
Someone has known about the scandal for a very long time, and someone has wished to conceal it.
MrÂ Prodi says that his reform, which was begun in 1999, is already working.
How, then, will he explain the fact that the press and the European Parliament knew about the Eurostat scandal a good year before MEPs forced the Commission to act.
MrÂ Prodi says that OLAF had been working on fraud in Eurostat for several years, without providing a word of information to the Commission, yet he says he has every confidence in MrÂ BrÃŒner and OLAF.
There are three possible explanations: either the Commission gave OLAFâs director completely fatuous instructions, with the result that he did not keep the Commission informed; or the Commission wished to leave unpleasant matters on the back burner for years in a secretive OLAF; or OLAFâs management is appallingly naive and does not understand the political necessity of sounding the alarm bells so that the Commission is warned of serious fraud.
MrÂ Prodi says that he has now taken some tough decisions.
No, MrÂ Prodi, you have not.
You have merely suspended a few criminal bosses on full wages, and you have only done it under pressure from the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament.
You bear full responsibility.
This Parliament will be naive if it gives discharge for your administration.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is a difference between guilt and responsibility.
Who bears political responsibility for the Eurostat scandal?
The scandal is not that someone has had their fingers in the till. The most serious scandal is that we have an accounting system that still makes embezzlement possible.
Forty-seven auditors and other experts have worked with Eurostat since June 2003.
They have asked for 78 contracts but only received 60.
Of those 60, 28.5% were implemented in contravention of EU rules governing invitations for tenders.
Where are those 18 missing contracts?
Who is responsible for their not being there?
Who will obtain them?
There must of course be copies of the contracts in all the firms.
Why have they not been obtained straight away, and where are the banksâ copies for the secret accounts?
Who is responsible for the fact that the 47 auditors do not have them?
Who is taking responsibility for ensuring that all the documents in proof now come to light?
MrÂ Prodi, you have just held a meeting with the Committee on Budgetary Control in my groupâs offices, where you promised openness and zero tolerance for fraud, as you also did when you came to office in 1999.
Up until now, however, zero tolerance has been shown first and foremost to those who have revealed fraud and warned against the accounting system that permits it.
The Commission has shown efficiency in its dealings with Paul van Buitenen, Marta Andreasen and Dorte Smidt-Brown.
They were quickly and resolutely frozen out.
Who has responsibility for restoring their civil rights?
When will you say to MrÂ Solbes: âPedro, you are not perhaps the guilty party, but Eurostat is your responsibility.
Step down.
I accept MrÂ Blakâs proposal and assume responsibility myself for providing a full explanation of the Eurostat scandalâ.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot think of anyone who appreciates the sympathy expressed by Parliament at the murder of the Italian soldiers and Iraqi civilians.
Those who have died know they were murdered for the same reasons as their US and UK colleagues and fellow-soldiers are being murdered, and for the same reasons that we find ourselves in Istanbul with a cowardly, two-faced, three-faced Europe, which, in general, needs the capacity offered by Istanbul in order to ensure that an Israeli has the same human rights as a Palestinian, the same human rights as someone who is in favour with this Europe of Vichy, with this Europe with pacifist tendencies, of this Europe of our Parliament, not even a tenth of which is present here this morning: just count the headsÂ âÂ 58Â âÂ not even a tenth of the elected representatives.
That follows, however, for it is nothing but a voting machine, and it is a party political voting machine; this is a Europe which deserves no credit at all for expressing sympathy, for it is sympathy which is impersonal solidarity, solidarity against George Bush and with Saddam Hussein, always, consistently, in all events.
Mr President of the Commission, as I read your âState of the Unionâ speech I am reminded of something: it is as if the âState of the Unionâ speech were being made by that Washington which your Europe hates, as it hated it in 1939 and 1940, as it hated the plutocratic Judaeo-Masonic democracies in the 1940s, as it hated the France of Jacques Doriot in addition to the France of Marshal Philippe PÃ©tain, as it hated those who cried, âDie for Danzig, die for Danzig!â â no, never, ! â when, in the name of pacifism, the murderous, shameful Munich Pact struck; the shameful pact which set the scene for the Holocaust and established the fascist, communist, fundamentalist, Counter-Reformist alliance.
The Europe of reform, President Prodi?
Be patient: minus the beautiful baroque art of Bernini, this is the Europe of the Counter-Reformation, of the era when the undiluted perversion of the policies of the Pope-King made Dante Alighieri call a âshameless whoreâ the See which exploited the story and mission of Christ in the interests of the most abasing worldly affairsÂ âÂ in the Vatican at that time but I say it is happening today too.
I am quoting Dante, and, much as it pains me, I feel that the quotation is appropriate.
The state of the Union, Mr President: according to the lines you are all takingÂ âÂ Parliament, Council and CommissionÂ âÂ we should have a Commission comprising 30 members, soon to become 35, because we are the United States of Europe.
Of course, the President of the United States ought to have 50 or so ministers to run the country effectively, is that not so?
It is not this way that you will unite a Europe which provides an alternative, the Europe of Altiero Spinelli, of Alcide De Gasperi, of Konrad Adenauer rather than of Erich Ollenhauer or his other contemporary nationalistic social democrat rival.
Such is the state of the Union.
This Union, President Prodi, is what funds all the dictatorships with which it sustains relations, following a criminal policy.
The provisions of Article 2, which are usually the basis for agreements with dictatorship regimes, are not worth the paper they are written on.
At the moment, we have here in Strasbourg the representatives of the real Vietnam of tomorrow and all the years to come, we have representatives of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, who are asking to see you.
Every day, in the face of events in Vietnam, Cambodia and throughout the world, we, and Mr Solana and others, as in the case of the former Yugoslavia, essentially side with Milosevic against those fighting for democracy.
The state of the Union is pitiful, for Europe is the Europe of television, of Munich, of fascism, of communism; it is a democratic and civil disgrace.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, 2004 is going to be a very important year, a year of challenges, as MrÂ Prodi has just said.
Next June, European elections will be held in very special circumstances, when we welcome ten new countries in the most extensive enlargement that Europe has ever seen.
They will take place in an atmosphere of hope for a constitution for Europe, on the basis of the excellent draft submitted by the Convention, all of this against an unstable international background, with an increasingly-entrenched war in Iraq, intensifying international terrorism, presidential elections in the United States and a still-fragile economic climate in Europe.
In such a situation we need to hold to our course with a strong and independent Commission at the helm.
If, as we all hope, there are signs of an economic recovery, the Commission must be able to respond so as to take advantage of all of the opportunities likely to benefit its economic and employment policy.
The European Parliament cannot afford to lose a year.
Our fellow citizens would not understand.
We therefore need to concentrate on those proposals that absolutely must be adopted by the end of the parliamentary term, that is to say during the first quarter of 2004, and monitor progress on those that we are patiently waiting to scrutinise for the first time.
For the second year running, we have maintained the principle of structured dialogue between parliamentary committees and commissioners.
We welcome this, but the dialogue still has room for improvement.
We therefore propose the creation of a more reliable interinstitutional timetable, to be drafted on a multiannual basis, which would make it easier to follow up and evaluate the actual results achieved.
It would also be desirable to provide for more systematic follow-up to the demands made by Parliament for additional actions to be incorporated in the programme.
As far as the accession of the ten new Member States is concerned, we have every confidence in the friends who will be joining us.
We take note of the extraordinary progress that they have made, but we attach great importance to their respecting the and applying the texts relating to controls at the new external border.
Similarly, we also think it is important to monitor the level of nuclear safety within the enlarged Union.
This enlargement cannot succeed unless the institutional framework is adapted.
Our group wishes to see the work of the Convention respected.
This draft should therefore be safeguarded and must be recognisable in the constitutional treaty.
The Commission has undertaken to improve our legislation, to make it more accessible, easier to read and more transparent, and to simplify law-making.
We will ensure that it does so!
This is one of the publicâs major expectations.
The added value of the European Union rightly lies in policies which further the fight against illegal immigration, in common management of our borders and in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and this thanks to enhanced police and judicial cooperation and the development of a common asylum policy setting out clear procedures.
These initiatives should be taken in cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin and the enlarged Unionâs new neighbours: Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.
An additional key to stability is the concept of sustainable development, which should have a bearing on all of our legislative work.
Making a success of sustainable development means fostering private initiative, educating and informing the public, continuing to pursue healthy macro-economic policies that generate jobs, accelerating structural reform and promoting investment in infrastructure and human resources.
These initiatives should be undertaken in accordance with the Lisbon agenda, which seeks to boost potential economic performance by increasing the flexibility of the markets in goods, capital and labour.
Whether it be transport policy, research policy, which is still insufficient in the light of the brain drain, telecommunications, with the development of the Internet, our Structural Funds policy, which is essential for revitalising the regions â and not only in the enlargement countries â all of our initiatives and policies should place the people at their heart.
That is why we expect a robust commitment from you to take account of increasing life expectancy.
All of this is part and parcel of sustainable development.
Furthermore, although we warmly welcome the thematic strategies for the environment, we deplore the lack of initiatives on the urban environment and the lack of follow-up to the Thessaloniki Council, which was supposed to create a European diplomacy network on the environment and sustainable development.
Even though next year is bound to be slightly curtailed by the European elections, neither the Commission nor Parliament will be short of work.
As I said at the outset, you should hold to your course for 2004.
Finally, I regret the obvious lack of commitment on the part of the Member States when it comes to implementing Community legislation, all the more so when the codecision procedure is used.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Prodi, you are right to make the issue of enlargement the central priority for 2004 in your proposals.
In reality, enlargement has been formally agreed but in many peopleâs minds â perhaps in this House, but especially in the wider population â it is still not truly complete.
For that reason, the Commission is right to focus in the coming months on ensuring that where there is corruption, where there are administrative issues to be resolved, and where nuclear safety is at stake, all the countries which are due to accede to the European Union on 1 May 2004 are genuinely preparing to do so.
Our negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania must continue too.
We must state clearly and unequivocally that 2010 is the envisaged date â but no country can assume that the envisaged date will be the actual date unless they persist with the reforms they have begun.
Mr Prodi, you will have the task of preparing the Councilâs decision on Turkey next year.
However, I would ask you to consider this: unless a positive decision is adopted in favour of opening accession negotiations, you will need to come up with ideas on how we can intensify our cooperation with Turkey until â and, indeed, during â the opening of negotiations.
The events of recent days in Istanbul demonstrate the importance of cooperation with Turkey, especially on security issues.
This closer and coordinated cooperation with Turkey is essential, irrespective of the accession issue.
Enlargement also raises the issue of effective and secure external borders.
I agree that this is an important aspect of our development, also in the context of the wider Europe.
However, cooperation with our neighbours is also essential, for example, in preventing cross-border crime and combating the evils of human trafficking.
Developments in the Balkans have shown that it is quite possible for the European Union to shape this cooperation productively.
However, it is also crucial that when we talk about migration, we also talk about integration.
I hope that the Commission will point out to some countries that it is not just a matter of restricting migration.
The task is also to integrate the people who come to the European Union more fully into our societies.
As regards policies for growth, which your programme also deals with extensively, we support the Commissionâs proposals on investment in networks and knowledge.
We need a swift decision here.
This House must make some swift decisions in order to implement the Growth Initiative.
Emphasising investment is all well and good, but networks and knowledge need investment too.
Indeed, experience in recent months has shown that if we merely liberalise without creating incentives for investment in networks â such as energy or transport â at the same time, the temporary or even the longer-term collapse of networks may be the result.
If we want to modernise Europe, we â and that means the European Union as a whole and, of course, all the individual Member States â must increase investment not only in knowledge but also in our infrastructure.
On the issues of liberalisation and harmonisation, I would ask you, Mr Prodi, also to consider that we are trying to achieve a European social model.
In my view, this is not adequately expressed in your paper.
I sometimes have the impression that we are more liberal than the neoliberals in their theory books and more American than the Americans in some of our steps towards harmonisation and liberalisation.
We must consider the social consequences.
We must make combating social exclusion and poverty a priority.
In some countries, poverty is on the increase again.
Surely that is a catastrophe?
This may also be due to the fact that the austerity programmes do not adequately consider how spending cuts and liberalisation measures impact on various social groups.
That is not an argument against liberalisation, but simply an argument for considering the social impacts of unemployment etc.
In this context â and in my view, the paper does not focus adequately on this issue either â I would like to highlight the importance of public services, which we will be discussing next week in this House.
Many public services are a particular feature of the European social model which we wish to stand up for, clearly and unequivocally, also to the outside world.
I therefore ask you to take more account of that in your work
I would like to make two further comments.
The first concerns foreign policy.
This Parliament has very often discussed the position of this House and the European Union on the Middle East.
We must have the strength and determination to pursue the goal we have set ourselves and clearly support all peace initiatives, the most recent being the Geneva Accord.
However, none of the developments in the Middle East and none of the criticism we voice towards Israel remotely justifies anti-Semitic statements or actions.
Europe must be clear that criticism of the present Israeli Governmentâs position cannot be a motive for any kind of anti-Semitic words or deeds.
We should all have learned the lesson of the disaster of the Second World War in particular, and together, we should resolutely counter all forms of discrimination and anti-Semitism, notwithstanding our clear position on the Middle East.
Mr Prodi, you have heard our views today.
We want a strong Commission President and a strong Commission.
Please do not add grist to the anti-European mill by raising uncertainty or, indeed, doubts that you will represent a strong Commission as its President until the elections next year.
This is essential to ensure that when the voters go to the polls in June, they know what they are voting for, namely a strong and united Europe with a strong Commission and Commission President.
Â Â  MrÂ President, to begin with, I should like to say how encouraging it is that Commission President Prodi and the Commission have apparently learned from the Eurostat case, that there are a number of things that are to be tidied up and that a number of reforms are to be implemented so that nothing similar happens in the future.
In the process that is now to be begun, it is absolutely crucial to ensure that we continue to have a strong internal audit service which, in spite of everything, is of course the first link in the chain when it comes to discovering fraud, misappropriation and irregularities.
It is important for us to have a strong and independent OLAF.
It is particularly important for us to have a clear definition of political responsibility.
I think, in actual fact, that political responsibility is of crucial importance and, what is more, political responsibility borne by the individual Commissioner.
If we do not have this, I do not believe it will be possible for the reforms to percolate through the system and down to the individual employee, lowest in the hierarchy.
I therefore listened, of course, with great attention to MrÂ Prodiâs remark that we are now to have a definition of political responsibility.
I should therefore like to ask the President of the Commission how the political responsibility we are now to have defined differs from that defined by the independent experts and that indicated in the Code of Conduct signed by the Commissioners in 1999.
We are now also to have a monitoring unit for picking up signals if something goes wrong.
MrÂ Prodi argues that the Commission did not have the ability to intervene prior to May 2003.
My question, however, is this: what kind of signals is this group to pick up?
Now that it has emerged that 14 critical auditorsâ reports are not enough, just as complaints from various employees to different Commissioners, letters in the press, hearings in the Committee on Budgetary Control and auditorsâ letters to the Commissioner responsible in the department responsible are not enough, what kind of signals are needed before the Commission intervenes?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioners, as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I should like to briefly discuss the social state of Europe. For I have noticed that, slowly but surely, we are moving towards a situation in which social policy competition is increasing considerably and in which the European citizen might well conclude in time that social dumping will be playing a part, more so than is currently the case and more so than we can justify to the citizen in Europe.
We would like a straight answer from the Commission to the question whether we can expect its position on employment directives before the end of March.
This would allow us during the last plenary meeting in April to give our position on these employment directives against the backdrop of the current economic climate.
We want to speed up the process of adopting directives in the area of the European works council and on working times, which have to do with social dumping.
After all, in some countries, England being one of them, it is possible to work up to sixty hours or so.
We want speed in the package that pertains to the Posting of Workers directives.
We want acceleration where the European social funds are involved, and I could go on like this for at least another five minutes.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like once again to express our sympathy for the victims of the massacres of Nasiriya, for their families and for all the European armed forces engaged throughout the world in peace missions combating terrorism
I will now focus my speech on the Eurostat case.
There are too many unresolved questions in this affair and the measures that have been taken to remedy matters are few and, I would venture to say, belated and, therefore, probably ineffective.
My opinion was confirmed after President Prodiâs hearing before the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, in which he was, quite frankly, too general and, if I may say so, a little reticent.
As regards the way the affair has been handled, given that we have a President who has made transparency one of his principal objectives, we do not understand why we have witnessed all kinds of endeavours to keep the documentation under wraps and avoid public debate in the Eurostat case, as if we were dealing with a state secret.
There are too many questions, as I said.
Has this drain on the EUâs funds come to an end?
If it has come to an end, when, exactly, did that happen?
Just this morning, the fact that the most serious incidents took place before 1999 was stressed once again.
What about the less serious incidents?
When did they occur?
Are they still going on?
Most importantly, what is the criterion for assessing the seriousness of an incident?
The size of the sum taken, maybe?
I would respectfully point out that fraud is serious by its very nature, and it is much more serious and unacceptable when public officials are involved.
Moreover, how is it possible for a fraudulent organisation to have succeeded in operating without hindrance for years in the Commission?
Are we really to believe that nobody noticed anything, despite the fact that rumours, faxes and emails on unlawful gains and fake contracts were flying around the Commission departments?
What is more, we fail to understand how the Commissionâs watchdog system works, for many other outrageous incidents have been discovered in addition to the Eurostat affair, such as the case of cereal prices.
In this connection, the most ridiculous thingÂ âÂ it would be laughable if the matter were not so seriousÂ âÂ is that the document presented this morning statesÂ âÂ and I would draw your attention to thisÂ âÂ that we need gradually to lay the foundations for a new culture of responsibility and transparency.
What are we to infer from this?
That, hitherto, irresponsibility and lack of transparency have been the norm in the Commission?
There is something else that needs to be said on the subject of Eurostat and the serious nature of the scandal surrounding the organisation.
This is not just another department, one of the many centres of European bureaucracy: it is an institution which, in carrying out its recording and statistical work, is, in actual fact, the guarantor of the Stability Pact, verifying the implementation of the Maastricht criteria.
It therefore plays a part in defining Member Statesâ economic and financial policies and, in practice, in forcing the States to adopt stringent policies which often involve budgetary or welfare cuts.
It is therefore an institution which has a watchdog role and which cannot afford to be associated with even the remotest doubt or suspicion regarding its impartiality or authority of the kind currently surrounding it.
We realise that the affair is embarrassing because public funds have been used for unlawful purposes; we also understand the problem caused by the fact that the affair has exploded at a sensitive time, on the eve of the European elections, of enlargement and of the Constitution; we understand the problem but we cannot compromise on the matter.
We can neither condone nor, as some would have us do, underestimate the severity of the incidents of corruption, fraud and malpractice.
It is the citizens who demand that we stand firm, the same citizens of whom we ask sacrifices in the name of the Stability Pact.
What is more, instead of pointing the finger and making a scapegoat out of some civil servant and bringing the affair to a hasty conclusion in this way, we would have greatly appreciated it if the Commission had fully shouldered its responsibilities, as Mr Santer did over much less.
We cannot let all this pass without speaking out, especially at a time when the President of the Commission is disseminating a political manifestoÂ âÂ or maybe we should call it an electoral manifestoÂ âÂ describing the Europe of his dreams while neglecting the Europe that exists here and now.
As if things were not bad enough already!
President Prodi is entitled to put himself forward as a candidate for the next European elections, but, if this is his intention, we expect him to do things properly and resign.
On the other hand, the damage this would cause at institutional level would be severe and, quite frankly, unacceptable.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to make clear my distaste for the complete farce that went on over the release of the OLAF report and the reports on Eurostat.
As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I was perfectly entitled to see those reports without being subjected to a ridiculous Stalinist rigmarole.
It clearly demonstrates the Commission's contempt for this Parliament, for democracy and for the people that ultimately have to underwrite the Eurostat corruption, by which I mean the taxpayers of Europe.
The report highlights the fundamentally inadequate procedures for combating fraud and more importantly how slow the Commission was to react to clear evidence of major problems within Eurostat.
I am also deeply concerned about the snail's pace at which OLAF worked in investigating this whole sorry matter.
The stench of graft is all around us and is getting stronger by the day.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have before me President Prodiâs manifesto.
It contains good ideas, even if they may be a little trivial and general; some of them certainly deserve support and others less so, but, although I do not object to the Commission President drawing up a political documentÂ âÂ he is still entitled to his own political viewsÂ âÂ it is unacceptable that he should address an individual country and an individual party in this manifesto.
It should also be pointed outÂ âÂ and I am going to do soÂ âÂ that, in his position, rather than expressing ideas he should be making things happen.
He is the President of the Commission: he is in a position to accomplish things, he can take steps to make them law.
As regards the fact that he said that his manifesto is addressed to the whole of Europe, I beg to differ.
Indeed, I quote: âIt is against this backdrop that, turning to Italy and the forthcoming elections for the European Parliament next spring, I have proposed that all reformists ...â and so on.
Then the document makes a clear reference to the Olive Tree for it says: âBut the inspiration is still the original inspiration behind the Olive Treeâ.
This is therefore a partisan document, which is unacceptable from the President of the Commission.
If Mr Prodi claims to have addressed Europe as a whole then he is speaking a load of codswallop, not least in that I do not seem to remember seeing any olive trees sprouting up and growing in countries such as Sweden or Finland.
Â Â  Mr President, I, like other colleagues, welcome this debate, because it makes sense to have a debate on the legislative programme before we take decisions on the 2004 budget.
The priority of enlargement, along with the other two priorities, makes real sense for the European Union.
Since most of the Commission is here, it would make sense to summon all our colleagues in order to hold a real debate on what the European Union is going to be.
That would suggest we should cancel all meetings outside the Chamber to allow our colleagues to be present.
I wish to make a remark about the Commission reforms which, as you have said, MrÂ President, were the reason for the Commission coming into office.
My Group has continually pressed for reforms based on the Wise Men's report.
There has been significant progress, and most recently we received a very positive document detailing changes in the financial regulation and the staff regulations yesterday evening in the Committee on Budgets.
However, this document still fails to address the weaknesses in the way the Commission is operating, as revealed by the Eurostat affair.
In the light of the three steps you outlined to the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, my Group is disappointed at the way in which the reforms have been implemented.
One or two of our members said to you that reforms in relation to the flow of information, proper internal audits and Commissioners' responsibility for the services they run should have been completed by September 1999.
If the institutions are to be successfully reformed, which is vital if our citizens are to have confidence in the way in which they are run, it is a problem, as Mr Blak has said, that nobody seems to wish to take responsibility.
You have sacked a Director-General, but the Commissioners are still in place.
You reassured us this morning in the Committee on Budgetary Control that the Commissioners will have responsibility, but there are still unanswered questions.
My main question, to which I would like a reply, Mr President of the Commission, concerns the internal documents relating to Eurostat.
You have come forward with proposals for the reorganisation of OLAF.
However, we as a Parliament are still waiting for OLAF's report on Eurostat.
Are the suggestions for reorganising the whole system coming from OLAF, because OLAF is a Commission service, or are we going to be able to have OLAF's report so that we as a Parliament can assess the situation and come to a conclusion?
Other speakers have already said that we will need a strong Commission during 2004 to ensure that we can manage the responsibilities of the Union effectively.
Â Â  â Mr Elles, I share your view about the presence of Members, but unfortunately the President cannot run Parliament like a regiment of soldiers.
Â Â  Mr President, it was a good thing, Mr Prodi, that you attended the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning, and it is important to say so.
As a matter of principle, I would like to draw attention to the PSE Groupâs concerns about the Eurostat affair, but about other issues as well.
It is not good if the Commission always needs a new scandal before it takes a further step along its road to reform.
This is constant grist to Mr Bondeâs mill â if I may be so bold as to name names â and he makes political capital out of it.
That is one lesson the Commission should learn.
Let me now turn to some individual points.
I greatly welcome your announcement this morning that the information channels between OLAF and the Commission are to be reviewed.
That is necessary.
However â and let me speak plainly â this must include answering the question how the Commission deals internally with information from OLAF, so that this information is not simply buried in the files without anyone knowing about it while everyone has their knives out for the Commission.
I also welcome the fact that when asked, you clarified to the Commission on Budgetary Control that your proposals on the reform of OLAF do not imply that you are questioning or restricting OLAFâs responsibility for internal investigations.
That is very important, for it would have resulted in a major clash with this House.
We want to see OLAF as an independent agency, especially in light of the internal investigations, and so I welcome your clarifying this point to the Committee on Budgetary Control and urge you to continue along this course.
Let me comment on the issue of political responsibility.
We have always adopted the position that the Commissioners should also be able to exercise this responsibility.
Based on your statement this morning and the fact that a supplement to the Code of Conduct has again become necessary â describing how the Commissioners themselves should ask questions and how the services and the Directorates-General should be obliged to inform the Commissioners about problems, or landmines â I can only assume that this has not been set down on paper or been common practice.
That was how we analysed the situation in July.
However, the time has come to learn lessons from this.
We want a radical reform of the relations between the Directorates-General and the Commissioners, and we will scrutinise your proposals to see whether they match these requirements.
Â Â  Mr President, whenever we speak, just about anywhere in our own countries, particularly over the past five years, there is one topic that is always particularly sensitive, which is: how are the finances being managed?
Then the general opinion on Brussels is not all that great.
This is why it was very much to be welcomed that the Prodi Commission declared that from now on, there would be zero tolerance across the board.
We were therefore very shocked to hear the claims made in connection with Eurostat a few months ago.
It has to be said that the Commission was quick to react when the news broke, but the big question is: what did the Commission know before that point?
In my view, there are clear indications that the Commission, in the years leading up to May 2003, could have had some knowledge of what was happening at Eurostat.
The Commission failed to take any action in the light of that information.
Although it may talk about the need to improve information, we were told at regular intervals that an enquiry had begun at Eurostat.
The big question is: why did the alarm bells not go off sooner in the Commission?
When I hear the Commission speak, the main point it is driving home is that it is proud of the results achieved.
In fact, the Court of Auditors stated yesterday that there are signs of improvement, and the Commission can be proud of this, with good reason.
However, as for the aspects that went clearly wrong, the Commission washes its hands of them.
The fault lies with OLAF, or the director-general, or whoever, but not with the Commission.
That is wrong.
I can only refer to an English politician, maybe a statesman â Mr Kinnock will undoubtedly know him â Lord Carrington.
He knew nothing of the Falklands war, he was not sufficiently informed and despite this, he assumed the political responsibility for it.
That is a very honourable position in my view.
In the political culture from which I come, a minister, a secretary of state or a councillor is always responsible, and that should also be the case for a Commissioner and for the Commission.
That is an issue on which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will be focusing.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, your Commission was not formed out of the blue.
It succeeded the Santer Commission, which had to go precisely because nobody took responsibility.
You stated that you were going to apply zero tolerance, and we took you seriously.
At the moment, however, we are utterly disappointed.
After all, it has taken a thousand press articles before Parliament was informed about the Eurostat fraud, and today, you are bringing us a fine story, showing, in fact, that you are evaluating OLAF rather than Eurostat and your own responsibility.
You stated that the Commission should take the political responsibility for OLAF's actions without having the means to do this.
I find this incredible and ,I would follow this up by saying that the Commission is also politically responsible for Eurostat.
In its defence, the Commission states that is does not have the means for that either.
The gospel contains a fine fable which states: Salt is good; but if salt has lost its saltiness, how can you season?
Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.
I would like us to ...
Â Â  â MrÂ President, formally speaking, the Commissionâs work programme for 2004 is well presented, but reading it does not give the impression that next year is going to be a historic turning point for the European Union.
Of course, its priorities have to be approved, first and foremost the end of the accession procedure for the ten new members and the creation of a neighbourhood policy for the enlarged Union, establishing an area of peace and prosperity on the basis of shared values and interests.
Here we see a concern to step up the fight against illegal immigration, which is given greater prominence than in previous programmes.
Its move up the list of priorities is realistic and must of course be followed by tangible initiatives.
Approval also has to be given to efforts to establish sustainable growth through a whole series of initiatives, including, amongst others, the Lisbon objectives and the major public works programmes that are currently being planned.
Nevertheless, we remain perplexed about the calls for increased coordination of economic and budgetary matters, along the lines of the stability pact, as this risks on the contrary reducing flexibility, which would have an adverse impact on growth.
Finally, this programme leaves many questions unanswered.
Some are inevitable: 2004 is full of uncertainty, with the European elections, the renewal of the Commission and the Intergovernmental Conference, the outcome of which no one can know in advance.
Other questions concern enlargement, which does not amount solely to an accession procedure, as the document that has been tabled would seem to suggest, but which is also going to mean a significant change in working methods, including in the Commission.
Will these working methods remain the same, as the document would seem to assume, or will they have to be changed?
