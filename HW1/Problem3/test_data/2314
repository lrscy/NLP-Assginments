Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has had the excellent idea of paying tribute to the memory of Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli during the final part-session of its fifth legislature as an assembly elected by universal suffrage.
Although they are not the only founding fathers of Europe, Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli, perhaps more than any other, represent the incredible development of Europe since the Second World War as a result of their vision and their tangible actions.
Jean Monnet taught us what we had to do, and thus in the declaration of 9 May 1950 he wrote, âEurope will not be made all at once, or according to a single, general plan.
It will be built through concrete achievements, which first create a de facto solidarityâ.
This simple sentence indicated the direction we had to take and which we have been following since the 1950s: concrete achievements in order to create de facto solidarity.
The famous step-by-step policy.
I am convinced that the enlargement of the Union of 1Â May, which will not be the last, is an eloquent example of this principle.
But this simple statement at the same time points to the ultimate destination of this road: Europe, the single, general plan.
Today, de facto solidarity exists and Europe is preparing to adopt its Constitutional Treaty.
Jean Monnet established the foundations for the current European Union and proposed the method for achieving it.
Through his own concrete achievements, in particular as the first President of the High Authority of the ECSC and, above all, as the constant and determined inspiration for the subsequent development of European integration.
The Action Committee for a United States of Europe, which he promoted over the course of 20 years, inspired many fertile ideas which have subsequently been put into practice.
I would like today to remind you all of his actions to promote direct elections to the European Parliament, which allowed us to be where we are today, with a Parliament that has real legislative and control powers.
Jean Monnet died 25 years ago, just before the first elections which brought Altiero Spinelli to the European Parliament.
Like Monnet, Spinelli offered Europe his vision and his achievements.
I would point out that he was a European Commissioner before becoming an MEP.
Today we are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the European Parliamentâs adoption of the draft Treaty establishing the European Union, usually called, quite rightly, the âSpinelli draftâ, since Spinelli was not just its rapporteur, but also the inspiration behind it.
With hindsight, we can say without hesitation that without this draft we would not have the draft European Constitutional Treaty today.
Hence, with the draft of 1984 the process began within the Union which led to the successive revisions of the Treaty of Rome, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice, and, subsequently, to the constitutional discussions which took place within the framework of the European Convention.
The Spinelli draft was innovative in several respects, eight years before the Treaty of Maastricht advocated the creation of a genuine European Union, based on the European Community.
Various fundamental provisions of the Treaty of Maastricht stem directly from the Spinelli draft, such as those relating to citizenship of the Union, respect for fundamental rights or the introduction of the principle of subsidiarity when allocating and exercising the Unionâs competences.
The Treaty of Amsterdam took up the idea of providing for the possibility of imposing sanctions on a State in the event of serious or persistent violation of the democratic principles or fundamental rights upon which we are founded.
There are other provisions which anticipated, 20 years earlier, the draft Constitutional Treaty produced by the Convention.
I would like in particular to mention the explicit expression of the primacy of Union law, the introduction of the concept of a Union law, restricted to the fundamental principles of Union action, the duty of the Commission to initiate the programming of the Union's activities and Parliament's final say in the budgetary field.
Finally, we may have to wait for a new phase of European integration to begin in order to introduce certain supplementary provisions.
I would point out, in particular, Article 82 of the Spinelli draft which laid down that when the Treaty had been ratified by a majority of States representing two thirds of the total population of the Union, the governments of the States which had ratified it would meet immediately to reach a common agreement on the procedures and the date of entry into force of the new Treaty, as well as relations with the States which had not yet ratified it.
Something which in a Union of 25 States or more will inevitably have to be considered.
Whatever form it might take, the Spinelli draft proposed the idea of founding the Union upon a fundamental Treaty which would be a genuine Constitution for Europe and would hence become the single, general plan which Jean Monnet considered to be the inevitable consequence of concrete achievements.
These two men, who were so different in terms of culture and temperament, worked together throughout the 1950s.
In this way, the visionary Spinelli proposed concrete solutions to the pragmatic Monnet, who in turn enshrined his vision of Europe in his proposals to the different governments.
This combination of pragmatism and idealism is what we need most in the current European situation.
The challenges are different, but the method is still valid.
We need will and determination, generosity and ambition, in order to create a Europe of peace and prosperity, of values and civilisation, which works for solidarity in the world: our Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for paying tribute to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its chairman for the last five years.
You see, Mr President, it is important for the history of the creation of this united Europe, begun more than 50 years ago, to become part of the common memory of the peoples represented in Parliament today: we should retrace and go back over this history in terms of the dates and milestones which characterised it and in terms of its protagonists.
Today we are commemorating two of them who were not members of a government, who did not sign treaties, who did not work in the spotlight reserved for the powerful, but who were great men of vision and exponents of integration, that is, JeanÂ Monnet and AltieroÂ Spinelli.
They were both convinced that Europe, divided and bloodstained following two devastating wars in the first half of the twentieth century, would only have a future if it united and overcame nationalism, rivalry and hostility between the States.
They pointed out the path to take in order to establish a common European interest and to create institutions capable of expressing and pursuing it through the exercise of joint sovereignty.
While it is true that Monnet and Spinelli had different approaches, different strategies to advance the cause of a united Europe, it is even more true that their ideal was the same and that they both dedicated their livesâ work to it.
The strategy of JeanÂ Monnet and the great French statesman, RobertÂ Schuman, for whom he was a valuable adviser, was a strategy based on integrating the production, starting with coal and steel, the economies and the markets of the countries participating in the project, a strategy for the gradual development of European integration.
It was defined as functionalist, aimed to lay tangible foundations for peace in Europe, firstly between France and Germany, and gave rise to the Communities which remained in operation until the Treaty of Maastricht of 1991.
The strategy for which AltieroÂ Spinelli was the combative standard-bearer was, on the contrary, a constituent strategy, for the political foundation of European unity according to a federalist design, and it was supported by the ideas of a great Italian statesman: AlcideÂ DeÂ Gasperi.
But at critical times, for example in 1955 when, following the failed attempt to create a Europe Defence Community, the integration process seemed to come to a standstill, the efforts of Monnet and Spinelli, although they followed different paths, both headed in the same direction.
Spinelli wrote that he and Monnet were both stubbornly slaving away: Monnet in the hope of obtaining a fresh initiative from the governments, and he in the hope of obtaining from the movement new momentum, a new bottom-up stimulus.
He said that despite their shared scepticism and all the obstacles, they would win.
And that is what happened.
That prophecy came true: the believers in Europeanism, the tenacious exponents of integration and fighters, Monnet and Spinelli, were victorious.
We have now met goals, Mr President, which not even they dared to hope for, and finally the dream of European integration can be fulfilled: a dream which already took tangible form 20 years ago when the European Parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority the draft drawn up under the guidance of AltieroÂ Spinelli, on 14 February 1984; also that date, which we are commemorating today, is celebrated as the date of birth of the constituent process.
Twenty years on, the dream has become a fundamental requirement for the great new Europe.
The constituent process must at last be achieved by approving the draft adopted by the Convention on the Future of Europe.
We cannot stop now, we cannot turn back.
The draft Constitution is not perfect, but it constitutes common ground established with difficulty between governments and parliaments.
It could be improved by drawing on the Spinelli draft of 20 years ago, for example where it laid down â as MrsÂ deÂ Palacio said â that the Treaty would enter into force as soon as it was ratified by a majority of the Member States and the population of the Community.
The text of the Convention could be improved but it must not be weakened because, in that case, the newly created Union of 25 would run the risk of grinding to a halt and falling into crisis.
And so nobody, none of the governments participating in the Intergovernmental Conference should retract their words and withdraw the approval they expressed in the Convention: this is the appeal which once again Parliament is making to everyone; this is the best way to honour in practice, without rhetoric, AltieroÂ Spinelli and JeanÂ Monnet.
Â Â  â Mr President, my group believes the initiative to commemorate Monnet and Spinelli today to be a good one.
Because without Monnet, the great inspiration in the shadows, the declaration of 9 May 1950, which is the founding act of European construction, could not be understood, and without the declaration there would not have been Franco-German reconciliation and it would not have been possible to reconcile the Europeans.
And without his decisive advocacy of de facto solidarity it would not have been possible to make progress towards a common market, the forerunner to political union.
And without his institutional vision, and in particular the key role for the European Commission, we would not have been able to overcome the straitjacket of cooperation between governments.
Also 20 years ago â and this has been pointed out here â this House, which had been democratically elected for the first time, approved the Treaty which we know as the âSpinelli Treatyâ, whose rapporteur was Spinelli himself.
The âSpinelli Treatyâ has been an essential reference for all successive modifications: the Single Act, the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice and, of course, the Treaty drawn up by the Convention.
When I had the honour of chairing the European Parliament's delegation to that Convention, I always had the Spinelli draft beside me.
And I would think to myself, âwhat would Spinelli say about this?â and I must acknowledge that, although it was produced 20 years ago, the âSpinelli Treatyâ was incredibly relevant to today and many of the proposals he made are now in the Constitutional Treaty.
There is something which unites Monnet and Spinelli, Mr President: both wanted to unite people.
âLet us unite menâ, said Monnet.
And the whole of the âSpinelli Treatyâ is full of references to citizens, to people.
I believe â and my friend Dick Roche said this earlier â that they would both feel proud of what we have done over these years, because I believe that the draft Constitutional Treaty is a treaty for people.
And this starts with the first article, which speaks of a Union of States and citizens, and also where it grants the European Parliament full legislative powers and powers of political control, or where it introduces national parliaments, by means of the early warning system.
There is also the popular initiative and the recognition of the role of the regions and municipalities and of NGOs, all of which is in favour of people.
In our work over 50 years, we have done what both Monnet and Spinelli called for: to unite people.
And allow me to tell you a little secret: as a child, as I was, between Monnet and Spinelli, when I left my country, which in the words of Gil de Biedma was âan old inefficient countryâ, I was faced with a Europe full of walls, the Berlin Wall, the wall of the Pyrenees, the wall of dictatorships, the wall of egotisms and the wall of nationalisms.
Todayâs Europe, the Europe which my daughter sees, is a Europe without walls, and those which still remain will fall.
At this moment when a wonderful enlargement has taken place, with which we have sewn together two Europes, with which we have realised that project expounded in the declaration of 9 May, I would like to say to the new countries which make up the European Union that they should enjoy their incorporation into the Union just as we Spaniards enjoyed ours, with the prospect of freedoms, prosperity and above all of sharing a common project.
Mr President, we politicians often talk about the future and I believe there will be time to fight the battles and overcome the obstacles we face, but I believe that today we have meditated on the past, on Monnet and Spinelli, and I would ask that we take pleasure in the present.
Because today's present is a wonderful one.
Monnet and Spinelli would certainly be described as utopian, but Lamartine was right when he said that utopia is nothing more than a truth whose time has not yet come.
And today the ups and downs of life often make reality much nicer than literature.
I therefore believe that today we must enjoy this wonderful moment, savour it, take pleasure in it.
We have created the Greater Europe, and on this marvellous morning, as I walked towards this Strasbourg palace, I remembered that episode of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in Valmy, when he suddenly stood up in front of a group of people and, possessed by an extraordinary strength, said: âwe are witnessing an historic moment, life will never be the same and you will be able to say: we were thereâ.
Â Â  Mr President, just over 20 years ago I had the immense privilege of working closely with Altiero Spinelli when he was the general rapporteur on the draft Treaty that we are commemorating today and I was a young, enthusiastic member of Parliament's secretariat.
It was in many ways for me a dream come true: I was fresh from coordinating the 'yes' campaign in Britain in the referendum on our membership of the European Community in 1975.
I had been the coordinator of the 'yes' campaign at Oxford University.
I had then led a group of students to Rome to demonstrate outside a European Council meeting in favour of having â novel idea â direct elections to this European Parliament â one of Spinelli's main campaign themes at that time.
So to then work with Spinelli was an immense honour and privilege.
I found I was working with a remarkable man, who 40 years before the draft Treaty was already making history when, as a political prisoner of Mussolini â which he was for 17 years â he co-authored the Ventotene Manifesto, which already in 1941 said that: 'If our struggle against fascism is successful and if we win this war, then it will all have been in vain if it simply leads to the re-establishment of the old system of totally sovereign nation states in shifting alliances.
The main challenge after the war must be to bind the countries of Europe together in a structure that develops their common interests and makes war impossible.'
That text circulated throughout the anti-fascist resistance movements during the last years of the war and was one of the main motivations, the main ideals, that helped spread the European message at that time, well ahead of the European movements convention in The Hague.
Forty years later Spinelli was here helping Parliament to produce its draft Treaty on European Union.
He was a man with great ambition, but who knew when to compromise.
He was a man with daring methods but willing to build consensus.
He also realised that to succeed his project should not be seen just as his own personal project: he was willing to share the credit â the ownership â of the draft Treaty that this Parliament produced.
He himself never referred to it as the Spinelli draft Treaty.
He ensured that there were six co-rapporteurs from all the different groups appointed to work with him.
He knew that this project was a project of Parliament.
He described himself not as the author but as the midwife who had allowed Parliament to deliver this baby which needed then to be nurtured.
The baby was important.
Initially, it only helped produce the Single European Act.
Many people were not impressed.
However, if we now look back with a certain sense of perspective, we can see that cumulatively it started a process leading to four successive IGCs, the Single Act, Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice and now the Constitution coming up.
Incrementally it has transformed the European Community of 1984 into the quite different European Union that we have today, a Union with a wider scope of responsibility, with at least partially more effective institutions and with greater democratic accountability.
Step by step, Spinelli's achievement can now be seen in perspective.
However, the lesson for us within Parliament is that Spinelli's method was one of trying to build up consensus.
He said: 'This Parliament brings together representatives of all of Europe's main political parties.
We must use that to thrash out a consensus here and the message can then be taken back home to convince our parties and our governments in our countries and create a political momentum that will be irresistible.'
He was successful in building up a consensus.
This was a time, let us not forget, of great euroscepticism â the buzzword in those days was eurosclerosis â and when governments were telling us not to change the Treaties as it would only lead to a step backwards.
The President of the Council, Leo Tindemans, and the President of the Commission, Gaston Thorn, came to the Committee on Institutional Affairs, as it was then, to ask us not to do it.
Yet Parliament persevered and built up this consensus which reopened the Treaties â a taboo subject for many years.
Nobody wanted to change the Treaties: the Tindemans report avoided proposing Treaty changes and the Three Wise Men report in 1979 advised against changing the Treaties.
Parliament had the courage to say that the Treaties must be reopened and our basic constitutional texts must be re-examined.
Spinelli patiently built up a compromise that was supported in the end by 88% of Parliament when it was adopted.
Every single political group at that time had a majority supporting it.
Even 79% of the British Conservatives supported the Spinelli draft Treaty â they then sat in a different political group.
Now they have joined the EPP-ED Group.
I cannot say they have become more European â perhaps Mr Poettering should work on them a little more.
That is one group that seems to have gone backwards.
Nonetheless, at that time Spinelli was able to build up a remarkable consensus, and it worked.
By thrashing out a project here in this House â which represents the full spectrum of public opinion in Europe â a compromise acceptable to such a wide majority, we were able to set in motion a process which has taken us to where we are today and where the draft Constitution will be the crowning glory of Spinelli's efforts.
We must ensure that Constitution is adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after 17 years as a Member of this European Parliament, I am standing here today, on behalf of the Liberal Group, to deliver what is probably my last speech in a plenary debate.
I am proud, and at the same time thankful, to be here today in a historic place at a historic time.
This is a historic place because the European Parliament is at the heart of democracy in Europe and the only European institution to be elected directly by 450 million European citizens.
Very soon, on 13 June, the peoples of 25 European countries will collectively choose their MEPs at the same time.
Today, Europe is one, reunited in a voluntary, peaceful and sustainable manner on a footing of equality, parity and solidarity.
Eurosceptics say that we are investing in a dream.
That may be so, but what is wrong with that?
At least, and that is important, we are, to a great extent, managing to realise our dreams and unifying Europe.
Today, we are specifically commemorating Jean Monnet, the first thinker, or can I say the first dreamer, of a unified Europe, the architect of the Schuman plan, and the initial founder of the present European Union.
With Jean Monnet in mind, we can dream to our heart's content.
We can cherish dreams, as long as we know how to translate them into action.
Although our great European dream is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress.
In addition to Jean Monnet, I should also like to pay tribute to all those thousands of others who have helped pave the way and, not least, to the European citizens themselves.
The step we are taking on this journey today should also give renewed impetus to the European integration process, because the lack of a truly political European Union will be even more tangible from today.
If the European Union is to play a real role of any significance in the world, it should stop appearing to be a purely economic alliance and grow into political adulthood.
Today is about more than just the European Union's enlargement; it is about a mutation, a reunification of Europe and of all Europeans.
Indeed, today, we are taking a historic step â a step from division to unity, from threatened conflict to guaranteed peace and stability, a step from socio-economic inequality to sustainable growth and prosperity for all our European citizens.
Congratulations to all in this House, because we have not missed this historic opportunity of a European Union.
Consequently, it is with confidence that I am passing on the torch to the many new, young, enthusiastic Europeans in the unique assembly that this European Parliament is.
I should like to say to these young Members, and to all MEPs: the future of Europe is in your hands.
Fare well, Europe.
Remain a beacon of peace and quiet in the stormy sea that our world, alas, has all too often become.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is for me both a great joy and a great honour, here today, to honour the memory of the great European Jean Monnet and to recall that it was the Italian anti-fascist and democratic Communist Altiero Spinelli who was behind the 14 February 1984 draft treaty founding the European Union, and the precursor of the draft constitution drafted by the European Convention, and which, as is well known, the European Parliament of the time approved by a remarkably large majority.
At that time, Altiero Spinelli made it expressly clear that it was above all the European Parliament that, being legitimised as a European institution by the direct suffrage of the citizens, had the vocation of pressing on with European integration and developing it further.
This message of Spinelliâs may well sound like a bequest, but I see it as still being valid today, and so, in the future too, it should guide this Houseâs actions as 25 States join in hammering out the co-existence of 450 million people in the European Union, and do so on a basis of solidarity, democratically and socially.
I am convinced that it is only thus that the unification of Europe, having been officially consummated on 1 May, can really succeed and have a future.
Altiero Spinelli was elected to the European Parliament in 1979, having stood as a candidate for the Italian Communist Party.
He sat as a member of what was at the time the Communist Group, which consisted almost exclusively of representatives of the Italian and French Communist Parties.
From July 1982, as chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, he was in charge of drawing up the draft Treaty.
Regarding myself as belonging very much to Spinelliâs tradition, I am sure you will not mind if I focus my recollections today on him as a man and as a politician.
My main reason for doing so is that Altiero Spinelliâs definitive abandonment of Stalinism occurred as early as 1937, and that he later unswervingly championed European unification with idealism, passion, energy and occasional visions in advance of his own time, whether as an advisor to De Gasperi, to Jean Monnet, to the Italian foreign minister Pietro Nenni, as a visiting professor and political scientist, as a member of the Commission or of Parliament.
His critics and opponents accused him of an occasional tendency to dream dreams and lose touch with reality, which, it has to be said, meant that he made not only friends in the ranks of his own group.
For me, Altiero Spinelli personifies the most recent aspects of our European heritage.
He learned from bitter experience that nationalism, fascism and war must be consigned to the past; that was what motivated his so passionate dedication to a united Europe.
For fighting against fascism, Altiero Spinelli endured many years in Mussoliniâs jails.
That made it only logical that Spinelli should be among the prime movers behind the draft European manifesto at the European resistance conferences in Geneva in 1944.
Even before the end of the war, Spinelli returned to Northern Italy and participated in the armed resistance.
After the war, he was alongside such people as Henri Frenay, the leader of the French resistance movement , and Eugen Kogon, a German who survived Buchenwald, as a co-founder of the European movement.
For Altiero Spinelli, then, it was from the struggle against fascism that he acquired a sense of responsibility for Europeâs development as a peaceful and free democracy, and, right up to his death on 23 May 1986, he treasured his freedom, which had been bought at a great price, and maintained his firm faith in a peaceful and united Europe.
It is this anti-fascist heritage of which I believe we should always be mindful, and which, above all, should always guide our actions.
Â Â  â Mr President, a few months ago, at the Intergovernmental Conference in Brussels, it became clear that the Union might fail and that we might revert to the hallowed national egotisms.
Everyone shrank back from the consequences of such disintegration, got cold feet and set about looking for ways of getting the good ship Europe afloat again.
Mr President, you really ought to interrupt me and ask why I am talking nonsense.
This sentence is 20 years old; Spinelli used it in his speech to this House when presenting his draft.
I confess that I am shocked by how up-to-date this speech is.
As if he were discussing the Convention, he compares the two methods â the drafting of a constitution by a parliament as against the diplomats and ministers at an Intergovernmental Conference.
He tells us that we now know the outcomes of these two differing approaches.
As the negotiations progressed, the national outlook irresistibly gained the upper hand, the European outlook has steadily faded away, and we end up with the proposal that, in effect, action by states should be emphasised to the detriment of action at a supranational level.
As you can see, I am sharing my speaking time with Spinelli.
There is no better way of expressing what has happened over the past few months, in Ecofin, in Brussels, in Naples: the old struggle for a European democracy as opposed to the Europe of the State chanceries, bureaucracies, governments and their claims to absolute power.
Spinelli appeals to this House in these words: âIn taking this initiative, we derive our legitimacy from our status as the citizensâ and the communityâs elected representatives, as those who bear the actual responsibility for the European democracy that is coming into being.â
I have found it very exciting to follow the argument in this speech, for he is trying to persuade this House not to send the draft to the Council or to the Intergovernmental Conference, but to be ratified by the national parliaments.
He, too, was only a matter of months away from an election, and he was speaking in a February, the same month as the decisive moment in the constitution-making process, and I regret the fact that Parliament has not found it in itself to adopt this Convention draft and submit it to the national Parliaments for ratification.
He goes on to say how ashamed he is of a parliament that will in future be powerless to act decisively in giving Europe a constitution, how he shrinks back from setting foot in it.
He also has something fundamental to say about unanimity and the constitution: âIf we were to allow ourselves misgivings about the possibility of starting before everyone has acceded, we would be leaving the decision in the hands, not of those who are most determined, but of those who are the most hesitant, and, indeed, potential opponents, and would thereby be condemning the whole enterprise to virtually certain failure.â
Twenty years ago, Altiero Spinelli called on Parliament to tell the people what was at stake, that being European democracy and the development of political unity.
I will close with some words from Jean Monnet, words that I would urge all governments and ministers to bear constantly in mind, the most up-to-date words that can possibly be said in todayâs constitution-making process: âWe are not coordinating states; we are bringing people together!â
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that both Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli would be very proud of the events of 1 May.
Jean Monnet, a much respected founding father of the European Union, campaigned for the establishment of the European Economic Community because it would be a means to ensure that the continent of Europe would be at peace with itself, as opposed to engaging in war.
The artificial divide which has existed in Europe since the end of World War II has now come to an end and the peoples of east and west Europe have now come together freely as a community of 25 countries, working together with the common interests of promoting economic prosperity, democracy and the rule of law.
The vision of the founding fathers of Europe has been further realised as a direct consequence of the accession of ten new countries into the Union.
As a Community of 25 members, the Union is now in a much stronger position than ever to promote policies on the international stage with vigour and determination.
Also it is now 20 years since Altiero Spinelli drafted his report, which recommended that a constitutional Treaty be agreed for the European Union and one of the key elements of his report back in 1984 was to give a stronger role to the European Parliament.
Many of Altiero Spinelli's recommendations have been included in the Treaties which have been enacted over the last 18 years.
The European Parliament now has the power of codecision with governments of Europe in over 50 fields of legislative activity.
But we must be careful and remember that an extensive amount of work remains to be completed before a European Union Constitutional Treaty is agreed.
Intensive negotiations will continue under the Irish presidency between now and 17 June, with a view to finalising the provisions of this new Treaty.
It is then incumbent on those of us who support this Treaty, which will streamline how the EU does its business, to get out and positively promote its provisions to the people of Europe.
If agreement is reached for a new European Treaty then we will have to focus on the campaign to ratify the terms of this new Treaty across the 25 different Member States of the Union.
We must not underestimate the magnitude of this task.
We must be determined to win this battle so that we will have a Treaty which will govern the European Union for the next 25 years.
Â Â  MrÂ President, today we are remembering Monnet and Spinelli.
I have read Monnetâs memoirs with great pleasure, but nowhere found references there in support of the undemocratic, super-centralised EU state heralded by the Constitution.
Monnet spoke, for example, of a small, practical Commission and not of an uncontrolled democratic monster with fraud and misappropriation amounting to perhaps DKKÂ 60Â billion per year.
I sat beside Spinelli in the Committee on Budgets during my first ten years in Parliament and came to have great respect for his consistent, federalist thinking.
It was he and the founder of , Emanuelle Gasso, who taught me that federalism is not centralism but the idea of democracy at a level higher than that of the national state.
Federalism is a sensible form of government in the United States, Canada, Switzerland and Germany.
It is also a splendid dream for Europe, but it is a dream that could turn into a nightmare if there were no community of people that felt at home in a federal state.
The turn-out at elections to the European Parliament has fallen from 63% to 49% over five elections and will scarcely be more than 40% in June.
Eighty-seven per cent of voters took part in the last Danish election.
I am not an anti-federalist but a realist.
If we make a comparison with the United States, we now have 450 million native Europeans who would have to be removed before a new, common European people could emerge.
If there were 87% participation in the elections to the European Parliament and 49% participation in national elections, the federalists would take over from those of us who are working for a Europe of the nations and for a Europe of democracies and diversities.
Why not make a deal between federalists and realists, whereby you federalists accept a Europe governed from the national parliaments until such time as participation in elections to the European Parliament exceeds participation in national elections?
In return, we should accept the federalist model, or retire, on the day that participation in European Parliament elections makes the national elections less representative of the voters.
Might we also agree to have the EU Constitution put to the vote in all the EU countries on the same day.
In that way, we should obtain the first common European debate on our common future, and we should be able to see whether federalism could defeat our mission to bring about a Europe of democracies.
Let us have a fair fight about the future of Europe.
Until then, I prefer the Danish to the EU Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, MrÂ PresidentâinâOffice of the Council, the Europe of JeanÂ Monnet and AltieroÂ Spinelli was not in Europe.
In Europe the peoples and the institutions were united: nazi Berlin, fascist Rome, Vichy Paris, and Spain and Portugal: they were united.
That Europe of Nations was not the Europe of the Ventotene Manifesto; it was just the Europe of the Holocaust The people of Europe were united in just one instance during Europeâs history: as the Jewish population of the whole of Europe, as different, homosexual or roma people, as the people of the Holocaust.
This is what Europe was.
And the cheerful Europe, the Europe of festivals, executions and of things I do not even want to continue to mention ... Europe then was in prison or had been murdered.
Our Europe was with ThomasÂ Mann, with AlbertÂ Einstein, perhaps with MarleneÂ Dietrich; it was with Don Luigi Sturzo, with GaetanoÂ Salvemini, with EnricoÂ Fermi.
Europe was outside Europe, and we lay claim to those roots only if we visualise a Europe founded on European reform and not on the counter-reform of FranzÂ vonÂ Papen and CardinalÂ Pacelli; the Europe of the White Rose, the Europe of, precisely, reform, and not of the deception of communism, fascism, nationalism and Roman talibanism.
We need to say it clearly, MrÂ President!
You are about to celebrate something which has nothing to do with Spinelliâs idea; tomorrow you will approve a Europe of Nations that lies between social democracy and Gaullism.
Spinelli envisaged Europe in the Council, along the lines of the United States Senate, not in the actual project but in terms of the idea.
Until we reach that type of United States federalism and federalism of the United States of Europe, I think that we will find ourselves in a situation similar to the Paris of the Popular Front, based on red flags and trenches, which betrayed Spanish legality, making the Pyrenees a place of death for Madrid, while fascists and nazis were arriving in Spain to kill.
So I prefer to remember SalvadorÂ deÂ Madariaga and many others: this is Altieroâs Europe.
I would like to make an appeal, MrÂ President: ensure that the Ventotene Manifesto is published together with the draft which we are discussing, not just in all our European languages but also in Arabic and Chinese, because today there is a great need there for that dream, that history and those role models.
Â Â  Mr President, I very much regret that this will be my last speech to this Parliament, having been here for the past 25 years.
I have to retire owing to health reasons, but I want to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues in this Parliament, and of course to the Commission and the Council, for the outstanding support that they gave to peace in Northern Ireland.
The special programme for peace and reconciliation and the International Fund for Ireland have done outstanding work in giving great hope to our young people.
I also owe a lot to this Parliament and to Strasbourg in terms of my own thinking.
I always tell the story of the first time I came here in 1979.
I went for a walk across the bridge from Strasbourg in France to Kehl in Germany and I stopped and meditated.
I thought then that if I had stood there 30 years ago at the end of the Second World War â the worst half century in the history of the world in which 50 million human beings were slaughtered â and had said to myself 'don't worry, it's all over, they will all be united very soon', I would have been sent to a psychiatrist.
But it happened, and it is something that in my opinion the European Union does not devote enough attention to.
The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution.
For that reason, the principles at the heart of it should be sent to every area of conflict.
I know what I am talking about in saying that, because the three principles at the heart of the European Union are exactly the same as the three principles at the heart of our special agreement in Northern Ireland.
Principle number one is respect for difference.
All conflict is about difference, whether it is a matter of race, religion or nationality.
The answer to difference is to respect it, because it is an accident of birth.
Principle number two is institutions that respect differences.
All Member States are represented in the Council of Ministers, the European Commission and the European Parliament.
The third and most important principle is what I call the healing process.
The countries involved worked together in their common interests â for economic development, for example â spilling their sweat and not their blood.
As they did that, they eroded the divisions of centuries and as a result the new Europe has evolved and is still evolving.
Those same three principles are at the heart of our agreement in Northern Ireland.
Both identities fully respect principle number one, respect for difference.
As regards principle number two, institutions, a proportional assembly and a proportional government will involve all sections of society.
When they are in place, the third principle will come into play: working together in common interests, spilling sweat and not blood.
The barriers of the past in Ireland will be eroded and a new Ireland will evolve.
The world is a much smaller place now that we are living through the biggest revolution in the history of the world in terms of technology, telecommunications and transport.
We are therefore in a stronger position to shape that world, particularly in this very historic week â who could have dreamt that the whole of Europe would be together?
Given that it is a smaller world and that we are in a stronger position to shape it, the European Union should decide that our first objective in this new century is a world in which there is no longer any war or conflict.
In order to ensure that is the case â and I am making this appeal to the Council of Ministers â the European Union should put in place a Commissioner, backed by a Commission department for peace and reconciliation, whose function would be to send to every area of conflict in the world not arms or soldiers, but the philosophy of European Union.
This Commissioner's role would be to promote the dialogue about that philosophy and to help create a world in which there is no longer any war or any conflict.
I believe that is now possible.
Finally, once again I express my deepest gratitude to you all for the great support that you give to peace on my own streets.
Thank you very much indeed and I regret very much that I am leaving this great Parliament.
Â Â  I thank you, Mr Hume, and all the contributors to this commemorative debate.
That concludes the debate.
Â Â  The next item is the general debate on the future of the enlarged European Union.
Â Â  The general debate begins with Council and Commission statements â Towards a European Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would also like to pay a warm tribute to Mr Hume on what was a remarkable valedictory speech.
I am very pleased to be invited to speak to you today in this general debate on the future of the enlarged European Union â Towards a European Constitution.
Today's debate is taking place as representatives of all the Member States and of the Parliament are meeting in Dublin.
The task that has been set for them is to resolve the outstanding non-institutional issues in the debate on the Constitutional Treaty.
As a member of the European Convention, I am very conscious of the hard work and the deep commitment of the representatives of the European Parliament to the Convention process.
While we may not have been entirely in agreement on each and every issue, I valued our shared commitment to producing a Constitutional Treaty that will serve this Union well and that will commend itself to the citizens of Europe.
While negotiations on the draft Treaty are yet to be concluded, we can take some satisfaction from what has been achieved.
I should like to underline that at this point in our discussions we have moved much further, in a much more positive way, than anyone would have believed possible in the dark days of December and the early days of January.
The draft that came out of the Convention provided the Intergovernmental Conference with a truly excellent framework on which to build a Constitutional Treaty that will stand the test of time.
The draft is presented in language which is more accessible than any previous Treaty.
The draft makes it clear who does what in the Union.
It elaborates the doctrine of subsidiarity, it clarifies the scope of the European Union's powers, it enhances democratic accountability and simplifies the range of legal instruments through which the Union acts.
It seeks to provide the Union of 25 and more Member States with institutions that are workable and capable of meeting the needs of our citizens and of our Union into the future.
It enshrines for the first time a Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Union's constitutional order.
It equips our Union to act with greater cohesion internally and to project and promote our shared values on the world stage, the very values of which Mr Hume spoke so movingly a few moments ago.
This is a formidable document that should commend itself to the people of Europe.
When I listen to critics and sceptics I am at a loss to understand what they are talking about.
As I said on the BBC last weekend, I earnestly hope that the critics and sceptics â including those in this House â will take just a little time to consider this draft document and what it contains, and to take on board its very many merits.
I want to express my thanks to Parliament for its strong support of our efforts to conclude the IGC under the Irish presidency.
I can reassure you, Mr President, and the Members of this Parliament again today that we are doing everything in our power to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion.
The very positive reaction to the Taoiseach's report to the Spring Council and the confirmation that the political will existed to reach agreement by the June European Council is a very encouraging sign of the commitment of partners to finding a final agreement.
While we must not underestimate the challenge that lies ahead, we can say with some confidence that we are closer to agreement than we have ever been.
We are seeking to make as much progress as possible during May, so as to leave only a very small number of issues for final decision by the Heads of State or Government at the June European Council.
In this context, the Taoiseach called on partners take a 'positive and focused approach' to the negotiations and to avoid bringing issues not previously identified to the negotiating table.
In response to President Cox's point earlier, foreign ministers will meet for detailed discussions on 17 and 18Â May.
It is our ambition and intention to resolve as many outstanding issues as possible at that meeting.
At the last meeting of the General Affairs Council, Minister Cowen made it clear that if, in his view, further work is required, the foreign ministers will meet on 24 May and if necessary again after that.
We will also continue to meet partners bilaterally, at both political and official level.
The Taoiseach in particular will be using his pre-European Council tour of capitals, which started this week, to tease out Member States' concerns, to assuage those concerns, to answer any outstanding fears and to bring matters to resolution.
I do not propose to go into too much detail on the outstanding issues.
You are all aware of them: the definition and scope of QMV, the composition of the Commission, and a number of other issues of varying degrees of complexity and sensitivity.
However, irrespective of how complex the issues are or how sensitive they are, if there is a political will, a way will be found to resolve those conflicts and sensitive issues.
Touching on a number of key issues, we have made clear our view that only a voting system based on a double majority can command a consensus.
However, while keeping the need for efficiency, we must also pay due regard to the needs for balance among the Member States and to their specific concerns.
It should be possible to reach an outcome which meets the concerns of all, perhaps through some adjustment of the population and the Member State thresholds.
As regards the scope of QMV, there is a general desire, shared I know by Parliament, for its extension with a view to promoting efficient decision-making in a larger Union.
At the same time, there is also a need to take account of the particular concerns of Member States.
I believe that a satisfactory overall outcome, which will involve a further growth in the number of areas subject to QMV and to codecision, will be found.
We all agree that the Commission must be effective.
We also fully appreciate the concerns of Member States regarding the composition of the Commission.
Mr Hume spoke about the institutional framework and its extraordinarily subtle formula.
I feel that the two perspectives â the concerns about an efficient Commission and the concerns about the composition of the Commission â could possibly be reconciled through maintaining, for an extended period, a Commission comprising one national from each Member State, moving thereafter to a reduced size on the basis of strict equal rotation.
I know that a great many of you hope that it will be possible to conclude the Constitutional Treaty before the European Parliament elections, and indeed, privately, that would be my hope and desire too.
As presidency, we would like to be in a position to do so, but at this stage it is more realistic to suggest that the final negotiations will conclude in the June European Council.
We should recognise that the vast bulk of the Convention's work has remained unchanged and will not be changed.
We should remember that we have agreed a clear set of values and principles to which we can all subscribe and which go to the very heart of what the European Union is and what the European Union is hoping to achieve.
These are not in question in the Intergovernmental Conference.
It is worth reiterating what we have achieved: we have made tremendous progress in simplifying decision-making, in making clear who is responsible for taking decisions, in making clear to citizens that these decisions will be taken at the appropriate level.
We have further enhanced the role of the European Parliament and strengthened, as a result, the democratic scrutiny of the Union.
These principles are not in question in the IGC.
We should also remember the very substantial progress on the outstanding non-institutional issues made by the Italian presidency, to which I pay tribute.
The proposals which we have tabled for discussion at today's focal point meeting owe a great deal to the work of this presidency's predecessors.
This new Constitution will be good for the European Union, it will be good for the Member States, and, most importantly of all, it will be good for the citizens of Europe.
Of that I am absolutely convinced.
As presidency, we are committed to doing everything in our power to ensure a successful outcome to the negotiations.
Following on from the momentous achievement of the enlargement which has just taken place, the successful conclusion of negotiations on the Constitutional Treaty is the next logical step in our Union's advancement.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were all, I am sure, moved and encouraged by the expressions of joy that greeted the arrival of ten new Member States in the European Union on 1Â May.
There is ample justification for such displays of enthusiasm.
Indeed, enlargement represents the future: the future of Europeâs history, a future of peace and prosperity, solidarity and union, on a continental scale.
It also represents the future of the European project, within the framework of which we must work together and the benefits of which we must constantly, on a daily basis, explain to our citizens, in order that we can earn their support.
Enlargement also represents a unique opportunity, which we must take with both hands, to reform our policies and to restructure the European institutions in order to develop the appropriate instruments to enable tomorrowâs EU to focus not only on the requirements â both internal and external â of efficiency, transparency and simplicity, but also on the specific concerns of the citizens and on anything that may make a difference to their daily lives.
It is worth recalling the reasons why the Laeken European Council opted to establish the Convention on the future of Europe: the growing distance between the public and the European institutions, the need to rethink the European project and the institutions in the context of enlargement and the need to take stock of Europeâs role in an increasingly globalised world.
Mr President, it is worth recalling the challenges that the Laeken Council issued to the Convention: the challenge of setting out clearly the division of competence between the Union and the Member States, so as to explain more clearly to the public who does what in the European Union; the challenge of simplifying the Unionâs texts, instruments and decision-making procedures; the challenge of bringing added value to the European institutions and decision-making processes, in terms of democracy, transparency and efficiency; and even, perhaps, the challenge of fulfilling the dream of adopting a European Constitution.
Faced with these challenges, the Convention made a clear choice â an extremely clear choice, in fact!
We chose the constitutional path.
We decided to place the public at the heart of the European project, hence the complete incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitutional Treaty.
Today we are closer than ever before, as Mr Roche has just said, to adopting a genuine European Constitution.
Our desire to see this ambitious project succeed is an accurate reflection of our evaluation of the Conventionâs work.
The Commission feels that the draft Constitution has met the aims of simplicity, efficiency and democracy.
This is not, of course, a perfect document.
A few refinements, confined to the Conventionâs draft Constitution, are, in our view, desirable, provided that these do not upset the overall balance of the text.
We must improve our ability to act, within the framework of decision-making that from now on encompasses the Twenty-Five, by means of a more general extension to qualified majority voting.
The decision-making process must be made more transparent.
We are staunch advocates of double majority in Council voting.
I understand Mr Rocheâs argument.
Ways must be found of ensuring that everyone is part of the double majority system.
Care must be taken, however, not to introduce any element into the double majority system that may cause confusion, as this would divest it of its major advantages from the publicâs point of view, namely, efficiency and clarity.
Let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater!
We must also be in a position to respond to future developments that are already underway, by making the procedure of revising the Treaties more flexible, at least as regards the EUâs policies.
Part III is, in fact, out of step with the modernisation of all the other elements of the Constitutional Treaty.
Moreover, it is not sufficiently adaptable to the new aims of the Union as regards the Lisbon Agenda and sustainable development.
What is needed is a flexible review of PartÂ III.
It is ultimately crucial that we ensure that all Member States receive equal treatment, by, , establishing a Commission made up of one voting Commissioner per Member State, which requires an internal Commission structure that complies with the principle of collegiality.
This solution for the Commission must stand until such time as the new Member States are completely integrated.
Where necessary, alternative solutions must be sought.
Mr President, I must express my support for the Irish Presidencyâs determination to conclude negotiations on the future Constitution, preferably before elections to Parliament or, at least, immediately after that landmark event.
We â and on this I feel that I am expressing the opinion of the Commission, Parliament and the presidencyÂ âÂ are all equally determined to see the European Constitution come to fruition during the first half of this year, thereby giving tangible form to the progress made in the Convention.
I should also like to thank Parliament on behalf of the Commission for its significant contribution in drawing up the Constitution, and, in particular, the efforts made by all of Parliamentâs representatives in the Convention and its Praesidium.
I should like to single out, if I may, MrÂ HÃ€nsch, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Duff.
Similarly instrumental were Parliamentâs determination, during negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), that the progress made at the Convention would not be undone, and the regular, comprehensive consultations, conducted under MrÂ Napolitanoâs competent and constructive leadership in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Against this backdrop, the Commission shares Parliamentâs determination â and, I feel, that of the vast majority of national delegations â that the consensus that emerged from the Convention on almost every point discussed should not be jeopardised during this final period of negotiations at the IGC.
To take steps backwards, in areas such as the balance between Parliament and the Council on financial and budgetary issues, would be completely unthinkable from the point of view of the principle of European democracy.
Nevertheless, I should like to point out that the process of making a constitutional Europe requires effort on the part of both the new Parliament and the next Commission.
In view of the ratification procedures in all current and new Member StatesÂ âÂ especially if referendums are to be held, as would appear to be the case â it is crucial that public debate on the European Constitution should take place.
We must avoid falling into the trap of simply juxtaposing twenty-five national debates; what we need is a real European debate.
Lastly, Mr President, although Milan Kundera wrote that the only reason people want to be masters of the future is to change the past, I, personally, want to master the future because I see it as a future of peace, prosperity and solidarity, founded upon a European Constitution that is able, democratically and effectively, to meet the expectations and needs of 450Â million citizens.
What we are doing is mastering the past in order to forge a common future.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hume has just spoken very movingly.
Having been a Member of this House since 1979, he will be leaving Parliament, as will my Irish friend Mr McCartin.
At a time like now, when we are thinking about the future, that should prompt us to briefly review the past, as we have just done in commemorating Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli.
Looking back over the past in this way enables us to have confidence and hope that we really can be optimistic in looking forward to our continentâs future.
Let us consider the previous enlargements.
There was one in 1973, when the Europe of the Six was joined by Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom, thus becoming a Europe of Nine; then, in 1981, came Greece; Spain and Portugal joined in 1986, with three more countries âFinland, Sweden and Austria â acceding in 1995.
Finally, we now have a Community of 25.
Hand in hand with this, the Community has always gained in depth, with the EEC and Euratom being created in 1957, the Single European Act in 1986, and the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, in connection with which we must recall the great achievements of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and Commission President Jacques Delors, whose work was successfully continued by Jacques Santer.
We then had Amsterdam in 1995, followed by Nice, which may well not have been that much of a success, but it was there that we adopted the resolution that we would conclude accession negotiations with the candidate countries in time for the European elections.
If we were to sum up all the changes that have taken place over these years, we would have to come to the conclusion that this is a great continent, one that has always, even when faced with great difficulties, gone forward in the right direction.
It is now a matter of our great good fortune that Ireland holds the Presidency â Mr Roche, their Minister for Europe and our President-in-Office of the Council, is with us today â and is conducting its affairs with a combination of vision, pragmatism and goodwill, the latter quite crucial if there is to be any progress.
Let me thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for the work you have done to date.
If we deserve a European Constitution, it is because of your efforts and Europeâs.
I would also like to express gratitude to Commissioner Vitorino, who, jointly with his fellow-Commissioner MrÂ Barnier presided over the work done by our colleagues in the Convention.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would welcome it if the Irish presidency were yet to succeed in getting a reference made in the preamble to our Judaeo-Christian heritage.
It is because this embodies our values that we regard it as important, but it is also important that you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, should not agree to any curtailment of Parliamentâs budgetary prerogatives.
Commissioner Vitorino also made reference to that.
Such a thing must not be permitted.
It is one of the prerogatives of the European Parliament, and indeed of any other, to be able to determine what is done with the Budget, and we will not be able accept any curtailment of our rights in that respect.
The European Constitution is a great step forward, in that it strengthens Europe as a Community.
It represents progress in that it strengthens European democracy and parliamentary government.
The European Constitution is a step forward in that subsidiarity is reinforced, and in that it makes reference, for the first time, to local governance.
Municipalities, cities, communities, that is to say the places we call home, are given the right to manage their own affairs.
The national parliaments are also given the right to appeal in the event of their rights under the subsidiarity principle being infringed.
Europe is becoming more efficient, Europe is becoming more democratic, and what we want to achieve is unity for this Europe of ours in all its diversity.
The Constitution is a means to that end.
When considering the future, we have to answer the question as to who can yet become a member of the European Union.
With whom do we want to co-exist as good neighbours?
We want to co-exist as good neighbours with everyone, especially with our Arab and Muslim neighbours, so that our continent may be a continent of peace, founded upon law and with a constitution of its own.
We wish the Irish Presidency every success in achieving that for us.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to begin by joining in the deserved tributes to Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli, two visionaries, two anti-fascists and two courageous people.
I would also like to point out that Jean Monnet very often quoted the Swiss philosopher Amiel, saying the following: âEach manâs experience starts again from the beginning.
Only institutions grow wiser: they accumulate collective experience; and, owing to this experience and this wisdom, men subject to the same rules will not see their own nature changing, but their behaviour gradually transformedâ.
And that is what we are doing here, in Parliament, and what we also want to do with the European Constitution.
My esteemed friend, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, told us that he carried the âSpinelli Treatyâ in his briefcase when he was working in the Convention.
I can tell him that, when we were preparing the Maastricht Treaty, I had the opportunity to speak with Paco OrdÃ³Ã±ez, who was Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister, and he told me that he carried the âSpinelli Treatyâ in his briefcase and I carried it as well, and I would recommend to Minister Roche that he carries the âSpinelli Treatyâ in his briefcase when he has to find some imaginative solution.
I would also like to add that much is said about solidarity, about the step-by-step policy and so on, but we must remember one thing, and that is that the declaration of 9 May 1950 begins by talking about peace â as our friend John Hume has done today.
Peace was the issue, not just creating a common market for steel and coal.
Having said this, Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to express our complete support for the declaration of the European Parliamentâs Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Constitution.
I believe that this is the time to support this declaration in circumstances such as that mentioned by the minister.
I would reiterate our support for the draft Constitution, in the form it left the Convention.
We are aware that there are certain specific points to deal with, not with regard to values â we are very happy with this democratic and secular Europe for everybody â but we do believe there are certain issues still to be dealt with.
One of them â and I say this coming from the country which, with an entirely mistaken vision, under the previous government, blocked the constitutional debate â is qualified majority voting within the Council.
We have always been clearly in favour of this system.
I would like Minister Roche to explain to this House how many times the Ioannina Compromise has been applied in the past, because there may well be proposals which take that route, which would not be the best ones.
I would also like to add another important element, which appears in the draft approved in Thessaloniki but which then disappears from sight: there must be a legislative Council, because laws must be created in public and transparently, and there must also be a shared legislative power, not only to create laws, but also to approve budgets.
Finally, Mr President â and I address this to the President of Parliament â there is a specific request from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which is of very great importance, and that is that the President of Parliament, and our representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference, should be able to participate fully in the debates of that conference. And also that during this period, given that the European Parliament remains constituted, that this House can be informed by the most appropriate means.
There is nothing to prevent this and it is important from the point of view of the timetable proposed to us by the President-in-Office of the Council.
I believe that this is an extremely important element and that in Parliament we are naturally going to be campaigning.
And a noble element of this campaign is that we contribute to making progress on the Constitution.
A final point which relates to the debate we will hold tomorrow: Mr President-in-office of the Council, we must make progress not just on the composition of the Commission, but also on the simultaneous mandate to that of Parliament.
We are now in a very complicated situation.
A new President-in-Office of the Council is going to be proposed. There is an excessively long period in a transitional and temporary situation and that is not good either for the Commission or for the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, it has been a great privilege to serve in a Parliament that has made such great progress in delivering for Europe the constitutional settlement that it needs.
Parliament has become now an assured player in the constitutive process and we have assisted Europe to answer definitively the old question about whether the Union could widen and deepen at the same time.
The answer is certainly 'yes'.
We expect the European Council now to show the political will to bring the IGC to a quick and successful conclusion and to draft the durable, efficient and effective system of democratic government that we need to strengthen the Union and its place in world affairs.
However, it is vital that Parliament, which has played such a crucial part in the IGC so far, does not fade at the final phase.
President Cox and our representatives, Mr Brok and MrÂ HÃ€nsch, must carry on playing a full part in the negotiations and resist any weakening of Parliament's powers of codecision and assent.
There are some worrying signs in this respect and Commissioner Vitorino is quite right to warn us.
Why, for example, is the Irish presidency suddenly seeking in its latest proposals to remove Parliament's power of codecision with respect to the Structural Funds?
Perhaps Minister Roche could explain.
If the Council wishes to encumber itself with unanimity upon financial questions, that is its own problem, but it cannot be permitted to evade parliamentary accountability.
I wish to support the committee's request that, should there be a crisis at the IGC, the President should call a special meeting of the Conference of Presidents.
Despite our dispersal across 25 electoral campaigns, we would be able to reassemble quickly to reinforce the President's negotiating position.
Please remember that a negative assessment by Parliament on the final conclusions of the IGC would certainly scupper referendum campaigns wherever they spring up.
Â Â  Mr President, on 3Â September last year, in this very House and to the cheers of those present, Mr Giscard d'Estaing presented us with the draft Constitution.
A large majority of my group, for its part â convinced that, now more than ever, we need a Europe that can offer hope that the world can change, and irrespective of what we might think of one aspect or another of the text â refused to sign up to what was termed the âconstitutionalisation of the liberal worldâ.
Ultimately, we were unanimous in calling for a referendum, to be preceded by a major public and genuinely pluralist debate in each country.
Eight months on, we are no less convinced of the rightness of our position; in fact we have, I think, been strengthened in it by the way in which the debate on the European Left has unfolded, by the experiences of several EU countries and, lastly, despite its wishes, by the work of the Commission itself.
Developments in the European leftâs debate on this issue have been most interesting.
Indeed, in the weeks and months following the publication of the text of the Convention, we have found our position increasingly in line with that of the main spokespeople of the European Social Forum and of alter-globalisation movements.
Furthermore, prominent Members of other groups of this House, or their political family, have taken on some of our arguments, even our wording, for which I am most grateful, albeit juxtaposing certain ideas that I would consider contradictory. This is nothing, however, that a calm public debate could not put right.
Equally significant is experience during this entire period in different EU countries.
Fierce social struggles have taken place against liberal reforms that are all rooted in the European policies of our respective governments.
This is precisely why, the very day after the resounding electoral defeat suffered by the Right in France, the Commission moved to head off any risk of a shift in French politics by issuing an ultimatum that, and I quote, âFrance must pursue its reformsâ.
Lastly, the Commission itself has just drawn up a progress report on the Lisbon Agenda, which, four years ago, expressed the ambition of social improvement through liberalism.
What exactly does this analysis say?
For the first time in ten years, as the document sets out in detail, we have shed two hundred thousand more jobs than we have created in the eurozone, whereas the declared objective had been to achieve full employment by 2010.
We even learn, from this same document, that more than one 15-year old European in six, to quote the Commission âdoes not have the basic skills in reading writing and arithmeticâ. This offers some idea of the depth of the crisis in the liberal model, which had aimed to lead us in less than six years to the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
On all of these points, most Members of my group are not expecting miracles from the European Council, which â by complete chance, of course â comes a few days after the European elections.
In forcefully reiterating our demands for a referendum, preceded by a genuine debate that would allow the public to be in possession of the facts, we feel that, straightaway, a clear and unequivocal vote this June will be the best signal to give to the architects of the future Treaty.
Mr President, on a personal note, if I may, I should like to conclude â given that this is to be my last speech of this legislative term â that, if my constituents so wish, I will continue to lead the fight, with my friends, in this very House, for an alternative Europe.
Otherwise, we will do so elsewhere, come what may.
See you soon!
Â Â  Mr Roche, there is a fundamental difference between work on the Constitution in the Convention and work during the Intergovernmental Conference which, I am afraid, can only have a clear, negative impact on the result.
Everything or almost everything regarding the Convention was visible, including its crises and other moments.
It was the outcome of complicated work which gave us a barely adequate compromise.
On the contrary, your work remains secret, and we have to rely on moles in order to find out what is happening, given that unfortunately, our representatives too and their officials love playing the diplomat and therefore do not inform us, as they should, of what is really taking place at the Intergovernmental Conference.
I do not like in the slightest what is really going on, and my group likes it even less.
A show of optimism, which feeds a kind of reassuring syrup to the media and public opinion, in my view in reality hides a further possible victory for those governments, old and new, who cheerily thumb their noses at the European interest.
It seems that this view is also held by the Commission which, behind much ceremony and diplomacy, has revealed to us here a line which is going in a completely different direction to the one which we are about to agree to in Dublin.
Today if we read the text which your officials are working on, MrÂ Roche, it is clear that this is an exercise for which AltieroÂ Spinelli would have retold the story of âThe Old Man and the Seaâ who, returning to the shore with his large fish, as you will remember, finds it has been devoured by sharks.
MrÂ Roche said that he does not want to go into detail.
That is a shame.
If he did, everyone would be able to see the price we are about to pay, including to MrÂ Blair and his referendum: firstly, maintaining unanimity for justice and home affairs, so we can kiss goodbye to the fight against terrorism, where today there will probably be an interesting instalment on the question of assigning European citizensâ rights to the United States with respect to the agreement on passengers; secondly, reinforcing the interpretative clause of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, tabled by the United Kingdom in Thessaloniki, which makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its cogency practically useless; and that is not to mention the removal of the European Parliamentâs power of assent for structural funds decisions or the opportunity for parliaments to veto each amendment.
Today, therefore, we find ourselves in a radically different situation to that of yesterday: yesterday was the day the dream came true; naturally I would not want us today to have to start picking up the pieces of a dream already shattered.
Our first duty now is to let the citizens know that the terms on which the Presidency has chosen to negotiate are the same terms which Parliament rejected in December; our second duty is to initiate a serious debate about what the consequences of a ânoâ in a referendum should be, which in my view should be crystal clear: anyone who says ânoâ in a referendum on the Constitution â as Spinelli said â is putting itself outside Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour today to appear for the first time before this forum of representatives of 450 million citizens of a united Europe speaking my mother tongue, Slovak.
For years and years, I have hoped and believed that Slovakia would, as a sovereign State, one day become a full member of the European Union.
An essential prerequisite for the continued effective operation of the EU following its historic enlargement involves adapting its institutional framework to meet the new circumstances.
The first test awaiting us, therefore, and what a test it is, is the approval of the Constitutional Treaty.
Adopting the Constitutional Treaty is, however, impossible unless citizens of the Member States can identify with such an important document.
Let us not divide Europe into old and new, let us not categorise States as small and large, rich and poor.
If we want Europe to be really unified, we must listen to every nation, every citizen.
Let us give an opportunity to these citizens and Member States to create their own attitudes to Europe in line with their own traditions, respecting the principle of sovereignty in cultural and ethical matters.
I am deeply convinced that the purpose of EU reform is to create not a superstate but a supranational body, whose legitimacy is derived from the primary legitimacy of the Member States.
The Constitutional Treaty must guarantee a model of effective coexistence, the fundamental pillars for which are tolerance and mutual trust.
May I remind you of the rights of the small States.
For them, the question of financial mechanisms, together with an effective regional policy, is particularly vital.
As regards the future shape of the European Commission, I am of the opinion that every Member State must have its own full Commissioner with precisely defined powers.
Europe must be built on the principle of equality among the Member States of the Union.
The accession of ten new States to the EU does not mean that the process of integration is finished.
Nor will adopting the Constitutional Treaty bring reform of the Union to an end and, therefore, it is not possible at this stage to resolve all the questions relating to the operation of the European Union.
It is important that this process should aim to meet our common objectives.
Mr President, allow me sincerely to wish our Irish friends and indeed all of us a successful resolution of these matters, matters which have been discussed with such passion, and to hope that fundamental progress is made at the summit in June, culminating perhaps in the adoption of the Treaty by consensus among all the national delegations.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the voters in twenty-five countries, some 300Â million in number, will go to the polls, between 10 and 13Â June depending on the country, without knowing the answers to the two key questions facing us: âWhat kind of Constitution is Europe to have?â and âWhat are Europeâs borders to be?â
What characterises the European Union, to my mind, is its contempt for the sovereign voice of nations and citizens: a federal Constitution, which is hidden, only to be unveiled three days later; three days after the elections!
Are you trying to have us believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that, after almost two years of the Convention, and the Intergovernmental Conference, you were not ready to present this Constitution to the citizens before they voted?
In all honesty, as you said just now, we can see right through this ...
As for Turkeyâs accession, which would give the European Union â let us be clear about this â a border with Iraq, the decision, which is already known, will also be taken, in a few monthsâ time behind the citizensâ backs.
Mr President, many people had high hopes for your Presidency, the Irish Presidency.
In truth, you will have put another brick in an ever-thicker wall, which is no longer dividing Europe in two, but is separating the Europe above â that of the institutions â from the Europe below, that is to say, the people.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to make the same suggestion to you as I did last time â I think it was the Prime Minister who was there: why not bring the June Summit forward by a week, just one week? That way, you will show the public that the European Union is not afraid of its own shadow.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a great joy for us today to meet one of the key objectives of the original Community, as we welcome into our Union the Eastern European countries freed from the Communist yoke.
Europe is turning a new page in its history, a page full of promise, and yet it will have to revolutionise the way in which it thinks and operates.
We have yet to make all the necessary changes in this respect.
On the day in which Europe is enlarged to 25, we are still living with institutions that were built on a unitary model retaining something of the old bloc-based Europe, in the way that it seeks power by supranational hierarchy and seeks to abolish national sovereignties.
The draft European Constitution under negotiation is a perfect example of this thinking, and is, consequently, ill-suited to the management of a Europe enlarged to include twenty-five, thirty, or more Members.
What we must do â and I hope that the EU will discover this soon, perhaps, indeed, with the help of the new Member States â is to revive the legitimacy of national democracies, and arrange for their experience to be shared and their example to be followed, in the grand European tradition of pluralism, within flexible institutions built on the foundations of free nations.
Â Â  Mr President, from 1 May we can celebrate one of the greatest achievements of the post-war era.
Few imagined 20 years ago that the borders of the European Union would extend to the Baltic States and Poland.
Then we faced a hostile Soviet Union that held Central and Eastern Europe in its iron grip.
The Cold War was evident, the nuclear stand-off only too real and many European peoples were under the yoke of one-party socialist dictatorships.
This is a time for thanksgiving that we are able to sit alongside democratically elected representatives of those previously suppressed peoples.
Liberal democracy has triumphed.
We also rejoice that these nations are members of the NATO alliance, the most successful defence organisation the world has ever seen.
Warfare between the nations of Europe is unthinkable.
We have secured a great prize and we must build on it.
This week my party marks the 25th anniversary of the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, whose government I was privileged to join.
We should recall today the major contribution she has made to the cause of freedom on this continent.
She did perhaps more than any western political statesman of our age in confronting the Communists and bringing about the collapse of the Iron Curtain.
As one who served on the Convention, I know there will be many debates on the future of this continent in the coming years, including through future treaties.
My party has a clear vision of a Europe of nation states.
The new Member States now join these debates.
The peoples of Europe want peace, freedom and security.
We must secure these goals and we do so in a spirit of openness and mutual respect.
However, Europe should meet the aspirations of its people in partnership with the United States.
With enlargement the Atlanticist cause will be strengthened.
In the economic sphere, the new Member States bring vitality and experience of the need for economic reform.
We must all become more competitive and abandon the economic ways of the past.
Whatever our views on the kind of Europe we want to see, this week we can celebrate the reuniting of the nations of Europe.
It is a cause that my party has long championed and we say unreservedly to those who join us here today: you are most welcome.
Â Â  â Mr President, today, again, almost everything has been said about the timetable for consideration of the Constitution and of its contents.
We welcome the Irish Presidencyâs adroitness and its determination to bring about a resolution on the Constitution by the end of June.
I agree entirely with Commissioner Vitorino in the demands he has made and the warnings he has given, and can testify that he played an outstanding part in the Conventionâs Praesidium, for which he has earned Parliamentâs gratitude.
What do we need the Constitution for?
Only with the Constitution will Europe be equal to its global responsibilities.
Without a Constitution, the states of Europe will remain pawns in other powersâ games; only with it will they themselves become players.
The Constitution alone will make the European Union stronger, more effective and more democratic, rather than merely larger.
Without the Constitution, the EU will progressively degenerate into a customs union.
The Constitution alone will enable the EU to become, again, attractive to the public, for Europe will become more comprehensible and more responsible.
Without the Constitution, people will lose what is left of their confidence in the future viability of European integration.
If it were to fail, it would mean more than just the end of a great hope.
Its failure would mean reversion to a Europe of plots and rancour; it would be the beginning of the end for European unity.
Centres of gravity, avant-gardes, and multiple speeds â none of these are alternatives; none of them can be a substitute for a constitution.
A Union of axes and alliances, of so-called strategic partnerships is not what we need.
We must not turn this Europe of ours into a patchwork Union, confusing the citizens at home and discrediting Europe in the eyes of those around us.
One of the key words in the Constitution is âbalanceâ.
That was, and remains, a key to peace and stability in Europe.
The states of the old Europe spent centuries in repeated attempts to establish this balance.
On the field of diplomacy, they used axes and alliances, and, on the field of battle, blood and iron.
The Constitution for the new Europe of the twenty-first century establishes balance by means of the equal participation of all states and the weighting of each of them within shared institutions in a way they can regard as fair.
The Constitution for the new Europe replaces the old Europeâs balance of powers by the balance of institutions and by balancing the legitimacy of states and citizens.
A new world order is coming into being, not in ten yearsâ time, but today.
If we Europeans do not prepare ourselves now, we will be opting out of world history â first in political terms, and then, inevitably, economically as well.
The union of Europeans on the basis of this Constitution is our response to globalisation.
History affords no precedent for what we will be doing.
It will demand political courage and a firm faith in the future of our old continent.
Legally speaking, the Constitution is a Treaty, and replaces the treaties on European Union currently in force, but it does â like every democratic constitution in the world â govern the ways in which power is legitimated and the ways in which it is limited.
Politically speaking, the Constitution makes the enlarged European Union more solid, more effective, more responsible, more manageable and more comprehensible, enabling its people to become more familiar with it and to trust it more.
Historically speaking, though, the Constitution amounts to nothing less than the re-founding of the European Union, of a Union that is an example to those within it and those outside it, a Union of peace, freedom, and justice.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Vitorino, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, we are no doubt all still going around in a state of euphoria following the historic weekend celebration of European unification.
It feels like a real privilege to be able to stand here in the House together with fellow MEPs from 24 other countries.
The EU will never be the same again.
An ordinary day will, however, dawn following this celebration, an ordinary day in the life of the European Union, characterised by negotiations, discussions and compromises.
This method is in every respect superior to all others when it comes to making progress in European cooperation, but it also has shortcomings, and it will not always be easy to unite when there are so many different countries, desires, cultures, backgrounds and expectations.
People are also making a lot of demands of us and subjecting us to pressure, and there are expectations that the EU will operate properly and deliver.
We therefore need a book of rules.
We need a Constitution.
We have today honoured the memory of Altiero Spinelli who, more than anyone else, fought for a Constitution.
There is no better way of honouring his memory than by ensuring that the citizens of Europe are given a European Constitution.
The new countries that have now become our colleagues have made huge efforts on their journey here.
Unfortunately, the old EU has not to anything like the same extent displayed a willingness to change.
We face huge challenges.
We have the environmental threats, including the greenhouse effect, as well as the fight against organised crime, including terrorism, and the horrific trafficking in women and children.
We must create a continent characterised by growth and economic development.
We must create a common European foreign policy, and we must become more active in global work for peace, democracy and free trade.
These issues cannot be resolved in an effective and satisfactory way by using the Treaty of Nice.
Here in Parliament, we have done our homework.
We put our weight behind setting up a Convention.
We actively contributed our views.
Now it is time for the Council to show that it too has done its homework.
We must show the people of 25 countries â 450 million people â that the new EU has risen to its new status.
We must show that we are able and willing to change in order to tackle the problems we face and fully realise the potential of our united Europe.
I therefore wish to thank the Irish Presidency for the huge amount of work it is doing and wish it every good fortune so that we might all get to see a European Constitution brought about at the forthcoming June summit.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened with interest to what Mr Roche told us earlier, namely that the Irish Presidency of the Council is drawing, in its proposals, on those made by its Italian predecessor.
Basically, Mr Roche, the only thing is that the public has no idea whatever about what negotiations are currently going on and what the present position is with regard to the draft Constitution.
At the same time, the text produced by the Convention is still under massive attack, even though it is due to be adopted at the end of the Irish Presidency, which is only a matter of a few weeks away.
I therefore, as a former member of the Convention, have this appeal to make to the Council and to the Irish who preside over it.
For a start, no concession must be made, under any circumstances whatever, to the renewed pressure from the European Central Bank for the objective in Part I to be revised. The Convention has stated that the ECB should, in future, promote a balance between sustainable growth, employment and price stability, and that should be the end of the matter.
Secondly, Part III of the draft Constitution must â as this House has emphatically demanded â be adapted, in a politically and legally binding way, to the fundamental provisions of Part I, in order to secure the social dimension of the European Union.
To put it another way, the expression âopen market economyâ must be replaced by âsocial market economyâ if we are to avoid opening the door wide to unbridled capitalism.
Thirdly, let me contradict Mr Poettering by saying that the preamble to the Constitution is no place for mention of God.
The people who live in the EU must not be divided into believers and unbelievers.
Reference to God is not, moreover, a suitable bargaining counter for getting the Poles, for example, to agree to dual majority in the Council of Ministers, nor must it be used in an attempt to nullify the idea of Turkeyâs accession to the EU.
We do indeed need a referendum on the Constitution, and, in the Convention, I have already argued the case for one.
It is the EUâs citizens who must have the last word, for it is their future that is at stake.
I urge that there should be an EU-wide referendum on the Constitution on the same day in all the Member States; the date I would suggest is 8 May 2005.
Being the 60th anniversary of liberation from Fascism and the eve of the Day of Europe, it would be a suitable day on which to vote.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, a moment ago, our President reminded us of Jean Monnet and his words:âWe are not united states, we are united peopleâ.
I should like to change this to: âWe are united peoplesâ.
Yesterday, we welcomed ten new countries, and ten new flags of ten new Member States are now outside.
Today, I should like to call your attention to the flags of the regions and nations that were not fortunate enough to become a state.
The course of history has decided that at present, some big countries are being accompanied ...
Â Â  Mrs Maes, please take the flags down, you have made your point.
The Rules are very clear on this, so please respect them.
Â Â  Mr President, we will take down the flags, pending their recognition by the European Union.
It is a fact that six Member States are smaller than the regions whose flags are on display today.
What we mean by this is that we welcome the new Member States, but at the same time, we want to call on the Council and Commission to recognise that the reality of languages and cultures, the diversity of peoples in Europe, cannot simply be reduced to states.
We know, and realise all too well, that we are one big family, but in our new Constitution, we must share sovereignty at supranational level, so that with Europe, we can play a role in the world that is worthy of these 450 million citizens.
At the same time, we must urge our Member States to recognise that within some Member States there are differences that are not sufficiently recognised.
In principle, this is already the case in the new Constitution.
The principles are laid down, but the rest is down to our Member States.
We would like our Member States to realise that they have to recognise the diversity of peoples within themselves, so that these constitutional regions are not required to become states â which over the course of history, they have missed the opportunity of doing.
Although we collectively want to share sovereignty at supranational level, we also want the principle of subsidiarity to be applied from the top down, and languages and cultures to be protected.
Catalan, for example, is a language that is spoken by 10 million inhabitants.
We are reluctant to accept that such a language can be recognised at European level only if Spain wishes it to be so.
Is it not sufficient that that is what ten million citizens aspire to?
Thank you for your attention and I hope that in the new Constitution, due consideration will be given to this deeper reality, which is older than our Member States.
â The gallery does not participate in the sitting.
Therefore, quiet please.
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday, when the flags of the new Member States of the European Union were raised here in Strasbourg, Poland was celebrating the anniversary of the adoption of the first written constitution in Europe, and the second in the world, namely the 1791 Polish constitution.
Its purpose was to make Poland a fair and efficient country.
The Constitutional Treaty of the European Union is supposed to be the crowning achievement of the great project of European integration, for which we in Poland waited almost 50 years.
However, the draft submitted by the European Convention does not bode well either for the future of the European Union as a whole, or for Poland and other Member States of the European Union.
Our Community needs a different constitution, a constitution that does not lead to excessive centralisation and regulation.
If we want to develop quickly, if we want to compete successfully in the globalising economy, the Union must not regulate every area of the economy.
All regulation has a negative impact on competitiveness and hinders development.
Also, the new constitution must not take precedence over the constitutions of the Member States of the European Union. This would amount to surrendering national sovereignty.
The Union, as it is to be defined by the Constitutional Treaty, must be based on the principle of solidarity, a principle underpinning our Community and upon which, over many years, a new post-war order was built in Western Europe.
The concept of solidarity has a special significance in my country, Poland.
It was in the name of solidarity that we Poles, fought for freedom.
Europe cannot cut itself off from its Christian roots.
If it does so, it will be in danger of dying a lingering death.
This would mean the death of our civilisation, which would have proved incapable of coping with a number of threats that have recently appeared in the world.
I have referred to a constitution enabling Europe to become a strong, competitive partner in international relationships based on fundamental principles.
The European Constitution should unite the peoples and nations of the European Union.
The European Union should remain a strong association of nation States bound together by solidarity.
The strength and legitimacy of the Union is derived from the mandate and will to cooperate of sovereign countries.
Â Â  Mr President, as a dedicated opponent of the whole EU process, I have to admit that on the face of it you are having a good week.
It has been a triumph for euronationalism and that is exactly what it is: a form of nationalism that never takes 'no' for an answer.
I find the language that is used fascinating.
I keep hearing people talking about the 're-unification' of Europe and I wonder to which particular model they are referring.
I wonder, do these ten new members really know what they have let themselves in for?
I can fully understand their reasons for joining NATO, where governments cooperate together, but the EU that they joined last weekend is about to become a different EU in just six weeks' time, because with the Constitution comes a new legal order.
I very much hope that the governments of those ten Member States give their citizens a chance to vote again in referenda, because they will be voting on something quite different from what they have been sold at the moment.
Certainly the Czechs and the Hungarians will well remember Brezhnev's doctrine of limited sovereignty.
What they are doing is now entering a similar system â they just call it pooled sovereignty.
Frankly, this Constitution must be unacceptable to any democrat, because the terms of Article 59, the terms of withdrawal, are totally unacceptable.
People are very soon going to learn that in this place nothing is what it seems.
Cooperation means coercion.
Competence means power, and the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is paving the way for an appalling form of centrist EU control.
I can only say that, in my view, the gap that exists between the political classes of Europe and the ordinary men and women of Europe has never been wider.
More is the pity.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like Polandâs voice to be heard in this parliamentary debate on the subject of the Treaty creating a constitution for Europe.
After all, on 3Â MayÂ 1791 Poland became the first country in Europe to adopt a democratic constitution.
Yesterday we celebrated the 213th anniversary of this great event.
The May Constitution expressed the democratic and sovereign aspirations of the people.
It is, however, firmly based on Christian values, which united the States and peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, and which became enshrined in the May Constitution.
Unfortunately, the wording of the current draft of the Constitution of the European Union does not refer at all to the Christian roots that are an essential value of the foundations of Europe.
Further it raises concerns about the preservation of the sovereignty of Member States.
Within the framework of the European Union, the road to integration and unity through such a constitution would be even longer and more difficult.
Integration and unity cannot be achieved through the creation of a new centralised state.
The countries of the former Communist bloc have only recently freed themselves from the fetters of a centralised State with a Communist ideology.
They would not like to find themselves in some sort of new centralised organisation all over again.
Within the framework of the current configuration of Europe, Member States and nations must have a guarantee for the preservation of their sovereignty.
They also need a sense of their cultural identity, community of faith and tradition.
Polish Solidarity would not have existed without a Polish Pope whose own faith and example shows how to build a new Europe through a civilisation based on love.
This new order would make it possible to overcome the difficulties, conflicts, and confusion of languages that led to dissent amongst the builders of the biblical Tower of Babel and their eventual dispersal.
The key principles of the civilisation based on love have been proclaimed by Christianity from time immemorial. They have been advocated in a particularly charismatic manner by Pope John Paul II.
It was thanks to these principles that it proved possible first to break the fetters of Communist totalitarianism, starting in Poland.
Thanks to them too, it was subsequently possible to establish a new democratic system in Europe.
They will also make it possible now to overcome fear, prejudice, and hatred. They will make it possible for people to understand each other and build an economic and political democracy in a Europe that will be safe from the dangers of world economic globalism.
Europe and the peoples that make it up have their own democratic tradition.
They will find the strength to reinforce and disseminate it, as well as to defend it, should the need arise.
May God help the European Parliament in the building of such unity.
In Old Polish, I wish it Godspeed.
I must apologise for making such a long speech, but this is my last appearance in this House, as I will not be a candidate in the European elections.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the inaugural address, today work begins for those of us who are new Members in the European Parliament.
We Hungarians have been living at the heart of Europe for thousands of years, and over the centuries we have often had to fight to protect Europeâs freedom and faith.
If our fight for freedom in 1956 had not been crushed by the Soviet tanks and the Hungarian servants of the dictatorship, then representatives of our country would have been sitting there in Rome, amongst the founders of todayâs Union. Then we Hungarians too would have taken part in the construction work based on security, freedom and wellbeing that we want to strengthen and renew now with the Constitutional Agreement.
Todayâs great enterprise of the reunited Europe, the Constitution, can only be successful and long-lasting if it is based on firm foundations.
What are these foundations?
Firstly: the equal rights of the States that form the Union.
We Hungarians have often enough been in a subordinate position, deprived of our rights, and that is why we are particularly sensitive to any violation of equality of rights.
What is needed today is not a two-speed Europe, but the rapid and complete removal of the remaining discriminations.
Secondly: lasting union can only be based on strong self-identity.
Reference to Christian roots would be the acknowledgement of the spiritual source of our freedom and pluralism today.
Without Christianity, Europe would only have a brain, but its heart would be missing.
The Christian humanist tradition will keep us together and it will not segregate us.
The culture of love born from Christianity is manifested in Beethovenâs Ode to Joy as well.
During the years of the twentieth century when Europe was torn apart, behind the Iron Curtain, faith and the church represented for us the institutional bond to the idea of Europe.
Thirdly: Europe must be a union of unions, a system whereby the unions strengthen and build on each other.
For us Hungarians, because of Trianon, the injustice of the Treaty of Trianon, it is increasingly important to have the rights of minorities represented in the principles of the Constitution.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must not forget; we have a responsibility to our forefathers and our children alike to fight against the bloody dictatorships of the twentieth century.
When we are preparing the reunited, revitalised European Constitution, please bear in mind the words of the Hungarian poet, Attila JÃ³zsef: âOur job is to finally sort out our mutual business, and it is not a small job.â
Â Â  Mr President, every country and every international organisation needs a constitution.
A constitution defines the structure of the organisation or country and the rights of its citizens.
When the European Union was smaller it was able to operate on the basis of successively amended treaties.
By contrast, a Union made up of 25 States, and in the future of 27 or more, must have a clear institutional system and a distinct division of powers.
It must function efficiently, and, above all, it must be closer to the citizen.
For this reason the decision taken at Laeken to convene a European Convention to draft a constitution was right and necessary.
I took part in the proceedings of the Convention and can vouch for the high quality of the work it accomplished.
I appreciate the excellent quality of the work undertaken by the European Parliament and successive presidencies, and must thank them for it.
The draft constitution proposed by the European Council has certainly proved an excellent basis for further discussion.
In certain places, however, it gives rise to doubts, emotions and debate.
In order to answer the question as to how good the constitution has to be, we must reflect on the kind of constitution Europe wants.
First: Europe and its people want a constitution ensuring security and freedom from the use of force and terrorism.
This is the type of Europe that is wanted.
It is therefore important to consider whether a paragraph regarding the sources of terrorism should be introduced into the constitution.
Should the anti-terrorism coordinator not be linked to the Commission and his powers clearly defined?
We want a just Europe that cares for the individual.
This is why we should develop the third part of the constitution further.
As it stands, it pays far too little attention to social policy.
We want a well-managed Europe. Consequently, there has to be a balance between the powers of the Member States and those of the Union.
An institutional balance is required.
This is why the powers of the European Parliament in the area of the Unionâs finances and budget must not be restricted.
After all, Parliament is the only democratically elected body in the Union.
We want a Europe that does not discriminate against anyone, a Europe capable of building an open society.
How then could it have been possible not to provide for a ban on discrimination on the grounds of disability, when drafting the anti-discrimination clause?
It should be recalled that there the European Union has 50 million citizens with disabilities.
Above all, however, we are aiming at a democratic and united Union, a Union in which all states and citizens are equal.
Consequently, the decision-making process in the Council of the European Union should be based on a spirit of compromise that takes into account the interests of all States, large and small.
An accommodation is called for.
All the Unionâs power must not be vested in just a small number of its Member States.
The willingness to accept this compromise will be a measure and determinant of European democracy.
The constitution is almost ready and will have to serve future generations.
Taking into account also that the people have endorsed it by means of a referendum or in parliament, it will be only right that, in the spirit of compromise, we adopt it quickly.
This will make for deeper integration.
Â Â  Mr President, I have one minute so I will not refer to the Green position on the Constitution, but will make the point that the final text of the Constitution must also address the question of Euratom.
I wish to tell the presidency that we cannot enter the 21st century with a Treaty that dates from the end of the 1950s.
That Treaty completely ignores the views of this House and also creates a large distortion in the internal energy market, which we created recently, because it provides billions of euros for research and cheap loans and ensures dependence on the nuclear industry.
If you are not persuaded by my arguments, think of the power of the voters and citizens in Austria, Germany and Spain, in all the countries which no longer consider nuclear energy as a centrepiece of the solutions for tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, a constitution is something like an organisation plan for a society, and we urgently need one.
I regret to say, though, that the text we have is not worthy of the name.
There is no separation of powers, no direct involvement by the citizens, and, as Mr Turmes quite rightly said, there are important elements that we have not dealt with.
We do, however, need a constitution, and we need it as a matter of urgency, as it has to be clear that the West must make itself ready for the East, which has now moved into this House.
The situation we are in â a very difficult one â is to some degree comparable to that of someone who has a very fine plan with which to build a house.
We have Europe the peace project, social and liberal, but not the foundations that will provide a truly stable basis on which it can work.
As a European who is responsible to the taxpayer, I cannot but be very worried about the future of this project.
We are now obliged to rebuild the European Union from the ground up, with a proper constitution, which must then, in order to enjoy the necessary acceptance, be submitted to the popular vote in every single country.
Transparency will also be needed, for there is no democracy without it.
The way in which this constitution has been brought into being, and the secretive way in which further negotiations on it are being conducted, does not augur well for the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we are on the subject of freedom of speech, let me say just one thing, which is that this has been an open process, one in which every detail of the Convention was public, for everyone to read, examine, discuss and add their own contributions.
The process involved everyone who was entitled to participate, ranging from the national parliaments to the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
That is something that Mr Martin should not denigrate, even if it does not fit into his present programme and that of the !
I would like, with your permission, to make a few comments.
The first is that we have completed the project of the century, the reunification of the whole of Europe.
Over the past few days, we have heard a lot of fine speeches about that.
I hope that these will prove to be more than lofty sentiments, and that we will instead put them into practice.
What that means is that we have to enable the enlarged Europe to function and confer legitimacy upon it, and that is why the Constitution is so important.
If you are in favour of reunification, then you have to be in favour of this Constitution, for it is democratic and is founded upon values to be found in the preamble and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights â values that I regard as being, to a large extent, of Christian origin.
The European Union has to be able to function.
A larger Union is of no use if its decision-making structures do not make it effective.
Having listened to all the lofty sentiments that have been expressed, we have to acknowledge that no longer can any of us, in the present world, defend our interests on our own â that, after all, is why Europe is united.
No longer can anyone defend interests that are exclusively national.
The fact is that it is better that we should put our national interests on the back burner when we have a common denominator, for it is this common denominator that will enable us to develop the strength to defend our national interests as well.
Now it is only through Europe that national interests can be defended, and if this is made apparent in practical action and in the way this constitution develops, then we really will make progress.
I would just like to express my gratitude to the Irish Presidency of the Council for its astute leadership, even though we will have to discuss those details in the final document where we in this House cannot agree to what is proposed.
I do hope, though, that we will nevertheless be able to achieve a good result.
Â Â  Mr President, the details of the European Constitution are extremely important.
For that reason it is important that the IGC does not take any step backwards.
Our citizens want more Europe.
They cannot understand why Europe is not more present in the United Nations.
They cannot understand why we impose on ourselves international impotence in the face of the conflicts that surround us in the world at large.
They want a Europe that is based on human values, based firmly on universal rights.
If I might just address those who are calling for Christianity in the Constitution, could I suggest that if God existed she might ask the men who run the churches and the synagogues and the mosques to respect all human rights, and in particular respect the rights of the women they exclude from their ceremonies and from their theologies!
Could I suggest that it is important that we do not reduce the Constitution to its detail, that we do not damn it with faint praise by suggesting that it is just a tidying up exercise, because the spirit of the Constitution is greater than the sum of its parts.
We must appeal to the better instincts of our peoples, to bear in mind that what we are trying to create is a Europe based on human values.
We are trying to demonstrate that it is possible at a global level to achieve the dream of democratic global governance.
Many people have quoted Irish poets over the past few days in the big speeches that have been made, Seamus Heaney in particular, and his line that hope chimes with history.
Could I remind the IGC of another Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, who warned the founders of the Irish state to tread softly as they tread on our dreams.
The Constitution is a dream that we need to have put into practice.
I urge the IGC not to step back from it.
Â Â  The Polish socialist, MrsÂ Grabowska, who spoke earlier, said something very interesting, to the effect that every State needed a constitution.
The trouble is, however, that the European Union is not, strictly speaking, a State.
The European Union does not, therefore, need a constitution because, contrary to what Mrs Grabowska says, an international organisation does not need a constitution.
This is precisely why the League of Nations referred to its founding treaty as âthe pactâ, why the United Nations calls its treaty âthe Charterâ and why every international organisation has a founding treaty.
Whilst the Constitution that you are proposing is being presented, in essence, as a codification of the Treaties, the very fact that it is referred to as the Constitution is ample proof of the direction in which you want to go: you want to move towards establishing a super-State, which will dominate the political, economic, diplomatic and cultural life of all Europeans, down to the last detail, regardless of the decisions taken by freely elected governments.
What you are creating is a new Soviet Union, and that is exactly what we do not want.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a great honour and privilege for me to be one of the first Polish Members to address the House after the Unionâs enlargement.
This is an historic occasion, and I am particularly pleased to be speaking on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the largest group in the European Parliament, and a group that has made a major contribution to the enlargement of Europe.
The enlarged European Union is generating great hopes, not only among the old Member States, but also among the new countries joining the European Union.
This is particularly true in the case of my own country, Poland.
The Polish people have painful experience of the dark era of communism and nationalism.
They know how much hard work had to be done in order to join the European Union.
We had to make up for the several decades during which we had fallen behind because we were on the other side.
Today we are discussing the future of Europe.
We hope to endorse and adopt the European Constitution.
This is needed in order for us to be able to manage Europe efficiently and for us to take decisions efficiently.
For this step to have real significance, it must be adopted through compromise, with the consent of all the nations making up the European Union.
It is also essential to remember our roots, the basis on which European civilisation was built.
A Europe that forgets its roots cannot have a future.
Some of the views expressed in the course of this debate have caused concern.
There seems to be an attempt to create a two-speed Europe and to forge deeper alliances within the framework of the European Union.
We cannot go along with this.
There has been an attempt to establish false standards of what being European means.
These are not good omens. They reinforce the political strength of the Euro-sceptics which is most certainly not our intention.
The European venture is not yet complete.
New states are waiting at our doors. Soon Bulgaria and Romania will join.
It is also important to keep in mind Ukraine and our neighbours in the Balkans.
Much remains to be done.
I hope wise decisions will be taken to strengthen Europe as a whole and each nation individually.
I am sure we all aspire to a Europe of peace, in which the differences between societies and economies are minimal.
We long for a Europe in which richer countries will help poorer countries.
We hope that Europe will stand up to threats such as terrorism.
We would like Europe to be a strong and efficiently managed international organisation.
Finally, we want Europe to continue to honour Christian values, human dignity, tradition, and morality.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member from a newly acceding country, I urge you to accept the Constitutional Agreement before the European elections. Primarily because this constitutional agreement would establish a model that is equally attractive to the existing and the new Member States alike.
In fact, by recognising this, a number of countries wanted to hold the European election jointly with the national elections in respect of the constitutional agreement.
The values and objectives stated in the Constitution will extend and strengthen the foundations of the European social model.
Equal rights, as a core value, had been placed, for the first time, in this document, alongside freedom, democracy and the principles of a constitutional state.
The aim to achieve a high level of employment is replaced by the plan to achieve full employment.
The establishment of peace and security is coupled with the fight against poverty and the protection of human rights.
On that basis, a vision is outlined of a new Europe with greater welfare and solidarity.
The inclusion of the charter of fundamental rights will further enrich the European catalogue of human rights.
We Hungarians are delighted that as a result of our efforts the rights of minorities will be included in the Constitution.
On the basis of the Constitutional Agreement, the European Union will operate on a more democratic basis and its activities will be more transparent.
The importance of the European Parliament and the role of national parliaments will further increase.
Ongoing dialogue with civil organisations, churches and religious institutions will be opened.
The Constitution will provide an opportunity for direct civil initiatives too.
The legal foundations and forms of cooperation for the struggle against international organised crime and terrorism will be expanded and strengthened.
Ladies and gentlemen, people everywhere expect the European Union to make their life easier and better.
Discussions on institutional reforms often seem quite complex for the citizens.
These issues cannot make the democratic constitutionalisation process fail.
I greatly appreciate the effective work of the Irish Presidency, and I trust that with the support of European public opinion and as a result of the efforts of the European Parliament, we shall successfully complete the second phase of the constitutionalisation process.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this speech marks the end of my fifteen years of service in this House, which, I would like to point out, is the legitimate representative of the European citizens and of which I have had the honour of being President.
I would not be worthy of wearing the Jean Monnet medal or the Schuman medal if I restricted myself simply to taking pleasure in seeing the 25 flags and receiving our fellow Members from the new Member States, nor if I confined myself to expressing my satisfaction with the direction taken.
We must talk about the future of Europe, and that is what this debate is about.
I believe that the future of Europe, Mr President, will involve overcoming five challenges: completing enlargement, creating more efficient and democratic European institutions, effectively combating terrorism inside and outside Europe, providing the Union with the financial resources it needs to implement financial policies and, finally, to turn the Union into a factor for peace and development at global level.
I have talked about completing enlargement, because we have the immense pleasure of having the ten new States and their representatives in this Parliament, but this must not lead us to forget that we have to fulfil our commitments to Bulgaria and Rumania and that we have the moral duty to complete the work of establishing peace that we have carried out in the rest of the Balkans and incorporate those States into our European family.
Until we have done so we will not be able to say realistically that the iron curtain has been entirely removed and that we have successfully included everybody in the European family.
Overcoming the second challenge, of providing the Union with efficient institutions, means approving and ratifying the Constitution.
I expressed my thoughts about that Constitution in the report which this House approved and which I produced together with Professor Tsatsos.
Today I would just like to add one thing, particularly for those people who allow themselves to be led by internal bickering: it is very important that we can have simple and comprehensible decision making by majorities, but it is essential that this system of majorities, Mr President-in-Office of the Council â and I address this to you in particular â is sufficient to allow balanced decisions to be taken within the Union, without allowing for leaders or groups who wish to lead other groups of States.
And this is a difficult task which, unquestionably, the Irish Presidency must complete and on which ratification not achieved beforehand will largely depend.
I have also referred to financial sufficiency.
This is a principle that Jean Monnet stressed, without which we have a larger Europe but a much emptier one.
A Europe which will not be able to implement the Community policies that have existed until now.
That is something the Constitution does not resolve and I very much fear, Mr President, that it will lead to a crisis over the coming years within our Europe, a crisis which I trust will be overcome.
It will be overcome simply by adhering to a basic principle, the principle of solidarity.
Solidarity, not fruitless rivalries or ridiculous aspirations to hegemony: that is the message I wanted to leave you with on my departure.
I will end, Mr President, by thanking all those people who have been in this House during my three terms of office: Members of Parliament, officials and colleagues from the groups and other Members, representatives of the Council and the Commission, and all the authorities with which I have had the opportunity to work.
I have learnt a lot from everybody, I would urge you all to continue fighting for an increasingly democratic and fair Europe of solidarity, which is able to overcome the crises that arise.
Mr President, the future does not belong to those who allow themselves to disappear into the shadows of doubt and danger.
The future belongs to those who, despite the uncertainties of the present, can see the coming of tomorrowâs dawn.
Â Â  Mr President, I would firstly like to acknowledge the work carried out in this House by our fellow Member and fellow-countryman JosÃ© MarÃ­a Gil-Robles, and his contribution as President of this House during the previous stage, which has made it possible for us to open up the stage we are opening up today: the stage of enlargement and political deepening.
I would like to express my gratitude to him, particularly because he was the author, together with Mr Tsatsos, of the report by means of which this House supported the draft European Constitution produced by the Convention in which I had the honour of participating.
That draft European Constitution is intended to enable the Union genuinely to confront not just enlargement, but also the great future challenges that we currently face. To intervene in globalisation in order to enhance it democratically and socially, to contribute to creating a new international order which is fair, democratic and respectful of international law, and, naturally, one which responds to the demands of the citizens.
We need a stronger, more democratic and more efficient Union which guarantees the consolidation and development of the European social model.
A secular Europe which respects the values which have defined the co-existence of our citizens, respect for human rights and the multi-party system.
In other words, the rule of law which is today in place throughout this great Europe.
Mr President, despite what Mr Rumsfeld suggested, we do not have a new Europe and an old Europe, there is a greater Europe, one which is sitting here today in this Parliament, the Europe of the citizens, the Europe which has broken down its borders, the Europe which has reunified the continent.
We must ensure that the European Constitution becomes a reality, and in this regard we must demand once again that the Conventionâs draft be approved as soon as possible, during the Irish Presidency at least.
As a Spaniard, I am pleased to see that the arrival of a new government in my country is going to make it possible to break the deadlock in the Intergovernmental Conference and the approval of that Constitution, so that all the Community bodies function properly, also ...
Â Â  Mr President, I am very pleased to be here with you speaking Slovene and, with the voting card of a Member of the European Parliament, to be enjoying a time when history is smiling on us.
It smiled when the Berlin Wall fell, when human dignity was returned to the people of the new democracies, and when we were building an independent and democratic Slovenian State.
Remembering the victims of totalitarianism in Europe, I am grateful to all those who have contributed to the European democratic movement.
I am particularly grateful to you, ladies and gentlemen, for all your support and solidarity.
The success and stability of the European Union will depend on what we do and how we work together.
I would like us to work together in the spirit of the founders of Europe.
This session is not our first experience together.
We already have behind us experiences that will enable us to work together in the future, namely our work in the European Convention, which has led to a good draft of the Constitutional Treaty and has deepened our sense of mutual trust.
The enlargement of the European Union must also mean a deeper union.
An enlarged Europe means a larger political Europe, a more transparent and effective institutional order, a greater role for the European Parliament, greater decision-making with a qualified majority, a single Foreign Minister and greater influence on the part of all its citizens, both men and women.
An enlarged Europe also means increased cooperation, open under the same conditions to all members, and not just open to a club operating at different speeds without a constitutional foundation.
The European project is not only a matter for professional Europeans.
We will succeed if the citizens of the European Union experience it as their own.
The key terms of the Convention have been the values, democracy and equality of the Member States, and not any quantitative talk about large and small.
We new members do not want to be just additions, we want to be an additional value, the equal co-creators of a united Europe.
Let us bring together the experiences of the older Member States and the democratic dynamic of the new ones.
The plan of a truly united Europe will succeed if the European countries, or âEurolandâ, become the foundation of a country of values, or âValuelandâ and if, at the same time, the Union becomes a community.
The term âmore Europeâ must mean above all an enhanced Europe in Europe itself.
The European project must also be completed in a south-easterly direction.
The sources of conflict there must be replaced with a vision for the future, with reconciliation, the respect of all identities, cooperation and a well thought out economic plan.
Â Â  Mr President, like my fellow Member Mr Peterle before me, I would like to express my pleasure that I am able to speak as a representative of the Republic of Slovenia, as a new Member State, in my Slovenian mother tongue.
On the basis of my experiences of taking part in the Convention and my experiences during my one year stint as an observer in the European Parliament, I am absolutely convinced that it is crucially important that the European Constitution be adopted and implemented as soon as possible.
The fundamental legitimacy of this exceptional document, which is without equal anywhere in the world, lies in the fact that it was accepted by a consensus in the Convention after lengthy preparations and discussions with the broadest possible participation of the national and European parliaments, governments, the European Commission, the civil service, social partners and others.
Furthermore, I am firmly convinced that the early adoption and implementation of the European Constitution is a prerequisite for the effective, democratic and transparent functioning of the enlarged European Union.
It is a prerequisite for the achievement of values and goals and also for the rapid and socially just development of a united Europe.
The Constitution is vital if everyone's high expectations are to be fulfilled.
This is particularly true in the new Member States.
It is also important if the European Union is to play a greater role and if its social market model is to develop sustainably in the global world.
Finally, with its assurance of balance in the functioning of the institutions of the European Union and particularly the enhanced role of the European Parliament and national parliaments, the European Constitution is an important condition for actually bringing the European Union and its citizens closer together.
I therefore call upon the governments to demonstrate both courage and responsibility by adopting the final treaty as soon as possible at the Intergovernmental Conference, and, if possible, during the Irish Presidency, which has shown exceptional sensitivity and commitment.
Â Â  Mr President, the Europe which is being born at the moment brings to a definitive close the unhappy season of great dictatorships which bloodied our continent during the last century.
The new Europe is not an enlarged Europe though; instead it is a reunited Europe.
At last, countries and peoples who have had to endure a communist dictatorship are joining a broad area of peace and freedom.
I would like to welcome my fellow Members from Eastern European countries.
But we cannot conceive of a federation of nation-states which lacks a fundamental law governing the relationship between the institutions and the citizens: this is why it is important for us to sign as soon as possible a Constitution based on the principles of freedom, subsidiarity, centrality of people and which promotes a social market economy.
Nevertheless, Europe cannot renounce its Judaeo-Christian roots: they are the bridge which unites East and West, they are the true element which unites half a billion people; they guarantee the secular nature of the institutions, and at this point we should remember the evangelical precept: ârender unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's'.
We are calling for a reference to these roots to be included in the preamble to our Constitution, as it is on the flag: indeed, you know that the 12 stars represent the 12 tribes of Israel, crowning Maryâs head.
Why not follow the example of the text of the Polish Constitution â as often urged by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats during the Convention debate â where there is an explicit reference to the word âGodâ?
This is an example which our friends, who from now on will sit in Parliament, can give us, an example which we are sure that the whole of Europe should follow.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I wish to express my joy at having today been given the right for the first time to speak to this Parliament, the European Parliament, and to refer to an issue on which I have been engaged, the European Constitution.
I was a member of the drafting Convention and I know that this Constitution is the fruit of agreement between the representatives of states, parliaments and civil society.
It is not an editorial miracle, as many want and wanted what the Convention produced to be.
However, it is a text which promotes the cohesion and unity of Europe.
It promotes the principles and the values of Europe and it also promotes the vision of Jean Monnet and of the person we honoured today, Altiero Spinelli.
Those who oppose approval of the Constitution are, I think, doing the European question a disservice because, in seeking something better, they are undermining something good.
This Constitution, as I said, is the product of agreement; it is precisely what the European Union cultivates, a culture of cohesion and compromise.
Consequently, extremes and approaches based on ethnic criteria are mistaken.
I call for this Constitution to be adopted by the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004, so that 2004 can be christened the year of the European Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have a two-fold historic responsibility; firstly, to give the Union a Constitution, a text that will enable it to function.
I should like to highlight, if I may, the inherent paradox in reaching agreement on a text after the elections, even though it will have been the main subject of debate.
If governments had wanted to assert their authority, to put it mildly, they could not have done so any better.
As we await the summit of 17Â and 18Â June, all we have, as things stand today, is a virtual Constitution.
We hope it will not turn out to be a minimalist one, but we will judge it when the time comes.
Your second historic responsibility is more important: that of setting in train the ratification process.
If we do not want this Constitution to be stillborn, it must be adopted.
Accordingly, Mr President, I should like to inform you of a proposal that came out of discussions in the , which I have had the honour of chairing since May 2003.
Governments must reach an agreement, both on a joint text, and on when it is to be ratified, or, in other words, the day â or rather the period of days, as with the European elections taking place from 10 to 13Â June â when the Constitution is to be submitted for ratification in the twenty-five countries, following a joint transnational debate.
On this subject, I was very taken by the way Commissioner Vitorino put it: we must not simply juxtapose twenty-five national debates.
I suggest therefore that you set the date for 5Â to 8Â May 2005.
We will thus replace the 60th anniversary of the end of World War Two, which affected all of us, with the anniversary of something that we are adopting together.
On that day, which we could celebrate together as Constitution Day, and which could subsequently become a public holiday in the twenty-five countries of the EU, each country will ratify its constitutional treaty according to its own tradition and legal system, by means of a referendum or through parliamentary channels.
In France, I would, of course, advocate a referendum.
Answering the same question together on the same day, and adopting the same fundamental text, will truly make the European people sovereign in matters of common concern.
Â Â  Mr President, humbled and honoured at the privilege granted to me as the first MEP from Malta to address this Assembly so soon after enlargement, I believe that the European Constitution should emphasise a union of citizens just as much as a union of sovereign states â a Union based on the value of 'personalism' and not of individualism.
There is no viable alternative to a Union of nation states, intertwined with a clear recognition of an unmistakable historical fact: Europe's Christian roots, values and heritage.
Without such heritage we would not have had the works of Dante, Petrarch, Raphael, Michelangelo and others all inspired by a Christian leitmotif, or the labour of love and Christian faith involved in building the cathedrals and churches of our European cities, including Strasbourg.
'Yes' to European laicism, but 'no' to secularisation.
I shall continue in Maltese.
Mr President, I believe in a Europe where it is essential for its legitimacy and credibility to speak categorically with one voice in the international arena.
We must have a European Constitution where the rule of law is the same for all, a Europe of the power of the law and not of the law of power or one which favours the strongest.
A Constitution that confirms that every State is equal, even by acknowledging Maltaâs right to have six seats in this Parliament.
Malta must be represented effectively in the same manner as all other States.
Mr President, we created and moulded Europe.
Now it is important that everyone feels equally European.
This must be the crux of the European Constitution and Malta will be working to achieve all this.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The general debate on the subject of the future of enlarged Europe will continue at 3.00 p.m. this afternoon.
Â Â  . â It is appalling that a majority of Members of this House is determined to adopt the so-called European Constitution.
As we have stated on many occasions, this Constitution is an attempt to extend capitalist integration in the European Union still further, which clearly consolidates the federal nature of the Communityâs institutions and the dominant position of the major powers in the decision-making process, including unacceptable primacy over national constitutions.
The Constitution will also launch the institutional bases of militarisation, by establishing a European Armaments Agency, which is intended ultimately to create a political-military bloc, in conjunction with NATO.
It is a project to which we are opposed and which we criticise in the strongest terms, also because of the way in which it restricts the ways forward for Europe, by imposing neo-liberalism as the sole solution and by establishing the primacy of competition as the guiding principle.
We are thus forced to fight to defend derogations relating to public services, whilst they ought to be an absolute priority, a key instrument towards ensuring that human rights are respected and that we establish a Europe based on economic and social cohesion and solidarity.
We will continue to fight for an alternative Europe that respects the inalienable rights of the people of each Member State to shape their own future, one that respects national constitutions and one that is in keeping with the principle that States are sovereign and have equal rights.
We will campaign for a referendum in Portugal before the draft Constitution is ratified.
Â Â  On behalf of Parliament, I should like to extend a warm welcome to Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, who has taken her seat in the official gallery here this afternoon.
I know that Her Royal Highness has an extensive programme of meetings here in Parliament this week; indeed, I have already met with her.
I hope her visit proves to be an interesting and informative experience.(1)
In response to the questions raised yesterday, I am advised by our legal service in very clear terms that all 788 Members of the House are entitled to vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, the request for urgent procedure cannot be accepted by Parliament as the Council has not forwarded to Parliament a text to which the international agreement makes reference, namely the Commission's draft decision on adequacy, declaring that passengers' data are adequately protected by the US; nor has it received the so-called undertakings by the US administration.
In other words, we still have no guarantee that European passenger data transferred to the US will not be passed on to third countries.
This is the first vote of the new enlarged Parliament, the only democratically elected institution that represents 450 million citizens.
The Council is asking us to vote with closed eyes on a question that relates to our fundamental rights.
If we accept this request, Parliament cannot be taken seriously.
In addition, there is a procedural defect in that translation into the new languages is not available.
I ask you to withdraw this item and also to respect our referral of the matter to the Court of Justice.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the opposite view.
As you will be aware, the current practice is for airline passengersâ details to be forwarded in order to prevent and combat terrorism, but it all happens without a legal basis, and so it is illegal.
It is for that reason that we must aim to bring this illegal and unregulated situation to as speedy an end as possible and to combat terrorism effectively.
You will be aware that it was not least at the insistence of this House that the Commission entered into negotiations, and these have produced a creditable result.
Much of what we called for has been incorporated in this draft agreement.
There is room for further work on it, but it does, as a basis for an agreement, enable us in future to transmit, on a legal basis, data needed in the fight against terrorism from the European Union to the USA.
That is what we should be aiming to do; we can then carry on working on an agreement.
We will continue to monitor its progress and can always appeal to the ECJ in the event of any agreement being breached, but our aim must be to establish, now and as quickly as possible, a contractual status, a legal basis, that will enable us to take proper action in the interests of our citizensâ safety and in combating terrorism.
That is why I am in favour of this being put on the agenda as a matter of topical and urgent importance.
Â Â  From the Chair, it seems that I am now being presented with a mountain of advice which I do not require!
This is the vote, not a debate.
There are some misunderstandings here.
Last part-session we voted to refer this matter to the European Court of Justice. That has been done.
No vote today can alter the fact that the matter has been referred to the Court.
I shall take no more speakers on this.
You heard a speaker for and a speaker against.
We shall now vote on whether we accept the request for urgency.
Permit me to point out that Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, as rapporteur, correctly observed that not all language versions were available, particularly as regards the languages of several of the new Member States.
As a parliament, We anticipated that we may from time to time find ourselves with such a problem.
Mr Dell'Alba's report on the Rules of Procedure established a Rule 117a which allows for a transitional arrangement in this regard.
I should like to underline a point for the future: if you start to set a precedent of playing the language game in order to block votes, you are going to be faced with the worst imaginable gridlock and headache.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, perhaps you â and those who say that European politics are obscure â would like to take note of the fact that the first vote in the enlarged Europe pitted the Left against the Right, and that the Left won it.
Â Â  That has been duly noted, Mr Duhamel!
Â Â  â Mr President, I rise to speak in response to what my old schoolfriend MrÂ Duhamel has just said.
As is so often the case, what he said is nonsense; although he spoke in terms of a Left versus Right vote, I voted the same way as he did.
I still believe that I am on the Right and that he is on the Left!
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Â Â  . It is disgraceful that the parliamentary Left continues to delay the conclusion of the EU/USA Agreement on the handling and transfer of data contained in Passenger Name Records (PNR), based on what was negotiated by the Commission and suitably explained and clarified several times, both in committee and in plenary, particularly in the previous sitting.
Missing the point entirely, those on the left continue to create conflict between security and freedom, suggesting that they prefer freedom to security.
They ignore the fact that there is no freedom without security.
They show contempt for the rule of law in force, both in the European Union and in the USA.
Most tellingly, they forget that, faced with the terrible threat of modern-day terrorism on a world scale, it is essential that we safeguard both the security and the freedom of our citizens and cooperate closely with countries that are our friends and allies.
In the forthcoming European elections, the citizens will, hopefully, rally to the defence of their freedom and security, and mete out electoral punishment to a left wing that has no idea what it is doing.
Â Â  Mr President, maladministration is not confined to Brussels: all political structures are imperfect.
Man is fallen and some people will sometimes give in to temptation.
What is peculiar to Brussels is the way in which allegations of malpractice are dealt with.
The usual response of the EU authorities, faced with evidence of corruption, is not to address the issues raised but to impugn the motives of the critic.
Thus we have seen the disgraceful way in which Paul van Buitenen and Martha Andreasen were treated and the extraordinary arrest of Hans-Martin Tillack.
In the looking glass world of Brussels, it is not those engaging in fraud who are harassed and bullied, but those exposing it.
This inability to handle even the most narrow and qualified criticism can be seen in the reaction to the censure motion on which we have just voted.
Rather than accepting a mild rebuke, the EU establishment went into overdrive, cajoling and threatening the various signatories in an attempt to prevent the motion from seeing the light of day.
Any lingering doubts about whether the motion was justified have surely been removed by the attempts to smother it.
I hope that people beyond this House will extrapolate from what has just happened.
If this is how the EU administers itself, are we wise to invite it to assume control over huge new swathes of our national affairs?
If this is how Brussels exercises the powers it currently has, what are we thinking of that we should be proposing to give it new ones?
My masters, are we mad?
Â Â  Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion of censure because I believe that this Commission has failed to deliver the reforms it was asked to get on with five years ago.
We have had fine words, a lot of wind and bluster from the Commissioner in charge of reforms, Mr Kinnock, but it seems that although the Commissioner can talk the talk he has failed to walk the walk.
I was elected on a manifesto commitment to fight fraud and maladminstration and it is very difficult to explain to my voters, the good people of Louth and Horncastle or of Derbyshire, why for ten years the accounts have not been signed off by the European Court of Auditors.
These problems are significant and typified by Eurostat and have failed to be addressed.
This motion of censure is not just about Eurostat but about the management culture that this exhibits, which goes unchecked.
Mr Solbes might well have gone, but the lack of political responsibility within the Commission remains.
This Commission deserves to be censured and future Commissioners need to know that they will be made politically responsible for the actions of those they direct.
Â Â  Mr President, I felt obliged to vote for the motion of censure because of the Commission's incompetence and lack of financial control as manifested in the whole Eurostat affair.
It is indeed bizarre that the only person detained in connection with this sorry episode is the journalist who exposed it.
I also took the opportunity to register my disapproval of the way the Commission has deliberately ignored the will of this House with regard to aid for hospitals in Belarus, which are woefully ill-equipped to treat the cancers â particularly in children â which have occurred as a direct result of the Chernobyl disaster.
Two years running we voted to allocate resources from underspent budget lines to buy this much-needed equipment.
So far not one penny has arrived.
My constituents in Scarborough and Whitby and I are appalled that money languishes in accounts in Brussels when children are dying of diseases that could be treated.
Â Â  Mr President, as I hope everyone in this House knows, EUR 5 million went missing at Eurostat.
I believe this is an unacceptable waste of taxpayers' money.
Taxpayers whom I represent across the United Kingdom's capital â in Barnet, Enfield, Croydon â are concerned that the tax they are paying, which is channelled to the European Commission, is not being properly accounted for.
This is a situation that has gone on for far too long.
Just a little over five years ago it was said of the Santer Commission that it was difficult to find anyone with the slightest sense of responsibility.
It saddens me that the situation has not changed and it saddens me that so many people in this House voted for business as usual.
For these reasons I voted to support this motion of censure because it is unacceptable that the Commission should continue to evade responsibility for its actions and vital that it should continue properly to police the funds which the taxpayer entrusts to it.
Â Â  Mr President, in 1999 Commissioner Kinnock was given the task of cleaning up the Commission's accounting and eliminating fraud.
He has failed spectacularly.
His main achievement has been to persecute the successive whistleblowers who have revealed the appalling debts of the Commission's failure.
So far the only person arrested in the Eurostat scandal has been the journalist who broke the story.
We get nothing but excuses and cover-ups.
How am I supposed to justify to my constituents in Leicestershire or Northamptonshire the fact that the admitted level of waste and fraud in the EU institutions at EUR 5 billion is as much as the UK's annual net budget contribution.
I was elected on a Conservative Party manifesto to oppose fraud and maladministration.
