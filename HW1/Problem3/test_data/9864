Firstly I should like to consider the medicines for health crises in developing countries, for AIDS and malaria for example.
Countries without a pharmaceuticals industry of their own are dependent on the import of cheap medicines.
Last weekend's agreement has been characterised as unworkable by health organisations because of the complicated import procedure.
The European Union is therefore going to have to continue working for a simplification of this procedure in CancÃºn to ensure that in practice these countries do not remain reliant on expensive medicines.
Secondly we need to make trade in general fairer.
Not by supporting fair trade financially, but through fair rules. In other words, standards not just for working conditions, but also for animal welfare and the environment.
Working conditions, including child labour, merit more specific detail in the Commission document.
These standards will only lead to fair trade if we help the developing countries to produce and to trade in accordance with them.
For imports into the European market, in particular, to some extent similar standards must be employed to prevent an improper difference in competitive conditions.
This will also encourage other countries to increase the quality of their products and production methods.
After all protectionism is not the purpose of standardisation, as many developing countries fear.
Finally, the low prices of raw materials and agricultural products constitute an impediment to development in many countries.
Overcapacity is leading to extreme difficulties in a number of sectors, such as the coffee sector.
The rapporteur rightly says that Europe must make an effort to bring about a trend towards higher prices for these products.
Restricting production is a useful tool in this regard and must be recognised as such by Europe in CancÃºn.
Free trade is after all not the solution for these problems.
Both the Commission document and the report recognise this and consequently deserve our full support.
Mr President, I stand here tonight conscious that in CancÃºn the Commissioner and others will have to battle to protect very poor people.
I would like you, Mr President, to count to ten.
When you end that count, 80 people in the world will have died of starvation.
Every second, eight people die of malnutrition.
What is it that these people can do to make all of us better off?
The only thing they know they can do is to grow more food.
But the one thing we prevent them from doing is to grow food that they can export to us.
Because we want to protect our cows and our farmers and our industry, we give more money to a cow each day than 600 million people have to live on.
We give two dollars a day to a cow.
The poorest people in this world have to live on one dollar.
In CancÃºn we can make a difference.
When I came to this Parliament from the British House of Commons, I came with great expectations.
I came with the expectations that the European Union meant what it said.
I came with the expectation that the Doha Round was a development round.
I came with the expectation that the Commissioner sitting there would have a spine to go and fight, that Mr Lamy, who had introduced 'Everything But Arms', would go and fight.
Well, I want to see them fight.
Because if they do not fight, what are their lives about?
What are our lives about?
What is all this about when we know that now, for the first time in our history, we can make a direct link between poverty and the propagation of terrorism?
We must understand that link and we must start doing something about it.
I come from a very privileged background in Sri Lanka, and I know people here come from very privileged backgrounds around the world.
We must understand that link and have the spine and the courage to fight to allow people - who can do things such as grow and market their food and create rural agriculture in the developing world - to export produce.
We should stop protecting our cows and our farmers in Europe inefficiently, and stop destroying our own customer base.
Unless we are able to do that, we are going to have to pick up a huge bill.
Mr President, this debate on Mrs Morgantini's report is about the link that we need to make between trade liberalisation, economic growth and poverty.
It is about whether trade and development run in one direction.
Often there are no unequivocal conclusions about whether or not that is the case.
However, I would argue, as I am sure many speakers in the debate would argue, that trade liberalisation is not a panacea for generating the kind of self-sustaining growth and poverty reduction that we want to see as a result of our policies - we are talking about coherence here - let alone the objective that we have of promoting human development.
If developing countries are to benefit from trade then the first thing that has to happen, as the report makes very clear, is that developing country producers have to get a fair price for what they produce for their exports, and that those prices reflect the value of their exports.
Since the 1970s deteriorating trade terms have cost developing countries a great deal.
Many ACP countries have lost more than seven times the amount they get in development aid.
For them, as the Commissioner knows, the central problem is the shortage of competitively-priced exports.
But in cases where export capacity exists, in countries like South Africa, Mauritius, Ghana, Botswana and certain Caribbean countries, then one does see export growth as a result.
But they also insist - and this is the case not just with CancÃºn, which most people will talk about, but in the EPA negotiations - that duty-free access to EU markets is simply not a sufficient spur to increase exports.
They are aware, as we are, of the importance of addressing supply-side constraints, the need for adjustments and the need to meet the associated costs for developing countries.
We need to understand - and I want to make a strong case for this - that capacity constraints are an essential part of how we deal with the ability of developing countries to tackle the trade issues that they face at this time, in bilateral, regional, and multilateral negotiations.
They have a huge number of negotiations to deal with.
Again, Commissioner Nielson is as aware of this, as am I, insofar as ACP countries are concerned.
In all of these negotiations there is a substantial and obvious imbalance between the parties negotiating in terms of economic size, political power and the sheer capacity to deal with the issue.
I saw that insofar as the South African negotiations were concerned.
Agricultural subsidies have an enormous, crushing effect on developing country producers and markets.
I hope that at CancÃºn, although Commissioner Lamy denies that it is a central issue, we will realise that for developing countries it certainly is.
We are a long way from achieving the millennium development goals.
Two years after the declaration of a Doha development round, next week in CancÃºn we have an opportunity to make globalisation work for the many rather than the few.
I am sure you will agree with me, Commissioner, that we cannot afford to fail.
Mr President, it is high time that forces were joined to help the developing countries to greater prosperity.
The best way of doing this is generalised free trade, which offers the best guarantees for sustainable economic growth in all parts of the world.
It is certainly the case that the liberalisation of trade is the key to development, but it also needs an important nuance.
I argue for the free market, not the unbridled or unlimited free market.
The free market does not actually exist any more.
Today we talk of a socially corrected market with attention to social standards, the environment, consumer protection, respect for intellectual rights, etc.
These constraints must be a permanent factor in the inclusion of less developed countries in the world trade system.
In the next WTO round, we from Europe must certainly see the developing countries as our partners rather than as our opponents.
I do not share the view of the rapporteur, Mrs Morgantini when she says that there is no evidence of liberalisation stimulating the growth of prosperity.
Globalisation offers benefits to all countries that engage in the world economy.
Similar countries that have pursued a different trade strategy demonstrate marked differences in the area of per capita income.
I am thinking for example of South Korea compared with North Korea, of East Germany compared with West Germany before unification.
I am thinking of the Asian tigers compared with the Southern Asian countries.
Or even more blatantly, about 20 years ago China and Africa were at the same level of development.
Since China has resolutely pursued the path of an open economy and has engaged in the world trade system, the results have been spectacular.
On average, the Chinese today earn three times as much as the Africans.
The difference is enormous not just where income levels, but also knowledge levels are concerned.
The rich may well have grown richer as a result of globalisation, but any question of the poor growing poorer is manifestly untrue.
UN figures prove it.
The proportion of the world's population living in extreme poverty has fallen in 10 years from 29% to 23%.
At the end of the nineties, there were 826 million people undernourished, or 40 million fewer than in the early nineties, despite the population explosion.
The infant mortality rate fell worldwide from 64 per 1 000 in 1980 to 56 per 1 000 in the nineties.
Around 80% of people in the developing countries have access to good water supplies, and illiteracy has fallen to 20%.
That is not perfect, but things are moving in the right direction.
There is still much to be done, but there is also hope.
Proper globalisation is the way ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, we certainly support those aspects of the report that censure the system, and for that reason we will be voting for the report, despite the impotence that it expresses.
What sort of a society is it in which nearly a third of humankind does not even have access to that most basic commodity, drinking water?
Millions of people in poor countries die every year if not of thirst then at least from the many diseases spread by contaminated water.
Is it because there are insurmountable technical obstacles to providing all the inhabitants of our planet with drinking water?
No.
Everyone knows that it is quite simply about money.
Everyone also knows that twenty-first century society has accumulated more than enough material and financial resources to provide this.
But water itself and its distribution have become a colossal source of profits for the multinational conglomerates.
These conglomerates - Vivendi, the former SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale des Eaux, Suez, Bouygues - are free to raise water prices while international institutions vote through resolutions and prepare the ground for them by systematically dismantling public water services in poor countries.
Their profit is dirty money, contaminated by the blood of the millions of people who die of dysentery, cholera, typhus, malaria and bilharzia.
In 10 years, the number of human beings without drinking water has risen from 1.2 billion to 1.7 billion.
This is a crime against humanity and speaks volumes about the deadly harm inflicted by the current organisation of the economy, which plunges a part of humanity into barbarism.
Mr President, the next round of World Trade talks begins in Mexico next week.
I have been nominated to act as a negotiator at these talks for the European Parliament.
I certainly hope that the countries participating in these negotiations - including the European Union and the United States of America - come to an agreement on one very sensitive issue.
There are 42 million people in the world who are sufferers of the AIDS virus - many of whom are based in Africa - yet the technology and the treatment is available to combat diseases such as AIDS.
If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms, then the costs of these medicines would be substantially reduced.
There is now a growing political will to introduce changes to the international intellectual property rights system so that drugs to combat AIDS can be given to those countries which do not have the money to pay for them.
We all know what our responsibilities are when it comes to the issue of combating AIDS and we must act accordingly.
A successful outcome to these negotiations would mean saving the lives of millions of people in the world.
This round of trade talks must truly be a development round.
Saving people's lives must always come before any doctrine on intellectual property rights.
Mr President, Mr Lannoye's report contains very accurate and incisive criticisms of the negative effects of privatising water supply services.
I wish to take this opportunity of supplementing Mr Lannoye's criticisms with further arguments, to the effect that privatisation also weakens the protection of precious water resources.
In Denmark, the supply of water is based upon a principle of solidarity when it comes to prices and the accessibility of resources.
In Denmark, the supply of water services is decentralised, primarily public and to a lesser extent private, but it is always user/owner controlled.
That is a very important factor for ensuring the continued protection of sources of water.
The public dimension of the Danish water supply services is very active in demanding as high levels of protection as possible and in demanding an end to possible sources of pollution.
The private dimension is, however, very satisfied with the diluted requirements that the EU is now coming up with and that mean a weakening of the limit values for pesticides in our drinking water.
Experience in Great Britain and elsewhere also shows that, when the water supply is turned into a commodity and privatised, there is no more protection of resources.
At the time when the EU was negotiating in connection with the Drinking Water Directive, London's private water suppliers were thus lobbied on the same basis as the European chemical industry with a view to our simply allowing large quantities of pesticides into the drinking water.
It was easier to earn money that way.
As I see it, the only sure way to protect sources is not to use pesticides.
I am therefore very pleased that, in its conclusion, Mr Lannoye's report has, as its priority, the need to introduce production methods, in both the north and the south, that promote environmentally friendly agriculture, based to a significant degree upon local resources, green technologies and regional cooperatives.
I am delighted to vote in favour of Mr Lannoye's report.
Mr President, in the last 10 years there have been several international conferences on the theme of access to clean drinking water.
We know that in many areas there has been failure, not least in the commitment to ensure that everyone would have access to clean water by the year 2000.
In 10 years the number of those suffering from a shortage of clean water has instead increased by half a billion, the number at present being approximately 1.7 billion.
One in four people in the world drinks dirty water.
The situation is compelling decision-makers to take a serious look at whether the measures taken have been at all the right ones.
Universal, equitable and non-discriminatory access to clean water is a basic human right.
A shortage of water is a self-evident cause of the spiral of poverty.
Experience has shown that it is impossible to leave the problem of water shortages to the market to resolve.
The invisible hand of the market is hardly likely to hand a glass of water to someone who is thirsty.
We also have to recognise the fact that privatisation normally means higher prices for water and purification services, which naturally cause the greatest problems for the poorest people.
Because access to water has been established as a basic right it should affect the way we think about it.
Water resources should not be seen as one country's private property, but as a shared global resource.
It must be said, however, that if water is treated as a free commodity to be shared, it weakens the potential for organising a highly functional water supply.
For that reason, the flexible practices called for in the amendments in order to mix the public with the private are needed, as long as a person's right to water is considered to be something basic that can never be given up.
Mr Lannoye's report intelligently highlights the connection between access to water and purification and hygiene.
Around 6 000 people, mainly children, die each day of infectious diseases, often caused by poor hygiene.
It would be a fundamental error to view water, sanitation and hygiene as separate issues.
Now, more than anything, we should increase those domestic and international resources that can be used to improve the water supply and sanitation in city slums and shanty villages as well as in rural areas.
Of key importance is linking sanitation with the water supply, which will not succeed if there is no substantial additional investment on the part of those responsible for the water supply.
We must, moreover, develop people-oriented technology for households as a solution to water and water purification problems.
I wish to express my support for Amendment No 19, which requests the application of a water-debt trade-off, so that debts can be cancelled and the money used to fund basic water purification infrastructures.
Mr President, I would like to highlight two aspects of the Lannoye report on water.
Given that we will be represented at the WTO conference in CancÃºn next week, I would first like to mention the connection with the General Agreement on Trade in Services.
I think that the European Union should make its attitude clearer.
If we consider - and that seems very much what you were advocating, Commissioner - that water is a public good, then we should ensure that the public authorities keep control of water distribution in each and every country.
Of course, public-private partnerships can be used for funding.
But you yourself quoted the comparison - a rather daring one, it has to be said - with what other countries regard as vital. Take anti-missile defence in the United States, for example.
No one could imagine suggesting to the United States that they should subject their anti-missile defence to the authority of a WTO dispute resolution body, with rules such as national treatment, most-favoured nation rules, or the obligation to award a contract to any other WTO country if it responds to an open invitation to tender in this crucial area.
When it comes to water, if we take your comparison further, developing countries, such as Burkina Faso for example, even if they have access to investors, to multinational companies, should very much retain control over the way in which those investors are involved.
I therefore believe that in the context of GATS - and I hope that the Commissioner responsible for development will have a decisive influence on those discussions, and that those discussions will not just relate to trade policy - we should not put pressure on these countries to liberalise their public services, in particular those relating to water, as a quid pro quo for giving them access to our markets, such as the agriculture market.
When it comes to financing, we certainly need a European fund, but I support Mr Lannoye's comments.
As in the case of the European Structural Funds, we know that creating a market is not the same thing as creating a community.
Sometimes we have to support measures designed to make up for delays in development, which means that public finance is essential.
A European fund is vital.
We should even establish a world water fund, in the same way that UNAIDS exists at world level to treat persons suffering from AIDS.
Private finance alone will not be enough to achieve this, and we cannot be content just to indulge in engineering.
This will also mean increasing public funding.
As regards Mrs Morgantini's report on the link between trade and development, I would say that even if everyone agrees that trade can contribute to development, it is still not enough just to open up borders - as some speakers including Mr De Clercq have suggested - as if that automatically gave the key to development.
Economic diversification is crucial.
We should draw more inspiration from what we have done ourselves.
Over a period, in a pragmatic and gradual way and by means of sectoral aid, we have to accept that the countries of the South can protect their own economies.
Encouraging them to create markets on the huge scale required is essentially the objective of regional integration.
But we should not adopt a systematic, dogmatic, one-size-fits-all approach to liberalisation, because that would exacerbate the deterioration in the terms of trade mentioned by Mrs Kinnock.
These countries will of course export in greater volumes and Mr Deva is right to say that we should increase their agricultural products' access to the EU market, and we should reduce our subsidies to limit the effects of market distortion.
They will, however, always be exporting products with ever lower value on the world market.
These countries should be in a position to export more diversified, sophisticated and industrialised products.
We therefore need to revise our trade policy towards developing countries, by giving priority to the aspirations and objectives of trade policy and to those of the Commissioner responsible for development.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on its rapid response to the challenges set in Johannesburg on the issue of water and the lack of water, and also Mr Lannoye, whom I shall now address.
Nevertheless, I believe that the report issued by the Commission on water does not go far enough and perhaps avoids some of the most important structural issues and fundamental problems which we are going to have and which we already have in relation to water.
Firstly, I believe that the debate goes much further than privatisation or liberalisation.
Europe is accustomed to providing general solutions, to laying down directives on everything relating to the European Union.
I believe, furthermore, that we must fully accept that sustainable development must be approached in a made-to-measure fashion, that the problems are not the same in one place as they are in another and, therefore, we must, from the outset, establish flexible and open policies which allow for thousands of different solutions, hundreds of thousands of small projects, appropriate for the place in question.
We must, moreover, introduce this philosophy into the investment criteria and the aid criteria amongst other things, because without local efforts and this adaptation of programmes to local projects we will not get anywhere.
I therefore advocate this notion of flexibility, adaptability and numerous small projects, despite the fact that there are broad problems.
Nevertheless, on the subject of the framework concept, there is another issue which I would like to comment on.
If water is a universal resource, as necessary and indispensable as the air or the earth, it is also limited and, take note, ladies and gentlemen, it is a transportable resource, unlike the earth.
It therefore requires protection and regulation not only by states, but also at international level.
It is a resource which must be shared.
Just as the great rivers are shared and enjoyed by peoples of different languages, religions and nationalities, it is a cross-border resource and therefore requires international agreements and conventions for the sake of justice and sustainability.
As a universal resource, Europe must propose an international agreement, a convention which will allow rivers to be organised in accordance with river basins, as stated in the Directive on water, preventing a particular country from having the right to intervene in a manner which, as in the case of the Tigris and the Euphrates, leaves other nations in precarious situations.
Europe must take decisions as well, and talk about the fact that water, being a universal resource, cannot belong only to those who live at the heads of river basins or the peoples who wish to use them along the length of their course; we must discuss the possibility of creating diversions without harming anybody, in order to resolve the problems of desertification and water stress; in order to resolve the problem of the development of peoples living at the mouths of rivers or along their course.
I believe there are legal issues of great importance which Europe should promote and we should also introduce the concept of flexibility, sustainability and made-to-measure actions.
Mr President, I am sure you have seen it, that Oxfam cow, to which we are currently giving shelter in our Parliament.
For us Europeans, this cow is of course a symbol of affluence.
But let us be realistic, for people in the developing countries this cow stands for unfair world trade.
There is a good reason for Oxfam campaigning under the slogan 'Make trade fair, stop the dumping'.
I cannot repeat it often enough, and Mr Deva has also used the example: for a fifth of the poorest people in the world, the amount that this European cow receives in subsidy per day is more than they have to live on each day.
In point of fact, the aim of our social democratic input at the WTO negotiations in CancÃºn next week is to come closer to genuinely fair world trade.
Mrs Morgantini's report on aid and trade therefore comes at the right time.
It also clearly chooses the side of the developing countries.
Unambiguously, the rapporteur stresses that, two years ago, clear agreements were made in Doha, but that there are difficulties in following them and observing them.
First and foremost, it is the rich north - we may well look a little longer at the United States - that has been in default.
In June, also in Europe as a party to the treaty, we just in time reached an agreement on the reform of European agriculture.
This weekend we were finally able to reach an agreement, a huge breakthrough, on cheap medicines, following very strong resistance from the United States.
It was at the last minute, but it was undoubtedly a huge breakthrough.
Apart from agriculture and medicines, the core of the Doha negotiations, the trade in services will also be on the agenda in CancÃºn.
In his report Mr Lannoye takes a closer look at one of these services, that is the supply of water.
His argument is that water is public property.
I would say water production in particular, that is what my group actually supports.
Water production must therefore stay in government hands, but for many developing countries private capital is needed for water distribution.
The Commissioner has explained this.
That does not mean that it must not happen under the control of the government, which is responsible for access and pricing.
But 1.7 billion people have no access to clean drinking water and as many as three billion have no access to sanitary facilities.
There is a compelling need for a good policy in this regard.
Social democrats are in favour of public services remaining in government hands, a public responsibility of government control.
But that does not mean that the private sector does not have an important part to play in parts of water distribution.
This is the essence of the debate and here we agree with what the Commissioners said.
In my group, as my colleague has already said, there are different thoughts about this.
A second product that warrants special attention in the light of trade and development, and which is often overlooked in the discussion of agriculture, is cotton.
Four West African countries have called on the WTO to recognise the strategic importance of cotton for development, combating poverty, and food security in Western and Central Africa.
Ten million people are directly dependent on the production and export of cotton.
Their development is being hindered by trade barriers in the cotton sector, as a result of which prices are being kept artificially low.
Our plea is that, in Doha, we should take measures concerning products such as sugar and cotton.
We are also sure that the Commission can take action in this direction.
Then we will have fair trade.
More trade therefore means more success for the poor countries.
Mr President, knock on any mud hut in any poor country and ask the poor family inside what it needs most of all.
There is only one answer: water.
Not democracy.
Not human rights.
Not medicines.
Nothing else, just water.
If the European Union has allocated EUR one billion for water aid - and I believe Commissioner Nielson has been instrumental in this - I must congratulate the EU and the Commissioner.
What a fantastic job.
This is what these people need.
Sadly, it is not enough.
We need to do more and I ask the Commissioner to please make sure that this Parliament has a say in formulating water aid policy so that it is not lost in the clouds like the EDF.
Parliament needs to be involved.
I want this to happen.
I hope you will assure us of this because I do not want my colleague here to persuade the PPE-DE Group to vote against the Lannoye report tomorrow.
I understand what you are doing and I have confidence in it.
I would like to say a quick word about trade.
The poor countries need to process their products, not simply to export the raw products so that the value added is not received by them.
That is the key to trade.
I know Commissioner Nielson understands this and I know he is working for it.
I hope he will do more.
.
The contribution by Mr Khanbhai corresponds to Mrs Sanders-ten Holte's remarks about the wish of Parliament to be involved in anything relating to the Water Initiative and the Water Fund.
This is not difficult to understand.
The money we are talking about is part of the EDF.
We are working to set the budget for the EDF.
The Commission and Parliament are in full agreement on this, also for very principled reasons.
We want a special facility or fund in order to have a more flexible instrument, more ability to work across the board.
There is no reason for the worry expressed in the report by Mr Lannoye about the 0.3% management of the fund.
This is not an attempt to create one solution.
It is more like a facility.
It does not matter if we use the word 'fund'.
The main idea is to be able to accelerate actions as necessary and to be a catalyst for the various partnerships that it is possible to create and promote.
We are not talking about a conventional method of funding projects, but something that could accelerate things.
We hope that this debate and the welcome support from Parliament will make it possible for Member States to accept what we have proposed.
To be direct, this is about eliminating the risk of losing EUR 1 billion of the EUR 13.5 billion reserved in the 9th European Development Fund which is up for evaluation next year.
That money was made conditional some years ago, under the Cotonou Agreement and the 9th EDF, on the performance in the first part of the period.
This is a totally political judgement.
This is why we came up with the idea of reserving this money for the Water Initiative, in order to make sure that we all agree on this high-priority dossier and reserve the money for it so as to more or less lift this EUR 1 billion out of the general discussion.
That is what we are trying to do.
I hope that support from Parliament on this will muster enthusiasm among Member States.
Regarding the trade aspect of the discussion, I agree with Mr Belder about the very difficult situation in terms of coffee.
It is ironic that we urged developing countries to diversify and pointed out that coffee was a good cash crop.
The result is that now, Vietnam and many other developing countries are quite successfully moving into coffee production, consequently dumping it on the market, and damaging the market to such an extent that we have a crisis that is very difficult to deal with.
There is no easy answer to that.
The reality of the market is here to stay.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0217/2003) by Mr John Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission Communication on health and poverty reduction in developing countries (COM(2002) 129 - C5-0334/2002 - 2002/2178(COS)).
.
Mr President, today the world's gaze is very much on world trade.
However, for millions that is a million miles from their broken, infected and disabled lives, because you can only trade if you can make, grow, sell and distribute.
Those tasks are essential to your economic wellbeing and to your country's economic growth.
They are tasks which are way beyond you if you are physically or mentally ill or disabled.
If they are beyond you, you are in a downward spiral to poverty and, more often than not, to death.
Health and wealth, ill-health and poverty are inextricably entwined.
Poverty leads to ill-health and ill-health means poverty for nations, families and individuals.
Without health you cannot create wealth and without wealth you cannot prevent and cure disease.
We, the countries of the European Union, have accepted the challenge to help the least- and the less-developed countries to overcome poverty and to become partners with us in world trade and development.
We have acknowledged the fundamental link between good health and the reduction in poverty and we now need to enhance this priority in our development policies.
The Commission has sent us a good communication, which I welcome.
It focuses on the three massive challenges of TB, AIDS and malaria and nothing in my report contradicts that focus.
Indeed, I call for more and better investment in these areas.
However, there are other enormous health challenges we must also address.
Let me start with the final point in our report.
We, the developed world, are short of doctors.
Each and every year we make up our domestic failure by recruiting 63 000 doctors from the developing countries.
In return, we send them just 1 300.
This is unacceptable.
Then let me re-emphasise the need for a shift in resources to basic health, if our rhetoric is to be translated into effective action.
Just 3.4% of our current development budgets go to health.
That is simply inadequate.
Only 9 of the first 61 country strategy papers had health as a focal area for cooperation.
That will not achieve results.
We need resources, but they must be efficiently targeted.
Drugs, for example, are wasted if not accompanied by adequate storage, distribution, monitoring and patient education.
Nigeria is an example where dramatic improvement was possible in fatal childhood diseases once the programme developed a home-to-home strategy and changed the public perception about immunisation.
Then there are the diseases and disorders beyond the three priorities of TB, AIDS and malaria.
By 2020, 80% of the global burden of disease will be non-communicable diseases: cardiovascular, cancer, respiratory, diabetes, depression, epilepsy, etc. Diarrhoea diseases kill 1.5 million children a year.
We heard in the last debate about water.
Apart from malaria, water-borne diseases that debilitate and destroy include typhoid, dysentery, cholera, hepatitis, trachoma, fluorosis and Japanese encephalitis.
Yet 1.1 billion people have no access to clean water and 2.4 billion are without hygienic sanitation.
Yet the cost need not be prohibitive, and our report points to examples of inexpensive interventions and changes of local practice which can make a significant difference.
I am grateful to colleagues from all parts of the House who suggested additions or amendments - most of which we were able to incorporate in committee - and a few which I have accepted and put my name on at this plenary stage.
I would also like to thank the governments, academics, practitioners and NGOs - not least from the developing countries themselves - for their contributions.
They confirmed many of the proposals I had drafted and suggested new areas for me to explore, such as vaccines, maternal health, biomass fuels and palliative care.
I hope Parliament will endorse our report and that the Council and the Commission will see it as supportive as well as exhortative.
None of us can be satisfied with our efforts to date to defeat poverty by promoting good health.
We are all in development mode and our commitment must be to drive our policy forward and faster.
It is in all our interests to make real and lasting progress.
.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Bowis for his good work.
While we give support to health directly in many countries, the Commission is increasingly investing in budget support strategies where the linkages to improved health outcomes are ensured.
In this context the follow-up through key input and outcome indicators is crucial and this is a high-priority area of work.
This relates to a long discussion with Parliament and the Committee on Development and Cooperation about the percentages allocated to different sectors.
The Commission is prioritising support for improved health and education outcomes.
To reflect this, it is not enough simply to calculate funds for health and education where they appear as focal sectors.
All support to related social sectors, such as investment in water and sanitation, and budget support linked to improved health and education outcomes, has to be taken into account.
Doing this brings us to something that adds up to more than 40% of the programming for the 9th EDF.
It is a matter of the credibility of the link between budget support and outcomes in these sectors, but this is the best way we can do this.
We are relying on other donors or partner governments to do more of the substantial work.
We are providing a lot of money, but this is also what complementarity is about, what donor coordination is about and what ownership is about.
I am in no way apologetic about these percentages and I will never get tired of arguing like I do here whenever, like tonight, I hear figures - which I feel are wrong - regarding how much we do in these sectors.
The Interreg contribution through budget support is real and it has the advantage that it also makes it possible for us to fund, and for support to be received for, the ongoing recurring costs.
It does not do much to help to build a nurses' training centre if the teaching there cannot be sustained.
That is one of the advantages of budget support.
This is in no way an excuse, but it is a real, hard-core explanation.
The specific challenges as regards HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis have been meaningful, leading to our contribution to the global fund.
Our engagements at country level mean that we now know better what to do than we did some years ago.
Attempts at solving the HIV/AIDS problem are made more difficult as it involves having to cope with the ideological battle of reproductive health and sexual rights.
I do not want to start a discussion tonight on these issues, but it is an added problem on top of all the other existing problems.
As regards financing I am pleased that it was possible to get the United States to accept what everyone else agreed to in December last year in the WTO on TRIPs and the use of generic medicines.
The point I want to make here is that it is very nice to see that our decision last year to untangle the procurement of medicine for these diseases adds to the reality and impact of what was agreed in the WTO last weekend.
If we still tied procurement to European producers, the WTO agreement that Third World countries should be able to buy generic medicine would not have carried much real importance.
So it is the combination of this deal in the WTO and our untying of procurement there that really is dynamic.
I do not want to prolong the discussion ahead.
I will end by repeating my appreciation of the input provided by Mr Bowis.
Mr President, it is the people with least resources who suffer the worst health.
Illness and poverty are two sides of the same coin and therefore any strategy for combating poverty must take account of this interrelationship.
Lack of health drastically reduces the opportunities for the peoples and groups suffering from it to develop.
In developing countries, 28 000 children under five years old die every day as a result of illnesses which can be prevented with existing medicines.
Diarrhoeal diseases alone kill more than a million and a half children per year and one in every 13 African women may die during pregnancy or childbirth, which also means that they can no longer care for the rest of their families, immediately increasing their risk of death.
AIDS, as well as killing more than 2 million people in Africa, is hindering the possibilities for development in a society by removing thousands of active young people and mothers who, in turn, leave behind orphans.
Women are the poorest and suffer most from illness in the developing countries.
Furthermore, they are much more vulnerable to risks of illness, which is always linked to poverty, precisely as a result of their reproductive role.
That is why we have wished to highlight the importance of information, but also of access to reproductive health services, which would help to prevent the spread of AIDS, illnesses caused by continual pregnancies, births and clandestine abortions.
Incorporating the views of women into the fight against poverty and illness is essential to the least-favoured societies since they are responsible for the care of children and because they are an indispensable factor in the well-being of individuals, families, local collectives and nations.
We believe that, thanks to this report, whose rapporteur, Mr Bowis, has been so much in favour of incorporating the gender perspective into it, the Commission's Communication has been improved. Perhaps the same can be said for the still weak position occupied by women in the development policy of the European Union, which I believe must continue to strive to fulfil its commitments.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Bowis for this really excellent report.
This House welcomes the Commission communication and urges the Commission and the Member States to make their contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water, especially given that around three million people die every year from water-borne diseases.
If we look at the Commission's ambitious goals, they deserve Parliament's full and unequivocal support.
The EU has undertaken to reach the development aid target of 0.39% of GDP on average for all EU Member States by 2006.
At the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in March 2002, it was agreed that each of the current EU Member States would by 2006 increase the proportion of GDP spent on development to at least 0.33%.
Yet taking the Federal Republic of Germany as an example, we can see that unfortunately, this is likely to remain a utopian ideal.
Germany vigorously rejected, to the very last, any increase in spending, claiming that this was incompatible with budget discipline.
This shows that ultimately, the Federal Government's economic policy failures are the cause of inadequate development assistance.
Only yesterday, I saw that the German Minister of Development states on her website that 0.27% of GDP is currently allocated to development assistance.
This must seem like pure mockery to the people affected, who followed what happened at the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen as long ago as 1995 and trusted the pledge that 0.7% of GDP would be spent on official development assistance.
The only conclusion we can draw is that it is hard luck for anyone who relies on development pledges!
It is a sign of political bankruptcy - indeed, it is a political debtor's oath - that at the same time, real expenditure has decreased by more than 500 million euros from 1990 to 2001.
Yet we live in an era when Volkswagen, for example, has to appoint three apprentices to every training place in the developing countries because two out of three die during training, either from Aids or from other - water-borne - diseases.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in Monterrey, and I quote with your permission, Mr President, 'If the industrialized countries do not double development assistance, the forces of envy, despair and terror will continue to grow'.
Let me add to this: these forces will impact on Europe too.
That, not least, must be avoided!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur has presented a very comprehensive report demonstrating, in an impressive and multi-faceted way, that there can be no sustainable development without good health.
Poverty reduction must therefore be linked as a matter of urgency with measures to combat diseases, and great efforts are needed to build an effective healthcare system in the developing countries.
In this context, we must focus first and foremost on the most vulnerable population groups, such as children, who die, as previous speakers have said, in their hundreds of thousands every year from diarrhoeal diseases. They die of infectious diseases because they are denied the vaccinations which could save them, and they fall victim to malaria - hundreds of thousands of children every year - because their immune systems are not robust enough to survive this disease.
These examples show that health problems in the developing countries, especially among children, certainly do not always result from life-threatening diseases. Often, they fall victim to illnesses capable of being cured or prevented if the necessary drugs or vaccinations are available.
Women, too, are especially at risk.
Giving birth to many children at short intervals destroys women's reproductive health, causing severe anaemia and increasing their susceptibility to infectious diseases.
Poor food or malnutrition also undermines the health of large sections of the population - for hunger is not just hunger, it also saps the strength necessary to build a good life.
It has quite rightly been pointed out, and I say this again, that sustainable development is under threat.
It is true that a holistic strategy is required.
It is not just primarily a matter of medical care.
The scenario we are dealing with today - and this is where the campaign against tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS comes into play - is that we are dealing with diseases - AIDS in particular - which are not curable but which can be treated, thus giving people the opportunity to live for longer.
Nonetheless, the fact that there is no cure for it means that we must also address the issue of prevention.
This is an extremely important area, and must also be included in a holistic healthcare system.
I am convinced that we can generate more support for these campaigns in many ways if we highlight the severe economic impacts sustained by countries where a large number of people are affected by these diseases.
According to the statistics which I have available, in Burkina Faso, agricultural production has decreased by 16% because people are sick or have already died of AIDS and therefore can no longer work in agriculture.
In Swaziland, school attendance among girls has decreased by 36% because they have to care for their parents who are sick with AIDS.
Ultimately, only the grandparents will be left.
This means that massive economic damage will result in these countries unless there is an effective healthcare system to help restore public health to the necessary level.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication and Mr Bowis's report are based on the vicious, infernal and fatal circle which robs developing countries of any real right to health for the majority of their population, which only aggravates their underdevelopment still further. The same applied, incidentally, to my own report on the financing of clinical interventions to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which was adopted several months ago.
I therefore give my unreserved support to the rapporteur and to the proposals he and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have put forward.
We need to increase the level of financial contributions, particularly those earmarked for water.
As several other Members have said, three million people die in the world every year for lack of drinking water.
Major vaccination campaigns are needed.
Preventive health measures need to be built up.
Medicines need to be made accessible and methods of treatment need to be adapted for developing countries, not to mention palliative care, the provision of analgesics and the fight against trafficking in counterfeit medicines.
In March 2003, in the wake of the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development, I persuaded the European Parliament to adopt a EUR 600 million research programme to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis under Article 169, which also made a concrete contribution towards achieving the same objectives.
I am seizing the opportunity I have been given this evening to inform fellow Members about the implementation of this programme since its final adoption on 16 June.
Commissioner Busquin has returned from Africa, where he was able to confirm interest on the part of researchers in the countries concerned following the establishment of appropriate management structures.
Measurable progress has already been accomplished over several years, very often with the encouragement of this House, acting in close partnership with the European Commission.
We also, and above all, need to be aware of the dramatic situation in the developing countries, which is an indication of everything that remains to be done and of the enormous effort that is required in terms of imagination, partnership and budget resources.
By way of conclusion, I would like to reiterate my support for the committee's proposals, my total support for our rapporteur, my personal commitment in these areas, not to mention the commitment of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and I invite the Commission, and above all the Council, to step up Europe's commitment if we are to avoid a situation in which far from improving, the developing countries' position deteriorates in future.
Mr President, up to now we have placed particular emphasis on the fight against communicable diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
We have repeatedly asked for the scope of this action to be extended to other diseases particularly associated with poverty and with poor hygiene and environmental conditions.
I therefore very warmly welcome John Bowis's report, which approaches health in the broadest possible way and takes account of the impact on health of food, environmental and educational policy.
Preventing diseases involves improving the living conditions of people in the South, by means of a coherent and integrated development strategy.
In the long term a preventive strategy is essential.
In the shorter term, we need to ensure that the sick have access to treatment and medicines, which also have to be made available in the first place.
It is true that in the majority of countries in the South health systems are poor, but privatising the sector will not solve the problem.
Only the public sector can provide free and universal health care.
For that reason, health should continue to be excluded from GATS, and I am delighted that this report reiterates that fundamental principle.
I of course support the amendment calling for the provisions of the Doha Declaration on medicines to be implemented, especially as the agreement that the TRIPS Council has just reached is supposed to allow it to come into force.
Although we welcome this entry into force, it also has to be recognised that the complexity of this agreement means that we have some doubts about its effectiveness.
For example, countries without any production capacity will be subject to a double system of mandatory licences and restrictions that they could often find costly.
If health really is one of the priorities of the European Union's development policy, then the Member States should make a firm commitment to grant the mandatory licences developing countries need if they are to protect their public health.
We Members of the European Parliament need to join together to exert continuing pressure if this communication is not to be just a dead letter.
Mr President, I would first like to say thank you to my colleague, Mr John Bowis, for his work.
He has taken all aspects of human health into consideration impartially.
It is opportune that we should be speaking about the health situation in the developing countries and access to clean water in the same sitting.
You cannot just daydream about good health if people are denied their basic right to clean water.
Clean water, functional sanitation and good hygiene are the foundations on which healthcare is built.
Every year three million people die of infectious diseases transmitted through polluted water.
Health and poverty reduction is a subject where almost everything has already been said.
There is no lack of information from us.
I do not intend now, therefore, to churn out more tragic figures and statistics before Parliament.
I would prefer to tell you briefly why I decided some time ago to stand for the European Parliament.
When I was asked to stand I had serious doubts about the reasons, which I shall not go into here.
However, while I was thinking over what my decision should be I was on a working trip to El Salvador and Mexico.
I was working for a development cooperation organisation examining the tracks of the hurricane that had raged in the autumn of 1998 and familiarising myself with the situation regarding AIDS patients and conditions in the slums.
I met a mother of small children who had been infected with HIV by her partner and now it had been detected in her newborn child too.
I encountered a lot more examples of wretched human destiny: small people crushed by enormous problems.
Then I began to think: what if the politicians who decide these people's affairs and fate for them have never met them in the flesh?
What, furthermore, if they do not understand the issues they are taking decisions about?
Supposing they do not even see the people through the statistics?
They are, after all, real people, not zombies.
They have a pain threshold.
I made the decision to go into politics for these people's sakes.
Many a time I ask myself if my efforts are visible anywhere or sufficiently visible, and I cannot bring myself to answer the question.
I think that if it does not result in any practical decision being made, or a gesture made for better things to come, or a hunger for justice, which has concrete results, I do not have the right to call myself a politician.
Mr President, in 2001 this Parliament asked the European Commission to make primary education and basic health care spearheads of development policy.
Now 35% of the development budget goes on social expenditure, including education and health care.
For Africa one of the biggest threats is the AIDS epidemic.
Along with tuberculosis and malaria this is a disease requiring extra attention in the Commission's policy.
In the present announcements this attention is very clearly in evidence in the action programme.
Attention is focused on these three diseases.
The arguments for the approach to these three diseases remain valid and have even become clearer still than previously where AIDS is concerned.
Public opinion however is not yet fully mobilised around a clear realisation of the worldwide crisis that these three diseases represent.
There is still an urgent need for large-scale collective action.
In his report Mr Bowis rightly says that, in addition to these three diseases, the approach to other poverty-related diseases also warrants attention.
African trypanosomiasis, better known by the name sleeping sickness, is a good example of this.
There are two stages to this infectious disease.
In the first stage the victim suffers fever and debilitation.
The disease is difficult to recognise at this point, but relatively easy to treat.
If the disease is not treated, then the parasite moves from the blood to the brain.
It can take anything from a few weeks to years before the disease progresses from phase 1 to phase 2.
In stage 2 the victim suffers fits and convulsions.
Sleeping sickness is easy to recognise in the second phase, but treatment then is far more difficult.
If the disease is not treated, the patient goes into a coma and inevitably dies.
There is a general lack of such treatment in the developing countries.
An unnecessarily large number of people die because the diagnosis cannot be made in time and medicines are not available or are far too expensive.
The agreement on the cheap AIDS medicines that was concluded last Saturday as part of the WTO negotiations is a big step forward in combating this poverty-related disease.
To give priority to basic health care ahead of regulations in the field of intellectual property was a crucial decision.
Failure would have destroyed confidence in the ability of the WTO to have a development round to tackle the injustices in the world trade system.
All the WTO members now have an obligation to ensure that the agreements work in practice.
European countries must promise, just as Canada has already done, that producers of generic medicines obtain licences from the country in question for export to developing countries.
It is also important in the WTO negotiations that, where the trade in services or GATTS is concerned, the right of every WTO member to regulate public services should be guaranteed and that developing countries must not be compelled to hand government control of basic services such as health care over to the market.
I would like to say expressly that, in this, I feel supported by the attitude of the Commission and Commissioner Lamy.
In this our positions do not differ.
If you were to ask a random passer-by in Strasbourg how his health was, then that will always count as number one.
If we later go to South Africa, I should like to see a similar random passer-by whom we meet there able to say the same, and for us to be able to live safely in the same world village, on the same street.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0249/2003) by Mr Richard Howitt, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on participation of non-state actors in EC development policy (COM(2002) 598 - 2002/2283(INI)).
.
Mr President, non-state actors, non-governmental organisations, private companies, trade unions and civil society have a major role to play in the European Union's development programmes.
They are crucial to us for four reasons.
First, good development practice means that aid is successful when the beneficiaries themselves participate in the programmes that deliver that aid - helping people to help themselves.
Second, non-state actors provide pluralism, alternative views and alternative experiences to those of governments, views which are at best representative of grass-roots communities of marginalised people, who in turn are representative of those in greatest need.
Third, a strong civil society is part of a healthy democracy, providing scrutiny of governments and promoting principles of anti-corruption and good governance.
Democracy and development go hand in hand.
Fourth, from a European perspective, the best of independent actors - renowned non-governmental organisations like Oxfam or the Save the Children Fund from the UK, MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃšres from France and so on - have helped to deliver public support to the whole notion of development, as well as providing a record for ensuring the swiftest, most direct and efficient provision of aid which, in itself, commands that public support.
However, as the proposed resolution lays down, that relationship is not always a comfortable one.
For example, non-governmental organisations are themselves not immune from criticism.
I supported Commissioner Nielson when he made proper criticisms regarding the management and efficiency of the former liaison committee of EU development NGOs in Brussels.
It is true that non-state actors can suffer from the same problems of bad governance for which we sometimes criticise governments of developing countries.
Yet the Commission's communication and this Parliament's conviction is based on the principle that we can do better.
I am grateful for the active cooperation of the Commissioner's services, but the results of my questionnaire - showing that non-state actor consultation took place in only half of 63 beneficiary countries and that the totals by region record only 2 or 3% of the total funding provided going to non-state actors - represents a challenge for the time ahead.
It is a challenge which can and must be met in the forthcoming mid-term review.
I welcome the fact that the Commission supports my proposal in the resolution for one staff member per delegation in developing countries to be responsible for NSA consultation and participation.
We have taken such steps in relation to financial management and it is right that we give equal weight to quality as well as quantity of aid.
I hope the Commissioner tonight will not simply support the principle of training in this respect, but will also commit himself to beginning to deliver it in practice.
I propose in the resolution that this process be supported through the creation of multi-stakeholder committees by country or region, a proposal which is meant not to increase bureaucracy but to ensure systematic means of participation by NSAs.
I know that the Commissioner has a healthy scepticism of my interest in budget quotas, but the 15% identified in his own programming guidelines should provide a firm baseline in the budget for non-state actor participation - 85% for governance seems not an unduly small amount.
I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has now invited MEPs, including myself, to contribute to the reform of the specific NGO co-finance budget line.
I advance the proposal that the delegation should manage its own small-scale, capacity-building funds - a model which is effective for some Member State interventions, including those in the United Kingdom.
In conclusion, I accept that non-state actor involvement is not simply - nor principally - an issue of funding.
It is now five years since the Commission established a small, informal working party under the then Director-General of DG Development to recommend a new relationship with non-governmental organisations.
The evolution of those discussions has, in part, taken in Commissioner Kinnock's reform programme and the White Paper on Governance from Mr Prodi.
Now it includes the proposal from the European Convention for a legal base on civil dialogue.
In development specifically it has included the legally-binding, contractual participation laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, a principle that we believe should be extended to the EU's relationship with all regions of developing countries in the world.
However, it is now time to move from discussion about NGOs, civil society and non-state actors in order to effect real change and improvement.
Commissioner Nielson's communication gives us the opportunity to do just that.
We must, we should and we will.
.
There are many different aspects to the discussion on the role of non-state actors.
One is that we deliberately played up expectations, especially in the ACP countries following the Cotonou Agreement, making an interesting breakthrough in giving them a role in the debate over country strategies and also starting a new activity of being able to fund the different non-state actors in these countries more directly.
But these activities of NGOs and so on in our partner countries are not something we run or organise.
It depends on the political situation, the level of democratisation, the character of the society.
In some countries these things are very new.
That is why the feedback of how successful this inclusiveness has been is somewhat mixed.
We are pushing for it, but I cannot accept that the Commission can or should be made responsible for how successfully this can be done in another country.
It is not our country.
There is a limit to our powers.
I am quite optimistic.
We have compared our attempts to the somewhat similar ones to broaden participation in the discussions in the poverty reduction strategy paper process, handled by the World Bank with the same countries in most cases.
When we compare the achievement of involving civil society, we have had much more success.
This should not be seen as a civil society beauty contest between the Commission and the World Bank.
It is of more interest that both urge the partner countries to do the same thing.
The partner countries could then see that different partners in development work would actually like civil society in these countries to be more involved.
Civil society relations with NGOs in a European context are a somewhat different story.
Mr Howitt wrote something in the explanatory statement that I disagree with.
It is simply wrong.
He says that the organisations themselves complain that any consultation they enjoy is entirely ad hoc and that the Commission can be accused of only consulting when it wants to legitimise its own perspective.
I have checked whether the new umbrella organisation of development NGOs agrees with this description of the relationship.
It does not.
So what Mr Howitt has presented here is not what I have heard from the same NGOs.
Of course both the NGOs and Mr Howitt could be wrong.
I do not claim that one of them must be right.
In my view, today we are in a constructive phase of the discussions.
My preference is to put the emphasis on an exchange of substance rather than formalising things between us.
This is well understood.
The hard-core of cooperation - the funding and administrative working relationship - is better than it has been for many years.
It is possible to keep it that way.
What is most interesting in terms of the funding aspect is that the NGO budget of EUR 200 million per year is only a small part of the total activity that we are funding through NGOs.
The total amount of money per year going through NGOs is closer to EUR 1.5 billion - food aid, food security, part of the humanitarian aid for NGOs, and a great volume of project implementation work where we use different NGOs in the field.
This should be given more attention.
The EUR 200 million budget is so heavily in demand that we have an impossible situation if all of the discussion is concentrated there, especially in view of the ten new Member States that will join the EU.
We should take care to provide good opportunities for NGOs in those countries to get in on the action.
The EUR 200 million budget for NGOs should be looked at with a view to making sure that civil society in the new Member States does not feel marginalised because of stiff competition for that specific budget.
I look forward to continuing the discussion, not only with Parliament and Mr Howitt, but also with the NGO community.
Mr President, the role of NSAs - non-state actors - in helping development has been acknowledged and I agree with Commissioner Nielson in what he said.
If you look at the United Nations, there are 72 000 registered NGOs drawing EUR 7 billion every year.
Certainly, the NGOs have got their act together.
They know what to do, where to go and source the founds.
On the other hand, private companies - and they are non-state actors too - do not enjoy the same status, privilege or funding.
I am very much in favour of tilting the balance to established private corporations with a good track record in development and in developing countries, so that they may also receive aid that would be very well utilised.
We also have two categories that the EU has never considered.
I know they are slightly off-track and perhaps Parliament has discussed this.
One of them is service clubs, such as Rotary Clubs, which do a fantastic job at a very low cost. Others are missionaries, particularly in Africa.
Very selective use of mission work in developing countries can bring substantial benefit to the very poorest in these countries for very low sums of money.
I have personal experience of both Rotary Clubs and missionaries working in East Africa for very little money.
They provide substantial support for local communities.
But today I am going to focus on accountability.
It is known that a large percentage of money received by non-state actors, particularly NGOs, is spent on administration, including high salaries, first- or club-class fares, and bills for expensive hotels.
There are so many seminars which now, with information technology, are totally unnecessary.
Transparency International is supposed to monitor the role of such bodies, but it has not done the job it is supposed to have done.
I am pointing out these things for this Parliament and for Commissioner Nielson to put at the back of their minds because much has already been said and will be said.
But I want to highlight one thing and I hope Commissioner Nielson will take note of this.
Whenever the EU gives any aid to any poor country, please let us inform the population what we are doing: how much money we are giving for each sector and to which actors or players or stakeholders this money is being given.
Because the poor will be the best invigilators, the best inspectors, the best reporters to our EU delegations if they find that this EU money is being misused.
If money has been given to the government through budgets and not spent in an appropriate manner the people will know and will report.
If money is given to NGOs and it is not utilised people will know.
But if they do not know what the EU gives, for what sectors, there is no inspection, there is no vigilance and there is no feedback.
I want to say one last thing.
There is aid fatigue and it is important that whatever the EU gives, which is very generous, it is spent well.
I wish Commissioner Nielson much luck in what he is doing.
He has my full support.
Mr President, we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have been genuinely pleased with the Commission's initiative to define and strengthen the role of non-state actors, both European and from recipient countries, in the Community's development policy.
I would like to congratulate Mr Howitt, because his report was approved unanimously within the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Furthermore, he did significant work by means of a questionnaire aimed at ascertaining the situation with regard to the participation of NGOs.
It is a fact that NGOs have had a decisive influence on the current configuration of a more open international society and on the democratisation of a system of international relations which until very recently was restricted to states and intergovernmental organisations.
We believe that the active participation of NGOs in the implementation of the Community's development policy represents the principal added value of European cooperation, since it provides a degree of effectiveness which development policies do not have when they are implemented solely within an intergovernmental context.
Nevertheless, this is not a round trip, although there is no doubt about the need for development processes to be participatory if they are to be effective and sustainable.
Only in a minority of cases do non-governmental organisations and civil organisations in the countries receiving aid participate in the creation and implementation of the development actions benefiting them.
As Mr Howitt's report points out, we will ask the Commission for data on the participation of non-state actors in the production of strategy documents by region and country.
It should be pointed out that programmes and projects drawn up in this way are mainly financed by means of the EDF, to which, unfortunately, the non-state actors do not have direct access.
The other source of funding, the decentralised cooperation line B7-6002, involves very small amounts - 3% of the amount provided for NGOs.
The structuring of civil society, including companies, NGOs, local organisations and the like, is essential to development processes and cooperation relationships.
We therefore trust that the Commission - despite the fact that it has expressed some reservations in relation to the report - will stipulate our requirements as soon as possible in this regard and respond to the commitment made with the international community by means of the millennium declaration - to which end the United Nations adopted an agenda for action which involves 1 300 non-governmental organisations - to create a mechanism for permanent consultation with non-state actors and improve open and integrated dialogue, which the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, calls participatory development.
There must be permanent consultation with non-state actors in order to combat extreme poverty in the world.
Mr President, Mr Howitt's report opens up some interesting avenues.
Public involvement in cooperation with developing countries is at the heart of our concerns.
This communication should underpin real cooperation with non-state actors.
Who are these non-state actors though?
Who are these privileged partners?
Are they partners imposed on us?
We believe that participation should involve a wide range of actors, including partners from the South, and it should prevent the poorest countries from being marginalised.
This means that a proper mechanism needs to be established to optimise participants' representation.
This communication should not allow the Commission and the governments of developing countries to legitimise their actions by treating non-state actors as pawns.
The populations of the countries of the South themselves should be able to democratically appoint their representatives and organise themselves collectively through associations, trade unions and grassroots organisations.
It is this process that we need to support by providing the structural aid needed to guarantee that non-state actors have the independence that is vital for dialogue and for the involvement of all strata in society.
It is incumbent on European companies to stop banning trade union organisation and rights of association for workers and local people. On the contrary, they should encourage such activities.
At present civil society is only recognised in the text of the Cotonou Agreement.
It needs to come off the printed page and be put into practice!
When we revise the ALA Regulation, it is essential to include this aspect in our cooperation with the countries of Latin America and Asia, which would also make it possible to make funds available to non-state actors in those countries.
Involving non-state actors in their governments' development strategy is essential to guaranteeing pluralism, freedom of expression and democracy, which underpin the European Union's missions throughout the world.
We are therefore pleased to welcome this report by Mr Howitt.
It opens up important avenues that we must not fail to explore.
Mr President, although we welcome the Commission communication, I regret that it does not adequately reflect the fundamental principle - stated in Cotonou - of participation by non-state actors (NSAs).
Support from the Commission for non-state actors must be ensured, especially in countries where such support is not provided by government agencies.
In doing this, those NSA projects that already have a successful track record should, in the interests of continuity, remain under NSA management, thus averting any risk that EU funding will trickle away into government structures.
It has long been undisputed in the EU that civil society is an important pillar of its social development.
The contributions made by civil society during the European Convention's negotiations on an EU constitution are a recent example of this.
Yet the increasingly robust civil society in the ACP states had no chance of participating in the negotiations on the current Cotonou Agreement.
This, in my view, is where the Commission wasted an opportunity.
The German Development Minister condescended to hold a joint press conference with a number of NGOs at the time, but she failed to give adequate support to civil society's direct participation in the negotiations.
Of course, there are still some developing countries that deal with aid funds in a fairly arbitrary way.
That is the flip-side of the developing countries' greater individual responsibility for the formulation of development policy, which is what we are seeking to achieve.
Nonetheless, part of the balance can undoubtedly be restored by a strong civil society in the countries concerned.
It is hardly surprising that most governments in the ACP countries reject such demands.
For many ACP governments, non-state actors are still synonymous with opposition.
It is even more important, therefore, for the Commission to take this step in the right direction at last.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Howitt on a report which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can vote for almost without reservation, and the direction of which we endorse in principle.
I would like to focus this evening on a group of non-state actors to whom the report does not give explicit credit.
The report mainly refers to two categories of non-state actor: the trade unions, on the one hand, and private sector actors, on the other.
It omits to mention one group of non-state actors which also meet the 'non-governmental organisation' criterion, by which I mean the independent political foundations.
Being non-profit organisations, they cannot be categorised as non-state actors from business or industry.
They are autonomous, even though their policy programmes are based on the political movements.
In every case, however, they are non-governmental organisations.
They are funded from within Europe.
Their management and funding are subject to the most stringent financial controls and performance audits.
They are established in most Member States and in a total of more than eighty countries worldwide, and they are recognised by the local partners.
Most importantly, the foundations cover a wide range of fields: poverty alleviation, good governance, pluralist democracy, human rights, promoting SMEs, 'green' business, rule-of-law structures, control of security forces, healthcare, education and training in developing countries, etc. They develop synergies and work with many partners, especially NGOs.
Until now, these foundations have mainly relied on national sources of funding.
However, various functions have now been defined at European level for which these foundations have been qualifying themselves worldwide for decades.
They are therefore natural partners for the EU in fulfilling these tasks.
If the Konrad Adenauer Foundation or the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, for example, had not been present in a country such as Zimbabwe in recent years, many NGOs and civil society would have been without major partners to support their commitment to human rights, democracy and good governance.
For this reason, the independent political foundations should also be given particular consideration in the present and, above all, in the future debate.
.
Mr President, I should like to respond to Mr Nielson's statement that my explanatory memorandum gave false information about what development NGOs had said in relation to his own consultation arrangements.
I do not regard Mr Nielson as someone who is thin-skinned, but I believe that statement did not do him justice.
It may be true that Mr Howitt may be wrong, as may the NGOs, but is it not equally true that so might the Commission?
For the record, comments were properly made to me pointing out that there is insufficient NGO involvement in agenda preparation and presentation in the Commission's twice-yearly meetings with Brussels-based development NGOs.
The NGOs I consulted are part of the public record.
Indeed, I produced an appendix to my report that listed them and this was passed to the Commissioner's service.
Perhaps, rather than rejecting the criticism, the Commissioner should reflect on why - if it is true - it might be that NGOs are saying something slightly different to him than they are saying to this Parliament.
Good governance is surely an issue for all of us.
.
Mr President, I made the effort of discussing this with Concord.
We have an ongoing discussion about the preparation of our regular meetings with the development NGOs.
This works well and happens regularly.
Both sides in those discussions produced input - this is not dictated by one side.
If they are grown up enough to discuss and criticise something they are unhappy with, they should do so directly.
In any case, to say one thing to me and then some thing different to Mr Howitt shows there is a problem - not necessarily for me or for Mr Howitt.
We need and are entitled to expect clarity in discussing things like this.
I do not want to relate to something which is not up front and clear.
We are entitled to expect better than that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0209/2003) by Mr Miguel Angel MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the 2001 Annual Report of the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on EC development policy and the implementation of external assistance (COM(2002) 490 - C5-0607/2002 - 2002/2246(INI)).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report which should have been dealt with during the last part-session of Parliament - before the summer - since it was ready to be debated, and which had been produced principally by our Committee on Development and Cooperation, with opinions being produced by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities.
In fact, our initial proposals were considerably improved by means of the proposals made by the rapporteurs Mrs Ursula Stenzel and Mrs Regina Bastos, respectively, and the text of the final resolution was approved unanimously, as I hope will be the case in tomorrow's vote.
Our report is an assessment of a document produced by the Commission which analyses the European Union's development policy and the execution of foreign aid during 2001.
It should be pointed out at the outset that this is a very useful compendium of data and comments which are not available in any other form for easy consultation.
The document describes in a reasonably clear way how the Commission spent the funds available to it during 2001, both in the field of development cooperation and with regard to humanitarian aid.
This assessment is particularly important, above all, if we bear in mind that the European Union is the main donor in certain areas.
Our report, however, makes many critical observations, all in the best spirit and in the hope that in subsequent years the shortcomings and insufficiencies will be overcome.
Furthermore, we take account of the fact that 2001 was still a time of transition, during which the details of the form to be taken by European policy in the areas we are interested in here, and the best mechanisms for implementing that policy, were defined.
Perhaps the most positive element, in Parliament's view, is the fact that the Commission's report very clearly reflects the same policy objectives that this House had recommended on repeated occasions: the achievement of the millennium development objectives, with particular emphasis on the eradication of poverty.
Nevertheless, what is less clear is to what extent our actions - which are significant objectively - are contributing to bringing those objectives closer.
Furthermore, what is demonstrated is that the complexity of the procedures - which are often excessively bureaucratic - means that, in certain regions and in the year under examination, the Commission was not able to spend a significant proportion of the resources available to it.
Another issue which remains in the air is the quest for greater efficiency in our actions by means of selecting more suitable interlocutors with whom to implement our actions.
The participation of non-governmental organisations from our countries is often the determining factor in terms of our interventions achieving good results.
In other cases, the cooperation we are able to lend to the United Nations and its specialised agencies on issues of development and humanitarian action appears to be very important.
More questionable is the work the Commission's delegations can carry out directly in the countries benefiting from our aid, undoubtedly as a result of the scandalous restrictions those delegations suffer in terms of personnel.
One of the criticisms which has been expressed most often in our debates relates to the fact that the report being assessed rather mixes up what is genuine development and humanitarian aid with what in 2001 was aid to candidate countries, preparing them for enlargement, and also action in the Balkans, which took up a significant proportion of the budgets available.
Of the conclusions of our resolution, there are one or two I would like to highlight: the first is Parliament's request - which is being repeated once again - that the European Development Fund (EDF) should be included within the European Union's ordinary budgets so that it becomes more transparent and subject to Parliament's control; the second is, in reality, our congratulations to the Commission - and more specifically the people responsible for our actions, both in development cooperation and in humanitarian aid.
We sincerely believe that, despite the criticisms made, there has been considerable progress in terms of what is done in these fields but, above all, we note that there is genuine concern to take stock, expose problems and to seek the participation of many - of Parliament as well, of course - in order to ensure that things are done better every day.
That is why one of the recommendations we stress most in our resolution is that the Commission's 2001 report - with its attractive presentation - should be disseminated widely within the countries benefiting from our aid policies and also within our own states, reaching the administrations - and also local administrations, which are often closely involved in cooperation and humanitarian aid policies - and, in particular, the NGOs, which are indispensable and wonderful partners in this work by the European Union.
Thank you, Mr President, and thank you also to the Members who helped me in the production of this report.
Thank you also to the people responsible within the Commission, who showed great willingness to help us, clarifying issues and replying to our questions.
Thank you, finally, to the officials of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and those of my group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, who cooperated with me generously and very effectively throughout the production of our report.
.
Mr President, despite the improvements cited, the 2001 report is still by no means a perfect one.
We are learning year by year.
We started with a very difficult background.
I have stated a number of times - some thought it was a bad joke - that the main reason why we are so bad as regards informing the public about what we do in development cooperation is that we do not know what we are doing.
The truth is that statistically speaking, we are very far behind in our reporting and the whole mechanics of the system.
We did not have an annual report that presented, across the board, a picture of what the Commission was doing in this area.
This was a very big problem a few years ago.
So, getting started was very important.
I am pleased to inform you that the 2002 report is just about to be published.
In fact we sent it today to Parliament and the Council.
Even though preparations for it had to be launched at the end of last year, it takes into account many of the recommendations made by your rapporteur, such as more analysis on the effectiveness of aid follow-up to Monterrey and Johannesburg, more statistical information permitting a comparison among the regions, and an executive summary.
So, as you will see from the new report, we really are trying to improve it.
I should like to stress that production of this kind of report is a complex process.
First of all, it addresses many different audiences.
On the one hand, it is an important management tool for our own institutions.
On the other, it is a public information instrument.
Following this dual purpose, there are conflicting demands.
We have to fulfil our obligations on a number of regulations, resolutions and so on concerning reporting.
For that reason we had to include a lot of detail.
At the same time, it should be easy to read, without too much technical jargon.
All in all we are happy that we have done it although we are not yet totally happy with the quality of it.
The great help we get from Parliament and the feedback from this good report by Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez is, from our point of view, one way of continuing to improve the standard.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
. (FR) Where European Union law exists, the Member States, who are supposed to enforce it, ride roughshod over it.
This is acknowledged by this report, at the same time as it blandly speculates what legal bases might make it possible for adherence to it to be compelled.
The members of this union of states, obliged to join together, but competing with one another in order to defend their own bourgeoisies, apply Community law only in so far as their big businesses and major industries find it convenient for them to do so.
Although the rapporteur makes reference to the steps taken by the European Court of Justice in support of Community law, the same Court is incapable of preventing the law of the jungle from being the only law that prevails in this competitive society.
The most it will be able to do, then, is to make the smallest European powers comply with a few rules, whilst grovelling before the larger ones as it has always done.
Announcement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, before beginning our work, let us remember with emotion that it is the 40th anniversary of the death of Robert Schuman, who was President of the European Parliamentary Assembly between 1958 and 1960 and one of the outstanding figures in the founding of the European Union.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0271/2003) by Mr Michl Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, with recommendations to the Commission on regional and lesser-used languages - the minority languages in the European Union in the context of enlargement and cultural diversity (2003/2057(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, not only in this plenary but far beyond these walls, it was repeatedly said that we faced, in the shape of enlargement, an historic step.
This historic step demands of us, above all else, understanding, an understanding that must be profound rather than merely superficial, a real comprehension rather than just a random encounter.
We need languages as a vector if this understanding is to be guaranteed.
In this place, we will soon be representing twenty-five states and over three thousand years of cultural history.
Many cultures and many languages are far younger and hence less deep-rooted, so there is, in all of them, concern about their own identity.
I believe that these concerns do not need to persist, and would like to give you the example of the South Tyrol, from which I come.
We have benefited from the European Union.
The Austrian minority in South Tyrol - speaking German and Ladin - has been greatly strengthened by the EU, by a policy of openness on the part of Italy and by developments in the European Union.
It is my belief that this minority has become a bridge between Italy and Austria, between the German-speakers and Italian-speakers.
That is why I would like to dispel the misgivings of the minorities, the small linguistic communities within the EU and of those who will be joining it.
This report seeks to value and maintain languages and cultures and to strengthen all of them - not just the official languages, but also the regional and less-used ones.
Europe is a mosaic, and a very beautiful one, and we want this mosaic to be conserved rather than becoming a cocktail.
In the Europe of Fifteen, there are at present over sixty minorities.
Another sixty will be added from the ten candidate countries.
This wealth of languages makes for diversity and enriches us, and it will be possible for many of these minorities to function as bridges between States.
The Commission, with its action plan and its inclusive approach, has recognised that at the right time.
I would like not only to single out Commissioner Reding for specific mention, but also to express due gratitude to her for this initiative.
The Action Plan on Linguistic Diversity is the right way forward.
I am grateful to the Members of this House and to those who, in past parliamentary terms, have made substantial contributions towards this end, above all those in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport who have helped to improve this report.
Parliament played a leading role in this.
From 1981 to 2001, it has taken the initiative with the ArfÃ© Report, the Kuijpers Report, the Reding Report, the Killilea Report, and, most recently, the Morgan resolution; now, with this resolution from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, it wants to go one step further.
This is a decisive moment before enlargement, when we are able not only to express our positions on the work that the Convention has completed, but also to offer proposals.
The Year of Languages 2001 was important, but it was not enough.
The learning of languages must not be limited to one year, but must become and remain a continuous process.
Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking the rapporteur very warmly for his commitment, as it is a commitment to languages and therefore to human beings and to our citizens.
It seeks to create a multilingual and multicultural Europe where we advocate diversity, because as far as we are concerned that is Europe's real wealth.
Mr Ebner, both you and the Commissioner want the same thing.
We now have to decide how to achieve it.
I would like to go on to look at the two legislative proposals contained in the report.
The first concerns an Agency on Linguistic Diversity.
Although I do feel that such an agency would be useful, we must stop and think before launching such an undertaking.
A feasibility study would be a vital stage in the considerations; it would provide us with a detailed assessment of the existing instruments, including those relating to regional and minority languages.
My services have carried out an evaluation of all of the activities relating to regional and minority languages, and a report should be published at the beginning of next year, which will serve as a first step on this path.
I am sure you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that a feasibility study on the creation of a Cultural Cooperation Observatory - the Ruffolo report - is already under way.
I feel that it would be useful to learn the lessons of that experience before embarking upon a new exercise.
I would like to highlight the importance we place on the Council of Europe's activities in the field of languages.
I agree with you: we must coordinate the efforts of the Commission and the Council of Europe.
Before going any further in terms of creating an agency, there should be an exchange of ideas regarding the methods for greater coordination.
The second point relates to the adoption of a multi-annual programme.
I must admit, Mr President, that this poses a problem, as the Commission cannot accept this recommendation.
It is not a question of substance, as you know very well that we are of the same opinion in that respect.
I have already had several opportunities to talk to you about this issue.
I have supported the idea that in the current circumstances the best way of promoting regional and minority languages is through an integrated approach.
I am totally convinced of this, as a separate programme would, in my view, mean further isolation of regional and minority languages.
Now is the time for just the opposite, that is, giving them greater recognition.
We must ensure support for these languages by making use of the possibilities provided by the existing programmes.
Moreover, the European Year - you will no doubt agree - was an experience that integrated regional and minority languages.
The implementation report demonstrates that regional and minority languages now occupy a prime position.
After careful consideration, the Commission decided to present an action plan, which the rapporteur has already mentioned and which I have brought with me today.
You should have received a copy.
If not, I have some copies here that you can have.
Would the President like one?
President Roca, your copy awaits!
This action plan is based on the conclusions of the Helsinki Conference on regional and minority languages, organised under the aegis of President Ahtisaari in October 2002.
Mr Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, if you like, I will outline this action plan, adopted on 24 July, in greater detail and talk to you about its implementation.
The plan envisages the integrated approach I spoke about, as we must focus on the opportunities for financing within the framework of existing programmes and ensure that there is more awareness of these opportunities and that they are better utilised.
As a result, thanks to the budget passed by Parliament, on 31 July the Commission published a call for proposals and the projects should be submitted by the end of this month.
Allow me also to say that we should take advantage of the discussions on the new generations of programme because if we truly want to implement a concerted action for languages, the new programmes should incorporate a significant multilingual element.
Before ending, I would very briefly like to mention some of the points in the report.
As far as the definition is concerned, I believe we are in agreement: we should use that of the Council of Europe, as set out in the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages.
With regard to the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages and the Mercator network, I know that many of you here are very interested in these instruments and hope that they can continue to operate.
I can tell you that the proposal for a decision establishing an action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture is currently being negotiated.
A total of EUR 5.4 million is being set aside to fund the Bureau and the Mercator network for the 2004-2008 period.
You can therefore forget any concerns regarding this issue.
Finally, Mr President, the annex to the motion for a resolution sets out 20 different requests.
I must stress that most of these requests go far beyond what could be implemented within the framework of the two legislative initiatives proposed by Parliament itself.
I do not want to go into detail, but would remind you that many concrete initiatives to promote regional and minority languages are contained in this action plan and that substantial funding is already available.
The action plan aims to bring everything together and to present to the citizens in all their diversity the possibilities the European Union can offer them, the opportunities recommended in the action plan for languages, in other words the opportunities, Mr Ebner, that have exactly the same aim as your report: to turn this grand European linguistic mosaic into a great table for Europe's cultural diversity.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for all his work and, above all, for his great willingness to seek solutions to possible problems.
Spain is a country with great wealth when it comes to languages, and there are many regions or Autonomous Communities in which Castilian is co-official - as the official language of the Spanish State - with another language, such as Catalan or Basque, amongst others.
Above all, moreover, I must say that we feel very proud of this.
We in the People's Party always try to ensure that one of these co-official languages does not thrive to the detriment of another, for the good of our citizens and in order to have a totally bilingual population.
We in Spain already channel enough money towards the promotion of languages and, for this reason, we do not agree with channelling more Community budget for this purpose, bearing in mind all the existing needs at European level.
We believe that certain points in this report - and we agree with its general basis - do not entirely respect the principle of subsidiarity and even violate the principle of proportionality and Community legislation.
We have full confidence, however, that, this being the case, the European Commission will play its role as guardian of the Treaties and put right anything which is not correct in the report.
Mr President, it is commonly accepted that European cultural diversity is closely linked to linguistic diversity, which makes a significant contribution to our very perception of the world, to expression and creativity.
This is something which is also included in the draft Constitutional Treaty and we are particularly satisfied with that.
Maintaining linguistic diversity, as expressed through support for lesser-used languages, contributes, apart from anything else, to social cohesion, to preventing conflicts and, of course, should not in my opinion operate along lines of quantitative parameters, along lines of majorities and minorities.
I take the same view of minority languages.
They have an intrinsic value and should be dealt with as such.
There are in fact millions of Europeans who, alongside the official language of their country, speak a minority language, mainly within their communities, and this is a tradition from generation to generation which we all respect.
That is why it is important for cultural ties to be used creatively for the purpose of communication and exchanges and not, of course, to isolate a community; this would be particularly negative and we have seen it happen in the past.
It is therefore important for our strategies as regards minority languages to be characterised by an open spirit of cooperation, by scientific research and association with the wealth of cultural elements which surround them.
Promoting cultural cooperation and exchanges is the best way of offering the public the area of European culture we all want to create.
In the present era of globalisation, concentration of resources and the prevalence of monolingual situations, maintaining minority languages must be addressed as a source of primary elements which have the freshness and verve to claim their expression over time, despite their limited extent.
However, it should be stressed that it is only by opening these cultural communities up to dialogue that we shall find a fruitful solution.
That is why I think that the Commission study is important and we await its results with great interest.
Mr President, Europe is a collection of peoples - as we heard during the presentation of the Convention two days ago.
In Europe there is a group of languages which forms a significant part of its heritage.
We see this in this Chamber: 11 working languages and nine new languages which will be incorporated on the enlargement of the European Union.
In Europe there are unitary states, nation states and also multinational states - states made up of several nations with their own languages.
In my case, in the Spanish state, there are several nations.
I belong to the Catalan nation, the language spoken by more than 7 million people - in other words, more speakers than two of the current official languages of the European Union, and more speakers than six of the languages of the 10 candidate states.
The Commissioner herself, Mrs Reding, was rapporteur for a report on the linguistic diversity in Europe in 1990.
At that time the European Commission was asked to take account of the particular circumstances of the Catalan language within the European Union.
In this regard, we can say that the steps recommended by Parliament - by means of the Reding report - at that time have not been taken: that official texts in Catalan should have validity and that the Commission should also regulate a form of incorporation of Catalan into the linguistic system of the European Union, since it is a language spoken more widely than many of the languages which are working languages and official languages here.
We are not asking, under any circumstances, that Catalan should be a working language - the European Union's linguistic system is quite complex enough - we are simply asking for recognition of its validity as an official language and that it may participate in the wealth of this cultural mosaic.
In this way we will be able to satisfy that plurality which Robert Schuman - as the President mentioned at the beginning of the sitting - spoke of during his lifetime.
.
[Translation: 'For many years the EU has been speaking about language diversity and respect for minorities.
Today, through Mr Ebner's report we are at last putting that into practice and supporting language learning and multilingualism, including minority languages, like the language I am speaking now, Welsh, my mother tongue.']
Mr President, I would like to thank the interpreters for translating the first part of my address - which was in Welsh - to be understood by the rest of the Members here.
I wish to begin by congratulating and thanking Mr Ebner for adventuring in the task of writing a report on European minority languages and presenting so many constructive ideas to further respect for multilingualism in Europe.
We all know how sensitive this issue of minority languages is in some countries which consider them a threat not only to the integrity of their state culture but also to their territorial integrity.
The issue of minority languages is a matter very close to my heart, because I am, myself - as are many others in this Chamber - a speaker of a minority language.
Minority-language speakers are no different to speakers of other languages.
We only want to live a full life through the medium of our language, whilst not giving up, of course, the pleasure of learning and mastering many languages which open doors to cultures and windows to a better understanding of others.
I welcome the fact that minority languages are back on the European agenda.
For many years we have been in a stalemate over the legal funding for minority languages in Europe.
The Commission and the Council have dragged their feet on this issue for far too long.
Therefore, today's debate in Parliament is a major step forward which should ultimately lead to new legislation.
Minority languages must be sustained and promoted if we are to live up to the claim of a Europe of diversity.
At this important juncture in Europe's future, with new members joining the Union, the European Parliament is again leading the cause for greater respect for minority-language speakers.
I wish Mr Ebner well with his report.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Ebner on this excellent report on regional and lesser-used languages.
The variety of regional and lesser-used languages across the continent of Europe is an integral part of our unique cultural heritage.
We are culturally richer due to the fact that so many of these languages have survived in this multimedia globalised age and are still used on a daily basis.
Credit is certainly due to the Commission, which has consistently supported the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages.
I strongly support the rapporteur's idea of creating a European agency to assist the various aspects of language policy.
We recognise that the area of culture and language policy is primarily a national preserve.
Nevertheless, I am convinced that by pooling a certain amount of our resources and experience, we can bring about improvements which would have Europe-wide benefits.
In my own country, Ireland, and in the neighbouring United Kingdom, the predominant language is an ever more global English.
If against this backdrop lesser-used national languages such as Gaeilge, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh, which we heard so eloquently spoken here this morning by Mr Wyn, can thrive, there is no reason why any of our minority languages have to die out.
We often talk about Europe's cultural heritage.
The preservation of language diversity far outweighs preservation of architectural or artistic heritage, important as they may be, because language is a living thing.
It is part of our very identity.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ebner, for his report on the promotion of regional and minority languages, which goes hand in hand with the values supported by our group, in particular those relating to rural issues.
It is vital to safeguard and promote these languages.
A heritage of our past, they cement peoples and territories and add the specific characteristics and cachet to numerous regions throughout Europe, like here, Alsace or Catalonia - Northern Catalonia - from which I come.
Mr VallvÃ©, we are the symbol of geographical diversity for the same so-called minority language.
I do wonder, however, about the means of fulfilling this objective and, in particular, the need for a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning.
How, exactly, is it going to operate on the ground to promote this learning?
Would it not be better to apply the subsidiarity principle and work at national level, much closer to local level?
That would make it possible to respect cultural traditions and the administrative and constitutional organisation of each state by encouraging them to promote, first and foremost, the learning of regional and minority languages from nursery school and, then, the organisation of cultural events such as twinning and school exchanges that would encompass the identity and history of the people.
We must not rob the Member States of their power of action in the field of training and culture.
I see Amendment No 5 as a step in the right direction, as it encourages ongoing support for minority and regional languages in a context of political neutrality and independently of any mercenary, financial considerations.
We must also provide a legal basis for these actions so that we can get out of the mess caused by the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and allow European funds to be used.
Allow me, as a member of the Disability Intergroup, to say how pleased I am to see the reference to sign language, which, according to the Council of Europe, is used by more than 3 million of our fellow citizens.
There could perhaps have been greater emphasis on these languages as their users face the same problems on a daily basis as the people using the languages covered by this report.
It is essential that all the members of the Union ratify the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
After 2001, the European Year of Languages, I hope that the excellent links we have with the Council of Europe can continue to grow, especially with the secretariat of the Charter.
That would seem to me to be a pragmatic and effective way of encouraging and developing the use of our regional languages.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ebner's report deserves credit for having emphasised the value of regional languages as components of our cultural heritage and wealth.
I regret, however, that the report did not seek to define its subject and has left this to the Commission, which is invited, in paragraph 2, to lay down criteria on the basis of scientific elements.
As legislators, it is precisely our role to determine these criteria.
Thus we would undoubtedly have had to distinguish between regional languages and minority languages.
Minority languages may be national or official languages in a Member State, one example being the German-speaking population in the Alto Adige region or South Tyrol, as mentioned by the rapporteur.
Although these people speak German, it is more questionable whether German can be considered a regional language in Alsace as the Alsatian dialect, which is undoubtedly Germanic, is substantially different.
As far as regional languages are concerned, what exactly are they?
Are they, for example, the langue d'oc in the south of France, or its distinct components, ProvenÃ§al or Gascon?
Above all, we must not forget that many of our national languages are themselves threatened.
Indeed, the Parliament itself provides its own delegations travelling abroad only with interpreting services into English, as was recently the case with the delegation to Japan, and that leads me to believe that we are going down a dangerous path.
My own language, French, is unfortunately losing ground every day as a language of international communication, but the very existence of others is threatened.
I am thinking of Gaelic in Ireland and the languages of the Baltic states, which have only just escaped Russification.
We must certainly develop regional languages, and that is my conclusion, Mr President, but we must ensure that we do not undermine or weaken our national languages.
We must ensure that there is no artificial reconstruction of abstract languages that are removed from the regional realities.
We must ensure that we do not establish a restrictive and authoritarian system.
The regional languages will contribute to our cultural wealth only if they meet these three conditions.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the moment, some 40 million people speak a regional or minority language in addition to one of the Union's official languages.
With the enlargement in 2004, some 6 million people will be added to this.
In the Netherlands too, we have the phenomenon of a minority language, Friesian, which enjoys official recognition as such.
As has been said before, linguistic diversity is a heritage of which we Europeans are proud, and so we should be.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union rightly recognises the cultural and linguistic diversity.
In future, this will also form an inherent part of the European Constitution.
The European Parliament has always made a case for protecting linguistic diversity and regional and minority languages.
Various resolutions have been adopted in this respect.
A budget line was created for this purpose as early as 1980.
In 2001, the European year of languages was particularly intended to draw attention to the importance of languages, to language diversity, and to stimulating language teaching.
This involved not only the major languages, but also lesser-used regional and minority languages.
It was a sound initiative.
Nevertheless, there is still a great deal left to be done in this area.
I am therefore pleased that a plan of action is now being drafted in order to hammer this point home once more.
I myself have spoken in favour of greater attention being given to sign language.
We know that about 1 in 1 000 people - some 15 000 people in the Netherlands alone - are born deaf or become deaf before they reach the age of three.
To them, sign language is an essential means of communication, so I am pleased that this component has been included in the present report.
It would be good if sign language could be considered a minority language.
Deaf people are often excluded from many areas of society on account of their disability.
Their language deserves as much attention and support as do spoken minority languages.
I sincerely hope that the Commission will manage to present a legislative proposal on language diversity by the end of this year.
Peace in Europe is not only about effective economic cooperation.
It is, above all, about demonstrating an interest in, respect for, and understanding of, people from a different culture.
Language is an important key in this.
Finally, I should like to congratulate Mr Ebner on the result of his work and thank him for the particularly pleasant working relationship.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have often heard that Europe's wealth lies in its cultural diversity, and the expression is often, and readily, used in many political speeches.
It is not, however, meant only to be used, but should also emphasise and reinforce European consciousness.
As we have already heard said many times today, one essential part of this richness is linguistic diversity, which we have taken on as our cultural heritage and must pass on as a matter of cultural responsibility.
Put into practical terms, this means that we need institutions to take on this work, financial resources to make it possible, and voluntary organisations to give support in the performance of these tasks.
Being myself from Austria, a country in which six recognised ethnic groups and their minority languages are represented - three of them, including Roma, in my very small federal state of Burgenland alone - I know how difficult it is to meet all the demands involved in using languages properly and in maintaining them.
Whilst it is the individual states that have responsibility for minority languages and for their support, the European Union cannot evade the obligation to take action to back them up in this; we are talking here about 40 million EU citizens and 60 regional and minority languages.
The European Year of Languages was, as we have heard, a great success; it also sent the right signals and pointed us in the right direction.
Now is the time for what we have learned to be put into practice, and I would agree with Mrs Martens that sign language must absolutely be included, as the deaf must be able to participate in social and political life.
Multiannual programmes for linguistic diversity are desirable and should be pushed through.
International exchanges of experience and courses of study, cross-border projects and so on, should be brought together under one roof, and I believe it to be absolutely necessary that EBLUL be given a legal basis enabling it to make full use of the financial resources provided for it.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Constitution says that European values include that of preserving and developing linguistic diversity.
Today is therefore a particularly well chosen time to present the report on regional languages and cultural diversity.
I want to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Ebner for all the hard work he has done.
As many in this House have pointed out, we now need practical efforts in order to make further progress with this work.
I believe that, as Mr Ebner said, developments will increase the need for measures on our part.
It is important for us to share our various experiences of linguistic diversity and language learning.
I therefore believe it important for a relevant institute to be set up.
I nonetheless believe that there is no great difference between how matters look at present and what is discussed in the report, where there is explicit talk about what are called language baths.
This is an extremely good method, which has been used to good effect in South Tyrol, Catalonia and Finland.
I see no mention of it in the Commission's action plan, but I am glad the plan states that the universities must review their language policies so that English is not so dominant.
I want, however, to emphasise that we must investigate, and go more deeply into, the issue of an institute for linguistic diversity and language learning.
I am convinced that such an institute is needed.
I also wish to thank the Commissioner for mentioning the conference in Finland.
We learned a lot at this conference, lessons I hope may also be taken on board by Parliament.
Mr President, we must congratulate our colleague, Mr Ebner, on this further resolution from Parliament to promote so-called regional or minority languages.
During the European Year of Languages, the Council even went so far as to state that all languages are equal in dignity.
That is all very well, but as the joke goes, some are more equal than others.
Those that are more equal than others are the official languages of the Union.
The others, although equal in dignity, are not equal in law.
My national language, Catalan, is spoken by more than 10 million citizens of the European Union.
These 10 million people cannot use their own language in their relations with the Union.
We are therefore discriminated against in relation to our fellow European citizens.
Why?
It is because we Catalans have not had our own State since Barcelona was taken by the Franco-Spanish armies on 11 September 1714.
We therefore know what has to be done.
The democratic exercise of the right to self-determination will one day soon resolve our European linguistic problem.
I give you my word.
Mr President, unfortunately, I fear that the situation is a lot less positive than some of the speakers would have us believe.
Linguistic diversity is being destroyed in Europe.
In short, I believe that the solution to this problem does not simply lie in supporting languages or minority languages, because this is not enough, it will not suffice; I believe that the solution lies in a difficult and uncomfortable word: Esperanto.
Let us try it at least!
According to studies, this language, as a technical and neutral language, could be learnt and, therefore, chosen as a political language in place of other languages.
To use other languages, which represent and bring with them a culture, as sole languages or as bridge languages, would be to encourage the predominance of one culture over another, which is what is already happening now.
With Esperanto this issue, this shortcoming, does not arise.
If it is true, and I believe it to be so, that this language is as easy to learn as is claimed by many international studies, then I believe that the European Union should at least try exploring this avenue.
Funding and support are not enough when facing the destruction of linguistic diversity.
Mr President, let me, too, start by congratulating Mr Ebner on his report, in which, taking the positive experience of the European Year of Languages as his starting point, he highlights the growing awareness in Europe of the way in which languages bridge the gaps between cultures and cultures the gulfs that divide people, and points out that we must accordingly - if I may exaggerate to make a point - stop dreaming of the 'American model' of one language and no culture, instead really discovering in the diversity of our languages and cultures a keynote, something indeed of fundamental value for our future.
Knowing our neighbours' language and culture better means understanding them better and respecting them, and so I see language as performing an essential task in the sense that knowledge of other people's languages promotes peace.
If we look more closely into the trouble spots in and around Europe, we discover that a lack of respect for those who are different - which involves languages - has very often brought about the trouble in the first place and led to the situation in these places worsening.
I therefore see language as being about more than knowing and respecting others.
I see language as the best peacekeeping force that we in Europe can deploy.
The report makes clear, though, that, in an ever-expanding Europe, there is increasing awareness of regional cultures and also of regional languages.
Belonging as I do to the German-speaking community in Belgium, I can see that respecting this is not a luxury for those regions that enjoy autonomy, but something I regard as a European fundamental right.
It is for that reason that governments have - as we have just heard said - the primary task of guaranteeing the cultures of smaller regions and their right to have their voices heard.
We should then, at the European level, give consideration to what additional instruments we employ.
We appreciate Mr Ebner's work in representing us in this House.
We know that German is spoken in Italy and Belgium ?
However, that does not prevent us from speaking the language of our neighbours.
We do so with belief in our own culture and also with love for the culture of others.
We hope that this will be the norm in the Europe of tomorrow; speaking one's own language, speaking the language of one's neighbour; getting to know one another better and on that basis building the foundations of a Europe of all languages and, above all, a Europe of mutual respect.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union would not be as culturally and politically rich as it is today if we did not have more than 40 million citizens who speak regional or minority languages.
That is why it is a very positive move that in the new draft Constitution the Union's linguistic diversity is being recognised.
Under Article 3 the Union will respect the wealth and diversity of its cultures and languages.
I do hope that at last we are moving on from speech to action in the area of language policy also.
Throughout the current parliamentary term we have encountered almost insurmountable problems whenever we have tried to steer funds from the Union's budget in the direction of minority languages. The reason has been the absence of any legal basis.
Fortunately, we have been able to avail ourselves of multiannual programmes such as Socrates and Culture 2000, not forgetting the European Year of Languages 2001.
The rapporteur, Mr Ebner, has done an excellent job.
I agree with him that the EU should have an Agency on Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning.
There should also be sufficient resources allocated to it for it to function effectively in an enlarged Union.
With enlargement the number of regional or minority language communities is estimated to double from the present number of approximately 60.
We must also give our support to the proposal for a multiannual programme on linguistic diversity and language learning.
No agency or action programme, however, will solve the problems that EU citizens who speak regional or minority languages encounter in many Member States.
The right to an education in one's own native language in particular should be guaranteed in all Member States.
For this there has to be investment in the training of teachers of regional and minority languages.
There will be limited scope in future budget headings in respect of internal policies for financing activities to encourage the use of regional and minority languages.
I hope that more resources under the Structural Funds can be directed towards such activities.
We should also inform speakers of regional or minority languages of such possible resources.
Mr President, I regret that, despite having offered a written translation, I have not been authorised to speak in Euskera - the language of an ancestral people, the Basques, which has survived the passing of time with a small population and which, in the opinion of eminent foreign researchers, is the language of the first residents of Europe.
By speaking in my language, I would have liked to have stressed the reality of this European Union which we are building amongst all of us on the basis of respect for our own cultural diversity.
I believe we are all concerned, not just the green ecologists, when the biodiversity of nature is threatened by man's actions.
However, we often forget human biodiversity, one of the main manifestations of which are the different languages and cultures which are sometimes not respected or protected, but rather there is simply an attempt to eliminate them, for the sake of the commercial convenience of uniformity and globalising tendencies.
Since I believe that the individual, the person, is above commercial and economic interests, I would advocate constant support for national, regional and minority languages, independently of changes in political power, as well as decisive support for multilingualism so that we can build our Union without it becoming a confused tower of Babel.
I would finally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ebner, on his wonderful report.
Mr Ortuondo, would you be so kind as to tell the Presidency to whom you put your request to speak some sentences in Euskera and provide a translation?
The Presidency has no knowledge of this request.
Evidence of this is that Mr Wyn, who made this request in relation to the Welsh language, has been able - quite legitimately - to say a few words in Welsh.
Could you explain how this has happened?
Mr President, thank you very much for your words.
I tried, through my group, to offer a translation of my words and to speak in Euskera, and the reply was that only one person per Parliamentary group could speak.
Mr Wyn is from my group.
He has been allowed to speak and I have not.
That is what I understand from the reply I have been given.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my warmest congratulations go to Mr Ebner for his report, which raises a central issue of democracy: the relationship between rights of freedom and the use of one's own language.
I would say, and this is, indeed, most significant, that the rights of freedom of the rapporteur have, in a sense, been violated in this House: when Mr Ebner mentioned his region, he called it - as is his right - SÃŒdtirol, and in the Italian translation it was adapted to the bureaucratic name fixed by the Italian centralist State and translated incorrectly, as 'Alto Adige'.
Europe, as he rightly said, quoting the great Europeanist, Dr Silvius Magnago, is a wonderful mosaic of nations and should, therefore, see its unique ethno-linguistic character as a precious gift to be defended and valued.
I will continue and conclude in my mother tongue, which is Piedmontese: 'Voeui bin rimarquÃ© si ma son che in Piemunt, che l'Ãš la mia regiÃ¹n, ancÃ¶i as parlan ?. ancura - a parte el piemunteis, che l'Ãš na lingua straordinaria con una bela literatÃŒra e na gramatica che risale adiritÃŒra al Setzent - due aute lingue minuritarie: lusitan e il valzer che s'parla anche in Valdusta.
Tant'el piemunteis que le aute lingue minuritarie l'han sÃŒbi e sÃŒbissen ancura adess, en tel 2003, n'upressiÃ¹n gravusa da la parte de le Stat centralista italian, e l'Ãš certament l'un dei mutivu per ingagÃšr nost cumbatiment per uteign sÃŒbit il federalismo, in Italia, e duman la piena libertÃ  e l'autonomia del nost bel Piemonte e de la Padania libera.
[I would like to add that in Piedmont, which is the region I come from, not only is Piedmontese still spoken, which is an extraordinary language with beautiful literature and grammar that dates back as far as the eighteenth century, there are two other minority languages: Ladin and Walser, that are also spoken in Val d'Aosta.
Both Piedmontese and the other two minority languages have suffered and continue to suffer now, in 2003, from serious oppression by the centralist Italian state, and this is certainly one of the reasons for fighting to obtain federalism in Italy without delay, and demand full freedom and independence for our lovely region of Piedmont and for a free Padania.]
Mr President, Commissioner, I have just learned that you would probably have been able to speak Letzeburgesh here this morning.
In contrast to Welsh and Basque, you would probably not have had to submit your speech beforehand.
We would have had it translated for us.
I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Ebner for his initiative in producing this report.
Along with Mr Grosch, who has also already spoken, he represents linguistic minorities in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I think the South Tyrol and Eastern Belgium are, along with other places, successful examples of how minorities make for enrichment rather than for instability and also build bridges.
In Eastern Belgium and the South Tyrol, multilingualism can be heard, and, above all, seen.
This visible multilingualism is something we have not yet achieved in this Parliament building, where what we can read is all in one single language.
We find nonetheless, in our fifteen Member States and ten candidate countries, which are stable democracies, a repressive reflex towards minorities and their languages, mainly for reasons of history.
I want to make it perfectly plain that there are no separatist or extremist languages, but, if anything, only separatist or extremist people, with whom we have to deal by means of policy or the criminal law.
That is why linguistic minorities as such cannot be generally suspected of imperilling the unity of the nation by using their language.
For this reason, I find it quite incomprehensible that not all Member States have ratified the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Council of Europe's framework convention on the subject.
I would call on those states that have not yet done this to do so.
It will not endanger their national unity or territorial integrity.
Those who have problems with this leave themselves open to the suspicion that they are very insecure and believe it self-evident that their own language and culture can only be safeguarded by restricting others rather than through their own attractiveness.
I would urge a bit more boldness on those who still hesitate.
