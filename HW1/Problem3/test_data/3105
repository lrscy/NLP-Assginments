He recommends that the reform of the justice system should be observed more vigorously from the beginning of the accession process.
The same recommendation applies to the fight against corruption.
These are the only mechanisms we can use to guarantee effectiveness and transparency in such difficult areas before future candidates join the Union.
Of course, it is now important for Bulgaria to concentrate on the period after accession.
Bulgaria must prove that she is able to implement the requirements the Commission has issued in its progress report in order to avoid any activation of safeguard clauses.
It is clear, however, that Bulgaria is a pro-European country, as the recent elections proved, and it is now up to Bulgaria's decision-makers to continue their efforts and to follow their words with concrete and credible actions.
I now turn to Romania, a country whose people have long been close to my mind and to my heart.
What a pleasure it has been to be of small assistance to Romania in her move towards this wonderful accession moment.
I congratulate most warmly my fellow rapporteur, and now the rapporteur, on his final report and on his previous work.
It has also been a pleasure to work with him.
This is a time of real celebration for all Romanians.
Entry into the Union should trigger inward investment, which Romania badly needs.
It will enhance workers' rights and, over time, bring prosperity within the grasp of all Romania's people: a true time of celebration.
It is a pleasure to have in the visitors' gallery today Theodora Bertzi, the Minister for Adoptions, Alina Mandroiu, from the High-Level Group for Romanian Children, and Minister Bogdan Panait, who is in charge of child protection.
I urge colleagues concerned about child protection and adoptions in Romania to go straight upstairs and speak to these experts.
They have all the files, all the information, and you will be agreeably surprised.
You will find that child health and welfare has progressed dramatically since the early 1990s.
Indeed, as the Prime Minister said in his letter, Romania has vigorously addressed this issue.
As the noted children's author J.K. Rowling said recently, 'When you look at how far Romania has come, it is hard not to concede that a minor miracle has been achieved'.
Romania is a model for other countries hoping to reform.
Romania was the state that acknowledged that there was a problem and set out to do something about it.
Colleagues, vote for all of Mr Moscovici's report, but reject the amendments.
In the Foreign Affairs Committee we rejected not only those amendments but the offending clauses in the opinions of the Women's Rights and Civil Liberties Committees as well.
Romania has changed.
These amendments reflect the old days and not the reality.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we are not entirely happy with these reports.
All I will say at the moment is that our group has tabled two amendments to the Van Orden report, one on compliance with the Copenhagen criteria in respect of the protection of minorities and another on the nuclear power station at Kosloduj.
It is not a matter of doubt that what is called flexibility on the closure of the nuclear power station goes against Article 30 of the accession treaty; even Commissioner Piebalgs, who is responsible for energy matters, is against the provisions of the treaty being nullified in this way.
It is at this point that the nuclear lobby creeps surreptitiously through the back door.
Is the delay in the decommissioning of both blocks to be a test case for other agreements on nuclear plants' active life and the watering down of them?
Kosloduj is one of the most unsafe and most dangerous plants in Europe.
The decommissioning of Blocks 3 and 4 by the end of this year was and is a condition for accession; the Bulgarian Government must, in this regard, adhere to the treaties and Europe must not give the impression that Parliament is expressing opposition to treaties currently in force.
That would put Parliament in a difficult - indeed embarrassing - position vis-Ã -vis the Council and the Commission, and the impression that Member States would not be required, following their accession, to abide by agreements already made would be fatal to future accessions.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania's accession to the Union on 1 January 2007 represents a success for all of us and hope for the future of our common Europe founded on Christian values.
These values will facilitate integration and allow us to rejoice in coming together again.
In the same way as other former Communist countries were welcomed earlier, we will welcome these two countries among us despite the fact that their economies still lag behind the average for the rest of the Union.
It should be remembered that as its name indicates, the European Union stands for something more than the former European Economic Community.
The values at stake now are more than purely economic values.
It is unfortunate, though, that these countries are not being accepted on the basis of equal rules for all.
There is free movement of capital but no free movement of labour, and I fear the immediate aftermath of this imbalance after accession will be an unnecessary growth of Euroscepticism in those countries.
On behalf of the Europe for the Nations Group, I warmly welcome Bulgaria and Romania to the Union.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, there is a certain inevitability about the debate today and the vote tomorrow; after all, the European Union wants to become a global power, so the argument goes that the bigger it is, the better, and that there is a nice, cosy consensus here in the Chamber.
Well, not us!
In 2004, UKIP was the only British party to vote against the enlargement of the European Union, arguing that the free movement of goods and services is one thing, but to have the free movement of peoples between countries with vastly differing GDPs is nothing less than wholly irresponsible.
We predicted a massive migration: condemned though we were at the time, we have been proved right; there are well over half a million in Britain that are registered for work, but nobody doubts that the true figure is much nearer one million.
And there is one hell of a cost to it.
Already, we have 55 000 people claiming some form of State benefit.
Unemployment in the UK has increased by over a quarter of a million in the last year.
We have a huge over-supply in our unskilled labour market.
Even the OECD said yesterday that EU enlargement had been at a very high cost to Britain.
And what is our solution to all of this?
To admit two countries that are even poorer than those that joined two years ago, with the inevitability, in percentage terms, of an even bigger migration!
I know everyone is in denial: we have had the Bulgarian Prime Minister here, the Romanian Prime Minister here; and they are all telling us that it will not happen, that there will not be a huge movement of peoples, but of course there will.
There is a much better way of doing this.
We should have a proper, on-demand work permit scheme, especially for skilled workers.
We have got nothing against the peoples of eastern Europe wanting to get on, but we simply cannot have an open-door immigration policy.
The truth is, we cannot take the numbers.
It does not make sense, and if we carry on down this road, I am afraid there is going to be bad blood and bad feeling in many towns and cities across the UK.
Then we have the extraordinary role that is being played here by the rapporteur for Bulgaria, one Geoffrey Van Orden.
In Chelmsford he is a fierce Eurosceptic, our brave brigadier battling for Britain, the spirit of 1940, we can all sleep well in our beds!
But it is not quite the same here in Brussels, is it Geoffrey?
In Brussels, you are the Commission's man.
You have done the Commission's bidding, you have done everything you can to get Bulgaria into the European Union, and it will lead to a mass migration.
In fact, you resemble Alec Guinness in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, doing completely the wrong thing for what you think is the right reason.
I just hope that everybody that voted Conservative in eastern England - especially those that are about to lose their jobs - knows what you and your party have done in this place.
(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)
(DE) Mr President, it is a recurrent excitement to experience in person the different ways in which one can argue and thereby come to different conclusions.
I, too, albeit for quite different reasons, count myself among the opponents of this enlargement, being firmly convinced that you, Commissioner, as well as the decision-makers who in fact set all this in motion many years ago without the necessary transparency and democratic legitimacy, are opting for the wrong strategy.
The fact is that these over-hasty enlargement rounds will get us no nearer to a sustainable European Union or enable us to achieve the result about which we in this House talk ceaselessly and to which I - as a pro-European - continue to be committed.
Although we are told that the country from which I come is to be among the principal beneficiaries of the enlargements currently in progress, it has to be borne in mind that, over the last ten years, it has been only the top per cent of earners who have actually seen their incomes increase in real terms, while the top ten per cent have more or less been able to keep up and the whole of the middle class have been put to flight.
That has a great deal to do with the fact that - in parallel with the process to which Mr Farage referred - the other thing going on is outsourcing, which prevents the creation, in our various countries, of the social foundations on which a proper social model for a strong Europe might actually be built.
I believe, Commissioner, that history will judge you - you and those with you who will make the wrong decision tomorrow.
(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would now, just a few weeks before Romania and Bulgaria join us, like to congratulate those two countries.
They are welcome!
This has to do with overcoming the division of Europe; it is a victory of democracy and the rule of law over dictatorship, the victory of the democratic Europe over the past century's men of violence, over Hitler and Stalin, over Zhivkov and Ceausescu.
While it is in that context that we have to see it, the job must nevertheless be done in a properly craftsmanlike manner if it is to work.
That is why it is important to remember that there are such things as transitional rules on such things as, inter alia, the free movement of labour, involving the same process as was used in the other enlargement treaties.
Transitional rules of this kind do not constitute discrimination against the countries in question; they are always to the benefit of both parties.
That is the most normal thing in the world, and the safeguard clauses are an addition to them.
I am very grateful to the Commissioner for informing this House that these safeguard clauses will actually be applied in the areas stated, just as they already, in fact, are being applied in certain areas, such as milk and meat, and, should it become necessary in such areas as law and internal affairs or in the use to which funds are put, the safeguard clauses can - as the Commissioner said, be applied immediately.
We will take him at his word.
This, again, does not indicate mistrust of the two countries in question; on the contrary, it is a perfectly normal way of going about things.
It is for this reason that this House will implement the monitoring process that remains an option until three years after accession, and so I do not doubt that we will get it all together and form a strong European Union.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind the House that, following the accession of these two countries, the debate on the European Union's capacity for further enlargement will be of crucial importance.
It is a debate that we need to take seriously if we are to be able to complete the political project of enabling the EU to take effective action.
Mr President, today we are discussing the last reports by this House on Bulgaria and Romania.
Just three months before the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, we are welcoming another two members into the family.
We know that there are still some reforms to be completed, but I am convinced that both governments are determined to continue their efforts to satisfy the requirements described in these reports.
I would like to praise Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden for their outstanding work and thank them for the excellent cooperation we have had in respect of both reports over the last two and a half years.
I would like to add that I am very happy with the choice of Meglena Kuneva as Bulgarian Commissioner, and with her portfolio, which covers a very important policy area.
Allow me to make a specific point on the minority law issue in Romania.
It is very well known that this minority law today, almost two years on, is still pending between committees in the Romanian Parliament.
I expect the Romanian Government to keep its promise and hope that the law will be adopted very soon.
In conclusion, I should like to welcome the people of Bulgaria and Romania to a place in which they have always belonged.
Their accession marks the end of the artificial absence of our family and opens new horizons for the future.
(Applause)
author. - (FR) Mr President, I do not wish to adopt the view of those who are going to see the Romanian state from inside official cars with tinted windows.
I am therefore going to read you a letter chosen at random from among those we have received from children in Romanian orphanages who have not been able to find Romanian adoptive parents and who will therefore remain in these orphanages because of a lack of resources.
'Why', write Marianne, aged nine and a half, and Catalin, aged six and a half, 'do our father and mother not come to look for us?
We prefer to die than to go on waiting.
What is more, we no longer want to eat, since there is no point.'
I have half a dozen letters like that, which I shall not force you to listen to.
Why have I read this letter?
I have done so because there are two points of view.
I am among those - and, in this, I support Mr Moscovici's report - who say that a large majority is crucial if Romania and Bulgaria are to join the EU.
Their membership is something needed as part of Europe's destiny, and to argue otherwise makes no sense.
That being the case, let us wind down the tinted windows of our cars.
In view of the restrictions that crop up regularly in this report and that, moreover, the rapporteur himself has set out, together with compromise amendments, I would call for this report to be supported, including Article 16, which suggests that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs monitor developments in the situation concerning international adoption.
I also call on my fellow Members to support Amendments 1 and 2, which remind Romania - and, to some extent, the EU too, Commissioner - of its obligations under the United Nations Charter and the Hague Convention.
In spite of the restrictions to which I referred and which are there because of the vigilance we are exercising and the aid we are offering - in a family, one helps brothers and sisters in difficulty - I am delighted to see these countries finally come back within the EU fold after 70 years of isolation, 70 years in which we have looked on and been sympathetic but in which we have done nothing.
It is the Romanian people who have today won their freedom and their right to join us.
Mr President, first I should like to say that my group and I are in favour of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
However, I should like to focus on the specific problem of the situation of minorities, especially the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria.
At this moment there is a political party, OMO Ilinden Pirin, that has not been legalised by the Bulgarian state because several difficulties have hampered the process of legalisation.
We think that the opportunity to be represented and to organise political parties and associations is one of the main aspects of fulfilling democracy.
Respect for minorities is one of the main issues as regards fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria.
We have to put it forward, and we have to pay attention to this, not because we are against Bulgaria, but that is our point of view all around Europe in all the Member States and all the states with accession to Europe and all around the countries, because the rights of minorities have to be upheld according to these criteria.
(PL) Mr President, Bulgaria still has a great deal of difficult work to do. These areas include tackling corruption, organised crime and people trafficking, strengthening the role of the Ombudsman, improving conditions in children's homes and institutions for the disabled, recognising the rights of national minorities and creating a better climate for foreign investment.
It is important to recognise, however, the enormous effort that has been put in to meet the European Union's requirements concerning the economy, legislation and social standards.
None of these positive changes would ever have come about without the powerful incentive provided by the prospect of EU membership.
This allowed the implementation of difficult and often unpopular reforms that were nonetheless in the interest of Bulgarian society and of the Europe as a whole.
I am convinced that Bulgaria will not rest on its laurels after 1 January and that it will redouble its efforts to pursue its internal transformation, taking full advantage of the historic opportunity presented by its membership of the European Union.
I would like to bid our Bulgarian brothers and sisters a warm welcome to the European Union.
(HU) Mr President, I myself am a committed believer in and supporter of Romania's accession.
Many people have different views, however, partly because Romanian undertakings were not always in harmony with their fulfilment.
Allow me to give two examples.
Despite its undertakings, Romania continues to have no minority law.
It is also cause for concern that at the hearings of Leonard Orban, the future Commissioner-designate for Multiculturalism spoke specifically of Romania's multilingualism, while at the same time, two faculty members were dismissed from the University of Cluj/KolozsvÃ¡r, because they wished to honour the university's own commitments, that is, they put up Hungarian language signs in the buildings.
I do not wish that those who do not trust that the undertakings will be fulfilled should turn out to be right.
In addition to undertakings at the European level, we also need enforcement at the European level.
In order to become an EU Member State in the full sense, Romania must show respect, respect for the rights of the 1.5 million Hungarian minority and for their cultural and administrative autonomy, since problems have to be resolved at their origins.
Autonomy is needed in the life of the University of Cluj/KolozsvÃ¡r and in that of the Hungarian community as well, as the examples of South Tirol and Catalonia also demonstrate.
Moreover, I believe that Romania will honour the trust placed in it by our vote, and that its accession will open a new chapter in the history of both the European Union and Romania.
(EL) Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in welcoming the huge efforts made by Bulgaria and Romania to be ready to accede to the European Union on 1 January 2007.
We welcome these two countries into the European Union.
I wish, however, to highlight a particularly important institutional and political problem for the European Parliament: in paragraph 20 of the report on Bulgaria, the Council is called upon to view with flexibility and to make provision for a delay of about eight months to Bulgaria's obligation to close units 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy nuclear power station.
I wish to remind the House that in Article 30 of the Accession Act, which was ratified by the Member States and their national parliaments, express reference is made to Bulgaria's obligation to close the units by 31.12.2006.
I wish to welcome in particular the statement by the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which he truly undertakes to honour this obligation.
The problem is in the European Parliament.
The European Parliament is not respecting the democratic constitutional order of the Member States and decisions by the national parliaments.
That is why I and my honourable friend Daniel Cohn-Bendit together tabled an amendment changing paragraph 20 of the report on Bulgaria.
(DE) Mr President, I had the opportunity, as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, to lead a delegation to Romania, the object of which was to find out more about the use to which European funds are put.
Like the rest of the delegation, I got the impression that Romania is trying very hard to use the money it gets from the EU to the benefit of all of us.
Work is being done on dealing with corruption, they are cooperating in matters relating to the justice system and with OLAF too.
It is particularly heartening to see how European funds are being used to really reduce the suffering of many children, and that is splendid evidence of how well European funds can be used.
Problems arise only when - as sometimes happens - a country such as this one is deluged with too much money.
That is, of course, a problem for the Commission, and this is where we need to remind ourselves that we should be willing - as Mr Brok mentioned earlier - to actually make use of the safeguard clauses that we introduced for the sake of a well-ordered accession process.
I believe that Romania in particular, but Bulgaria as well, are - so far as we can judge - on the right track, and we should do our best to accompany them along it.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this multi-faceted debate on Bulgaria's and Romania's accession to the European Union.
It has been a long and demanding process for these countries, but, as has been said in many speeches here, and Commissioner Rehn also recognised Parliament's contribution in this matter, it is very important and significant that the institutions of the European Union have given these countries massive support during the accession process.
The reform process and the fulfilment of obligations resulting from EU membership are to continue in Romania and Bulgaria.
It has become evident that, because this will be a long and demanding task, there is always the danger that the reform process will flag from time to time.
That is why it is important that the support given by the institutions of the European Union, including Parliament, to these countries and the support for their programme of reforms continues.
At the same time, we have to ensure that the Council is also committed to the notion that if there is a need to invoke the safeguard clauses, we will not hesitate to do so.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for adopting a selection procedure for Members of the Commission from the new Member States which makes it possible for them to be in their jobs from 1 January, as they ought to be under the Accession Treaty.
The Council thinks that it is important that the Commission, as a college, is fully competent and functional from the first morning of enlargement.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to thank Members for this very constructive and substantive debate.
It is a very honourable way to welcome Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union in the spirit of evolving European democracy.
I want to use this last opportunity, at least this year, to discuss one or two issues, in particular concerning the Hungarian minority in Romania.
We attach great importance to the protection of minorities, multiculturalism and multilingualism, which are core principles of the European Union.
Over the years, the situation of the Hungarian minority in Romania has improved.
There is always room for further improvement as regards the treatment of minorities and this applies to the current and future Member States.
For instance, in Romania, we would welcome further progress concerning inter-ethnic relations within the police, among other things.
Some speakers raised the issue of the future of our enlargement policy.
We will debate this at the December part-session.
I just wish to point out to you that in its report of 8 November 2006, the Commission called for a new consensus on the EU's enlargement policy that would combine both the historic mission of extending the area of peace, freedom and democracy on our continent and, at the same time, ensuring our capacity to gradually integrate new members.
In my view, it is necessary that we start to intensify our work for institutional reform.
That is necessary for the functioning capacity of the current European Union and, at the same time, it will also prepare the enlarged Union in time for further steps in enlargement.
The Commission's view is that a new institutional settlement should be reached before the next candidate country joins the European Union.
That means we trust that, as the European Council outlined in June, the four Presidencies over the next two years - the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies, and the French Presidency in the second half of 2008 - along with our Member States, with the support of Parliament and the Commission, will be able to achieve a new interinstitutional settlement.
It is a simple fact of timing that the year 2008 comes before the end of the decade when the 28th Member State, which is likely to be Croatia, could be ready to join our Union, if it is able to reform its judiciary, economy and meet all the other conditions with full determination and concrete results.
I very warmly welcome the debate that is to take place in December on our enlargement strategy and integration capacity.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(HU) If we had to sum up in one sentence the Phare report by the European Court of Auditors, it would go something like this: the 806 million euro allocated to Romania from the available funding was largely a waste of money.
The results of the inspection by the Court of Auditors show that the projects were carried out, but the majority of them operate in a way that differs from the intended purposes, and in the majority of the projects audited, sustainability is simply not possible.
The 'technical errors' and 'shortcomings' listed in the report are unfortunately the source of no small irritation on the part of European investors.
The contracts are systematically misinterpreted by the Romanian parties, and therefore they make it impossible for EU investments to be completed on time and the expenses accounted for.
Delays in implementing the projects give rise to overtime and overtime costs, which the Romanian party is not prepared to pay for.
Meanwhile, the authorities are continually changing their decisions and the regulatory background, as well as the way these are interpreted.
I wonder who bears responsibility for the Romanian state having spent the money, but not in the way and for the purposes for which it was received?
In recent days, Hungarian language signs put up on the walls of the trilingual Babes-Bolyai University were taken down by the administration, and roughly broken up in front of the students.
I would like to know why, only days before Romania joins the European Union, one may not put up a 'No Smoking' sign in Hungarian?
It is my hope that one of the first acts of the Romanian Commissioner will be to call upon his country's authorities to restore linguistic freedom as soon as possible, as an indication to his commitment to the EU.
(HU) Mr President, colleagues, Romania's accession to the European Union can be considered a historically significant step forward, which brings fundamental changes that will have a beneficial effect on the country's population as well as on the development of the European Union.
In recent years Romania underwent very rapid development in both the economic and judicial spheres.
I believe, however, that the struggle against corruption and organised crime still exhibits serious delays: therefore tangible results are needed in the matter of human trafficking and in particular the trafficking of women.
The European Union today is not only an economic but also a social, political and cultural community, where the protection of fundamental human rights must receive explicit emphasis, as must the struggle against every form of intolerance, racism and discrimination.
Romania should devote attention more decisively to protecting the Roma and the Hungarian communities.
It is important to improve living conditions for the Roma minority, and to enable them to have access to jobs and appropriate resources.
I believe that only a policy of zero tolerance can be followed with regard to racism against the Roma, while greater efforts are needed in the area of equal access to high quality education and health care.
Protection of the Hungarian minority can be ensured only through measures harmonised with the principles of subsidiarity and self-government.
It would be important for Hungarian students in higher education to receive full financial support.
I welcome Romania's imminent accession to the European Union, and thereby the improvement of the situation of Hungarians living in that country.
We cannot allow that in the course of accession, economic interests should win out over human rights.
Economic and social consequences of restructuring in the automobile sector in Europe (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the economic and social consequences of restructuring in the automobile sector in Europe.
Member of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the restructuring plan announced in November by Volkswagen to the board of the company's Belgian division and to the press will have a major social and economic impact within and beyond the company.
Allow me to express, first of all, my very great concern about the consequences that this plan is likely to have for several thousand workers and their families, as well as for the company's economic and social environment.
Restructuring is sometimes necessary in order to ensure companies' competitiveness and survival and, in the last analysis, in order to preserve jobs.
I am aware of the need for Volkswagen, in common with many other European companies in the sector, to engage in restructuring.
It is important, however, to ensure that this process is well planned and well administered in order to minimise its economic and social costs.
That is why, in March 2005, the Commission adopted a communication entitled 'Restructuring and Employment', which set out the main features of a proactive strategy to which you have entirely subscribed, namely anticipation, partnership and the coordination of policies and instruments.
As soon as Volkswagen's management announced the restructuring, the Commission made every effort to mobilise the instruments at its disposal.
I met the members of the Belgian Government in order to convey to them our solidarity and to emphasise the importance of complying with the applicable rules under Community law, particularly the directives on informing and consulting the workers' representatives.
My colleague, Mrs HÃŒbner, and myself also made it known that the services of the Commission were available to make flexible use of the instruments of financial support, in particular the Structural Funds, in order to help workers affected by the restructuring.
The European Social Fund has shown in the past to what degree prompt and targeted action may help reintegrate into the labour market workers laid off following company restructuring.
The services of the Commission have been invited to participate in the crisis unit set up by the Belgian authorities. This will examine, among other aspects, the practical possibilities of using credits: either those remaining from the current programme expiring at the end of 2006 or those, constituting larger available funds, that will be available under the new programmes entering into force as from 2007.
In any case, I can convey to you the Commission's desire to be proactive and as flexible as possible regarding the use made of the European budget.
On 24 November, the Commission convened its 'restructuring' task force, founded in March 2005 when the 'Restructuring and Employment' communication was issued.
The purpose of the meeting was to mobilise all the instruments at its disposal in order to reduce the impact of the restructuring measures taken in conjunction with the Belgian authorities and to make developments in the automobile sector part of a future strategy in Europe.
The automobile sector is vital to Europe, accounting for 3% of European GDP and employing 12 million people. It makes a crucial contribution to research and development efforts and, each year, creates a trade surplus with the rest of the world of approximately EUR 25 billion.
In common with all other sectors of the economy, the automobile sector has to confront some profound changes.
It has nonetheless been able to adapt to the major developments with which it is faced.
The figures I have mentioned bear this out.
Irrespective of the specific case that concerns us today, restructuring in the automobile sector is, in general, part of a necessary effort at adaptation.
However, the Commission neither wants, nor is able, to assume the company's own obligations and responsibilities in the process of restructuring that has been undertaken.
I personally have written to the president of the Volkswagen group to inform him of our concerns and to ask him to do everything possible in order to minimise the economic and social costs of the restructuring that has been announced.
I reminded him of the need to ensure that the Community directives on informing and consulting workers are complied with throughout the Member States.
These Community documents specify the need to inform and consult appropriately placed workers' representatives in advance about any transfer of production and the redundancies involved.
It is crucial to ensure the quality of any information provision or useful consultation at the appropriate level, whether it be about economic decisions or the consequences of these in terms of employment.
I would also point out that, in 2003, in response to a Commission consultation on this subject, the European social partners jointly prepared guidelines for administering change and its social consequences.
These guidelines state that a positive attitude to change and the existence of high-quality social dialogue in a climate of confidence are important factors for preventing or limiting the harmful social consequences of restructuring.
The implementation of these guidelines is essential if we are to achieve Community objectives of anticipation and of support during periods of change.
That is why, in March 2005, the Commission again contacted the European social partners and asked them to devise efficient methods of developing these guidelines everywhere in Europe and of ensuring their application.
I intend shortly to meet the representatives of the social partners in order to consider with them the means of making faster and more effective progress along these lines.
To return to the case that has given rise to this debate, it is now important to make room for negotiation within the group that is being restructured.
There have recently been signs that the partners concerned - management and worker representatives - are committed to a serious debate on the industrial future of the various sites in Europe, as well as on the social measures to be put in place.
While maintaining its offer of support, the Commission intends to respect the autonomy of the social dialogue beginning within the group.
Within the limits of its competence, the Commission is taking initiatives and making available the resources available to it.
In the current circumstances, I hope for nothing other than the firm commitment of all the parties to move in this same direction.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to extend a warm welcome to the workers of Volkswagen Vorst, the suppliers and their representatives, who are present here in the gallery, and I should also like to express our genuine solidarity with them in these difficult times.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the past few days, rather flippant statements have been made to the effect that, in cases like these, politics is powerless, but I see that as rather prejudging the situation.
Politics can very much hold a grip on a number of important factors.
First of all, the national government is very much able, by means of reliable and good governance, to create scope for keeping the burden on labour, the premiums in this case, to an absolute minimum and thus protecting our industry's competitiveness.
Europe, too, should shoulder its share of responsibility.
Thousands of workers are losing their jobs, and we should at the very least learn from this.
This presents Europe, Commissioner, with a unique opportunity to show off its social side.
The common European market, while economic in nature, also requires a social dimension.
That much is clear.
So we must now do what we can to reinforce this social dimension in the short term.
First of all, by ensuring that the workers affected can rely on support from the new European Fund for globalisation without delay.
We, the Christian Democrats in this House, are 100% behind this objective of the Fund, and we are counting, Commissioner, on the Commission's loyal support in this.
What matters most is that every effort is made to ensure that the Fund can start on time.
Secondly, we must also bring about real worker participation, which will in any case involve the evaluation of the 1994 European Directive in which this is enshrined.
Commissioner, you have already made reference to the Commission communication of March last year.
Well, let us seize the social tragedy at VW Vorst to make the necessary changes to the directive.
I firmly believe in the future of the European automotive industry, but we must do everything we can - and this is how I would like to finish off - in order to produce energy-efficient and 100% environmentally friendly cars.
I hope that the Audi A1 will be such a car and that it will be produced at the Vorst plant, thereby guaranteeing its future, despite the dark clouds that are gathering above it now.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I have three brief points.
I am pleased to see that the Commission is looking to use the structural funds to help deal with the social implications of this dreadful development.
However, questions have been raised over whether the Globalisation Adjustment Fund can be used or not.
Well, I hope this week's news that Volkswagen is to build plants in both India and Russia will show that there are global considerations and that the fund will be used to intervene.
Second, I welcome news that production of the Audi A1 might move to the Forest plant to save some jobs, but the workforce has already been warned that such a move must involve a drop in labour costs.
I hope this does not turn out to be a cynical move by VW, taking away with one hand and giving back with another, but in the meantime dramatically driving down wages and terms and conditions.
VW should be aware that we will be watching developments very closely in the months ahead.
Finally, a question to the Commissioner.
If the directive creating a general framework on information and consultation and the European works council directives are in force and are being observed in Belgium, how can this news have come as a shock last week?
Unless the Commission assiduously ensures the application and enforcement of social laws, social Europe will fall into total disrepute, and citizens will quite rightly turn their backs on the EU.
I am glad to hear, Commissioner, that you are now taking action, but quite frankly it is a little late for the workers at Forest.
Finally, I hope that the PPE-DE Group is solidly behind the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
That is not what I have been hearing.
I hope we see full support in the vote two weeks from now.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, in the debate that we are having at present, it is important not to get everything mixed up and not to confuse all the various responsibilities.
Acting, as we are, at European Union level, we must demonstrate the resources available to us at this level in order to contribute to the best possible solution to problems of this kind, whether in the metalworking industry or in other branches of activity.
As you said, Commissioner, just now when you began to speak, there are two aspects.
On the one hand, there are the companies and, if we want employment at EU level to be maintained over time, we need successful companies.
On the other hand, there are the employees, who are in need of help.
Through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and very soon, I hope, the European Monetary Fund (EMF), the European Union has the resources to help every worker individually with re-training, returning to work or starting his or her own business.
This customised help provided by the European Union needs to be publicised by the media when you issue your communications so that our fellow Europeans might be fully aware of the action taken by the EU.
What is more, it is crucial, as you have said, to be able to respond promptly.
If a number of sectors of the automobile industry - at present, it is Volkswagen - need our funds, the important thing is to help the employees extremely swiftly so that the aid we offer is genuinely useful and enables them to find other jobs quickly.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the Volkswagen trade unionists in Parliament this afternoon told us that, although their first priority was to obtain an industrial plan from the motor manufacturer's management, they were also waiting for Europe to put an end to the social and fiscal competition between Member States that drags everyone down.
Almost ten years ago, the workers of Renault Vilvorde were telling us the same thing.
What has changed?
Mr Å pidla, I find what you are saying quite inadequate.
You talk about the autonomy of the social dialogue, but you are well aware that the employers are reluctant to engage in such a dialogue.
We have instruments available to us.
We need to strengthen the European Works Council Directive.
Parliament asked you to do this as long ago as March 2006.
It is also necessary to create a European legal framework that will enable European collective negotiations to take place at sectoral and group levels.
The Commission needs to exercise more control over state aid and Community funds so that they are not used for the purposes of relocation within the European Union - an eventuality already referred to in the Cottigny and Hutchinson report.
Finally, a number of taxation matters need to be harmonised - and I choose that word carefully - at European level.
It is not enough to discuss a common tax base for European companies. What is needed is a minimum European rate for company taxation.
Under these conditions, we might perhaps today - and, I hope, tomorrow - speak to the relevant workers in terms different from those we employed when we had to deal with the Renault case.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, to begin with, I should like to take this opportunity to greet a sizeable delegation in the visitors' gallery of workers from Volkswagen's Forest plant, officials from all the trade unions in the plant and representatives of subcontracting companies.
(Applause)
A large contingent from my group visited the occupied plant yesterday and engaged in lengthy talks with the workforce and union representatives.
What emerged from these talks?
The first and foremost requirement, Commissioner, is to save the jobs at that location.
The European Union is in a quandary for want of an industrial policy.
As Mr Jonckheer has reminded us, the crisis in the European car industry is nothing new. Vilvorde happened ten years ago, and since then other plants have been closed or threatened with closure.
What has been done in the fields of research and investment policy and in the pursuit of balanced regional development? What efforts have been made to ensure that workers are trained and jobs safeguarded, to develop the clean, reliable and affordable cars that are in demand today and to diversify the economic fabric and increase the number of secure, skilled and properly paid jobs?
The large manufacturing groups have been given their head in the name of sacrosanct free-market economics and unbridled competition.
The immediate duty of everyone, including the European Union, is therefore to act to save these jobs at the Forest plant, not only for the workforce of the Volkswagen group but also for the 8 000 employees of subcontracting businesses.
Mr Henin will pick up that point in a moment.
Secondly, if this mass mobilisation should fail, raising the issue of compensation, the Volkswagen group must be formally bound to meet its responsibilities to the full.
The trade-union leaders reminded us in detail of the long list of public aid in the form of diverse exemptions that have been granted in respect of this plant to a group which, incidentally, has seen its profits rise sharply over the past two years, at least sharply enough to enable it to announce yesterday that it planned to invest hundreds of millions in Asia.
In addition, it goes without saying that the European Union should contribute to the compensation.
At the heart of this affair, however, we see the need for structural changes in the economic strategy being pursued in the name of what the Commission calls a competitive Europe in a globalised economy, which, in plain words, means cutting wage costs, introducing flexible working conditions, creating 'shareholder value', in other words windfalls for shareholders, pitting workers against each other and using the threat of relocation to blackmail public authorities.
This takes us to the very core of the celebrated liberal Europe, from which more and more Europeans feel totally alienated, and with good reason.
Only a break with this line of approach can open the door to a socially responsible Europe and enable us to win back the trust of our fellow citizens.
Mr Barroso often makes the case for a Europe that gets results.
Europe in its present state delivers results such as this one at Volkswagen Forest.
We could do with more Europe, a trade unionist told us, but it is a different Europe that we need.
This demand will surely be expressed forcefully in the streets of Brussels on Saturday.
(Applause)
(NL) Mr President, with 4 000 workers laid off at Volkswagen in Vorst and at least another 2 000 jobs lost among the suppliers, these are truly dark times in my country for the affected workers and their families.
The initial response of the Belgian Government under Prime Minister Verhofstadt has been to do what it always does, for, when there are economic successes, they are quite happy to consider them as yet another feather in their political cap, but when there are problems or setbacks, then someone else is always to blame.
In a rather xenophobic reaction, Prime Minister Verhofstadt even blamed the Germans for pursuing a kind of 'own people first' policy, which is, in my politically correct country, about the worst accusation anyone can make - ignoring the fact that in Germany, 20 000 jobs are being lost and that we, with the social tragedy at Vorst, are actually experiencing the worst so far of an enormous crisis that is enveloping the European automobile industry.
Let us be honest; nobody has a miracle cure for the tragedy that is unfolding in Europe at the moment.
Before blaming others, though, our governments, and the Belgian Government in particular, should ask itself whether it has done everything in its power to rescue as many jobs as possible, today in Vorst, but previously at Renault in Vilvoorde, at DHL, Sabena and elsewhere.
Nearly eight years after my country gained a government that promised it would make this problem a priority, Belgium is still facing a wage handicap of some 10% compared to its neighbouring countries.
This wage imbalance is the result of the huge tax burden.
This is not the only cause, but it is one of the reasons why the Belgian Government is to blame. I do mean the Belgian Government, for Flanders has for some time now shown the political will to use a cocktail of economic measures to make our country attractive again for investors and thus to create employment.
We, too, are in favour of the efficient use of European funds in this area, but this is not a miracle cure, and the proposals that are being made for more European bureaucracy are, in my view, counterproductive.
It is high time we all realised that our material wealth and our employment will not persist for ever of their own accord, that international competition will only intensify and that we, by being more flexible, reducing costs and creating an employer-friendly climate, really have to fight for each and every job.
We must, above all, think about ways of improving the competitiveness of our businesses, also in respect of businesses from countries that enjoy hardly any, or no, social protection.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, relocations normally involve moving to countries where production costs are lower and employment laws are more flexible.
In this case the opposite has happened: production is relocating to a country where production costs are higher and employment law is stricter.
Everything suggests that this decision was not based on market rules, but most probably on power relations between the company and the trade unions.
We seem to be facing a new kind of factor that may influence future relocations, which I would term the relocation of trade union power.
This kind of relocation is always directed towards the centre, in the sense that it favours the strongest.
If this practice spreads, we shall be moving in a direction that clearly runs counter to the essential values of the European project, because the rules of the market are flouted, productivity is not stimulated, and the fundamental principles of solidarity and of regional and social cohesion are violated.
In view of such a practice, I fear for the future of the Volkswagen plant in Portugal.
If something similar happens there, it will force us to think seriously about how to prevent a mere interest group from imposing itself on the normal operation of market rules.
That is our responsibility.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think the political world can look on helplessly in the face of such tragedy.
It goes without saying that the social effects must be cushioned, and if the globalisation fund is not intended for this purpose, then I have lost the plot.
Needless to say, Commissioner Å pidla, the social dialogue must work, but it has not.
There is more to it for Socialists such as ourselves.
When companies merge, the Commission checks whether competition is not distorted, but it does not examine whether restructuring operations are done on the basis of objective and economic criteria.
It strikes me as more intelligent and more useful to have a Commissioner who guides restructuring operations in the right channels than to have one for multilingualism.
I would ask the House to back this idea.
I am delighted that the Belgian Government will be taking these ideas to the December Council.
Multinationals cannot get off scot-free.
They should be called to account.
(FR) Mr President, every passing day sees the automotive industry shed hundreds of jobs.
The multinationals are putting enormous pressure on their workers.
They presume to use the workforce as scapegoats, challenging their acquired rights and almost implying that they are wallowing in affluence.
The fact is that workers have never been more productive or less secure in their jobs at any time in the last fifty years.
Not for thirty years has their purchasing power been so low.
It is not the competitiveness of labour that is putting the car industry in trouble but movements of capital in search of maximum yields in the shortest possible time.
Car-manufacturing groups engage in blackmail to milk the areas where their plants are located, and once they have sucked local budgets dry they start to look for pastures new where the grass is greener.
It is high time this Parliament stopped confining itself to hollow rhetoric and took tough initiatives to defend Europe's industrial potential, to hit profiteers where their heart lies, namely in their wallets, and to guarantee employees the right to genuine job security and training. These are some of the aims underlying the charter that my group is advocating as the key to the defence and development of our automotive industry.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, what we are experiencing today in spectacular fashion, in this savage decision by Volkswagen with its tragic consequences, is ultimately no more than the submerged part of the iceberg that floats on the ocean of free enterprise and free competition, which have become the watchwords of this European Union.
Every day, in fact, hundreds of jobs disappear in the wake of relocations and of numerous restructuring measures, although these jobs, of course, are axed more discreetly.
And no parallel moves, or desperately few, are made to bolster the industrial and social policies that are trampled under foot on these occasions.
This Parliament, Commissioner, has recently adopted resolutions on both relocations and corporate restructuring.
When will the Commission and the Council have the decency at least to respond to these resolutions, to express at least a modicum of interest in them, which they have not yet done?
It is certainly important today to provide active, effective and pragmatic support to the victims of this new closure, but it is equally important to ensure that we move on tomorrow from words to action in this European Union, which will have to come to grips with this problem in a more resolute manner.
The Union has fallen victim to a policy it wished on itself.
(FR) Mr President, is it ludicrous to hold a debate without a resolution on Volkswagen today with one minute per speaker?
No, it is shameful.
What sort of tragedy has to occur before the Commission proceeds with the revision of the Works Council Directive, which it is still blocking?
Did you pay heed to the Hutchinson report on relocations?
Will you allow Volkswagen to benefit from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund?
No, the reason why the Volkswagen plant is threatened with closure is not that liberalism has been malfunctioning; it is because there is still no social regulation of the market in Europe today.
To the Right, which opposes any legislation in this domain, let me say that there will be a social Europe; it will be created in spite of everything; it will be forged in blood and tears, but it will be created.
I call today not only for a Commissioner for corporate restructuring measures but also for a Volkswagen Directive, for the sake of the entire Forest workforce and for all those who, in my region and in yours, ladies and gentlemen, are losing faith in Europe and in politics.
(FR) Mr President, the European social model, the Lisbon Strategy, a Social Europe: what meaning is left in these words, which are nothing but empty promises in the reddened eyes of Volkswagen employees and their families?
Precarious existences have become the norm, and pitting employees against each other has become a managerial strategy, like redundancies and unemployment.
An ever-growing number of workers accept life on the brink of the abyss because they have no alternative.
Europe was built on foundations of peace, but social strife is being fomented, with tragic consequences in terms of human distress, growing distrust of the European Union and an upsurge in support for extremist parties in every election.
Are we to allow 4 000 jobs to be axed with impunity on the doorstep of our institutions, and more than 10 000 people to be put out of work, by a group that has simultaneously been announcing plans to set up a plant in India?
European funds will have to be mobilised, including the new Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
We shall see to that, perhaps by tabling a Volkswagen amendment - why not?
It is high time workers were respected in Europe, in the European Parliament and on our doorstep.
Member of the Commission. (CS) Honourable Members, the case of the Volkswagen Forest is, of course, the kind of case that has accompanied market economics throughout its history.
I feel that if we want to guarantee employment, the Lisbon Strategy is the right way forward, because its core objectives are knowledge-based competitiveness and the creation of high-quality jobs.
I feel that this is the right strategy and we must implement it.
The question of how to respond effectively to the Volkswagen situation is a different matter.
It is clear that there are different responsibilities at company, local authority, national state and EU levels.
All of these capacities should be mobilised responsibly.
I am pleased that the EU institutions have responded rapidly, and, to my mind, effectively; they have provided their resources in such a way that their response has been both responsible and effective.
It is also clear that social dialogue has a major role to play.
I understand that social dialogue negotiations are ongoing, and that they have reached an important stage.
If Europe is to sustain an effective social dimension it is, obviously, vital that the legislation in force in this area be adhered to.
The Commission has therefore launched an inquiry into whether the directives concerned are being rigorously complied with.
I believe that this will genuinely help to resolve this matter.
Honourable Members, we have heard a broad range of ideas and suggestions developed from a number of different perspectives in this debate.
It is clear that we have obligations arising from our responsibilities, from the Treaty and from effective European construction.
I am sure that each case will open up a debate that may help to enhance the legal framework, and to change our processes and the way in which we respond, all of which is indicative of a functioning and thriving Europe.
I should like, if I may, to return to the beginning.
At this time we must mobilise the resources at our disposal, and at EU level, this is already under way.
The debate is closed.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(PT) The threat hanging over the 4 000 Volkswagen workers in Belgium shows that multinationals continue to act utterly irresponsibly, motivated solely by the desire to make ever-greater profits.
They are completely indifferent to the social hardship and regional development problems they cause through regarding their workers as mere numbers and as cogs in a machine that are only of interest for the profits they can generate.
This situation is an integral part of the process of international trade, liberalisation and labour market deregulation that the European Union supports and encourages.
The situation is the same as that affecting thousands of workers in Portugal, particularly at Opel/GM in Azambuja, Johnson Controls, Lear and so many other companies.
It is time to adopt measures to put an end to this situation once and for all and to guarantee firmer action to protect workers' rights.
These measures must also ensure that European works councils are fully involved in decision-making processes, including the right to stop dismissals and relocations, and that there is effective control over Community funds allocated to such multinationals, thus forcing them to comply with all their workers' rights.
Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Flautre and Mr McMillan-Scott, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide (European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights) C6-0206/2006.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, decision-making on the part of the Finnish Presidency with regard to the European Union's future financing instruments will soon be at an end.
In an excellent show of solidarity, we have dealt with the matter successfully and adopted the majority of the Regulations on the new financing instruments.
Although there have been a number of challenges, there has also been immense political will on the part of the European Parliament, the Member States and the Commission to reach agreement on the relevant issues.
One challenge still lies ahead, and that is the adoption of the Regulation establishing a European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR).
This is an important matter both for Parliament and the Member States, because it concerns the promotion of basic values as enshrined in the Treaty on European Union.
Parliament and its Members have specialist knowledge of democracy and human rights issues, which has been a help in endeavours to attain a good outcome.
The Regulation on a new human rights instrument to apply worldwide has been drafted to a very tight schedule.
As well as Parliament, the Member States too have had numerous proposals for its content.
It is a very positive sign that agreement has already been reached on almost all the issues in these negotiations.
The Council, for its part, has unanimously approved the compromise text to serve as a mandate for the Presidency to conduct talks with Parliament with a view to finding a solution.
It is the Presidency's aim to adopt the instrument at first reading.
The reason for this will be clear to everyone.
The current EIDHR expires in a few weeks' time, at the end of the year.
We do not want any major disruption in the European Union's support for democracy and human rights.
We are duty-bound to take a swift decision, not only because of the importance to us Europeans of human rights and democracy as values, but also because of the hopes and expectations made known to us by defenders of human rights and democracy in other countries.
The instruments have been drafted in such a way that they form a whole that is as viable as possible.
Democracy and human rights are also implemented by means of other instruments, and the EIDHR will act as an addition to this whole in special areas.
It is for this reason too that the adoption of the instrument is very much in order before the new financing period starts.
The Presidency of the Council strongly requests Parliament to reach a decision before the end of the year.
The package adopted by the Council contains a very large number of amendments to the text of the Regulation tabled by Parliament with regard both to priority areas for support and to Parliament's own position regarding the implementation of the Regulation.
A significant feature of the new Regulation is the recognition of the importance of work for democracy and, as part of that, the stronger emphasis on the work of parliaments and parliamentarians.
The essential basis of our work in third countries is our reliance on international human rights conventions and the rights and obligations written into them.
With the proposal for the Regulation, the conditions for players to be eligible for aid from the Union are being widened.
It is good that we are able to acknowledge the diversity of human rights and democracy and to make flexible use of various resources in different situations.
It would also seem that the instrument's financial resources will also be up slightly on the financing period now ending, so the inclusion of new players will not necessarily detract from the positions of the other players.
The main idea behind establishing the instrument has been that it will make possible support for the work of civil society players in particular, and permit support in situations where that takes place without the specific consent of the government of the country concerned.
It is important that this approach remains throughout, and that not too many forms of support for other players are added within the framework of the Regulation.
The conditions for eligibility for aid in the Council's compromise proposal have been widened in accordance with the European Parliament's suggestions to include parliamentary and political foundations.
Moreover, the draft Regulation will also allow for the eligibility of other players in special circumstances.
In my view, that is a well considered, workable solution which takes account of the hopes and objections of various EU players.
Parliament has been keen to highlight the special feature that aid which is granted within the framework of the instrument, mainly meant for civil society players as it is, can be given without the consent of the government of a third country.
There has been general consensus on this principle between the Council and Parliament right from the start.
I believe that we have also now succeeded in finding a way of citing this principle in a more precise and clear manner, given our obligations under the Treaty on European Union and international agreements and conventions.
The Presidency is prepared to propose the inclusion of the principle in the first introductory wording, if there is agreement on the content of the Regulation as a whole at first reading.
Parliament has also drawn attention to the importance of mentioning the rights of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees in a given country in the text of the Regulation.
The text will be based on international human rights conventions.
One might therefore consider incorporating this proposed area already.
The Presidency is nevertheless prepared to consider this addition too, if the Regulation can be adopted in its entirety at first reading.
The Council, for its own part, therefore, is ready to demonstrate even greater flexibility in order to find a solution before the year is out.
Flexibility on the part of all sides is a requirement for this.
In the European Parliament's committee report, it is proposed that political groups should be added to the list of those receiving support.
This probably means, inter alia, political parties; that is to say, there would be financial support for the work of parties also operating in third countries.
Democratic parties undeniably have an important role in the strengthening of democracy and human rights all over the world.
It is very important that the criteria for support given within the framework of this human rights instrument are clear and that they are grounded in human rights principles agreed internationally.
There will be nowhere near enough resources available under this instrument for general party support for all based on the same criteria, such as there is in many countries in Europe.
Selecting individual parties as beneficiaries would be a very hard task from the point of view of establishing clear criteria.
The choice would have to be made in such a way that no one would have the impression that party political views were taking the place of the democracy and human rights criteria when allocating aid.
It is also clear that an increase in the number of beneficiaries in this area might mean less support for others.
We have mainly tried to steer support in the direction of NGOs working on behalf of democracy and human rights in particular.
The Presidency's compromise proposal takes account of Parliament's suggestions to add independent party foundations and national, regional and international parliaments to the group of beneficiaries.
Article 9(2) of the Regulation also makes it possible to provide support in special cases to other groups not mentioned under this Article.
The wording is very close to what Parliament wants to see, and it is flexible, because it allows problems to be solved during the financing period.
For all these reasons, adding political groups to the text of the Regulation does not have the Council's approval.
This issue may jeopardise the chances of having the entire Regulation adopted at first reading, and that again would give rise to a situation where there would not be any legal basis for EU action on democracy and human rights for the time being.
Freezing all EU human rights and democracy aid to resolve this case would be a very harsh weapon.
The Council has gone a long way in order to comply with Parliament's wishes.
In order to achieve a solution, it is very important to incorporate and maintain the support of the Member States in this Regulation package.
I hope that Parliament will show flexibility, so that together we can achieve our main goal. Our main goal is for the European Union to be able to continue next year to aid action on democracy and human rights by means of the new instrument.
To ensure that this support can continue, it is vital to get a decision on the proposal for a regulation, and the sooner the better.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to keep it brief so as to allow this debate to come to an end.
This financing instrument truly is a massive keystone in this comprehensive reform of the Community's system of overseas aid, and it gives me great satisfaction to see that you have succeeded in coming up, within a relatively short period, with a common draft regulation on human rights and democracy.
I see this instrument as expressing, in an exemplary way, the European Union's unconditional commitment to democracy and human rights as fundamental factors in external relations.
It is because we in the Commission regard your House as the most important of partners that we unreservedly stand by our statement on democratic scrutiny and coherence of external actions and will maintain regular dialogue with your House.
In situations in which human rights and democracy are particularly at risk, and which call for rapid action on the part of the Community, I propose that talks should be called at short notice with a small group of MEPs representing the relevant committees of your House.
Following the Council Presidency's explanation just now of how it has conducted lengthy negotiations in this field, I would like to say that we regard the compromise proposal it has put together in the course of these as overall doing justice to the expectations made of this new financing instrument, and I would also like to emphasise that it certainly reflects many proposals from your House that the Commission unreservedly endorses, dealing as it does not only with the process of democratic reform, but also with the overall protection of human rights, and putting a greater emphasis on support and protection for human rights advocates, without, however, neglecting the victims of torture and abuse.
Moreover, it creates a specific basis for successful monitoring of elections - and for that I am very grateful - without making disproportionate demands on the funds available for this purpose.
I can do no other than welcome this instrument and the greater flexibility, newly rapid orientation and speedy responses that it makes possible.
We will, in this regard, give particular attention to making it possible for it to be drawn on not only by private individuals but also by incorporated and unincorporated associations, and will, in the cause of flexibility, use all means available on the basis of the Budget Regulation and the implementing regulations enacted by reference to it.
I can agree to your House's proposals for a more detailed discussion in the recitals of the support's particular character as independent of the consent of state offices, and also for the inclusion of a reference indicating that the instrument is to be regarded as covering the rights of migrants, asylum seekers and persons forcibly removed from one part of a state to another.
Unfortunately, though, I am unable, like the Council, to see any scope for the inclusion of political parties and political movements as the immediate beneficiaries of the financing granted.
As I see it, the Council Presidency and Parliament - supported by us in the Commission - have, following quite lengthy debate, come to a very good compromise in agreeing that national parliaments should be permitted to be recipients of foreign aid.
I regard that as objectively justified by the inclusion, among the objectives of the instrument, of the creation, promotion and reinforcement of participatory, representative and parliamentary democracy and the associated processes of democratisation.
I could well imagine the funding of foundations being one way of overcoming our difficulties as well.
So far, we have seen the most important thing as being that we, the Commission, should be able to be neutral and non-partisan where Community aid is concerned; that has put us at a great advantage, and one that we must maintain in future, for it is this that has secured the widespread acceptance and potential of our aid in third states, so that is something else from which we should not deviate.
co-rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the month of September my co-rapporteur and I have been negotiating with the Council and the Commission with a view to gaining acceptance for Parliament's position on the European financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide.
These negotiations have now been concluded, and, as has just been said, the Council adopted a common position last week based on a compromise text.
This draft, much of which we had previously introduced in the form of amendments, satisfies most of Parliament's requirements.
It stipulates that the use of the instrument does not depend on the consent of host governments.
It permits the funding of non-registered organisations.
It includes a flexible mechanism for the provision of direct support to human-rights activists who face imminent danger.
This new mechanism should greatly enhance the effectiveness of our measures for the protection of those who campaign for fundamental freedoms.
The compromise also contains an entire section devoted to the promotion of democratic principles, electoral processes and parliamentary democracy.
Political foundations, as well as national parliaments - an element introduced by our Parliament - are explicitly enumerated among the bodies that are eligible for support.
The section dealing with the protection of human rights also satisfies almost all of Parliament's wishes, the only exceptions being the desire for explicit reference to combating impunity and to conflict prevention.
On the other hand, the rights of people with disabilities, corporate social responsibility, combating violence against women and many other objectives have been included.
Parliament has also secured the establishment of an enhanced structured dialogue that will involve it in the formulation of strategic priorities.
We should have wanted it to feature in the body of the text, but the compromise arrangement is that parliamentary involvement is to be ensured through an exchange of letters.
As far as explicit reference to democratic political groups is concerned, the Council, as we have just heard, regards that as a no-go area.
It therefore proved impossible to include a reference to support for these groups.
Nevertheless, an element of flexibility was introduced to allow the funding of other players in duly substantiated cases.
In this way, political groups, though not explicitly mentioned, will be able to receive support in certain circumstances.
In conclusion, Mr President, let me emphasise the uniqueness of this instrument.
It is the only one that funds the projects of non-governmental players without the need for prior authorisation from their government.
It is also the only instrument that finances electoral observer missions.
This is why it would be neither useful nor responsible to delay its adoption, and hence the funding of these projects, in the vain hope of introducing an explicit reference to political groups.
Indeed, an obstinate attachment to that aim has already cost us dear at this stage, since it scuppered the deal struck with the Council on inclusion of the rights of immigrants and asylum-seekers.
For these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to support the compromise as negotiated with the Council.
co-rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Flautre for her very hard work and that of her staff in recent months in trying to bring this instrument to the point where we can adopt it by the end of this year.
I would also like to thank the Commission and its staff, and the Council, for their work.
Both the Council and the Commission have worked very hard to try and achieve some sort of compromise on this instrument.
I must say that, in general terms, the ambitions of the Chairman of the Human Rights Subcommittee, my co-rapporteur, have largely been met.
I think on the question of human rights promotion, which represents universal values accepted worldwide, we now have an instrument which has the capacity and the flexibility to work effectively, primarily through civil society, and to achieve the goals of the European Union in its Treaty obligations towards human rights worldwide.
There is, however, a deficiency.
As colleagues know, I was the original promoter and founding rapporteur of the European initiative back in 1992.
It was aimed at the transformation of the ex-Soviet bloc and it looked primarily at the democratic process.
In the world today we now face different challenges.
I have spent some time this year going to countries which are 'complex environments', to use the terminology of the United Nations: China, Cuba and Russia.
These are the challenges of today.
My question to Council and Commission - and since the Council has chosen to negotiate in public - is, why cannot we as a European Union avail ourselves of the same instruments that our Member State governments have given to the United Nations?
I regard this as a great puzzle.
During my recent visit to New York I spent some talk talking to the UNDP, which, in its handbook on dealing with political parties, says, 'yet we have seen that the absence of strong, accountable and competent political parties that can represent positions and negotiate change, weakens the democratic process'.
This is a parliament of political parties.
Democracy cannot exist without competing political forces.
So I just wonder whether the Council has lost its nerve.
Faced with the challenges that we see to our east and to our south, is it really satisfactory that the European Union should not have the same capacity to involve itself in the political process, to reform countries where there is no democracy, that we have given to the United Nations?
I believe that the European Union should put its democracy money where its mouth is and include in the instrument a reference to supporting democratic political groups.
That, in some countries, is the only way to effect change.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for their cooperation, which meant that the document presented to the Committee on Foreign Affairs already encompassed the Committee on Development's requests.
These requests are also found in the document drawn up by the Council, which I would like to thank for its work and for the flexibility demonstrated during the months of negotiation.
In particular, I welcome the instrument's local dimension, so that it can respond to the specific needs of areas in difficulty; the feature of the instrument whereby action can also be taken independently of the consent of governments and public authorities; the transparency of the procedures and their consistency with other European external policies; its scope, in other words prioritising civil society; the access even for non-registered actors; the protection of women and children, migrants and minorities; the access to information; and the actions supporting democratic processes, even if the final draft of the document is not entirely satisfactory.
I would like to comment briefly on the most controversial points: regarding the ceiling for electoral observation missions, I would have hoped for a stronger commitment from the Commission and the Council than an attached statement, but I hope that, after the comments made in this Chamber, this ceiling will be strictly respected.
On structured dialogue, I note that the Council and the Commission have shown little willingness to improve the procedures in this respect.
It is significant, however, that the Commission's letter is at least addressed not only to the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, but also to the Chairman of the Committee on Development, in accordance with the legal basis for the instrument (Article 179(1) of the Treaty) and with the Rules of Procedure of Parliament (Annex VI).
In relation to political actors, I appreciate Mr McMillan-Scott's concerns and, although my committee has not given an explicit opinion on the subject, I have no problem in supporting his request, where openings exist.
If this is not the case, I will consider with my colleagues, in the light of recent developments, whether it is appropriate to block the process after successful compromises have been reached, with great effort, on the key points, in order to succeed in concluding an agreement at first reading and to allow the instrument to be launched in January 2007.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to extend warm thanks to both rapporteurs, Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs Flautre, for the way in which they have adopted the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets.
There are two things that the Committee on Budgets regards as important: accountability and the financial framework 2007-2013.
EUR 1.103 million has been set aside for this instrument, and it is our committee's wish that this House should be able to monitor the way it is spent.
Secondly, Parliament's rights in this area must be protected, both in terms of consultation with it, and the implementation of policy which must, in accordance with the Commission's statement, be subject to sound democratic control.
We are therefore delighted that this proposal was adopted not only by the rapporteurs, but also by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
It is also very important to the Committee on Budgets that funds be made available from other significant instruments, for development, but also for partnerships with neighbouring countries and pre-accession.
If this happens, if this instrument is used in this way, I am convinced that we, when we discuss this programme in the Committee on Budgetary Control in five years' time, will be granting discharge in this area.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (ES) Mr President, we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality welcome all of Parliament's efforts to ensure that this specific instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights could be debated today in this House.
Within the important work of simplifying the instruments and procedures in the field of external action, we believe that it is very important that we have a tool with the main objective of supporting civil society, of supporting those who are working to achieve democracy and a better life for everybody.
Within this context, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress the role of women as key players in the defence of fundamental freedoms.
We in our committee have worked to ensure that this instrument supports objectives and measures to promote the rights of women and children, gender equality at international level and the fight against the discrimination suffered by billions of women on a daily basis.
We would see the approval of this Regulation at first reading, so that it can enter into operation in 2007, as good news, particularly in view of the fact that 2007 has officially been designated European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is good that we should be given this instrument.
It is only right and proper that we should defy the wills of autocrats and dictators and defend the cause of human rights and democracy, and hence also that of democratic political groupings in the countries concerned.
Just imagine us, as democrats, living in Eastern Europe before the Wall came down, and our clandestinely organised groups being denied aid from the West on the basis of this very argument!
After all, all we are trying to do is to give the Commission the greatest possible flexibility in practice, and those officials who are wary of granting aid to political groups that are not specifically named should be encouraged to do so if the actual circumstances make it necessary.
This is not primarily about party funding, so I would ask the Council not to restrict discussion to that.
We cannot, though, be non-partisan in countries such as Belarus, for we would, in fact, by standing aloof from all political parties, end up giving support to Lukashenko and his like.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, for millions of people who put themselves at risk in order to defend freedoms and human rights, what we are debating today is absolutely vital.
The European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights has above all been an achievement of this Parliament.
It has not been an easy achievement.
We have always argued that, if our foreign policy is genuinely going to incorporate the European Union's values, it must work expressly to promote the human rights that we all claim to defend.
Now we have it; we have a valuable tool for defenders of human rights and all actors working to promote democracy, fundamental freedoms and justice to use.
We now have our instrument.
It contains a sufficiently full definition of the actors that can benefit from it, as Mrs Flautre has explained. So much so that there should be no justification for a battle that delays the implementation of this instrument, frustrating many expectations and hopes.
We Socialists would also have preferred a clear inclusion of the concept of 'conflict prevention', because that is a prior condition for peace and democratic development.
Nevertheless, for the sake of agreement and because it is necessary for the proposal to be approved, we accept the consensus reached with the Commission and the Council.
My group will not therefore present any amendments.
I hope that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shows the same degree of responsibility.
We must not let the main protagonists in this instrument down.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, this instrument will be the means whereby the European Union will contribute to democracy and human rights worldwide.
I find the compromise we have reached satisfactory on the whole, because it has taken essential points into account, and our rapporteurs, as well as the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission, deserve all credit for this.
I am, for example, pleased that help can be given without the approval of third-country governments, and that parliamentary democracy is expressly mentioned, as, for that matter, are political pluralism and democratic political representation.
Finally, I am pleased to see reference being made to independent political organisations.
Without, of course, wishing to diminish the importance of human rights per se - quite the reverse, in fact - I would at the same time like to stress the crucial importance of political parties in every democratisation process.
In a democracy, elections are indispensable, but not enough.
If a democracy is to be sustainable, what is needed is effective, democratic political parties to ensure that a debate can be held not only among the parties, but also with the public.
All too often, parties only function as a vehicle in order that a certain person, clan or group can be put into power, or indeed be kept there.
This is, in fact, one of the main reasons why they are generally distrusted.
NGOs and civil society are not sufficient, however, to guarantee a political debate and control over governance.
This is why I should like to ask the Council and Commission to continue to make an effort so that support to democratic political groupings - in exceptional circumstances, of course - can be possible in future.
Mr President, let me begin by saying that it was this Parliament that insisted there should be a separate legal instrument for human rights and democracy.
It took a while to convince our friends and colleagues of that, but tonight's debate shows that it is a victory for Parliament, and the right decision was made.
On the key issues within the debate, I very much welcome what our Finnish Presidency colleague has said about this being a programme that delivers help without the consent of host governments.
To the Commissioner, I say I am very proud of the work that we do on electoral observation.
I think it is one of the most effective things we are involved with.
Our attempt to limit it is simply to say that it should not take money away from grassroots human rights projects.
Both are important.
My own amendments tabled included support for parliamentary democracy where it is being suppressed, making sure that spending under this instrument is additional and not at the expense of human rights work within the mainstream programmes, and to give specific reference in the scope to core labour standards and corporate social responsibility, to the human rights of people with disabilities, and to access to justice.
I should like to thank the co-rapporteurs for their support for these amendments, and the Council and the Commission for the flexibility they have shown as regards Parliament's amendments as a whole.
Tonight we have been debating the detail of legal texts.
In this House we understand how important that is to ensure the European Union is effective.
However, the main political message we should give is that just as this Parliament has established its own subcommittee on human rights, this Union is establishing an independent human rights and democracy instrument, because at the same time as the United Nations is elevating the status and role of human rights, so are we in the European Union, to help the victims of oppression, injustice and persecution, and those who defend them right around this world.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must make us proud to be part of the European Union when we see the action it has taken to promote democracy and human rights.
These common values make the Union one of the foremost players on the world stage in this domain.
In the context of this unending struggle, it was imperative to reform the old instrument in order to enhance its effectiveness.
Thanks to the pugnacity of the rapporteurs, Mrs Flautre and Mr McMillan-Scott, both of whom I congratulate, we have a draft here that truly moves things forward.
It befits the importance of this instrument that it should be ambitious, and there is no shortage of ambition in its references to immigrants' rights and in the scope it offers to bypass the need for host-government approval of measures in support of democracy and human rights.
I do regret, however, that the negotiations did not result in the extension of the instrument to cover conflict prevention.
Moreover, in spite of greater parliamentary involvement in the monitoring process, the Council's refusal to formalise relations between our two institutions in this field is a deficiency.
In conclusion, the effectiveness of this instrument will depend on its being regularly evaluated and on its revision, a process in which Parliament must play its full part, because I believe that Europe, armed with its values, is fighting here for a world free from fear.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the comments that have been made in this debate.
It has become very clear that it is in our mutual interest to reach decisions on this instrument so that the European Union's aid for democracy and human rights development can continue and grow as from next year.
Let me stress one last time that the compromise proposal in this discussion is an enabling one.
It will enable aid to be granted even to the political groups which Parliament considers so very important.
One last time, let me say seriously that I hope we reach a decision, and preferably quite soon.
As has been mentioned in the debate, this instrument is very much the result of the European Parliament's massive influence.
Its powerful role is in evidence in the text of this Regulation.
Ultimately, however, we also need to be prepared to make compromises on matters where the Member States and Parliament share the decision process. Otherwise, no decisions will be reached.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude not only for the debate but also for the many sessions of negotiation in which we have eventually arrived at a good compromise.
We have come a long way, and there was from the very outset a high degree of unanimity concerning both objectives and scope.
The scope was then, at your House's suggestion, considerably extended, and even more detailed stipulations made, particularly as regards consultation with national parliaments and new measures for human rights advocates, but what are termed ad hoc measures are still possible.
Turning to the political parties, I would like to say that it is quite explicitly envisaged in the scope of the regulation that support shall be given to political pluralism, to democratic political representation and to democratic reform processes at local, regional and national level, and, as has already been emphasised, explicit provision has also been made for the involvement of independent political foundations and parliamentary bodies as partners in the implementation of measures supporting the development of democracy.
It follows that it will be possible to implement the instrument for promoting democracy in a primarily political way, which, I think, is what we all want it to do.
That being so, let me say that this draft of a new regulation, which has been the subject of really intensive negotiations, deserves - or so I believe - your House's support.
By way of conclusion, let me once more point out that this is the last of the financial instruments with which we will have to deal today, and, as I think we have all managed to come up with good and sustainable solutions to the others, we should take care to ensure that the democracy and human rights instrument can be put into effect beginning on the due date of 1 January 2007, for we have tried to be as flexible as circumstances require.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be in December.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(ET) The development of civil society and democratic mechanisms throughout the world, and especially in the vicinity of the European Union, is of vital importance to the stability of Europe itself.
We must help to solve problems on the spot, instead of being overcome by the flood of political and economic refugees.
The opponents of civil society have taken advantage of the inflexibility of our bureaucracy, and have criticised the adherence to programme documents as if they were scripture.
Recently, the Russian authorities have robbed several international organisations of their legal basis.
In accordance with the present rules, we can no longer fund these organisations.
We face the same problem in separatist Trans-Dnistria, which is governed by a puppet regime which is a keen student of the Kremlin's methods.
The report draws the only possible conclusion - we must become more flexible.
We must be able to react quickly and appropriately and finance unforeseen measures and organisations which lack the approval of governments, if necessary even covering our tracks.
Such flexibility also presupposes good monitoring.
It is for that reason that I strongly support Parliament's greater involvement in monitoring.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.20 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
- (SL) Allow me, first of all, to extend a warm welcome to Romania and Bulgaria on their entry to the European Union.
I would, however, like to mention one of the conditions for the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union, namely the closure of the Kozloduj nuclear power plant.
Despite the modernised safety system and the positive safety assessment by the relevant European institutions, Bulgaria must close reactors 3 and 4 by the end of 2006.
Bulgaria exports electricity to all its neighbouring countries, and numerous Members of this House have repeatedly drawn attention to the enormous social, economic and environmental damage that would be caused, and to the problems that would ensue, in the form of an increased dependence on imports and of problems in obtaining a reliable energy supply, should both reactors be closed. Given the nature of the problem, I hope that the Council will react flexibly and make arrangements with the Bulgarian Government to defer the closure of both reactors.
At a time when we have been placing so much emphasis on the importance of competitiveness, safety and a sustainable energy supply, calls for the closure of Kozloduj are downright ridiculous.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some members of the World Trade Organization do not comply with fundamental social standards and use the violation of social rights to compete unfairly and to distort the rules of competition.
Besides the European Communication on promoting decent work for all, how is the Union using its influence in the WTO to ensure respect for the fundamental rights of workers in member countries?
There are 200 million children in paid employment in the world, 12 million people perform forced labour, more than two million employees die every year from the consequences of accidents at work or of occupational diseases, and 145 trade unionists were assassinated last year.
In the light of these facts, it is not surprising that globalisation frightens our fellow citizens.
Declaring good intentions is laudable, but it is not enough.
The time has come to penalise all countries that benefit from the opening of markets but refuse to comply with the International Labour Conventions.
Europe must organise itself and use its collective influence in the WTO to ensure that the requirements of the International Labour Organization are respected.
(LT) The European Parliament often discusses issues that are topical to all countries as well as issues that are only of interest to representatives of certain countries.
However, the European Parliament Press Service does not reflect this distinction, and the national press services attached to the European Parliament (like Lithuania's for example) state that they cannot designate issues in their summaries as priority issues if they have not been designated as such for the European Parliament Press Service.
Therefore, matters of importance to Lithuania, such as the Baltic Sea Strategy or relations with Russia, are not reflected in the Lithuanian press reports.
They are relegated to secondary importance.
I strongly request that the European Parliament Bureau looks into the activities of the European Parliament Press Service to ensure that attention is given not only to issues of general European interest, but also to issues of interest to individual countries, whose concerns are also discussed in Parliament.
(NL) Mr President, tomorrow, this House will be voting on a proposal to liberalise the European fireworks market, something desired by nobody in Europe except the fireworks industry, which obviously has a hand in both the Commission document and the report.
There are major discrepancies in fireworks legislation in European countries.
In my own country, the Netherlands, we have exercised extreme caution ever since a terrible disaster in a fireworks factory in Enschede.
We are not waiting for Europe to hand down to us a harmonisation proposal preventing us from imposing our own stricter fireworks requirements.
Since I take the view that public safety should always prevail over the profits made by the fireworks industry, I shall be advising everyone to vote against this report tomorrow.
(PL) Mr President, the draft report on alleged CIA detention centres on European territory was presented yesterday by Mr Fava.
In this report Poland is singled out as the only European Union Member State where such secret CIA detention centres could have been located.
No evidence is provided in support of this statement.
It is mere supposition.
This attempt to compromise a new Member State by accusing it of cooperating in torturing terrorists is nothing short of scandalous.
One might well wonder if this is not a punishment meted out to Poland by certain Member States of the Union because of Poland's close military cooperation with the United States.
It could be interpreted as an attempt to bring Poland back into line.
I should like to emphasise that we are paying undue attention to these allegations instead of putting more efforts into countering the terrorist threat in Europe.
Mr President, colleagues will recall last week's exhibition in Parliament showing the multilingual attainment of the BabeÅ-Bolyai University in Cluj, Romania.
A wholly regrettable incident cast serious doubts over the commitment of the university to genuine multilingualism.
In 2005, the university's senate passed a resolution that notices in the university should be displayed in all its three languages: Romanian, Hungarian and German.
Yet attempts to introduce Hungarian language notices in the university building last week were prevented by force, and those involved were sacked by the university on Monday.
There is a far-reaching contradiction here.
Either the university is indeed multilingual, meaning that it must accept the full equality of the Hungarian language, or it is not, in which case it should stop pretending that it is.
Mr President, in Ireland we are in the middle of a 16-day campaign to highlight the issue of domestic violence.
It is essential that domestic violence is confronted and the proper services put in place, because domestic violence destroys millions of lives - those of women, children and sometimes men - right across Europe.
Awareness-raising is the first step.
Yesterday I had the opportunity to launch an exhibition of artwork and poetry, run by the Donegal Women's Domestic Violence Service, with contributions from three local schools: St Columba's, the Vocational School and Loreto Convent in Letterkenny in north-west Ireland.
A related issue, and an important one for Ireland, is human trafficking.
I call on our Taoiseach, who was here in Parliament today, to ratify immediately both the Council of Europe Convention on Trafficking in Human Beings and the United Nations Protocol on Trafficking in Persons.
It has been assessed that Ireland is a transit and destination country for trafficking in women and children, and evidence suggests that organised criminal gangs are helping international traffickers establish trafficking routes in Ireland.
Mr President, I should like to pay tribute to my constituent, Mr Alexander Litvinenko.
Alexander was fearless in exposing the political gangsters that now run Russia, and the creatures of the KGB and FSB that still hold political office in Europe.
For his bravery, he paid the ultimate price.
In April, I made two speeches in this Parliament repeating allegations made to me by Alexander that Romano Prodi had been an agent of some kind of the KGB.
Alexander told me that the key figure to understanding Mr Prodi's alleged relationship with the KGB in the 1970s was a man named Sokolov, also known as Konopkine, who worked for TASS in Italy.
Since Alexander can no longer testify to this effect, as he was ready, willing and able to do, I am pleased to provide this service for him posthumously.
(PL) Mr President, Poland would like any decision on replacing our national currency with the euro to be taken on the basis of a referendum, as was the case in Sweden.
Pursuant to the 1994 Treaty on Accession laying down the conditions for the accession of Sweden, the Swedish authorities were required to replace the Swedish krona with the euro.
Nonetheless, a referendum on the issue was held in Sweden in 2003.
The result was a victory for those in favour of retaining the krona, so no action was taken to introduce the euro.
The people of Poland are also entitled to a say on an issue of such vital importance for them.
At present, as many as 36% of my fellow citizens consider that bringing in the euro would lead to price rises and lower living standards.
They feel that introduction of the euro would amount to a political experiment with dubious benefits.
We do not wish to hand Polish monetary policy over to the European Central Bank at Frankfurt.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion on raising consumer taxes on beer in yesterday's EU finance ministers' Council meeting does not only affect the Czech Republic.
Beer and alcohol taxation should be viewed in context.
We Czechs treat beer as an integral part of our national cuisine; beer has the same significance for us as fine wine does for the French.
Just as many of my French-speaking colleagues would not think of having lunch without a glass of red wine, our traditional Czech lunch without a half-litre of high-quality Czech beer would, for me, be unthinkable.
Yesterday's Czech veto on increasing consumer tax on beer should therefore be interpreted not only as a call for a comprehensive solution to the problem of taxation on alcoholic drinks but also as a call for all of Europe's problems to be addressed on the basis of equality.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we want to fight against the negative effects of alcohol, we should establish the same taxation arrangements for all alcoholic drinks.
If we want to revive European agriculture, we should reform the common agricultural policy and support all farmers equally.
If we want to fight against terrorism, we must make sure that all Member States participate equally in that fight.
(PL) Mr President, a year ago Russia imposed an embargo on certain Polish products of plant and animal origin.
This was one of the reasons why Poland blocked negotiations between the European Union and Russia on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which was the subject of today's debate.
Poland used its veto to defend its interests.
The veto was a test of European unity against Russia and an expression of a strong spirit of EU solidarity.
The European Union came through that test with flying colours.
It showed that it cared about the interests of individual Member States.
It was unfortunate, however, that it was only after the embargo had been in place for a year that Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission called on Russia to lift it, insisting that the ban on imports was unjustified.
The effect of the Polish veto was to put on hold discussion on a new agreement with Russia, a matter of great importance to the whole European Union.
The existing agreement dates back 10 years and is no longer relevant to current problems.
A new agreement is essential to developing a common trade and energy policy with Russia, which is vital for the whole European Union.
We can but hope that in future, the European Commission will help in resolving such unilateral bans imposed on Member States of the European Union by third countries as a matter of urgency, and that it will not be necessary to hold up key negotiations such as these, which involve common European Union policy towards Russia.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me, on the very day when we are facing the decision to slow down the negotiations for Turkey's accession to the European Union that we are greatly mistaken in telling our public that the reason for this slowing down is the Cyprus question - the details of which are probably known to one European citizen in 1 000, or one in 10 000.
The truth is that this Europe of ours is frightened and is riding the wave of fear of those who put illegal immigration, fundamentalism and terrorism on the same plane and try to exorcise these enemies as if they were outside our frontiers.
They thus use Turkey as a scapegoat.
These are fears that should not be indulged. Instead they should be vanquished by a European political leadership that is capable of offering us a grand dream: a noble vision of a Europe that is secular, tolerant, modern and courageous, and thus capable of opening up so as to conquer the external enemies and above all the enemies within that cause ever-increasing worry.
(PL) Mr President, Poland's refusal to sanction the Union's negotiating mandate on talks with Russia should not be understood as action against Russia, and certainly not as opposition to negotiating a sound partnership agreement with that country.
We were forced to take that position, and we were aware that it is best to prevent matters from reaching such a stage.
We would wish to avoid similar situations arising in the future. But I would appeal to the EU side, and in particular to the Council and to the Commission, and ask them to examine their consciences and review their response to this issue.
I personally approached at least three Commissioners, those responsible for trade, agriculture and food safety.
I raised the matter during plenary sittings, and also at the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I can confirm that there was a lack of cooperation between the relevant Directorates-General and Commissioners on the matter.
Should similar situations arise in the future, support and joint action by all Member States will be of vital importance, in combination with the stance adopted by European Union institutions.
Mr President, hard drug abuse is a worldwide disease for which there is no significant cure.
People suffering from this serious illness must get their daily drug dose irrespective of cost or danger to themselves.
They will steal, prostitute themselves or kill if necessary in order to obtain their required drug.
In satisfying their dependency, they are providing life support for the flourishing drug-trafficking criminals.
Many will die from the consequences of their addiction; others will suffer severe complications.
Our society has been trying to deal with this problem using expensive police methods, partly due to ignorance and partly due to desperation.
These methods have failed conclusively because drug addicts need the help of a doctor, not a policeman.
Recently, some courageous senior police officers, including a deputy chief constable in the UK, have called for a change in tactics.
They are right!
Let us consider taking the brave step of beginning to treat drug abuse victims by providing them with their required drug in a controlled medical environment, free of charge, free of complications, free of police and the law and free of crime.
Let us at last start treating them like patients, not criminals.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to say something about the transmission of our sittings.
I think it is intolerable, when this House meets together in plenary session, as it is doing now, when we have various things to discuss, such as - as we are about to do - the Seventh Research Framework Programme, that, for those who run this place, everything is more important than having this meeting transmitted via a proper system of cameras to the Internet and then to the media by way of the relevant interfaces.
I would be much obliged to you if you were to give your attention to this matter, which affects the work done in this House.
(LT) Events in the past few months in the area of European Union-Russian relations have shown that Europe is starting to recognise the reality.
The strategic partner with so-called 'common values' has already been downgraded to a pragmatic partner, and it will not be long before Iran, with all of its energy resources, is also recognised as Europe's pragmatic partner.
Support for terrorists will be no obstacle.
We have already accepted that Russia's 'sovereign' statutes allow its agents to go around killing enemies of the regime anywhere in the world.
We accept it when the Kremlin openly tells Europe that the values we cherish are artificial and warns against spreading the colonialism of European democracy.
We keep silent and hope for that price to gain an Energy Charter, even though Russia has repeatedly said that it will rewrite the document in its own way and force Europeans to back down.
Recently Poland tried to defend the principle of European solidarity, and the EU was displeased with that.
We pushed aside the energy problem raised by the Poles and talked only about meat.
Therefore, talk about a Constitutional consensus is futile while we have no consensus of solidarity in our minds and hearts, and while Russia can buy not only a gas pipeline, but also European politicians.
That concludes the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme of the EC and the EAEC (debate)
Member of the Commission. Mr President, Honourable Members, Minister LehtomÃ€ki, this evening and tomorrow at midday are important hours for Europe and European science.
With your vote tomorrow, you, the Members of this Parliament, will demonstrate that the Europe of research is alive and kicking.
We have worked hard together over the past year so that Europe's researchers can start working and making the best of the opportunities the new Framework Programme will offer them.
Together, we have succeeded in delivering a Framework Programme that meets the objectives we set at the very beginning: ambition and excellence, a good balance between continuity and novelty and a strong basis for simplified rules and procedures.
And, on top of this, we are delivering Framework Programme 7 on time.
We succeeded in doing this despite some difficult circumstances, such as a late agreement on the Financial Perspectives and a rich debate on delicate ethical issues.
We succeeded because we all share the strong conviction that cooperation in research lies at the heart of the successful knowledge society that we want Europe to be: a Europe that delivers growth and jobs and a good standard of living.
The timely adoption of the ambitious FP7 will send a strong message to the scientific community, to industry and to the public at large.
The message is: let us not lose time.
Let us work together and realise Europe's potential for excellence.
I would like to pay tribute to the Members who have made all this possible: the rapporteur for Framework Programme 7, Mr Buzek, the rapporteur for the Rules of Participation, Mr Busquin, and, for the part concerning Euratom, Ms Laperrouze; the rapporteurs for the seven Specific Programmes, Ms Riera Madurell for Cooperation, Ms Niebler and Mr Ehler for Ideas, Mr Pirilli for People, Mr Prodi for Capacities, Mr Guidoni for Euratom, Mr Hammerstein Mintz on the EC direct actions of the Joint Research Centre, Mr Caspary on the Euratom direct actions of the Joint Research Centre, and the long list of shadow rapporteurs and other Members who have been deeply involved.

Our cooperation has been greatly facilitated by the skilful chairmanship of Mr Chichester.
I learned a lot from him and would like to thank him.
I would also like to acknowledge the hard work and good company of all the presidencies involved in the adoption of the programmes.
I would especially like to thank the Finnish Presidency for its constructive role in the final phase of the process.
Our negotiations have produced a solid and broad consensus among the three institutions on the main aspects of the Framework Programme 7 package.
We have moved forward considering every single act as part of the same package, ensuring full political coherence within the overall package.
You are more than familiar with the Framework Programme 7 and its content.
I will therefore limit my remarks to some key issues.
First, Mr Buzek's report on the Framework Programme 7, second reading. A lot of work has gone into reaching a balanced agreement the three institutions can agree on.
I would like to express a heartfelt 'thank you' to the rapporteur for his openness and constant collaboration.
The Commission accepts all elements of the agreement reached following the tripartite meetings.
In particular, I would like to mention some of the most important issues on which we finally reached a proper balance.
Firstly, the mid-term review and future decisions on the European Research Council, the appointment of its members and its administrative costs.
The Commission has also issued a declaration on this.
Secondly, the strengthened focus on renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, to which more than half the energy priority budget will be devoted.
I am particularly satisfied with the level of attention to be paid to energy efficiency in all thematic priorities.
The Commission has also made a declaration on this.
Thirdly, the redistribution of the budget in favour of the Cooperation, Ideas and People programmes and, within the Cooperation budget, in favour of Health, Energy, Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities, and Security.
Fourthly, the approach for the release in two steps of the budget destined for the Risk Sharing Finance Facility.
On the issue of European Union funding for human embryonic stem cell research, I believe we have agreed a very responsible ethical framework for a research programme covering so many different countries.
It continues the ethical framework of Framework Programme 6, which has proved successful in practice.
The Commission has made an extensive declaration on this ethical framework, which will be published in the Official Journal as part of the Framework Programme 7 package.
The Commission will fully respect and strictly implement this declaration, which I consider to be an integral part of the agreement on Framework Programme 7.
Accordingly, the Commission will not fund projects that include research activities which destroy human embryos, including for the procurement of stem cells.
The exclusion of funding of this step of research will not prevent Community funding of subsequent steps involving human embryonic stem cells.
Even if Article 6(3) of the Decision on Framework Programme 7 refers to derivation, the Commission will not fund derivation that involves destroying a human embryo.
The agreement on ethics reflects a careful and responsible balance.
The Commission calls on the European Parliament not to jeopardise this balance by any further amendment.
I now come to the seven Specific Programmes, which set out the details of the two framework programmes for research.
To a large extent, the modifications of the Commission's proposals were concerned with transposing the provisions of the agreed Framework Programme into the Specific Programme texts.
Following these changes, the final draft Presidency texts on the Specific Programmes include a welcome mixture of Parliament's requests and the Council's own reflections, making these texts perfectly compatible with the Commission's position.
For the Specific Programme on Cooperation, Parliament's amendments being put to the vote are, generally speaking, coherent with the Framework Programme text and largely acceptable.
This is also thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Ms Riera Madurell.
It was not an easy task to deal with such a broad range of fields with important research challenges.
Let me just mention as an example of our strong cooperation the agreement reached on renewables and energy efficiency.
For the Ideas programme, the European Parliament's main concerns, as reflected in the amendments and discussed intensively during the tripartite meetings, have been taken into account.
Due consideration has been given, in particular, to: the ceiling on the administrative costs of the total budget; questions related to the management staff of the European Research Council; a clearly defined approach to the process of selection, term of office and renewal of the members of the Scientific Council; the reference to the review of ERC structures and mechanisms and the possibility of the Scientific Council appointing a Secretary-General.
Once more, thanks to the rapporteur Ms Niebler and to Mr Ehler for their constructive work.
For the People programme, the current Presidency text has taken on board a number of Parliament's amendments, which are fully acceptable to the Commission.
I would highlight in particular those that refer to the importance of encouraging youngsters to enter the research profession, of helping them with a more stable career path, and making full use of women's potential.
I offer all my thanks for the support given by the rapporteur, Mr Pirilli.
On the Capacities Specific Programme, let me highlight some of those amendments that really improved the Commission's original proposal.
I am referring, in particular, to those clarifying the role of RTD performers for activities under Research for the benefit of SMEs and the introduction of mechanisms for cooperation with national and regional R[amp]D support programmes.
Concerning research potential activities, the addition of the reference to the associated countries clarifies and emphasises the eligibility of entities from these countries to participate in the actions supported under this specific programme.
The constant and useful support received from the rapporteur, Mr Prodi, has been really appreciated.
On the EC Joint Research Centre Specific Programme, I am glad to see that Parliament supports the priorities of the JRC as indicated in the Specific Programme.
I agree with the majority of the amendments tabled, which are aimed at better defining the JRC mission in relation to its different activities.
In particular, I agree to the request regarding the role that the JRC could play in providing a sustainable energy reference system and information on the reliability of the energy supply for Europe, as well as on the availability of renewable energy resources.
Thank you for your excellent work, Mr Hammerstein Mintz.
Regarding the Euratom Specific Programme, the text is broadly acceptable with some minor exceptions.
Thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Guidoni, for his strong support for the Commission's proposal.
Let me open a parenthesis here just to say that the ITER project has been of paramount importance.
I must say that I feel fortunate to have been directly involved.
Last week, I had the honour of taking part in the ceremony in Paris and, as I said there, I am confident that 'hard winds grow strong trees'.
I also thought of you, Mr Busquin, at that moment.
On the Euratom Joint Research Centre Specific Programme, I am pleased to see that the European Parliament and the Council support the Commission's approach and that the proposed amendments improve the Commission Proposal.
And I share the request expressed by the Parliament that "in view of the threat of a loss of knowledge and a lack of new scientists and engineers in the area of nuclear technology,[...] the JRC will implement a programme aimed at retaining knowledge, ensuring that this knowledge is readily available, properly organised and well documented."
Once more, thanks for the support received from the rapporteur, Mr Caspary.
Let me now turn to the reports by Mr Busquin and Ms Laperrouze on the EC and Euratom rules for participation respectively.
The Commission is very grateful to the European Parliament and, in particular, to the rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and other Members of the ITRE Committee for their constructive attitude and strong commitment to reaching a good compromise with the Council, allowing the adoption of the EC Framework Programme 7 rules for participation at first reading.
This follows the welcome precedent established under Framework Programme 6 and I am confident that this cooperation will continue in the future.
The Euratom Rules will follow the same principles as those agreed for the EC Rules, taking into account the necessary adjustments due to the specificities of the Framework Programme 7 Euratom Framework Programme.
Concerning the Busquin and Laperrouze reports, the Commission can accept all elements of the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council.
There is no doubt that the final text provides for significant improvements to the original Commission proposal.
I would like to highlight the following elements of the agreement on the rules for participation.
Firstly, the coverage and calculation of indirect costs, in particular the flat rate introduced for non-profit public bodies, universities, research organisations and SMEs.
This flat rate is now fixed at 60% for the first three years (2007-2009) and thereafter the Commission shall establish a new flat rate reflecting an approximation of the real indirect costs of participants, but not lower than 40%.
You have been very persuasive in convincing both the Council and the Commission in this respect.
Secondly, the Participants' Guarantee Fund, which replaces collective financial responsibility, as it was known under FP6.
This fund will be established by the Commission and will serve as a basis for exempting from verification participants - with the exception of project coordinators - requesting less than EUR 500 000 for a project.
Moreover, no additional guarantee or security may be requested from participants or imposed on them, which will particularly help SMEs and other small users.
Thirdly, the evaluation criteria will be clearly established in the Framework Programme 7 rules.
Fourthly, there is the clarification regarding the financial statements, where the compromise agreed reflects Parliament and the Council's common goal of simplifying and limiting the number of certificates.
Fifthly, the 75% upper funding limit for security-related research in the case of the development of highly reliable capabilities has an impact on the security of European citizens and is aimed at a limited number of public users.
Parliament's wish has been fully satisfied in this respect.
Finally, there are the access rights for European affiliates established in a Member State or associated country, which they will enjoy if they are required to use their own foreground under the same conditions as the participant to which they are affiliated.
I reiterate my warmest thanks for your excellent work, Mr Busquin and Mrs Laperrouze.
Before concluding, I would like to come to a topic that concerns at least some of you, as indicated by the amendments tabled.
This concerns the participation of entities established in territories that are not internationally recognised.
I understand that the aim is to exclude legal entities operating in the territories occupied by Israel.
Since August 1996, Israel has been fully associated to the Framework Programme for Research and Development.
Israel's research bodies are today valued and active partners in the implementation of the Framework Programme.
The Commission has therefore recommended that the Council should renew the association agreement for the lifetime of Framework Programme 7.
The association agreements in combination with the rules for participation give legal entities established in Israel the same rights and obligations concerning participation and funding as a legal entity established in a Member State.
Only legal entities which are established within the internationally recognised territory of Israel can be considered as such legal entities under the text of the rules for participation before you.
Legal entities established in the occupied territories cannot be considered as Israeli legal entities as defined by the FP6 rules for participation and the Association Agreement.
The Commission will be very vigilant in this regard.
Let me conclude by saying that I have really appreciated these 19 months of intense work and friendly collaboration.
Many amendments have a special meaning for me, as they remind me of each of you, from Mr Liese's interest in children's disease to Ms Riera Madurell's and Ms GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines's strong support for cultural heritage; from Mr Prodi's strong defence of the European Technology Platforms to Mr Hammerstein Mintz's and Mr Turmes's attention to renewable energy sources, and Mr Busquin's strong support for the Guarantee Fund, to mention just a few.
I believe our cooperation bodes well for the implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme and for the continued development of ambitious research and innovation policies that Europe needs and deserves.
The debate today and the vote tomorrow herald the start of a new journey, one that I hope will see Europe cross frontiers and reach new horizons.
Researchers will know that the European institutions are there to support them on this journey.
Yes, this evening and tomorrow at midday are truly important hours for Europe and European science.
We can truly be proud of what we have achieved and of the direction of the scientific journey on which we have embarked together for a better life for all Europeans and for the whole of humanity.
(Applause)
Commissioner, I believe the sustained applause from this House at such a late hour reflects the depth of its satisfaction with the work of the Commission.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to mention that Mauri Pekkarinen, Minister for Trade and Industry, to whose field this Framework Programme belongs, will unfortunately not be here this evening owing to illness.
For that reason, it is my pleasure and honour to represent the Council in this debate myself.
On account of this illness, the Presidency will not have representation at ministerial level at tomorrow's press conference, but I am sure that it will go well.
The European Community's Seventh Research Framework Programme is one of the most important of the Community's measures to implement the Lisbon Strategy and improve European competitiveness.
The Community's measures for research and development are crucial if this goal is to be achieved.
The budget for the Framework Programme over seven years is more than EUR 50 billion.
That makes it the biggest Framework Programme ever in terms of budget and the longest-lasting one to boot.
The interinstitutional agreement on the Community's financial framework was approved last May.
As a result, we managed to bring to a successful conclusion the negotiations conducted by Parliament and the Council, even though the timetable was a tight one.
I do hope that we will keep to our ambitious timetable and conclude the legislative work for the Framework Programme by the end of the year.
In this connection, I wish to thank the European Parliament for this compromise, and especially the rapporteurs Jerzy Buzek and Philippe Busquin, Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy Giles Chichester, the shadow rapporteurs and numerous other Members who have been active in finding a common solution.
In particular, I also want to thank Commissioner PotoÄnik for his constructive input in taking the negotiations forward.
Finland, in its capacity as President of the Council, has been able to rely in its work on the results achieved by former presidencies, especially that of Austria.
The Commission's draft proposal on the Framework Programme contained numerous new ambitious initiatives, such as the European Research Council, joint technology initiatives and the Risk-sharing Finance Facility.
At times the negotiations were very difficult; for example, with regard to the initiatives mentioned.
The outcome of the talks had meant a lot of work, considerable flexibility, and a genuine desire for compromise on the part of Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
With this in mind, I would like to mention that the Council in its common position adopted Parliament's amendment to the principles that steer financing for stem cell research under the Framework Programme.
The Commission made a determined effort to find agreement, for which I want to thank the Commissioner.
To my mind, the result is an ambitious, though balanced Programme.
It provides an excellent basis for Community measures in the area of research and development for the next seven years.
One important aim of the Commission's proposal for the participation rules was to simplify participation.
In this connection, Parliament's dynamic role has made it a lot easier for all researchers to participate fully in the Framework Programme.
The Finnish Presidency is happy to see that there are packages of amendments to vote on, amendments that are based on the outcome of the trilogue negotiations.
I can confirm that these amendments have the approval of the Council.
I hope, however, that the outcome of negotiations will remain unchanged in view of the other amendments tabled.
I hope that Parliament will adopt the decisions on the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the participation rules relating to implementation in tomorrow's sitting.
That way, the objective shared by all the institutions, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to have the Framework Programme start right at the beginning of next year can become a reality.
This is also what Europe's scientific community is expecting of us.
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the vote on the Seventh Framework Programme will take place tomorrow.
Over the last 18 months, four Presidencies have worked on the programme, along with Parliament and the Commission.
Each Presidency's input was valuable but particular thanks are due to the Finnish Presidency.
As a result of excellent cooperation with the Council and of Commissioner PotoÄnik's remarkable personal commitment, for which I thank him, and also thanks to the technical support provided by the European Commission, a compromise acceptable to all was reached in October.
Commissioner, we would like to thank you very much for the statement on stem cell research.
This was very important to Parliament.
The compromise amendments were passed by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy without encountering any opposition.
I should like to praise the shadow rapporteurs for the tremendous sense of responsibility and spirit of cooperation they demonstrated throughout.
Thank you all.
In terms of both work and cooperation this has been a very busy time for me.
Thanks are due also to the coordinators and political advisers who oversaw the work, and to the eight parliamentary committees involved for their opinions.
Along with the Seventh Framework Programme we shall today be debating specific programmes and the principles of participation.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy coordinated the work on these documents in the European Parliament, and I must thank the committee very much for its work too.
Turning to the Seventh Framework Programme itself, I should like to highlight that Parliament has always approached it in a positive spirit.
We did, however, introduce a number of improvements including new partial solutions.
These are important to the Programme and were deemed beneficial by the Council and the European Commission, as evidenced by the compromise amendments.
The structure and main provisions of the Programme represent an excellent response by the Union to the recommendations made in the Kok and Marimon reports and to the European Parliament's proposals contained in the Locatelli report.
The Seventh Framework Programme will allow the goals of the Lisbon Strategy to be achieved in many ways.
Everything will be based on the criterion of excellence in research.
There are also new and interesting proposals, joint technological initiatives, drawing on the financial resources of European industry.
This is a decisive move towards an innovative Europe, and is in line with the activities of European Technology Platforms.
In addition, the European Parliament decided that research capacity in all the regions of Europe must be released if a genuine European research area is to be created.
As regards the chapter entitled 'Ideas', it contains a definition of the European Research Council.
This is a new undertaking designed to promote basic and high-level frontier research.
The European Parliament has laid great stress on the need for this to be a fully autonomous Council, for its activities to be clear and transparent and for its administrative costs to be kept low.
The next chapter is entitled 'People' and centres on scientists.
If Europe exploits its human potential to the full, and in particular if it supports young scientists starting their professional lives, Europe will be in a position to spread its wings and prevent a brain drain.
The development of European research infrastructure is a key issue.
It features in the chapter entitled 'Capacities'. SMEs are another priority.
In keeping with the Sixth Framework Programme, they are guaranteed a 15% share in research projects.
Additional fast-track procedures and special programmes have been set up too, aimed at small projects.
New technologies and innovation underpinned our amendments to this part of the Seventh Framework Programme as well.
Work on the legislation is almost complete, and we must now turn to implementation of the programme.
Simpler and more flexible procedures are a key issue, as is coordinating European programmes with national ones.
Fragmentation of European research must be avoided at all costs.
I am quietly confident that the Seventh Framework Programme will enable us to reawaken enthusiasm for the Lisbon Programme, and to overcome the well-known European paradox.
In conclusion, I would like to turn to my fellow Members of the European Parliament and assure them that following adoption of the compromise amendments negotiated with the Council, the text of the Seventh Framework Programme fully reflects the priorities of the first reading.
I therefore appeal for your support for these amendments, so that Parliament can speak in one voice about research, development, innovation and the future of Europe.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate in Parliament this evening on the Seventh Framework Programme and the prospect of its implementation is undoubtedly a moment for us to rejoice.
It is an auspicious moment for the scientific community in particular, because this is, after all, the third most important programme of the European Union and one that enables the scientific community to take on a European dimension and motivates it to strive for excellence.
Accordingly, one of our key aims is to avoid any lack of continuity from one programme to the next.
Thanks to the joint efforts of the Finnish Presidency, whose perseverance and high-quality work I commend, of the Commissioner and the relevant departments of the Commission and of Parliament, working together in an excellent spirit of cooperation and fully focused on the defined goals, we have reached the stage at which we can launch the Seventh Framework Programme within the desired time frame.
That is a crucial point.
The second point is somewhat less gratifying, for the funding earmarked for the programme is lower than we had hoped.
We cannot do anything about that.
As the Commissioner emphasised, the Financial Perspective initially delayed the discussion of the programme and then fell short of what Europe needs to satisfy its ambitions.
I shall repeat incessantly that tomorrow's Europe will be built on research and innovation.
It is talked about, it is discussed, but the Member States are still unwilling to align their policies with these aims.
It is certainly detrimental that the Framework Programme as proposed by the Commission has been cut by at least 25 to 30%, but, as we say in Belgium, 'Il faut faire avec' - one has to play along - which means trying to make the Framework Programme as effective as possible.
In this respect, I believe, as Mr Buzek said, that the Commission's proposal has been broadly accepted and that the improvements and amendments that have been made all point in the right direction.
For my part, I would still like to raise two matters.
The first is the European Research Council, which is clearly an essential innovation in the field of European policy.
It is indeed imperative that the scientific community should establish itself on a European scale and that the European scientific community itself should recognise the goal of excellence.
This will give Europe a far higher profile.
That is why we, along with Mrs Niebler and others, have devoted a great deal of attention to the way in which this European Research Council would operate.
Another point that seems to be crucial relates to joint technological initiatives.
This process, which is an extension of the technological platforms, is one of the keys to the competitiveness of European industry.
It will therefore be very important for the Council, the Commission and Parliament to be able to carry out joint technological initiatives quickly in certain fields.
Needless to say, it will not be possible for this to happen in every domain, but I believe the instrument is indispensable.
Commissioner, you are a greater diplomat than I, so let me congratulate you explicitly on having secured an agreement with the Council on the continuation of stem-cell research, particularly as regards supernumerary embryonic stem cells.
This is a balanced agreement.
It follows on from what was achieved under the Sixth Framework Programme but is also well underpinned by ethical safeguards.
The statement you have just made reassures the House that embryos will not be destroyed but that all the potential offered by stem cells, particularly spare embryonic stem cells, for the creation of tomorrow's scientific and medical knowledge will be preserved.
I therefore congratulate you on securing this agreement.
I should also like to point out to the House that we shall be voting on the specific programmes tomorrow too and that there are amendments on the table.
I know that the procedure is different in the case of the specific programmes, for which we only deliver an opinion.
Be that as it may, our votes on the specific programmes ought not to be inconsistent with the provisions adopted for the Framework Programme.
Mr Buzek rightly said that Parliament supports the compromise proposals.
Legitimate amendments have also been tabled by Members.
The strength of support in the Chamber varies between the specific programmes and the Framework Programme.
For the sake of the general coherence of the system, there must not be a divide between the specific programmes and the Framework Programme.
Let me move on to the rules of participation.
I shall be very brief, because you, Commissioner, have already highlighted the points that are new in relation to the proposal.
There is, however, one precept on which I believe we are in agreement.
The aim is simplification, and we have tried to develop things in that direction.
Nevertheless, I am afraid we must remain humble and modest, for although the need to simplify is restated every time, those who have most experience of framework programmes sadly observe each time that they are not yet perfect.
I am not sure that what we have done will be perfect.
That will depend in part on your vigilance but also on us.
We are here to help you to eliminate the constraints from other sources that complicate the process.
For example, we sought to guarantee the participation of small and medium-sized businesses.
This has not simply involved granting them up to 75% of total eligible costs; in the context of the guarantee fund, for example, they will not be required to submit to three-monthly audits to check whether they are eligible to participate.
These, then, are the practical consequences, but they depend on implementation, because there are sometimes overzealous people involved.
That is quite normal, but it can result in excesses.
You will therefore have to ensure proper implementation.
I am also thinking of the lowering of indirect costs to 60%.
It may well be argued that this figure is somewhat arbitrary and that indirect costs should be calculated as accurately as possible. This, incidentally, is why a distinction is made between the first three years and the other years, but such a figure was essential in order to involve universities and SMEs from all countries, because accounting systems differ widely.
Let me conclude by saying thank you very much for the work you have done, and thank you especially for making this Framework Programme possible, along with the rules of participation for the scientific community, through your capacity to engage in dialogue and through that of the Finnish Presidency, which has been excellent throughout this process.
Thank you again, and I believe that we shall be here in good numbers tomorrow to carry your proposals and our amended proposals without any problem.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work performed by my fellow rapporteurs and, more generally, by the three institutions to pave the way for the rapid adoption of this research package.
The Seventh Framework Programme is the key instrument for the creation of a European research area in which the aim is to devote 3% of GDP to research.
It must serve to make national research policies cross-pollinate and complement each other and to promote consistency between the priorities of the Member States and the main aims to be defined by the European Research Council.
In spite of a budget that is less substantial than the Commission and Parliament had hoped, this Framework Programme should be appreciated for its leverage.
In view of the need to overcome difficulties in accessing finance, particularly for SMEs, the introduction of a funding mechanism and of risk-sharing is a step in the right direction.
This mechanism must serve to increase the number of loans granted by the European Investment Bank and the financial institutions, to commit greater sums of money and to support riskier projects.
As far as the Euratom rules of participation for the Seventh Framework Programme are concerned, my strategy was to work in close collaboration with Mr Busquin, rapporteur on the rules governing the conventional Framework Research and Development Programme, in order to preserve the similarity between these two drafts and thereby benefit from the codecision procedure.
This is why the compromise amendments proposed to you are the fruit of discussions between the Commission, the Council and Parliament on Mr Busquin's report, adapted for the realm of nuclear energy.
Two amendments, however, diverge from the Council's position.
In fact, we wanted to specify, by means of Amendment 58, the selection and award criteria, such as scientific excellence, the ability to carry out the action successfully, relevance to the objectives of the specific programme, the critical mass of resources mobilised and the quality of the plan for the utilisation and dissemination of acquired knowledge.
May I also draw your attention to Amendment 88 of this report, for which some Members have requested a separate vote.
This amendment is not incompatible with the choice of Barcelona as the seat of the joint undertaking.
Indeed the location of the seat is firmly enshrined in Council Decision 2006/458, and we approve of the choice.
The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the other activities envisaged within the thematic area of fusion energy are implemented and managed separately from the joint undertaking so that the researchers can develop their creative potential.
This separation would thus serve to maintain the integrated approach and the close involvement of the fusion associations, particularly through the European Fusion Development Agreement.
This point was raised during the trialogues with the Commission and the Council on the rules of participation with a view to clearly defining the roles of each.
The aims of this report on the rules of participation are to provide European support for research activities in the field of atomic energy in the hope of undoing the technological locks in the nuclear domain and particularly of fulfilling the promise of fusion for future energy production.
I wish to express my very sincere thanks to Mr Busquin, who put his skills and experience at my disposal and who involved me in all the meetings at which the compromise amendments were negotiated with the Council and the Commission.
Let me now conclude my remarks with a few words on the specific programmes that I have monitored more closely on behalf of my group.
As far as the direct actions conducted by the Joint Research Centre are concerned, it is worth noting that the Centre's expertise has been extended into areas of considerable political and public interest, such as the development of alternatives to animal testing, social welfare, sustainable agriculture and protection of the environment.
In the realm of nuclear energy, we would like the Joint Research Centre to play a greater role in fostering public awareness and providing training.
It is also our wish that the Joint Research Centre should lend its expertise to the effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The specific programme on cooperation must help to address social, economic and environmental challenges by focusing on areas such as health, energy or the environment and climate change.
The lengthy catalogue of amendments tabled by the European Parliament is akin, in some people's eyes, to a shopping list, and its very length indicates above all that a great deal of research is expected.
Let us bear in mind the place and role of the European Union in the world but more especially in the lives of its people.
A successful Framework Programme would be proof that the European Union is moving forward.
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the People programme has found its way to this House after a year of dialogue, in-depth analysis and comparisons.
My professional and political experience has brought ideas that are largely shared.
They have been instilled into the programme and also incorporated in part into the body of the main legal instrument of Framework Programme 7.
I accordingly express my profound thanks to Mr Buzek.
The modern world moves at a very fast pace.
The twentieth century was turbulent and exciting: it spanned three epochs, from peasant society to the industrial and post-industrial era, and went even further in its final decade.
It was then that EU Heads of State or Government drew up their far-sighted recipe for the future.
Lisbon 2000 was a ten-year programme, this being the time envisaged for the construction in Europe of a society of knowledge based on research and innovation.
Today we must however take note that progress has been slow, although Framework Programme 6 has signalled a significant positive shift in European policy in this particular strategic sector.
It is a modest effort when compared with the colossal achievements of the emerging economies: in the past fifteen years investments in the research and development sector in China have risen from USD 12.4 to USD 84.6 billion, an increase of 580%.
Today China accounts for 12.5% of world trade and is the second largest world producer of advanced technological goods.
Then we have India and the countries of the Indo-Pacific basin, the third axis of the technical and scientific world; this axis accounts for 36% of the high-tech products of the whole world, which is exactly double what the whole of Europe produces.
Some analysts have reached a catastrophic conclusion, if this state of affairs is to continue: within twenty years, 90% of the world's scientists will live in an East Asian country.
Thus Europe is lagging behind, when compared to the huge amount - in some cases more than 10% of GDP - that is invested in research and development by those countries.
Europe is the prisoner of the selfishness of Member States, some of which even today invest less than 1%, while the average for Europe is less than 2% of GDP.
This, very briefly, is the overall picture while we are getting ready to launch Framework Programme 7 - for which the European Commission has rightly asked Member States to provide a more substantial financial input.
The People programme constitutes both the mind and the body of the entire legislative corpus: mens sana in corpore sano.
Hence the idea of motivating researchers so as to motivate research.
Framework Programme 7 will create the free, independent and motivated European researcher.
This is the direction in which we should be moving: from recognising the research profession to giving it legal status; from a code of practice to the creation of a data-bank for selecting and employing researchers; from aligning remuneration with the best international standards; from equal opportunities for men and women, through measures to protect female researchers, to reconciling the needs of the workplace with family life; from initiatives to support family mobility to the necessary social security and insurance provisions, harmonisation of tax regimes, recognition of professional titles across EU states, freedom of movement and independence.
These are the prerequisites for creating a European area of research and professional integration, given that after years of investment in training young researchers it is in our own interest to make the most of them.
