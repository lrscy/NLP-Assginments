The plenary has spoken.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.

Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on the natural disasters in the South of France and the regions âLanguedoc-Roussillonâ and âProvence-Alpes-CÃŽte d'Azurâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wishes above all to express its solidarity with the citizens affected by the flooding that has recently affected several parts of southern France.
Unfortunately, my colleague Michel Barnier has not been able to come to Strasbourg today.
As you know, this question of natural disasters was debated at length here in this very place on 1 September at the end of a scorching summer.
The Commission has been actively working on the question of natural disasters for the last few years in close cooperation with the European Parliament.
In the face of the seemingly increasing rate of disasters, two key words underlie the Commissionâs action: repair and prevention.
So far as repairs are concerned, it is a matter of solidarity.
Following the summer 2002 floods in Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany, on Michel Barnierâs initiative the Commission proposed the creation of the Solidarity Fund.
Thanks to the support of your Assembly and the Council, this new instrument has now been in operation for a year, and since its creation its mobilisation has been requested 14 times; it has been effective in eight cases.
At present, the Commission does not yet have sufficient information about the recent flooding in the South of France to be able to say whether it will be possible to mobilise the Fund.
In any case, we can only act if officially requested by the French national authorities.
If we receive such a request, we will examine it as quickly as possible.
Rest assured that we will take the situation in southern France into account in the review we will be presenting at the conference to be organised by the European Commission on 5 March 2004.
The purpose of that conference is in fact to review the use made of the Solidarity Fund by several regions of Europe.
I must also point out that the regions of Languedoc-Roussillon and Provence Alpes-CÃŽte dâAzur are already receiving a large amount of EU aid under Objective 2 of the Structural Funds.
For the period 2000-2006, this aid amounts to EUR 316 million for Languedoc-Roussillon and EUR 340Â million for Provence Alpes-CÃŽte dâAzur.
At the time of the floods that affected those regions in September 2002, specific measures were provided to repair the damage caused.
The mid-term review provides the opportunity to again put the emphasis on prevention or repair.
If, as seems likely, the regions in question receive money from the performance reserve and if the programmes in question perform well, that could provide around an extra 4% on top of their allocation, that is EUR 10.8 million for Languedoc-Roussillon and EUR 12.3 million for Provence Alpes-CÃŽte dâAzur.
The distribution will be proposed to the Commission by the French State before 31 December next.
Significant regional development measures may be financed.
Let me now turn to the second key word: we must not be content with repairs, we must also give priority to prevention.
These natural disasters raise the fundamental question of climate change and prevention, for which research is required.
I want to assure you of my commitment and that of Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and the Commission as a whole in this matter.
As Mr Barnier has recently told your Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, he intends proposing that a âprevention of natural risksâ line be included in every Structural Funds programme for a future programming period.
In like vein, the third report on economic and social cohesion, which will be adopted by the Commission early next year, will propose that risk prevention be made one of the objectives of the Structural Funds during the next programming period, after 2006.
The Commission is also thinking of strengthening European coordination of civil protection, including the formation of a common European civil defence force, an idea on which MrÂ Barnier is particularly keen and on which he is working closely with MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m.
This new initiative, which is to be unveiled early next year, would have to build on existing structures, giving them sufficient resources to act quickly and promptly in the event of a disaster of any kind.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, streets flooded, homes invaded by mud, damaged infrastructure, people in despair: must we become accustomed to these disaster images which are sadly repeated every year?
The seriousness of this sadly repeated flooding affects us deeply.
I would like here to express again our deepest sympathy to all the victims, but also our gratitude to the civil defence services and volunteers, who have shown extraordinary dedication.
We can only congratulate the rescue and European mutual assistance services on their good coordination, which was really effective.
Our Parliament was also very active in this respect in asking for that mutual assistance to be put in place.
Once again in this Chamber we are having to deal with natural disasters, the consequences of which could nevertheless be better contained.
Temporarily cleaning up, immediately reinstating the infrastructures, providing temporary accommodation, all that is only repair work.
But we know that repairs cost a lot more than prevention.
Prevention requires political courage, a command of urban planning and coherent regional development.
Prevention costs less than repair, but we still need to be able to call on the resources.
It is true, as you reminded us, Commissioner, that at European level using the Structural Funds is one good way of rebuilding dykes, strengthening them, of quite simply maintaining waterways, of making retention basins.
But there are two limits to this Structural Funds policy.
The first lies in the fact that the Structural Funds are currently subject to the zoning rule and do not therefore place all victims on an equal footing.
The second is that the amount available from these funds is not always sufficient.
You only have to look at my own region, the RhÃŽne-Alpes region, which unfortunately has not been mentioned today, even though it was severely affected at the same time as Provence-Alpes-CÃŽte d'Azur and Languedoc-Roussillon.
It was stricken recently, but will have no more Structural Funds to draw on for 2003-2006: it has all been spent.
I am now speaking to my parliamentary colleagues who are sometimes tempted to delete or reduce the regional policy budget.
I say to them: be careful, make no mistake.
This funding affects our fellow citizens very intimately, it is an expression of European solidarity, the foundation of the Union.
We must all back Commissioner Barnier in his proposal to overhaul the Structural Funds.
You said so yourself, Commissioner.
These funds should not be constrained by zoning in future but should serve precise objectives, one of which would be concerned with the environment and risk prevention.
Given the changes our planet is undergoing, we need collective courage to meet these ecological challenges.
I hope that the Commission as a whole will go along with Commissioner Barnierâs proposals and that our Parliament will be able to adopt the budget the Structural Funds need.
Meanwhile, we must carry out repairs with the suffering families in mind.
Europe created a Solidarity Fund for regions and states that have suffered natural disasters.
It must also pool the technologies for prevention, based on the successful experience of the Netherlands, for example, putting in place cross-border cooperation.
I hope, Mr President, Commissioner, that we will not have debates on natural disasters in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, my fellow Member has just said that she really does not want us in future to have to add our tears to the waters that regularly devastate our regions.
Unfortunately, I am much less optimistic than she is.
Much less optimistic because I know very well that you were making a wish, Mrs GrossetÃªte.
However, wishes are not enough when we see the climate change that is taking place on our planet.
I was in my region of Languedoc a few days ago and people told me that what we are seeing now did not used to happen once in a hundred years.
We have now seen it three times in two years.
It is therefore clear to see that there is a change of frequency, magnitude and scale.
I am always surprised to see the authorities, not just in my country, that would be too easy, but in all the countries affected, running a little bit behind the disaster.
This summer, in the regions that were affected in south eastern France, the locals were already piling up sandbags.
How was it that the local people knew, but the authorities did not act until disaster happened?
There is clearly a gap between those who are on the ground and suffer the destruction and the decision makers, who are obviously still far away from it.
With heat waves, storms and sudden floods, the climate is changing.
I do not have the impression that public policies are changing at the same rate.
I think a whole arsenal of measures need to be taken to deal with it, taxation in particular.
How many times have we, the Greens and regionalists, said in this House that the tax weapon really should be used to change behaviour that poses a threat to the climate?
And we are still waiting for that tax on pollution, that tax on discharges that change the atmosphere of our planet and which, in the end, are destroying entire regions.
Aids are in the process of changing.
I do understand, Commissioner, that we have indeed little by little, disaster after disaster, deployed finance for repairs and prevention.
Repairs are good, prevention is better, my fellow Members have said.
However, and I agree with them entirely on this point, prevention is inconceivable without a far-reaching reform of the Structural Funds.
So long as there is zoning it will be ineffective.
You must understand that storms and floods often care nothing for the zones we have so cleverly drawn on a map far away in Brussels or elsewhere.
So these funds definitely need to be reformed and perhaps all those Structural Funds that do not find any use on the ground but are paid back into Community and then national budgets could be better employed in prevention to meet this climate change.
In conclusion, I was saying that these problems have obviously changed in frequency and scale.
Even if European public policies are changing, which I note and welcome, I do not have the impression that they are changing at the same speed and to the same extent, and I regret that.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to pay tribute to the victims, their families and all who have lost everything, and to the extraordinary work done in the rescue operations by men and women, municipal employees, firefighters, police, military personnel and volunteers.
The provisional toll of this disaster is particularly high: 30 departments are affected, eight of them severely, in particular Bouches-du-RhÃŽne, Vaucluse and Gard.
So far as the population is concerned, seven people have died and 32Â 500 have been displaced or taken to safety.
We might wonder about the origin of these tragedies and their frequency.
Some will mention global warming or masses of hot air from the Mediterranean colliding with masses of cold air over my own region, Roussillon.
But what can we do about it?
Others will mention manâs mania for urbanisation, always wanting to build more at the expense of the countryside and indifferent to its population.
However, forecasters considered this bad weather exceptional because it combined a number of factors: its duration â almost four days â its geographical extent and its intensity.
I would like to highlight the unacceptable administrative inertia of the authorities in the face of the revelations made in the Lyon technical assistance officeâs November 2002 report.
That report in fact made a full diagnosis of the dangers of the river and recommended a number of measures to reduce the damage caused by any flooding.
But that study, to which many people contributed and which cost EUR 3.5 million, has remained a dead letter and failed to worry the authorities concerned, or at least to do so soon enough.
Once again this bad weather has demonstrated the passivity of men in the face of disasters which, remember, cost seven people their lives.
No notice was taken of the strong signal given more than a year ago highlighting the urgent need for a harmonious development of the rural environment taking the whole of the territory and its inhabitants into account.
The French Government has released EUR 24 million to repair the dykes of the RhÃŽne delta, which gave way at several points under the effect of the rising waters.
But that sum is already proving inadequate on the ground.
I hope that the European Unionâs Solidarity Fund, which was set up after the devastating floods of August 2002, will help, at European level, to provide swift and fair compensation for the victims and enable them to resume a normal life.
But for how long?
Some are making their third damage claims and doing their third clean up in the space of a few months.
I was interested in what the Commissioner outlined just now, in particular about using the Structural Funds, but I second what Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mr Onesta said regarding their limits.
Of course the damage must be repaired, but should we not be immediately starting major prevention works for this Mediterranean region that has been stricken regularly in recent years?
NÃ®mes, Vaison-la-Romaine, Aramon, Lezignanais, Narbonnais, Minervois, Rennes-les-Bains, Couiza, Estagel, Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque, and these days Arles, Marseille, Montpellier, eloquent names and images, unbearable tragedies, much damage and loss of life.
This is becoming unacceptable in an age of satellite warning and forecasting, surveillance radar, specialist services and, moreover, the massive mechanisation that ought to make protective works possible.
The Roman aqueduct at Ansignan, close to where I live, the better known pont du Gard and many other testimonies to human genius have withstood every assault.
How can it be that the structures of the last century are not sufficiently reliable?
It is no longer the time for words but for action, with the necessary resources, even if the scale of them should be exceptional.
A Europe that believes in solidarity must stop letting its citizens die for lack of precautions and prevention.
That, it seems to me, is a priority and a must.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, my region, Languedoc-Roussillon, Provence, the whole of southern France, is again stricken by floods.
It is true that we have benefited from the solidarity of German and Italian firemen, but the reality as I speak to you now, the reality there even now is that there are hundreds and hundreds of dead bulls and sheep that people are still unable to recover from the flooded pastures and farms.
The reality is that in many small villages, like Codole in Gard, 98% of the houses were destroyed seven days before Christmas, hundreds of families are homeless, with definite budgetary realities.
EUR 700Â 000 are needed for just one kilometre of dyke, EUR 150Â 000 in one small village to rebuild the roads, millions of euros to reconstruct public buildings, schools, multipurpose rooms, water treatment plants and sewer networks.
The reality in a small village is EUR 5Â 000 every day to feed the homeless, the security services, families, even the military who are on guard to prevent looting; it is at least EUR 40Â 000 to 80Â 000 for every damaged house, and there are thousands of them.
That is the most important of it.
What is to be done?
Who will pay?
From which budget?
Will it be the local authorities, the region, France or Europe?
In theory, Mr President, Commissioner, there are solidarity mechanisms.
There is even a solidarity principle in Article 2 of the treaty.
There are mechanisms on paper: the ERDF, Objective 2, the EAGGF guarantee which came into play for mad cow disease, direct advances for farmers that were used after the August 2002 floods, the 2000-2004 programme for civil defence and the new Solidarity Fund.
In this connection, we all know, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that the Fundâs strict eligibility criteria and the modest EUR 1 billion allocated to it, which, incidentally, has already been swallowed up by the fires in Portugal or the earthquakes in Italy, are leaving my compatriots of Languedoc-Roussillon very much alone as Christmas approaches.
If, in the case we are concerned with, we have seen the coming of the floods but not of the euros, we must at least work for the future.
First, by funding a real time information system, which does not exist since the mayors were not alerted.
In these days in which we are living we need an electronic computer system from Lyons to Arles that will allow all the rivers, dykes, canals, arms and tributaries of the RhÃŽne basin to be monitored in real time and the local elected representatives to be alerted in case of danger.
The province of Murcia in Spain has done it, Mr President; we ought to be able to.
The crux of the matter lies elsewhere, however.
Beyond prevention, reconstruction and compensation we must see that the floods of water mask the reality of a demographic flood.
The senior citizens of northern Europe, not to mention the executives of the Paris region, come and make their homes in Languedoc-Roussillon, in Provence and throughout the south of France.
Land is expropriated, the ground concreted over, 150Â 000 hectares of vines have flooded, and this is why, to cut a long story short, the area is swamped.
What is more, the Dutch, English, Belgian and northern active European seniors will become truly aged citizens and demand extensive health care infrastructures in our region.
To conclude, the overhaul of the Structural Funds must anticipate this territorial justice: if populations are transferred from north to south, the funding must be transferred as well, otherwise we will become the Palestinians of Europe, seeing colonies of senior citizens from Northern Europe settled among us.
We do not want to be a permanently devastated West Bank in the South of France!
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  . The South of France has just suffered an unprecedented natural disaster.
We are now beginning to assess the scale of the damage, which has been considerable.
Seven people have died and around 100Â 000 have been affected by the disaster.
Tens of thousands have been forced to shelter in gymnasiums or other makeshift accommodation.
In the town of Arles alone, a third of the population has been evacuated.
Thousands of jobs have disappeared under the water.
Hundreds of flooded businesses have had to close their doors, plunging their employees into the uncertainty of temporary unemployment.
The Camargue, with its fragile eco-system, is completely submerged:Â 250 km of dykes have been damaged, 560 hectares of farmland are under water, over 1000 animals have drowned, the entire rice sector has been destroyed.
Damage in the region has been put at more than EURÂ oneÂ billion.
Europe must show solidarity, in accordance with Article 2 of the regulation establishing the Solidarity Fund.
This is an unprecedented disaster, as the region has fallen victim to the River RhÃŽneâs âcentennial floodâ â the most serious for a century.
On behalf of the French Socialists, I ask the EU to make funds quickly available.
Those stricken in the RhÃŽne Delta expect nothing less.
Â Â  . Devastating floods have once again struck my region, Provence-Alpes-CÃŽte d'Azur, and Languedoc-Roussillon.
I should first like to express my utmost sympathy to the victims of these disasters.
Although the French Government has taken the necessary emergency steps and declared a state of emergency, we need European solidarity.
This has already been seen on the ground, and I wish to thank the German, Italian, Belgian and Czech teams that have gone to the aid of the victims.
Hopefully, European solidarity will also manifest itself in the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund. The French Government is in the process of preparing a request to this end, which will be submitted at the beginning of 2004.
My region has already benefited from such funds, following the storms and appalling floods of September 2002, and I can assure you that these funds are of enormous importance.
Whilst the Structural Funds enable the cofinancing of some preventative and aid measures, zoning and normal consumption of funds limit their scope.
They are thus insufficient to help the stricken populations and regions.
Nonetheless, I hope that the prevention of natural disasters will, in future, become an integral part of their aims: while we have a duty to repair the damage, the only real aid policy is prevention.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0547/2003) by Anne AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Georgia: presidential and parliamentary elections;
(B5-0550/2003) by Demetrio Volcic and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Georgia: presidential and parliamentary elections;
(B5-0554/2003) by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Georgia: presidential and parliamentary elections;
(B5-0556/2003) by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Georgia;
(B5-0560/2003) by Per Gahrton, Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin and Miquel Mayol i Raynal, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Georgia;
(B5-0566/2003) by Marielle De Sarnez, Bernd Posselt and Ursula Schleicher, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Georgia: presidential and parliamentary elections.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am a member of the Delegation to the EU-Armenia, EU-Azerbaijan and EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and I have visited Georgia.
My impression was that they are very good people.
It is a beautiful country, the food is excellent, the history is rich and the sense of humour is good.
We visited Stalin's birthplace and went to a huge museum.
Upstairs there is a circular room, at one end of which there are quotes about Stalin by contemporary world leaders.
They are in the Georgian language and the Georgian alphabet, so I had to ask the guide what Winston Churchill had said about Stalin of which they are so proud.
She replied that Winston Churchill had said that Stalin would be remembered by history.
I enjoyed that.
Georgia is also beset by troubles.
It has Russian interference â Russian soldiers, although they promised to leave.
There are separatist tendencies splitting the country â pulling it apart â and, above, all, there is deep corruption.
Money is made from kidnapping foreigners.
So the first step â the peaceful revolution they have undergone â was a wonderful first step, which this Parliament welcomes very strongly.
However, they have a long way to go, although we would like to help them.
They must eliminate corruption to create confidence for foreign investment, and that will create trade, jobs and prosperity.
In the long run, I for one do not see why they should not one day become members of our Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, our document calls on the European Union to give a commitment to making the Southern Caucasus at the forefront of promoting peace, stability and economic development.
Nevertheless, without constructive cooperation from both Russia and the United States, it will be difficult to find a solution that is not merely abstract.
The word âabstractâ seems appropriate for our document, which is indeed full of principles and high hopes, but does not give any indication as to whether these will one day be realised.
In todayâs resolution we hope, for example, that the elections of 4Â JanuaryÂ âÂ that is, in a few days timeÂ âÂ will include the peoples of the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia: two breakaway regions.
We are calling for this even though we know that it is a pipe dream, that it is a matter of principle, even though we do not know if this is something that can be called for or if it isÂ âÂ so to speakÂ â merely an extremely abstract statement.
Europe should, for example, call for a move towards authorising Russian identity documents for citizens of Abkhazia and now also for the third dissident region because, after the forced resignation of MrÂ Shevardnadze, a third dissident region is emerging, Ajaria.
After the fall of Shevardnadze, the Moscow meeting of the three regionsÂ âÂ I repeat, no longer two but threeÂ âÂ which to varying extents want to break away from Georgia, also increases the uncertainty.
Can the European Union use its instruments and diplomatic relations to discover the political intentions of the great powers, of the major players in the region?
The entire issue of the presence of foreign troops in the Southern Caucasus should find a forum in which it can be discussed.
We want to understand whether the control and presence of foreign troops serves to bring stability or if it spreads further uncertainties.
Calling on the Council and the Commission to organise, with the United Nations, the OSCE and the other actors, sending a mission to maintain peace in the region and to re-launch the peace process, is part of our desire for stability.
The process of break-up has, however, reached the point where it is difficult to envisage what type of coexistence could be established, especiallyÂ âÂ and I repeatÂ âÂ if there is no collaboration between the major powers.
Every effort must, however, be made, including those which seem somewhat abstract, in the hope of creating a starting point for the new governing group that has inherited a situation that is difficult from all points of view.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Russian Federation plays a crucial role in the future of the Republic of Georgia.
The specific obstacles in the tense relationship between Moscow and Tbilisi are sufficiently known.
Russiaâs maintenance of a military presence on Georgian territory and its protection of Georgian regions threaten to break the political unity of this Trans-Caucasian republic permanently.
The first obstacle is the international undertaking of 1999, by which the Kremlin committed itself to withdrawing its military presence from Georgia.
The second obstacle was highlighted once again at the end of November during the much-publicised consultation in Moscow between Russia and representatives of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Ajaria.
The present resolution makes a clear stand against the said violations of Georgiaâs national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
This House expects the same political clarity from the Council and Commission in the relations between the European Union and Russia.
Meanwhile, the interim government in Georgia has the mammoth task of getting their country back on the right track constitutionally speaking.
This also calls for attention on the part of the European Union.
Over the past few years, one and a half million of Georgiaâs inhabitants have been obliged to leave their country in a gigantic brain drain.
This centuries-old nation must surely have a prospect other than that of such a sad diaspora.
Â Â  MrÂ President, everyone shares the euphoria about the recent developments in Georgia: the storming of the parliament and the resignation of President Shevardnadze, who at one time enjoyed sustained acclaim.
After a long tradition of having been the first colony in tsarist Russia, and then having been the birthplace of Stalin, and finally EduardÂ Shevardnadze, there now comes democracy.
It is reminiscent of the Central Europe of previous years: Romania after Ceaucescu, or Serbia after Milosevic.
Many European countries will be inclined to think: this is a nearby region, a Christian region, together with Armenia, but at the same time a long way away from us, only accessible from the Black Sea, via Turkey or via Russia.
What relations could the European Union have in the future with that country?
In addition, MrÂ Belder has already drawn attention to the problem of its national minorities, and Abkhazia, in particular, has been a Georgian breakaway region for a long time now.
The inhabitants of South Ossetia are actually unhappy about being part of Georgia, and in Ajaria people are supporting a leader who would gladly have remained loyal to Eduard Shevardnadze.
A great many unresolved problems remain, therefore, and I think that, if a solution is not found to these internal problems, the democracy that is now able to get off the ground in Georgia will start at a disadvantage.
It is very important to work towards this, therefore.
In Amendment NoÂ 3, my group calls for the EU to ensure that its involvement, which is supposed to make a contribution to democracy, does not lead to interference in Georgiaâs domestic politics.
We do not believe that the purposes of democracy would be served by the European Union adopting the wrong attitude, putting too much emphasis on forcing together different population groups that have difficulty living together.
It will have to be a cautious process, one that is primarily based on the efforts of the peoples of Georgia themselves: the Georgians as the largest group, but also taking account of the three large national minorities.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, following the euphoria over the peaceful revolution that took place a few weeks ago, we are now preoccupied with a growing number of major concerns.
Firstly, there is the terrible economic situation.
We all know, partly from comparison with other countries, that if the situation remains as bad as this, if there is no prospect of an improvement in the economic situation, this will have a very negative impact on the chances of improving the functioning of democracy.
We all support this: that is laid down in our resolution.
We also know, however, that many peopleâs perspective is determined primarily by their economic situation, and that the confidence in parliamentary democracy â and that confidence is not so great in Georgia as it is â melts away if there is no improvement in the economic situation.
To put it bluntly: without food or heating, democracy soon becomes a luxury.
A situation such as this must be avoided at all costs, but it is a great danger, one that is threatening at the moment.
My second great concern is the role of Russia.
Of course, Mr Ivanov, the Foreign Minister, played a very positive role in the departure of MrÂ Shevardnadze, for which he deserves great credit.
At the same time, however, we know that the influence of Russia in Georgia is very bad in the long term from a structural point of view.
Firstly, there are the military bases, which Russia said years ago it was going to remove.
That did not happen, which is a very bad thing.
In recent years, of course, there has been Russiaâs support for the three separatist movements in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Ajaria.
That assistance is military, but the assistance is often much more subtle: making it easier for the people from the regions to travel to Russia or to adopt Russian citizenship, for example.
This has to stop.
In order to change the role of Russia, assistance is required from the European Union.
Georgia cannot do it alone.
One way is for us to offer mediation.
I am very much in favour of this: that is also laid down in the resolution.
If Europe can play a role in this, it must be sure to do so.
I am afraid that that will not suffice, however.
I think that it will also be up to us to exert pressure on Russia to put an end to the negative role it is playing in Georgia.
To be honest, the European Union is not good at this.
The example of Chechnya shows that we often handle Russia with kid gloves when it comes to their conduct in the northern Caucasus, and now likewise in the southern Caucasus.
This really has to stop.
Supporting the elections is a very good thing, but it is just a drop in the ocean.
Nor will our help in boosting the economy there suffice â which is also essential for the preservation of confidence in democracy â if, at the same time, we know that the great neighbour to the north, Russia, is very actively engaged in pulling the country apart into three pieces.
The European Union must play a pioneering role in order to prevent this: if possible, by convincing Russia; but if necessary, by seeking confrontation.
Â Â  Mr President, due to the dramatic developments in Georgia in recent weeks and the imminent presidential elections on 4 January, six groups in the European Parliament have tabled a motion for this urgent debate.
With their peaceful and thankfully bloodless revolution, the Georgian people have gained a hearing and all our respect.
That is convincing evidence that despite their grave economic plight, the people of Georgia are yearning for democracy.
There is now a chance for a new beginning.
Properly conducted elections are a prerequisite for stability and development in Georgia.
A great deal of time has been wasted since the transforming events of twelve years ago.
Surprisingly, Georgiaâs state coffers are almost empty.
Georgia has received financial assistance not only from the European Union but from many other parts of the world, but its people have gone away empty-handed.
The Georgian people have high expectations of their new President.
He must create a democratic order but also provide for the peopleâs basic needs.
I would like to thank the European Parliament for making it possible for our special delegation to travel to the elections.
In this way, we are also showing that in the European Parliament, we take the task of supporting peaceful development in Georgia very seriously.
At the Brussels Summit, the European Unionâs Heads of State or Government have just reaffirmed, yet again, the Unionâs determination to build a balanced and reciprocal strategic partnership with Russia, based on the values of the rule of law, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms and a free market economy.
The national governments and the European Parliament, however, must accept that this kind of strategic partnership is only possible with states that honour their pledges.
Russia has failed to fulfil the international commitments it made to Georgia in Istanbul in 1999 and by adopting this position, it has greatly obstructed democratic development in an already fragile region in the past.
I can only hope that Russia will in future support constructive negotiations in all parts of Georgia, as agreed in the OSCE accords in 1999, and will not further impede democratic development.
Russia plays a key role in Georgia and the entire Southern Caucasus.
We in the European Parliament must address this issue when we deliberate our relations with Russia.
However, our task now is to help Georgia overcome its crisis.
Â Â  Mr President, on the day after the Velvet Revolution that led to the resignation of President Shevardnadze, a new chapter is beginning in Georgia.
More than ever before, Georgia has the opportunity to turn towards the EU and strengthen the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Georgia is a strategic gateway to Central Asia, but we must make the Georgian people aware that their future should not merely consist of a choice between twoÂ influences, Russia or the US.
The recent political crisis is a strong signal from the people of Georgia, who have shown their determination to fight for democracy, while the financial and economic situation in the country is catastrophic and corruption is on the increase.
A few weeks ahead of the planned presidential elections, which are due to take place on 4 January 2004, the EU must offer effective political, financial and technical assistance to the new Georgian authorities, in order to help them to adopt the reforms needed to stabilise the situation in the country and to allow the forthcoming elections to take place peacefully.
It is also our duty to offer our help in at last finding a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
The countryâs financial and economic situation must also be subject to far-reaching reforms aimed at eliminating corruption.
The EU has already provided an overall financial aid package of around EUR 342Â million in the form of grants.
Now more than ever, the process of economic reform must continue to enjoy EU support, so as to restore an atmosphere that is conducive to foreign and local investment.
In conclusion, the EU must redouble its efforts to encourage democratic institutions and to support and promote independent media, through aid and development programmes, such as Tacis.
Georgia must be made aware that it can receive generous support from the EU, enabling it to recover some stability, in an atmosphere of democracy and transparency.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, do we really hold ourselves in such low esteem?
Is there anyone among us who does not believe that the round of enlargement covering the ten countries that are to join the EU next year is the main reason why, with regard to at least some of them, they are not sinking into totalitarianism or chaos, into a situation in which Georgia almost found itself?
I believe that this is really what Europe today is about.
Yes, we feel down, the Brussels summit did not turn out as we would have wished, but I believe that in historical terms enlargement has always been a success; it is proof that the EU has succeeded.
The problem facing Georgia today is no different.
Georgia used to be richer than most of the Soviet Union, whereas today it is the poorest region.
If six years ago we had offered Georgia the chance to join, it would undoubtedly be in the same situation as the countries that are soon to join the EU.
We must not follow Mr Meijerâs example.
He is not only doing a disservice to us, but also to MrÂ Shevardnadze, a man who has his faults, but who also achieved some good things, and who is certainly no Ceaucescu orÂ Milosevic.
The issue, Mrs De Sarnez, is not the alternative that we can offer to the potential choice faced by the Georgians between Russia and the US; what we can offer is a choice between membership of the EU and chaos.
This is what is at stake. It is not, Mr Volcic, a matter of nostalgia for a bipolar, US-Soviet world.
The challenge for us, the EU, is to create an alternative for these countries of the Transcaucasus.
So I hope that we have seen the last of the unspoken comments and an inability to think beyond the Black Sea.
The Council has never even considered the matter, as it said again yesterday evening.
Georgia must be placed immediately on the list of candidate countries, so as to afford it the opportunity, as we did with the Baltic States, and with the countries of Central Europe, to build a path to stability, development and democracy, by offering EU membership within eight to ten years.
Â Â  Mr President, an ancient Christian kingdom that had long repelled all invaders became a Russian colony.
Then after the First World War, Georgia enjoyed a brief period of independence during what we might term the âCaucasian Springâ, a fact that is generally forgotten.
It was brought to an end by Lenin, who failed to uphold his own principles of nationality.
Then a strong liberation movement emerged at the end of the Soviet era.
We should not forget that the liberation movement in the Soviet Union began very vigorously and very early in Georgia.
We ourselves have a great deal to thank Georgia for when it came to the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Then President Gamsakhurdia was murdered.
This was followed by civil unrest, the separatist movements and the Shevardnadze era, which has now come to an end â thankfully without bloodshed.
The country is now at a stage where it finally has a chance to establish a system genuinely rooted in freedom.
We must ensure that after many decades of foreign tutelage, the country has the opportunity at last to become what it once was in history, namely a genuinely independent and peaceful factor in a very important and very dangerous region.
That is why we must push to ensure that Russia upholds the binding commitments it made to the OSCE in 1999.
We often demand, very arrogantly, of small states that they honour commitments that have often been imposed upon them, so we must be rigorous in demanding that when a major power enters into such commitments voluntarily, it is scrupulous in upholding them.
Mrs Schleicher is quite right, in my view, to say that Russia cannot be our partner if it fails to fulfil its commitments on this key issue.
We see that there are other powers as well which, for geostrategic and energy reasons, are aspiring to establish a particular dominance in the region.
That is why it is our obligation, as Europeans, to stabilise Georgia as our partner, although I would not go as far as Mr Dupuis, who is demanding full membership.
Georgia is a country with a great European tradition.
It is our valued partner and it can be a beacon of freedom in an extremely dangerous region.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union is very satisfied by the peaceful outcome to the political changes that have occurred in Georgia, following the parliamentary elections on 2Â November and President Shevardnadzeâs resignation.
Georgia now has a unique opportunity to leave the past behind in order to build a better future for all its citizens, one that is founded upon a clear commitment to democracy, to the rule of law, and to the market economy.
One must not, however, underestimate the challenges it will face, but, in view of Georgiaâs commitment to reform, Commissioner Patten wanted me to assure your House of the EUâs willingness to do everything in its power to help Georgia meet these challenges.
The most immediate challenge facing Georgia comes in the form of the democratic presidential elections to be held on 4 January, to be followed later by parliamentary elections in accordance with the undertakings given to the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
The Commission intends to grant Georgia a package of at most EURÂ 2Â million to support preparations for these elections.
Georgia is also facing very serious difficulties with its budget.
The Commission has just directed that the sum of EURÂ 5Â million be paid under a fast-track procedure for a food safety programme in order to enable Georgia to meet its most urgent needs during the winter months.
Now that democratic elections have been held, the Commission will support the newly-elected president, who is determined to introduce reforms.
We have re-examined our strategy in relation to Georgia, which provides a sound basis on which the country may be helped to tackle the priority areas in which reforms are indispensable.
Action to combat the scourge of corruption will assume crucial importance for any programme of reform to bear lasting fruit.
The Commission will consider the means whereby substantial resources may be mobilised in support of such reforms.
I also want to stress that the Commission is already, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, providing aid to Georgia to help ensure that these are respected.
Alongside the Council of Europe, we are also working to strengthen local democracy and the machinery for protecting human rights.
We will, over the coming months, be giving consideration to whether or not we need to change what we are doing in the light of recent political changes in Georgia.
The European Union has for a long time demonstrated its support for Georgiaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The endeavour to resolve the conflicts that are rending the country asunder, bringing long-term stability to this region of the South Caucasus, and establishing good working relations, founded upon mutual respect, between Georgia and Russia, will play an important part in this.
For its part, the European Union is examining new ways of giving support that will resolve conflicts or prevent them arising in the first place.
The Commission will stand ready to support rehabilitation efforts in the aftermath of conflicts.
The Commission is, in close collaboration with the EUâs special representative for the South Caucasus, MrÂ Heikki Talvitie, making resolute efforts at devising a broader policy for the European Union in its relations with the South Caucasus region, in which process our efforts at providing support for Georgia are both a major element, and, at this present time, crucial.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0545/2003) by Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;
(B5-0551/2003) by Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;
(B5-0557/2003) by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli and Lucio Manisco, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;
(B5-0562/2003) by Patricia McKenna and Matti Wuori, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;
(B5-0567/2003) by Bernd Posselt and Ilkka Suominen, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines;
(B5-0569/2003) by Cristiana Muscardini and LuÃ­s QueirÃ³, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the end of the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines.
Â Â  Mr President, the situation which has inspired this Resolution today demonstrates that human rights and respect for life, as higher values, are never entirely enjoyed and we democrats throughout the world must be alert at all times.
Despite the fact that the death penalty has not reduced crime rates in any country, we are very concerned to see that 83 countries in the world continue to maintain and apply it.
Today we must regret and condemn the fact that President Arroyo has changed her position on the death penalty in the Philippines.
Furthermore, we must not forget that in the Philippines there are cases of minors who have been sentenced to death.
The European Union must draw certain red lines, which we must never cross.
One of them is precisely the death penalty.
The fact that a country such as the Philippines can backtrack on what was a victory by means of the moratorium, is of great concern to all us democrats in the world at the moment, and in particular the democrats in the European Union.
Therefore, in view of this situation, we have promoted this Resolution, which the Philippines authorities absolutely must take account of, so that we can continue to believe that it is possible that the values we have advocated as higher values are never jeopardised.
Today my group will vote in favour of this Resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the death penalty is an abomination. It is a mediaeval phenomenon that was used by governments that were unable to guard their prisoners and therefore killed them before they could escape.
In the present day, however, it is even worse; and the death penalty phenomenon is at its worst when it is used as a political instrument by governments against their opponents.
The Philippines has a past history that has been a constant source of violence, and those problems are still unresolved today.
This is clear even from the history of the past hundred years: the takeover of the Spanish colonies by the United States inÂ 1898, followed by a kind of self-determination inÂ 1946, and then the assumption of power by governments that ruled the population in a very dictatorial manner, notably the long-standing Marcos dictatorship.
Since then, there have only been weak governments.
There may have been changes of president, but with a powerful army in the background, and with no regard being paid to opponents, and still less to independence movements, movements that envisaged a future outside the Philippines or in a loose alliance with the other parts of the Philippines.
As a result, the Philippines is constantly beset by various forms of guerrilla warfare.
In the Philippines of today, the left wing may have a three-strong representation in parliament, but this is actually there semi-legally, whilst other parts of the same left wing are regarded as terrorist organisations.
Under these circumstances, the death penalty is a highly dangerous instrument in the hands of a government that refuses to listen to diverging opinions and stands in the way of alternative solutions.
Meanwhile, the succession of governments of the Philippines of recent times has never succeeded in solving the major problems of poverty, deprivation, oppression and violence.
Everything possible should be done, from both outside and within, to give the Philippines a peaceful and prosperous future, and that cannot be done by means of the death penalty.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with Mr Meijer on many points.
However, I am afraid it is rather simplistic to describe the death penalty as a relic of the Middle Ages.
I am afraid that the death penalty is quite specifically a feature of the modern age as well.
The guillotine and the electric chair are symbols of the modern age.
So that this phenomenon vanishes from the modern age, we must lobby actively for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, regardless of the individual or the state concerned.
We have great sympathy and understanding for the Philippines, a country which is more at threat from organised crime, separatism and terrorism than most other countries in the world.
On the other hand, however, we must make it quite clear that terrorism and violence can only be overcome through justice and the rule of law, and that the thousands of detainees and persons condemned to death in the Philippines have just as much of a right to life as anyone else.
We oppose the death penalty in every case â whether the person concerned is Saddam Hussein or the perpetrator of other serious crimes.
The same naturally applies to the detainees in the Philippines.
We must make one thing very clear.
No state has the right â other than in self-defence â to challenge any individualâs right to life.
For that reason, the EU opposes the death penalty as a matter of principle and has made this a criterion for accession.
However, we must also make it a benchmark against which we measure our partners.
We therefore send out a very clear appeal to the Philippines: a) to uphold the moratorium, b) to review the thousand or so trials, many of which are of dubious legality with miscarriages of justice and political caprice, and c) to abolish the death penalty in general, for it can play no part in enforcing the rule of law.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am very concerned about President Arroyoâs decision to give in to pressure and end an almost four-year moratorium, in spite of the fact that she is opposed on principle to taking human life.
This decision emphasises the crucial need for a UN moratorium on the death penalty, which would make it much more difficult to give in to pressure to begin carrying out executions again.
It would also put an end to the completely unacceptable executions of mentally handicapped people and of child abusers which take place in a good many countries and which will take place in the Philippines from January 2004.
The Philippines are of course only one of many places in the world in which there is a danger of being sentenced to death for non-violent offences. Others include Pakistan and China where, respectively, blasphemy and tax evasion are punishable by death.
Innocent people too are at risk.
In 2003, nine people were pardoned in the United States because they were innocent.
We have to accept that a countryâs penal system reflects traditions and special historical circumstances, but the death penalty involves denying a person his or her dignity.
The EUâs efforts to abolish the death penalty and introduce a universal moratorium must therefore be made clear and explicit to all the EUâs partners.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission views with extreme concern Mrs Arroyoâs decision to lift the moratorium on the death penalty in the Philippines.
The European Union is opposed to the death penalty under whatever circumstances, believing as it does in the inherent dignity of every human being and in the inviolability of the human person.
The European Union has therefore asked Mrs Arroyo to reconsider her decision to no longer stand in the way of executions, and has invited her to maintain the moratorium, which has been in force since March 2000.
In particular, we are also concerned about the Supreme Courtâs imposition of the death sentence on fifteen minors, which contravenes Article 6 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, supported by the Commission through specific actions.
In its May 2001 communication on the EUâs role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries, the Commission reaffirmed the priority it gives to the funding of projects seeking to abolish capital punishment.
In consequence it included the abolition of capital punishment among the thematic priorities of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for the period 2002-2004 and allocated a specific budget of EURÂ 12 million to action in this area for the period 2000-2004.
In faithfulness to our commitment, we contributed some EURÂ 500Â 000 to the campaign against the death penalty in the Philippines in 2002, as part of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
The Commission communication, âA new partnership with South-East Asiaâ, stipulates that all new bilateral accords concluded with countries in that region must include the âessential elementâ clause on human rights.
In this context, this âessential elementâ clause, which has capital punishment as one of its fundamental aspects, shall be given priority in any bilateral accord planned between the European Union and the Philippines.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0546/2003) by Ole Andreasen, Anne AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard and Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Moldova;
(B5-0555/2003) by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Moldova;
(B5-0558/2003) by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli and Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Moldova;
(B5-0559/2003) by Jan Marinus Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the political situation in Moldova;
(B5-0561/2003) by Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin and Elisabeth Schroedter, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the political situation in Moldova;
(B5-0568/2003) by Michael Gahler, Bernd Posselt, Lennart SacrÃ©deus and Charles Tannock, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Moldova.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that on seeing the iron curtain fall and the Soviet Union collapse, we were all convinced that a great opportunity had arisen for development, peace and progress throughout Central and Eastern Europe.
We convinced ourselves that this was the end of history, that we were facing a new dawn.
Perhaps one of the most tragic refutations of this hope is the case of Moldova, which is a perfect example of how history does not always take the direction its leading figures set out for it and is one of the worst examples of this in modern Europe.
It is an example of a country riven by ethnic conflict, with part of it being occupied by foreign military forces, with its economy in a state of total collapse, with mafias in control and with the countryâs inhabitants trying to leave the country by any means available.
We must not forget that, as of 2007, according to the official timetable for enlargement, the European Union will share a border with Moldova.
Consequently, and here I address my words directly to the Commissioner, Moldova must be seen not as an issue of minor importance, but as a priority for European diplomacy.
The current state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue, and this resolution must be seen as a loud wake-up call to all the institutions to pay Moldova the greatest attention and to attempt to find a solution to the current conflict, which is undermining the stability of that country and that of Central and Eastern Europe as a whole.
Â Â  MrÂ President, they were spectacular words that Commissioner Verheugen addressed to Moldova on 5Â December during his visit to Chisinau.
Among other things, he spoke of âEuropean perspectivesâ.
MrÂ Verheugen also announced a special EU action plan for Moldova by MayÂ 2004.
I sincerely hope that that will be primarily a practical support plan, which does not raise any false hopes in Chisinau.
Meanwhile, the Republic of Transnistria, which is not recognised by the international community, remains the political open wound in Moldova.
The politico-military role of the Russian Federation is evident here.
It constitutes the litmus test for the near future as to whether the European Union and Russia are really aspiring to common stability and security goals on our continent.
What was that we were saying about good neighbourly relations?
Transnistria, an urgent matter for the Council and the Commission in their relations with the Kremlin.
What was that we were saying about EU priorities?
Â Â  MrÂ President, the predominantly Romanian-speaking region that was previously known as Bessarabia and is now called Moldova was part of Romania between the two world wars, but belonged to Russia before and afterwards.
When the Soviet Union collapsed, the same national colours were chosen as those of the Romanian flag, and many thought about a return to Romania.
Since then, the country has been torn apart by diverging opinions on its political future.
Many within the two conflicting population groups support an old-fashioned kind of authoritarian communist, in whom they see their best chance of survival despite their low incomes.
That is the only thing they do agree on, however.
The minority who speak a Slavonic language, principally in the narrow strip of land on the eastern bank of the river Dniester, want to preserve the traditional strong bond with Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.
The Romanian-speaking majority in the rest of the country would probably have joined Romania long ago if that country did not lag so far behind western Europe.
The way that Romania is now, few consider joining that much larger country a matter of urgency.
Within Romania, too, endeavours to regain Moldova have become less urgent.
When I visited Romania last year, I even heard a Romanian member of parliament state proudly that Romania is the only country that is still adhering properly to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, which established the new western borders of the Soviet Union on the eve of the Second World War.
The European Union must be careful that it does not appoint itself guardian of that short-lived agreement between Stalin and Hitler for eternity.
The two conflicting population groups within Moldova once agreed to part company peacefully if the majority were to join Romania.
It would therefore be prudent to take account of the possibility of the river Dniester becoming the frontier between Romania and Ukraine again in the future.
That is another eventuality that we should keep in mind.
Â Â  Mr President, I do apologise, but I would ask you to ring very loudly, for most Members of the House are assuming that the vote will take place in an hourâs time at the earliest, and it will take some time for them to get here.
Last time, many people missed the vote because the bell was rung too late.
Â Â  I would communicate to Mr Posselt that we have given instructions that the bells in the House should work and let us hope that the Members stay alert.
The honourable Members know the rules.
Thank you very much for your positive information.
Â Â  Mr President, if we look at the demands and expectations that we have set out in our resolution on Moldova, we see just how archaic the country still is in terms of democracy and civil society standards.
Among other things, we expect the government to respect democratic principles, to uphold human and minority rights, to allow civil society and a parliamentary opposition to exercise their constitutional rights, and to curb human trafficking in general and trafficking in women and girls in particular.
These are demands that we made of other countries years ago, and they have already been fulfilled in many regions of Central and Eastern Europe.
It is apparent that in Moldova, these foundations of democracy and a market economy have still not been put in place.
The situation is further exacerbated by the status of the regime in Transnistria, which can only survive with Russian support.
Here too, as in Georgia â as we discussed in the previous debate â we see that Russia is not using its influence to stabilise, but unfortunately to destabilise the situation.
I really do wish that our governments would address this issue unequivocally, also in connection with Moldova, in their frequent contacts with Russia.
It is clear that economic and political stabilisation in Moldova can only be achieved if this conflict is resolved.
That cannot happen without Russia.
It is a damning indictment that Russia did not pull out its troops by the end of 2003, as it had pledged to do.
It does not contribute to a solution if Russia unilaterally submits a plan that simply entrenches the status quo.
That is why a peace plan must not only be announced but must actually be submitted in Moldova itself.
I would like to see the government and opposition working together on this issue.
As the EU, we must make our contribution to ensuring, for example, that an OSCE mandate, which has been discussed here, can be achieved.
I believe that we should stress yet again that multilateral solutions are important in this context, and we must call on Russia, Ukraine and Romania to refrain from taking unilateral steps.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, as a Christian Democrat and Swedish Member of the European Parliament, I am very pleased that the issue of Moldova has been addressed again.
Moldova has not succeeded in stabilising its democratic development following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
As Commissioner Busquin is very well aware, the language issue and cultural identity are sources of division for the Moldovan people as a whole. The issue concerns the place of the Romanian language and of the national Moldovan movement in society, as opposed to that of the Russian language and of leanings towards Russia and the east.
We European and Swedish Christian Democrats wish to express our support for the opposition in Moldova, which is led by the Christian Democratic Party under Iurie Rosca.
We call upon them openly to stand up for a European, democratic and pluralist direction for Moldovan society on the basis of the common values upon which the European Union ultimately rests.
What this resolution says about Moldovan democracy not having been stabilised is perfectly true.
The situation in Transnistria, which is in practice a breakaway republic, does not make the situation any easier.
I believe that the Commission and the European Council should take action to strengthen cultural development in Moldova, so that the country might acquire an independence in which its own language, Moldovan, is given its rightful place.
The mass demonstrations conducted in Chisinau in recent years show that the country must be given every support in developing into a pluralist democracy in which the opposition is not suppressed by the countryâs Communist leadership.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union has for a long time been concerned about the Transnistria problem.
In the statement made at the recent Maastricht ministerial summit of the OSCE, with which the Commission is in full agreement, the Presidency of the European Union reaffirmed our commitment to guard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldavia, for which it confirmed its full and entire support in the context of the five-party negotiations between the OSCE, the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and the two parties concerned.
The European Union regards this framework as constituting a transparent space appropriate to the search for a political solution to the conflict.
At Maastricht, the European Union made clear its disappointment at Russiaâs failure to make any progress in respect of its undertaking, made at Istanbul in 1999, to withdraw its troops and munitions from Transnistria.
Considering that only a truly multinational commitment would enjoy international legitimacy, the European Union invited Russia to honour its commitments, and reiterated its willingness to help find a multinational solution under the aegis of the OSCE.
The European Union is also taking tangible action towards resolving the conflict.
The Commission is joining with Moldavia in putting the finishing touches to an accord drawn up to create a system of dual control over Moldaviaâs exports of steel to the EU, a system that will give Moldavia greater control over exports originating from the breakaway region.
The Commission is also encouraging Moldavia to improve the control of its borders and of its customs area; in March 2003, it organised an initial meeting between Moldavia and the Ukraine at which plans were made to institute joint controls along the two countriesâ shared borders and to discuss bilateral issues.
A second meeting will be held in January 2004.
The Wider Europe-New Neighbourhood initiative offers new prospects of enabling Moldavia to enjoy the stability, security and prosperity that we have brought about within the enlarged European Union.
We hope that the very clear prospect of EU membership offered to Moldavia as part of that initiative will act as an incentive to achieve a settlement of the conflict in Transnistria.
The Commission will continue to give attention to the way the situation develops and to remind the Russian Federation of the issue of its abiding by the undertakings it gave in Istanbul.
Â Â  â Thank, you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed, and we will proceed to the vote.(1)
Â Â  â The House has completed its business.
I declare suspended this session of the European Parliament, wishing you all a splendid holiday, in order to restore your energies ready to complete the fifth parliamentary term in 2004.
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
(1)
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 18 December 2003.
Â Â  Colleagues, as you know, on 26 December 2003, in the ancient city of Bam in Iran, at least 30Â 000 people lost their lives as a result of an earthquake.
Many thousands were injured and tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people in that city and region have been displaced.
I wish to place clearly on the record of this House our sympathy for all the victims of this earthquake, and our determination to show practical solidarity with them and their communities in the weeks and months to come.
I should like also to turn our attention to the accident, on 3 January 2004, involving an Egyptian charter plane, which crashed in the Red Sea killing 148 people.
I have already conveyed, on behalf of Parliament, our condolences to the families of the victims and to the French authorities.
Out of respect for the victims, both of the earthquake â a horrendous natural disaster â and of the air traffic accident, I ask you to observe a minute's silence.
Colleagues, I should like to point out to you that last night, here in this building in Strasbourg, a water leak occurred in a warm-water boiler situated on the floor above our Chamber.
The water leaked into the suspended ceiling of the Chamber and some of it fell on Members' seats and desks.
I regret to inform colleagues in the Socialist Group that yours was the target zone.
The leak was discovered at around 4.30 this morning by the European Parliament services, who immediately took the necessary steps to safeguard the Chamber and the fittings and to seek to localise and stop the leak.
The technical services and the contractors have cleared away the water from the suspended ceiling and dried it out, cleaned up the furniture and checked the technical equipment for interpretation and electronic voting.
I have been assured by our technical services that there is no danger in respect of the suspended ceiling, nor any threat of collapse.
To the best of our knowledge, there was no substantial damage to the voting or interpreting equipment, other than the 11 systems and stations that have been replaced in the course of this afternoon.
Therefore, the Chamber should be fully operational.
If there are any operational problems, please inform the services as a matter of urgency so that they can be addressed.(1)
Â Â  The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8 January 2004 has been distributed.
No changes have been proposed to the agenda for Strasbourg or for Brussels.
Â Â  â Mr President, the agenda for this afternoon includes Mr Pexâs report on sanctions for pollution offences at sea.
Mr Pex is well, as are Mr Doorn and others, and I am telling you that so that you are not dismayed by what I also have to tell you, which is that they have been in an aircraft accident.
It would appear from what I have been told that the aircraft ran off the runway, but all of them are all right.
Mr Pex has asked that his report should be taken today rather than being adjourned, and that it should be presented by Mr Bremmer, who, although he is not a member of the committee, is well-informed about the issue.
I was more than willing to convey this request to you.
Â Â  As the Commissioner is present, and as the House seems to agree, we shall thus proceed with the order of business today as planned.
Â Â  â Mr President, although, admittedly, we are announcing this at relatively short notice, we would like a change made to the vote on Thursday, and Mrs Gebhardt would be happy â assuming this to be possible â to explain our reasons for this.
Â Â  â Mr President, on Thursday, we are due to debate and vote on the ZappalÃ  report on the recognition of diplomas.
Although there is no reason whatever why the debate should not be held on Thursday morning, I would ask that we defer the vote on this report until the sitting in Brussels at the end of the month.
There are two reasons for this request, which I am making on behalf of my group.
The first is that there are a few amendments that still need to be checked before they go for translation today, and there is very little time left in which to do it.
I believe that the total number of amendments will be over 300.
The other is that a large number of Members of this House are flying off to India on Thursday morning for the Social Forum.
The recognition of professional qualifications is such an important topic, and one that affects so many members of the public, that it really would be sensible and proper for there to be a very large number of Members in this House to vote on it.
That is a reason for us to do it at a time when we can guarantee that many of us will be present, and so we ask that the vote on this report be held in Brussels at the end of the month, but that the debate should still be on Thursday morning.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I wish to speak to this topic on behalf of the rapporteur.
I have been advised that he would have been quite happy to have this report put to the vote this week, one reason being that we know from experience that attendance is higher when we are in Strasbourg than when we are sitting in Brussels.
This topic is of particular importance, one that has been under discussion for many, many months already, and our committee has put off voting on it over and over again, not least because it is so momentous and problematic.
This time, though, we believe that the time for a decision on the matter has come and that it can be taken this week.
Â Â  I am in something of a dilemma on this matter, not just because different suggestions are being made here, but also because my private office had contacted the rapporteur, and I understood that he supported a line of action other than the one now being proposed.
I suggest that we take soundings at the opening of business tomorrow morning to see if we can reconcile the different preferences that have been expressed here this afternoon.
Does the House agree?
Â Â  Mr President, would it not be possible to do so before the vote tomorrow lunchtime?
Â Â  Yes, in fact that is preferable, as more people will be in attendance at the beginning of the vote tomorrow.
I invite colleagues to use the interim period for consultation and, desirably, to come to a consensus.
Â Â  We now come to the vote on a request for urgent procedure.
This is a request that was considered at the end of the last part-session.
Â Â  Mr President, I will begin by presenting the apologies of Mrs Randzio-Plath, who is unable to be present.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be voting on this question of extension this evening under the simplified procedure, Article 158 (1), so the outcome should be known quickly.
I think we will in fact have an agreement, but the vote takes place this evening.
Â Â  I understand then that after tonight's meeting you will be definitively in a position to give a recommendation.
Do you thus want to deal with the urgency tomorrow morning at the opening of business?
Â Â  We are able to accept the proposal today, right now.
Â Â  Mr President, as you will be aware, last Monday my office received an incendiary bomb which was addressed to me but opened by my staff.
Could I take the opportunity to thank colleagues for their solidarity and support.
It was obviously a shocking incident, although we have to put it in perspective: a lot worse has happened to other Members of this House.
What was particularly frightening was that it was my staff who opened this correspondence and that could have included, for example, students on temporary work experience; that was the most cowardly aspect of it.
While we have to take security precautions, I hope that we would not allow barriers to be created between us and the electorate, because that is exactly what the perpetrators want: to undermine democratic society.
We have seen plenty of examples of that in the past.
Perhaps the most shocking aspect was a decision by Mr Farage of the UK Independence Party to put out an opportunist press release that was at best in the worst possible taste and at worst an apology for terrorism.
Since that press release, my office staff have had injury added to insult by receiving a lot of emails from supporters of the UK Independence Party, or its members, which have been frankly offensive and inflammatory in the extreme, including one suggestion that it should have been a bigger bomb.
This has reinforced my view of the UK Independence Party as a group of paranoid reactionaries on the fringes of society who are now clearly prepared to throw their lot in with those who advocate the violent overthrow of governments.
There have been apologists for terrorists in this House before, particularly Herri Batasuna.
I am disappointed and ashamed that a British political party should have taken the same stance and I hope you condemn that, Mr President.
Â Â  Mr Titley, the House expresses its total solidarity with you and your staff.
Several other colleagues wish to speak on this subject, but afterwards I should like to make a few comments to the House on some of the elements in hand with regard to learning lessons from the events of last week.
Â Â  Mr President, I would also like to express my gratitude for the countless expressions of friendship and solidarity I have received from practically every part of the world, from all the institutions â and I note that the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, is here â and from many many Members of this House, from all the political groups without exception, following the delivery of the package from Bologna.
Mr President, I believe that the institutions must not be intimidated by these acts and that, today more than ever, we must continue to work in favour of a united Europe â taking account of the priorities which the Irish Presidency will present to us the day after tomorrow â in favour of a Constitution for Europe; Europe wants and needs a Constitution, Mr President, a Constitution which must include all of us.
Mr President, I believe it is important that, in view of the threat of terrorism, which affects us all equally â and I believe it is a good time to recognise and express, as a Spaniard, my gratitude for the constant encouragement we have received from the European Parliament in our fight against the terrorist group ETA â we have to continue united, and the response must also be from us all equally.
And as Mr Titley said, that response must be calm and serene, and not hysterical, mobilising all our efforts and our determination so that freedom â and I would like to point out, Mr President, that this is the European citizensâ House of freedom â is not savagely, and with impunity, violated by barbarity, which is the only thing the terrorist movements represent.
Â Â  â Mr President, I did not actually want to make a statement, but, as a number of Members have spoken, I will do so after all.
It must be absolutely plain to us in this House that we will not allow anyone â be they terrorists, anarchists or anyone else â to bring pressure to bear on us.
We affirm that European integration is a labour of peace, of understanding and of reconciliation, from which nobody in Europe or anywhere in the world will succeed in diverting us.
We should therefore consider how we can improve our security, but should also be utterly determined to press on with our labour of peace in uniting Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I have said since the start of this episode that I condemn the use of violence to achieve political ends.
I said that throughout last week, and I am disappointed that Mr Titley has refused to listen.
If, as he says, he has received direct threats from people who purport to be supporters or members of the UK Independence Party, he should forward those names to me immediately, because those people would immediately face disciplinary proceedings and be expelled from our party.
We are a non-racist, non-sectarian, democratic political party, but one which dares to say that carrying on with European integration without the wholehearted consent of the people of Europe is a dangerous thing.
Would it not be better to put this proposed European Constitution to a democratic vote in every country in the European Union and let the people, not professional politicians, decide their destiny?
Not doing this might be a mistake of historic consequences that could lead to very serious disorder in the future.
Â Â  I call the former Mayor of Bologna, our Vice-President Mr Imbeni.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am not taking the floor in my capacity as former Mayor of Bologna, or as an MEP elected in Bologna.
I have, of course, already expressed my solidarity with those who were directly affected by these acts of violence, but I do, however, agree with those who say that we must not give too much publicity to those who want to weaken the democratic institutions though violent acts and intimidation.
In taking the floor, I am doing so to ask you, MrÂ President, and all my fellow Members to support an idea that was put forward by the former Norwegian Prime Minister a few days ago: the idea of awarding the Nobel Peace Price to the European Union.
Just as MrÂ Poettering mentioned a short time ago, this is the greatest and most extraordinary labourof peace that has ever been achieved.
I believe that the European UnionÂ âÂ I am not saying the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission, but the Union itselfÂ âÂ would be entirely justified in calling for and supporting the Nobel Peace Price being awarded to the Union.
I hope that all Members, starting with you, MrÂ President, will support this idea.
Â Â  With regard to the incidents of last week, I can reassure colleagues that we have had very intensive contacts with the security services of the Member States, particularly in the light of Mr Titley's experience.
We have carried out a very thorough review of the security arrangements within our buildings.
A number of operational issues were raised in that review.
We have addressed these and shall continue to address them with a serious focus.
This issue was discussed at length last week in the Conference of Presidents and will be discussed at length again tonight in the Bureau.
It is appropriate that I should reassure you that this is being treated in the way you would expect.
It is also fitting that we know what our response is and ought to be, but that we keep it to ourselves.
On the final issue touched on in the course of these remarks on the incidents of last week, let us be clear that there is no justification for acts of terror against democratically-elected people â whatever the cause, wherever the place â including, in the light of last week, Members of this House.
No Member of this House should seek, directly or indirectly, to sustain the unsustainable and the unacceptable.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to bring an entirely different matter to your attention, namely the special expropriation act in Valencia regulating urban development activities â the LRAU â which, in my view, is an outright violation of various international treaties, including the European Unionâs Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It appears as if the Valencian authorities have designed this Stalinist law in order to achieve their plans cheaply.
The law stipulates that expropriations can take place in the general interest, but, in practice, has the effect that project developers have a licence for carrying out their lucrative plans.
Compensation for house owners who are evicted is ridiculously low; there is no means of recourse against it and the residents, often retired foreigners from across the EU, are not even informed.
This seems to be a mediaeval situation.
I would therefore call for one of Parliament's committees of enquiry to examine whether this law violates international treaties and also for this law to be rendered inoperative during the enquiry.
Â Â  Mr President, this week marks the second anniversary of the detention of approximately 660 people in Guantanamo Bay without charge or trial.
Amnesty International has claimed that some of them are juveniles.
This House has expressed its concerns quite recently about the continued detention of these people without charge or trial and has urged that they be given a fair and open hearing with the right to choose their own defence counsel.
I ask you, Mr President, to make direct contact with the United States Congress to express the concerns of this Parliament and also to urge the President-in-Office of the Council to make contact with the authorities in the United States to express our concerns.
If, in the struggle to defeat terrorism, we deny people civil and political rights then we are undermining our democracies.
Â Â  In the course of my remarks on behalf of Parliament to the December 2003 summit meeting in Brussels, I spoke in precisely those terms regarding all of the institutions' contacts with the United States, its administration and Congress.
Â Â  Mr President, last week at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, India and Pakistan announced that they will meet again in a month's time to take bilateral confidence-building measures, including talks on Kashmir.
This House will welcome an easing of tensions at the most dangerous flashpoint in the globe which only two years ago was on the brink of a nuclear war.
Both countries have recently announced a ceasefire along the line of control in Kashmir, restored airline and bus links and signed a trade agreement.
In March, India's cricket team will be visiting Pakistan for the first time in a decade.
Sport and friendship go hand in hand.
I urge President Musharraf, nevertheless, at the same time to ensure an end to cross-border terrorist infiltration and I welcome the news today of the arrest of those accused of attempting to assassinate him.
I am sure this House will wish to express its encouragement and support for the peace process.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank the Members who have endorsed a paper that expresses solidarity with women accused of having an abortion and who are currently on trial again in Portugal.
The trial continues at Aveiro Criminal Court tomorrow.
Following the Maia case, around two years ago, new cases have emerged on a regular basis.
Despite the European Parliamentâs resolution, adopted on 3 July 2002, which recommends that Member States should not bring criminal action against women who have abortions, the law in Portugal remains out of touch with social reality.
It is a cruel law that makes women turn to illegal âbackstreetâ abortions, treats them like criminals, puts them in the dock and can send them to prison for up to three years.
Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore ask you to show solidarity with these women and call on the Portuguese National Assembly to address the problem of illegal abortions, and abolish the legislation that convicts these women.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at the beginning of December it was announced that the European Commission had concluded negotiations for an Association Agreement with Syria and then we heard no more about it.
I believe that, as regards the fight against terrorism, it is not necessary to dwell on links between Syria and organisations such as , and or on the direct aid that Syria provides them with.
Since, over the years, the European Union has shown itself to be incapable of ensuring respect for the clause on human rights in all of the Association Agreements, it would be appropriate for Parliament to receive all the information from the Commission, before debating the issue, as to how it was possible to conclude an Association Agreement with a country such as Syria.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at Tel Aviv airport a document was handed over which seeks to prevent movement in the Palestinian occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Those who want to go to the Palestinian Authority territories must obtain written authorisation and, without such, the Israeli authorities can â and I quote â âdeport, arrest and prosecute those entering the autonomous areasâ.
This is, in my view, an extremely serious act and a breach of the sovereignty of the Palestinian Authority.
The wall stops Palestinians from moving around: now it is the Israeli authorities that decide who Palestinians can meet or not; in other words, the jailers are granting authorisations to the prisoners.
The same document was sent to European Union contractors and officials.
I therefore call upon the President, the European Commission and the Council Presidency to intervene and to ask the Israeli authorities why they are restricting peopleâs movements in this way.
I will pass on the document that has been received by various foreign citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I wanted to speak about the polemics between the World Jewish Congress and the Commission of the European Union last week.
My aim is not to reinforce those polemics but to point out that they had their origin in a report, which apparently has not yet been distributed by the European institutions, on a matter that is unfortunately only too real.
That is the revival of anti-Semitism in a number of countries, France in particular, where Jewish children, because they are Jews, are harassed and persecuted every day by Arabs perniciously applying to them what is happening in the Middle East conflict.
Mr President, I would like you to intervene to get this report distributed so that the seminars planned on this question can actually be arranged, and quickly, and the European Union can, in accordance with its powers, be true to the commitments it has given, in particular through our Parliament.
Â Â  Mr Nordmann, I believe that your expression of interest in transparency through publication is something that would commend itself to this House.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by reacting to Mr Titley's remarks.
Firstly, I should like to say clearly that he has my wholehearted sympathy and solidarity.
We do not know yet who is responsible for the inadmissible behaviour in question.
He mentioned that the House hears Herri Batasuna praising terrorism.
I should like to say to Mr Titley, that, as an honourable Member of this House, he has the Irish presidency right now.
He can check all the records of this House and if he finds even one word praising terrorists in my speeches, he should say so.
I do not think he will find anything.
If there is proof of that, he should bring it before the Irish presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Gorostiaga has never condemned any of ETAâs attacks, whoever their victims have been.
He has on occasions expressed regret when there have been deaths and he has always justified ETAâs terrorist actions.
This is precisely what is known as an apology for terrorism and I would therefore like to express my solidarity with Mr Titley in relation to what has happened to him and what he has said today.
Â Â  Mr President, during the last plenary I asked for the House to observe one minute's silence for the needless death of children and other civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of bombings by the occupying forces and for this to take place at today's sitting.
The President in the chair at that sitting told me that he would raise the matter with the Bureau. I should therefore like to know whether you discussed it and whether you raised the question of observing one minute's silence.
Â Â  Mr President, just before Christmas we had the annual Brussels pantomime, otherwise known as the Council of Fisheries Ministers, which deliberated on catch quotas for 2004, along with longer-term recovery measures for cod.
For the second successive year the outcome for Scots coastal and island communities was a disaster.
While increasing haddock quotas, which was welcome, the Council limited the Scots fleet to only 15 days at sea, and also restricted access to certain key areas. That is likely to bankrupt many boats.
Incredibly the UK Government-led ministerial team actually volunteered Scotland for this suicidal package!
It is little wonder that many Scots have now completely lost faith in the CFP.
I am calling on the European Commission to look again at this package and to accept that the unworkable and discriminatory nature of its regulation must be re-examined.
Â Â  Mr President, I am informed that on 29Â December 2003, at approximately 2 a.m., the Casal Jaume I Cultural Centre in Russafa, a district of Valencia, was attacked by persons unknown.
All Casal Jaume I centres are members of the AcciÃ³ Cultural del PaÃ­s ValenciÃ  association, whose goals are to study, support and promote the cultural heritage of Valencia.
AcciÃ³ Cultural has more than 9 000 members.
Many young people are also members of Casal JaumeÂ I centres. The following day a press conference was held in the centre and the reporters could see the damage for themselves.
The Secretary-General of AcciÃ³ Cultural referred to 21 attacks since July 2001 on the Casal JaumeÂ I centres in Valencia and the nearby towns of LlÃ­ria, Carlet, Sueca and Vila-Real.
Even the headquarters of the Bloc Nacionalista ValenciÃ  party has been attacked.
In Valencia, there is continuing violence against parties and associations promoting and supporting cultural heritage and progressive values.
All those attacks have been reported to the police.
Violence is now on the increase; some people have been threatened, others attacked.
To date, the response of the government has been inadequate.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sure that you and the whole House will join me in expressing our distress and condolences with regard to the 21 Albanians who lost their lives when their boat was shipwrecked recently near Vlora, off the Albanian coast.
As we rightly strive to develop common European policies for asylum and, in parallel, common policies for Europe for legal immigration, this tragedy and other similar ones have drawn yet further attention to the need for the EU to be constantly aware of the less prosperous states around it and to do ever more to support those countries, of which Albania is just one example.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry to have to make yet another complaint about Air France.
On this occasion it concerns embarkation.
We used to leave through terminal 2D, where there are plenty of security machines and things ran smoothly, but for the last two months we have been leaving from terminal 2B, where there is one small security machine.
Today it took an average of 40 to 45 minutes to get through.
I am really speaking on behalf of some very stressed-out passengers from the Interpretation Service and for staff who were in tears at the thought they might not get on the plane.
Members who went to the lounge and were called at the appropriate moment in fact found they had to queue for 40 minutes.
The plane was then very late in leaving.
Could you perhaps ask that these facilities be improved?
Â Â  I was on that plane, Mr Corrie, and I will indeed take up correspondence. 2b or not 2b: that is the question we need to raise!
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to bring the attention of this Assembly to recent studies on the effects of climate change in particular, which were published in the scientific journal .
They document a massive loss of species, both plant and animal, as a result of climate change.
The golden toad is the most memorable of these species, although probably not the most deserving.
In the light of this, I should like to ask Commissioner de Palacio to retract comments she made in December on the death of the Kyoto Treaty and request that she seek to revive that Treaty and redouble her efforts in getting Russia to join.
Â Â  The Commissioner can take note of that.
For the record, I believe that your co-president has already raised this question in the House, and that it was answered comprehensively â and denied â by the Commissioner on that occasion.
Later she may wish to make a brief remark.
We will not have a debate now.
The Commissioner heard your point and can respond appropriately.
Â Â  I can assure you that we checked on that day that the comments we ascribe to the Commissioner were accurate.
Mr Prodi did not deny those comments.
He simply said that the Kyoto Treaty was important and would be pursued.
I would like the Commissioner herself to state what exactly she did or did not say.
Â Â  When we come to the report on air safety the Commissioner may wish to make a brief digression.
However, I will not call on the Commissioner at this time.
Â Â  Mr President, my honourable friend Mr Patakis raised what is, in my opinion, a serious matter a short while ago.
He had already called at the last session of Parliament for the House to observe one minute's silence in memory of the 16 children killed by the American invaders in Afghanistan at the beginning of December and in memory of the thousands of other civilian victims of the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The President in the chair assured him that he would notify you.
Today my honourable friend Mr Patakis reiterated this request.
From time to time, Parliament observes a minute's silence for various victims, even victims between invaders.
I think that basic compassion, Mr President, demands that my honourable friend's request be accepted.
Â Â  The request is noted.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on air safety and the EU-US agreement on the transmission of personal data relative to transatlantic flights.
Mr Gorostiaga, this is not a debate.
I always try to accommodate Members â you included.
If you wish to make any other remarks you will have to take them up bilaterally with colleagues.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent days we have had too many occasions to take an interest in the problem of safety in air transport.
And before dealing with the issue of transatlantic flights, I too would like to express my condolences in relation to the terrible accident involving the Flash Airlines aircraft on 3 January in which 148 people died, the majority of whom were European citizens.
I am sure that we all share the feelings of the families involved.
But first of all I would like to point out that once again we must wait for the conclusions of the investigation in order to know exactly under what circumstances it took place.
Over recent years, air safety has been one of the main concerns and tasks for the Commission, for myself and for the whole of the Transport Directorate-General.
It is a field in which we have made clear progress: we have approved the Directive on the notification of accidents in civil aviation; we have approved the creation of the European Air Safety Agency, which is now operational; we have approved the rules on the certification and maintenance of aircraft which that Agency must apply and we have also made progress on the âSingle Skyâ initiative, which is an element which must improve safety in the European air sector.
Unfortunately, these measures are not all relevant â and I do not know whether it is unfortunate â to the case in question.
We are talking here about a different case.
There was knowledge of certain problems with the aircraft â for example the incidents which took place when it was diverted for technical reasons to Athens airport â and it was natural to imagine that they would have been registered in the database provided for in the directive you approved last year, but it must be said that that directive will not enter into force for a year.
With regard to the Air Safety Agency, which since 28 September has been operational, its responsibility with regard to national certification competences is restricted to aircraft registered in the Community, in other words, those which have a Community flag, and therefore does not cover aircraft such as those of Flash Airlines.
In accordance with the Chicago Convention, it is the flag State â the State in which the aircraft are registered â which is responsible for those aircraft complying with international safety rules, all under the supervision of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
Nevertheless, the States retain the possibility of checking that third-country aircraft arriving in their territory respect these rules.
In order to facilitate this monitoring, in 1996 the States of the Union and certain European third countries created a system for inspecting aircraft and for exchanging the corresponding information, known as SAFA, within the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC).
The European Commission co-funds this programme and participates in it as an observer.
It is this programme which has allowed for the exchange of information on the six inspections carried out by France, Germany and Poland following by the Swiss prohibition of the Flash Airlines Boeing 737.
Nevertheless, although around 3 000 inspections are carried out each year, nothing guarantees that each State of the Union carries them out and how they are carried out.
Furthermore, this system guarantees neither the approval of collective measures nor, above all, the transparency of inspections and measures and, furthermore, lacks sanction mechanisms against States which do not comply with the rules.
Furthermore, I believe that this lack of transparency is prejudicial to the companies which most respect the safety rules and since that respect is not known and the greater quality of the most serious companies is not known, it offers opportunities to those which are less serious.
On the other hand, greater transparency would mean that everybody knows where things stand and clearly the passenger, the consumer, could choose, and would naturally choose maximum safety.
The Commission is aware of the shortcomings in the current organisation of the inspection system for aircraft.
And I would like to point out that, as a consequence of an accident similar to the Flash Airlines accident, which took place in 1996 in Puerto Plata, in the Dominican Republic, on a flight operated by a Turkish charter company on behalf of a German travel agency, the Commission presented a proposed directive in 1997 on the control of third-country aircraft which land at Community airports.
I would like to point out that the Commission also presented a modified proposal on this text in January 2002 which essentially took up the 1997 text with corrections which improved on the text and which, furthermore, allowed it to be adopted speedily.
As the honourable Members are aware, we are currently in the conciliation phase, which I hope will move forward in the coming days, and the Flash Airlines accident demonstrates the extent to which this text is absolutely essential and urgent: firstly, it is clear that the time limit for transposing the directive must be as short as possible â recent events demonstrate this â and that we must not exceed the usual two years for the incorporation of directives into national law.
It will be incomprehensible to everybody if following what has just happened there are further delays on the part of the States of the Union on this issue.
With regard to the annual report to be published by the Commission, I believe that it should be made available to all interested parties.
It should provide the necessary data for the choice of air companies by tour operators in order to encourage them to take even more interest in safety issues.
Naturally, the data in this report can only reflect the reality at a given time and does not always allow us to draw general conclusions on the safety or lack of safety of an aircraft or aircraft in general of a specific company.
Nevertheless, the British initiative to publish a list of companies which may not enter British air space demonstrates that, in any event, transparency is not only possible but that it is going to happen.
And the Commission's report must be carried out and drawn up in the light of this aspect.
The Commission supports Parliamentâs proposal that when a measure is adopted by a State of the Union â following an inspection â it should apply to the whole of the Community.
In that way, the attitude of the most rigorous state of the Union will become the attitude of the whole of the Union in relation to this type of aircraft.
This accident does not just require an effort and a strengthening of the controls and the transparency of those controls.
It also requires that we consider the need for greater discipline amongst tour operators with regard to information for passengers on the airline which is going to carry them and on the choice of that airline.
It makes no sense that when one buys a package deal all types of information is given on the hotel, meals, and also sometimes sight-seeing trips, offers of supplementary activities etc., but there is usually no information on precisely which airline is going to operate the flight. I have asked the services of the Commission to study this issue, which I believe to be essential, as a matter of priority.
This dramatic issue, Mr President, however, is not the only element which is going to lead to controversy and concern with regard to safety issues amongst the public in the civil aviation sector, since over Christmas we have all been aware of issues relating to suspensions of flights from European countries to the United States, with the corresponding problems and difficulties faced by all those passengers who had planned to take those flights.
There is no question that the current situation justifies enhanced and more active cooperation with the American authorities in order to reinforce security aspects in view of the new terrorist risks.
However, although we agree with these objectives, we are often faced with measures which are adopted unilaterally and, in this regard, I would like to say that we in the Commission have repeatedly informed the American authorities of the need to hold a dialogue and reach agreement prior to decision-making, which, furthermore, would not only facilitate the implementation of those decisions, but will also produce better results in view of the experience which certain States of the Union have had in this area, for better or for worse.
The difficult negotiations carried out by Mr Bolkestein on the automatic transfer of personal data to the American authorities also demonstrate that in the end we can find solutions acceptable to both parties, although it takes longer and creates more difficulties.
In this regard, I would like to say, on the subject of the transfer of data, that in December I had the opportunity to present the results of these negotiations to the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, together with Mr Vitorino, Mr Patten and Mr Bolkestein.
As we pointed out at the time, we believe that the results obtained on the transfer and storage of personal data allow the Commission to prepare an adequacy finding, bringing it into line with the Directive on data protection, which will complement an initiative within the ICAO to create an international framework and adequate information for passengers.
It must be made clear that the recent behaviour of our American friends and partners does not relate to these points.
We must point out that the data which has led to certain difficulties were not the data which appear in the âPassenger Name Recordâ (PNR) and that they are sufficiently detailed to prevent certain types of errors which have been made in this field.
Although the justification for the cancellation of, for example, Air France and British Airways flights is not demonstrated , however, we must always be cautious in the face of terrorist threats and it is better to be overcautious than to be faced with an attack.
I would also like to refer to another issue which has appeared in the media and which causes a degree of concern, and that is the presence of security personnel on board aircraft which fly to the United States, an issue which raises all sorts of problems.
Firstly, I would like to point out that this issue is one for the Member States to deal with.
The Community has no competence in this area.
Secondly, I would like to point out that, regardless of the way the Commission had organised a meeting next 16 January, that is, at the end of this week, of the aviation group in which all the civil aviation directors of the States of the Union participate, this point will be added to the long list of issues on the agenda and will be discussed.
Mr President, I will end by saying that what has happened recently demonstrates, firstly, that safety is a central aspect of air transport, and it is essential that we continue to ensure that it is maintained and strengthened.
That safety must be dealt with in a global manner and it is not sufficient to talk about guarantees and safety for air companies from our territories, that is, European air companies and aircraft, because third-country aircraft also use our airports and huge numbers of our citizens travel on them.
We therefore have to increase their safety and there is a margin to do so and I hope that there is agreement between Parliament and the Council on the issue of the safety of third-country aircraft.
I would like to say finally that safety issues for preventing problems relating to terrorism in the civil aviation sector must be dealt with from the point of view of seeking the greatest possible safeguards and security for passengers and citizens.
In any event, we must not forget that the number of air accidents has decreased over the last 10 years by 45 percent while air traffic has doubled.
Nevertheless, since in 2003 there were 576 victims on commercial flights at world level, we must continue working to try to prevent this type of accident and to reduce them even more.
Â Â  Mr President, the incident with the Flash Airlines aircraft was indeed tragic and I happened to experience the tragedy of this incident personally, in that I was in France and saw the reactions of French society.
I wish to point out that the European Parliament has good reason to feel satisfied about the fact that it has been aware of the issue of the safety of air transport for a long time now.
Its stand on the question of the European Aviation Safety Agency, the EASA, is evidence of this awareness.
We supported this endeavour right from the start and this year we voted in favour of all the items in the budget needed to staff this agency quickly.
At the same time, in the Maes report on third country aircraft, which the Commission rightly took the initiative of promoting, Parliament took a strict approach from the outset, and I am delighted that Mrs de Palacio agreed today with the European Parliament's position on our differences with the Council on the conciliation procedure.
It is very important, and I hope that the Council will take this on board, for the regulations introduced on this matter to be the right ones and for us to guarantee high safety standards, not just for our aircraft but also for third country aircraft flying to the European Union.
Then, as you know, there is the safety issue which arose after the terrorist attack on 11 September.
There are still problems here, but unfortunately, despite the talks held from time to time, it has proven impossible to address them correctly.
I believe that, on the other side of the Atlantic, despite the fact that I understand their reaction, at the same time there is also an arrogant approach to Europe, an intention to deal with the problems unilaterally.
I believe that we shall make it clear to the other side that we want to work together but, at the same time, we want to be on an equal footing with them, and the European Commission can help decidedly in this direction.
Â Â  â Mr President, as I have to take the chair, I have swapped with Mr Simpson, who will be speaking later on behalf of our group.
Since early last year, the Americans have been demanding the handing over of passengersâ data before they join a flight; some of this information is of a highly personal nature.
The US authorities planned to store this data for fifty years, with it being used not only to combat terrorism and potential dangers associated with it, but also, potentially, being made available to other security agencies as well.
The threat was made that, if the airlines did not comply, they would have to pay heavy fines or risk losing their landing rights.
Not only in this House did this call forth vehement criticisms, one in particular being that this was illegal, in that it is in flagrant breach of two items of European legislation, namely the Data Protection Directive and the Regulation on the handling of data in flight booking.
This, as the Commissioner has said, prompted the Commission to take action.
Where are we now?
The fifty years for which the data was to be stored have now become three and a half.
We have managed to get limitations put on what is done with it.
The data is to be used only in combating terrorism and crimes connected with it.
The rules are to apply for three and a half years in the first instance, after which they are to be renegotiated, and not all the passenger information is to be handed over; the US authorities have, in particular, confirmed that the really personal and sensitive âspecial service informationâ and that derived from the âspecial service requestâ is to be deleted.
Moreover, legal peace has been restored by the requirement for passengersâ prior consent, and the Commission will see to it that it is we who actively transmit the data â which means that we can also filter it â whereas, at present, it is still collected by the Americans; whilst this may well not, unfortunately, meet European data protection standards, it would be unfair to say that we had not achieved a great deal.
I will end by pointing out to the Commissioner that I see the clause about expiry after three and a half years as being significant in the sense that there is always a tension between, on the one hand, the need to intervene in the private sphere and, on the other, the potential needs of internal security.
If we are to consider extending this system beyond the three and a half years, it must, in that period, be demonstrated to produce real results.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs de Palacio for her introduction.
I will confine myself to the issue of flight data and the relationship with the United States.
I should like to point out that, at present, the United States still receives unfiltered information.
Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) 2299/89 and Article 26 of Directive 95/46/EC are still not being complied with.
Meanwhile, as the Commissioner did point out, various flights have been cancelled on the basis of unfiltered information and in addition, the United States have asked for permission for the presence of armed security agents on flights.
Furthermore, as the Commissioner stated, this last request, in particular, has met with very mixed reactions from various countries.
I have to say, Commissioner, that all of this has not, in any case, resulted in a joint approach and that this is very confusing for passengers and airline companies alike.
I therefore take the view that there is still neither adequate protection by the United States nor protection of the interests of air travellers and airline companies.
Nor am I convinced that the agreement will offer sufficient guarantees.
This is why I reiterate my desire for a permanent solution by means of an international agreement between the United States and Europe, with full involvement from the European Parliament and the US Congress, which would therefore be a weightier formula.
I would also repeat my proposal with regard to the Commission, on the basis of Article 300(6) of the Treaty of Nice, to ask the ECJ to give advice on this agreement.
If you fail to do so, I believe that Parliament itself should take on this responsibility.
After all, this is about an international world standard, and we will need to maintain very high standards.
I still fail to grasp, for example, how these decisions were taken on the basis of elements from the briefing, namely: the wider EU-US relationship, the safety and confidence of air travellers and the cost aspect of airline companies.
Even following consultation with a Foreign Affairs Minister, or various Foreign Affairs Ministers, a unilateral decision was taken to cancel flights.
How does this relate, for example, to international trade agreements?
In general, before we discuss the final agreement, which is in six weeks' time, I should also like to be told in what way cooperation between the European and American security authorities has been achieved.
In short, I think that the signals that were given over the past month are an example of precisely how things should not be done, and I therefore hope to receive a clear answer now, or at least in response to my written questions.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the only words that are fitting for the terrible disaster of Sharm el-Sheikh are sadness and compassion and I want again to express my solidarity with the victimsâ families and share in their grief.
Obviously, it is impossible today to determine the causes of this accident and to say who was responsible.
I am also aware that air transport is not without risks.
No airline is immune from accidents.
Having said that, we who carry political responsibility are involved, we have a particular responsibility because this accident has highlighted a number of questions that cannot be avoided.
I would like, in the time that is given me, to go over those that seem to me the most important.
The first question concerns States.
Why did two States, France and Switzerland, take different decisions about the condition of aircraft belonging to the same airline?
Was it due to inadequate cooperation or inadequate controls?
How are the SAFA programmes applied?
Important as they are, they are no substitute for thorough technical controls.
Information should be automatic and transparent, with mandatory inspection on the slightest suspicion.
As things in fact stand, as you said, there are no sanctions for states that fail to carry out inspections.
I share MrsÂ deÂ Palacioâs concern that it should be possible for a particular or reinforced protection measure adopted by one Member State in order to ensure safety to be extended to the whole Community.
The second question is concerned with the safety consequences of the liberalisation of air transport.
As you said, Commissioner, it is a global problem.
With the growth of charter flights and low-cost fliers, airlines are engaged in keen competition.
Cost cutting is certainly involved, but on what terms is that possible?
There is a great temptation to cut back on training, maintenance or staff, and safety is threatened.
Does not the European Unionâs vaunted obsession with favouring the lowest economic cost in aviation help to make that the only regulator?
The third question has to do with checks on aircraft that are a safety risk.
The proposed directive, which was again submitted in January 2002, has still not been adopted.
We must demand strict safety guarantees for all aircraft using the Unionâs airports, step up controls and further harmonise joint technical regulations, including those concerned with flight and rest times.
The Council should stop prevaricating and really get down to much stricter and more transparent safety rules.
Finally, if we are to be effective legislators, we must call on the industryâs professionals.
Pilots, technicians and other professionals have irreplaceable experience in this field.
It is very useful to listen to them.
That is the reason for the initiative my group has taken for a hearing to be held here on Wednesday afternoon.
I also want in a few words to give my opinion on the EU-US agreement on the transmission of data relative to transatlantic flights.
For the fight against terrorism, data would be transmitted in 34 fields, including the racial origins, political opinions, religious convictions and state of health of passengers, whereas the national authorities competent for the protection of privacy had reduced that list to 19.
Moreover, the US authorities want to pass that data to US surveillance networks.
It seems to me that this agreement isolates the European data protection directive and, in the light of European legislation, I do not think we can agree to the transfer of this data.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the accident involving the Egyptian aircraft has shocked people in Europe.
The tragic death of these tourists, most of them French, has demonstrated that there are still insufficient safety measures in place.
The public wants to know how it is possible, when safety regulations are international, widely known and should be widely applied, for an aircraft that is not allowed access to Swiss airspace to be allowed to fly in other European countries.
The Commission took an initiative more than six years ago, and I am delighted that the Commissioner gave us another account of those events.
Unfortunately, we are still waiting for the directive.
A dispute about Gibraltar between Spain and the United Kingdom has held this directive up for years.
After 11 September, and especially in view of the ensuing crisis in aviation, people have again begun to realise how very important safety is.
As the rapporteur for the safety of aircraft from third countries, I am pleased with the promptness with which at least this Parliament has acted and has accepted a number of amendments at first and second reading which we still need to debate.
I am delighted that the Commissioner has pledged her support to Parliament and I am convinced that the trialogue will be very fruitful.
I hope that the Council's response will also be very positive.
The most significant difference of opinion between the Commission and Council concerns information to the public.
We thought that the Commission was rather reserved in this respect.
As rapporteur, I take the view that we must ensure that every European citizen who boards a plane at one of our airports should have the certainty that this aircraft has been inspected according to the same standards and that regulations are also being complied with.
This is why we need more European solutions. The European Aviation Safety Agency should also be able to play its role to the full so that our citizens can be informed.
We must question whether keeping data anonymous is not a culpable omission at a specific point in time.
I cannot accept that a company that is branded unsafe should not be made known to the public.
I am sorry I had so little time, but I would like to thank the Commissioner and my fellow-Members for the support that they wish to express in the context of this report, and for the initiative they are taking.
I will certainly come and listen.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened most attentively to your statement on air safety in a context that is particularly difficult for France after the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster and I have heard your concerns.
On my own behalf and on behalf of the members of the French delegation of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I want to express our most sincere condolences and our solidarity with the victimsâ families.
Since it has not yet been possible to analyse the aircraftâs black boxes, it would be irresponsible to draw premature conclusions about this tragedy.
For the present, there is nothing tangible that would allow us to call into question either the condition of the aircraft, the professionalism of the Egyptian charter company FlashAirlines, the earnestness of the Egyptian civil aviation authority or the reliability of the technical controls that were carried out on that aircraft.
From what we know at present, even the hypothesis of an attack cannot be ruled out completely, even if it seems highly unlikely.
However, it seems to me essential that European users of air transport should be given every guarantee to reassure them.
I would like to take advantage of this session, Commissioner, to pass on to you some of the most frequent questions concerning charter airlines in particular.
Would it not be possible to require European tour operators to inform tourists who use their services of the precise identity of the airline they will be travelling with at the time they buy their tickets?
In order for European tour operators to be better assured of the level of safety of the airlines they work with, would it not also be desirable to go beyond the random checks that are currently made?
Would it not be advisable to recommend real in-depth technical audits of airlines that are not European but which are used by our tour operators?
Â Â  Mr President, I will concentrate on the issue of civil aviation safety.
I start by offering, on behalf of my Group, our condolences to the relatives and friends of all victims of aviation accidents, not just the recent one in Sharm el-Sheikh.
I firmly believe, however, that aviation safety has to be put into perspective.
The industry is the most regulated and has the best safety record of any mode of public transport.
When you compare the record of aviation with the carnage that occurs on our roads, and when you consider that the number of air accidents is going down, whilst the number of road accidents is going up, then any discussion on aviation safety must take these facts into account.
However, civil aviation must carry on improving its safety record.
I wish to highlight four areas where improvements could be made.
First there is a danger that a system similar to maritime transport's flags of convenience could creep into civil aviation.
I hope EASA, the new safety agency, will urgently examine this.
Member States need to increase their ramp inspections to weed out those airlines which are based in one country but register in another and have lower standards than we would expect within the European Union.
Second, there is an urgent need for a Europe-wide harmonised system of operations by way of an EU-ops.
This particular issue is all the more urgent with the impending enlargement of the European Union and would include matters such as flight and duty time for cockpit and cabin crew.
Third, the whole issue of cabin safety needs to be addressed, particularly the number of emergency exits, the amount of cabin baggage â try getting on the Air France flight today from Paris, for example! â and the use of sky marshals.
Fourth, there is a need to reform the existing package travel directive which is now not only outdated, but ineffectual and allows some airlines to offer packages without being covered by the directive.
This Parliament, with the help of the Commission, has worked long and hard to improve aviation safety and we have had some success.
There are still areas where more progress needs to be made.
However, I repeat that aviation is the safest form of public transport and accidents, however tragic, are thankfully rare.
The House would do well to await the results of any official investigations before jumping to conclusions that can often be misguided and wrong.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to express my condolences in respect of the victims of the aircraft accident in Egypt.
People are concerned; in my region, too, there is an airport that apparently has been, or is being, used by this airline company, so it is obvious that we need to know whether the assessment of all aircraft that fly in the EU is positive or not.
We have Mrs Maesâ report on third-country aircraft, in which, fortunately, we demand such things as our own inspections, the possibility of keeping aircraft on the ground and of exchanging information between Member States.
We have now reached the conciliation stage, and I hope that we can make use of this conciliation to tighten things up to some extent.
One of the questions that arose after the accident in Egypt is: what do we tell the public, what is intended for the public domain?
It is clear that the Council has toned down the questions that Parliament had on that score.
I would like to ask the Council, in the light of recent events, to revisit this issue.
It is evident that we do not throw just any piece of information into the public domain, for then it will lead a life of its own.
If, however, an airline company is banned from a country, surely people are entitled to know this, so that they can avoid using this airline in future.
I think that we should have clear rules in this respect.
I have read that a law is to be adopted in France according to which tour operators are to be required to tell customers which company will be used for the trip, so that people know with whom they are flying.
I think that passengers have a right to this, and if there were to be an imputation in respect of a company, then customers can establish that link themselves.
Why could that not become EU law?
I have also read that the American Federal Aviation Administration is examining the quality of inspections in third countries, or what Mr Simpson termed the role of the flag state.
This reminds me of safety in shipping.
Do we actually have control over the quality of the flag state?
Could we not do what the Americans are doing?
I think that the quality offered by ICAO is sound, but we should apply our own systems and do as the Americans are doing.
It is, in my view, not a bad idea for us as Europeans to go and have a look over there whether the quality standards are being respected.
Finally, I have read that there are quite a few differences between national inspections, and that one country is somewhat stricter than the other, or at least makes assessments on a different basis.
I should like to see flight bans established everywhere on the same basis â after all, one flight ban can be too strict, while another not strict enough.
In any case, we now have a European Aviation Safety Agency, and it might be useful if an independent audit were to be carried out on the different ways in which Member States assess the safety of aircraft.
I hope â Commissioner, Mr President, Mrs Maes and other Members who were involved in this conciliation â that we can use the conciliation procedure relating to your report in order to ensure that the points which Parliament pressed home in the light of recent events â and unfortunately, our decision-making is often, if not too often, disaster-driven â will be emphasised.
Mrs Maes, I hope that you, together with the Members of this House, will be able to salvage a few things yet.
Â Â  Commissioner, Mr President, the Sharm el-Sheikh disaster will hang over aviation for a long time.
We share the victimsâ pain, but there is more!
I think many French people, many Europeans have identified with the victims because they express part of our way of life.
We try to break with the everyday, and to do so we travel far.
We look for a change of scenery, sunshine in winter, and for that you have to go a long way.
And then we look for cheap services, and for that, too, you have to go a long way.
If we want this freedom or this mobility to last, then we shall have to increase air safety and be more strict, as we are over safety in other sectors.
As a result, this air safety is going to become a top priority again because that, at least, is something over which we can and must have some control.
Of course, we need first of all to know the causes of the accident.
There is a lot of talk about them at the moment, but they are not really known.
I think that is a necessity for all of us, even if for some the priority is to find someone to blame.
A long time ago, in 1996, the Commission presented a proposal following the crash of an aircraft belonging to a Turkish airline.
Nothing came of it because some States, Spain and the United Kingdom at the time, were in dispute over Gibraltar.
Since then, an Aviation Safety Agency has been set up, but it cannot encroach on Statesâ air traffic control, and some of these States, France in particular, often use the pretext of their sovereignty to curb its activities.
Another text has been under discussion since 2002.
I hope that this time it will be agreed quickly and that the recent accident will speed us towards a solution.
Lists have been made of rust-bucket ships.
We must now do the same for aircraft.
If some need to be done away with, let us make a list of them, Commissioner.
Finally, like others before me I would like to stress that yes, it is wrong that a passenger who buys a charter ticket does not know which airline he will be flying with.
We cannot demand labelling and traceability standards for GMOs but at the same time not worry about them for aircraft.
Labelling and traceability are necessary in aviation as well.
Â Â  MrÂ President, to date two stringent Parliament resolutions have been allowed to jeopardise European citizensâ fundamental right to protection of personal data.
US agencies can directly access data on the flight passenger list with no guarantee that the permission of those concerned will be asked, and with no guarantee of their right to have detailscorrected, or that they will have recourse to a lawyer or an independent authority.
There are no guarantees on the duration and the purpose of authorising data and, despite the efforts made by the Commission, the prospects for the future are not encouraging: the data of millions of European citizens who book trips to America will, therefore, be kept for years in US databases.
In what way, though, will keeping all their credit card data enhance our security?
How are we going to deny other countries something tomorrow that we are today granting to the US?
We called for reciprocity as regards citizensâ rights, but the Commission is instead, rather ironically, proposing reciprocity in the exchange of data between security agencies.
Let us be careful.
If monitoring becomes the norm instead of an exception, if a majority is under suspicion instead of an individual and if all citizens become suspects, then we are heading towards a worrying future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, first of all I wish to thank MrsÂ deÂ Palacio for her efforts to promote air safety.
I agree with what she has said.
I also wish to express my sympathy for the families of the victims of the air accident at el-Sheikh in Egypt before concentrating on the sensitive aspects of the discussions with the United States on air safety.
The Commission deserves all credit for its fight to defend privacy in the negotiations with the United States concerning the air passenger lists.
Some of us in the delegation for relations with the United States were there in the US and discussed these issues.
We know, in particular, how incredibly difficult it is to get the United States to achieve an, in our view, fair and considered balance between combating terrorism and defending human rights.
The outcome of the negotiations is, in some respects, successful and, in others, unsatisfactory.
The United States has, however, made major concessions.
The fact that it is possible to store information for three and a half years is positive from an American perspective. From a European perspective, it is, however, barely acceptable.
In this case, it is, however, also a question of creating efficient contacts between the EU and the United States so that business, trade and aviation can thrive and develop.
In the light of this, it is very important to find a solution that does not put a complete stop to these contacts at the very moment when the economy is in the process of improving.
I wish, however, to warn against contagion.
Three and a half years must not constitute a model for the EU when we proceed with our own legislation on data protection and combating crime.
In Europe, we have stronger protection for human rights than the United States does, especially when it comes to protecting privacy.
That protection is something of which we should be proud. When we in the EU develop our own measures to combat terrorism â in many cases similar to, but not identical with, those adopted by the United States â we must defend our protection of privacy.
Cooperation and coordination with the United States on these issues is certainly necessary, but we cannot abandon our own principles concerning human rights.
Who wishes to see European aviation include armed marshals and requirements to have finger prints taken?
The agreement must fall if the United States does not comply with the protection of human rights.
We cannot afford, in either financial or human terms, to make room for woolly interpretations by one side or the other.
In this area, the Commission must, on every point, be given clear assurances on interpretation and compliance.
A broader international agreement on air safety may be a step on this road too.
Â Â  Mr President, I support the British initiative to highlight those airlines that are not allowed into UK airspace.
At this time we cannot presume that the recent air accident in Egypt was caused by mechanical failure.
It is therefore prudent for us to await the accident investigation report.
However, I agree with the Commission that travel agents and tour operators should inform passengers more fully about the airlines which are part of their holiday package.
Perhaps we can do something about that.
There must also be a far better means of exchange of information, whether it be through the International Civil Aviation Organization, the EU or Member States.
In addition, I believe that the Maes Report on ramp checks, which is coming to its conclusion, should address some of the issues.
With regard to the transfer of data, we should remember that 3Â 000 people lost their lives in those horrendous attacks on 11 September, and many of them were from the European Union.
So it is not surprising that the Americans reacted in the way they did.
Having said that, I fully welcome the outcome of the negotiations attended by Commissioners Bolkestein and de Palacio.
The conclusions drawn from those negotiations are extremely positive, not least, in my view, in relation to the information on collection and storage.
Hopefully that should satisfy Parliament.
I agree that better cooperation between the US and the EU could probably solve problems before they arise.
I would therefore urge the United States not to act unilaterally.
I think we can do things better.
With regard to the suspension and delay of flights over the Christmas and New Year period, they were clearly decisions that had to be made by national governments.
In my view, it is therefore necessary to look again at the Lisi Report, which has just gone through Parliament, as regards current non-reference to matters coming under .
Â Â  . Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to thank the honourable Members for their speeches and, firstly, I would like to thank Mrs Maes for the work she is doing as rapporteur on the safety of third-country aircraft.
I hope that we can have a conciliation quickly and that this accident will serve to make us speed up and overcome certain reservations and difficulties which arose in the Council in relation to the points which I referred to earlier, whether those relating to speedy transposition into national laws or those relating to greater transparency with regard to the stringency and quality of safety and the state of maintenance of the aircraft by the different air companies operating in the European Union.
I believe that there is a middle ground between Parliamentâs initial proposal â which was perhaps too exhaustive â and not providing any information at all, and clearly the Commission supports, as I said in my first speech, an increase in transparency regarding the true situation of the aircraft of air companies, that is to say, stringency in the monitoring of safety standards.
As well as this issue, I would like to refer very briefly to the fact that there are certain issues which have yet to be promoted over the next few years, but the implementation of the European Civil Aviation Safety Agency is an extremely important step forward.
When we adopt this legislation on third-country aircraft, we will be taking an extremely important step forward.
Within the International Civil Aviation Organisation we must strengthen its controls, since, in principle, the control of how activities are carried out in the different States with regard to their aircraft falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
In other words, it would not be a question of the European Civil Aviation Agency going to a third country to check how they carry out their work and their controls there.
This task falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
It is a different thing for the European Union to have competence to ensure that the aircraft which land in our territory comply with the requirements and that we control how the requirements are complied with by those aircraft.
We must take an additional step forward, so that, at Community level, there are common rules, to the effect that if a country prohibits overflight or landing by certain aircraft, that that rule should be extended to the whole of the European Unionâs airspace.
That if a country detects a particular kind of problem in a specific aircraft, it will be obligatory for that information to be distributed and passed on to all the countries of the Union; and also that there be common rules on the way in which those controls are carried out, on the percentage and on the system.
We must reach agreements which guarantee that the whole of the Union takes appropriate measures and that they are applicable throughout our airspace.
The next point which has arisen is the transfer of passenger data to the United States.
I would like to clarify something which Mrs Ainardi has said, and that is that the United States are not requesting the sensitive information the honourable Member has mentioned.
The information classed as sensitive in accordance with the Directive on data protection in Europe â health, religion and so on â is not being requested by the United States.
This is what the honourable Member must be aware of.
It is not that information which is going to be communicated.
The next issue relates to the communication of data.
I can tell honourable Members that we have reached an agreement which the Commission believes provides for protection of the privacy of our citizens, because, as has been said before â I believe it was Mr Poignant â there is tension between the âsafetyâ component and the âprivacyâ component.
We must resolve the tension between the two elements in an appropriate and balanced way.
We have reached an agreement â amongst other things, thanks to this Parliament, let us make this very clear â which in the end includes a series of guarantees which the European Union was demanding â a reduction in the amount of data, the type of data, a restriction in terms of the objective for which they will be used, a restriction of the time for which they can be used, in other words, all the elements which the honourable Members are perfectly aware of â which means that we can say that, by means of this agreement, the fundamental rights which our legislation affords our citizens are guaranteed, also in terms of the way the United States uses the information, while at the same time we are helping and cooperating in the improvement of safety in the air sector and the fight against international terrorism.
I believe that all of this responds essentially to the elements which have been raised here.
I would like once again to thank this Parliament for its cooperation in the different steps we have taken.
I believe they have been extremely important.
We can bring them to a conclusion speedily through this Directive on the safety of third-country aircraft, and, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to express our condolences for the victims and say that we must continue to work to improve safety in the air sector, firstly, naturally, in European airspace, in relation to aircraft which leave Europe for other places, but also at world level, because, however much information we provide â and naturally we must do so, to increase transparency in the information tour operators give their clients, stating which company is going to provide the transport, stating exactly which companies they work with â this is important and will improve safeguards and information for our citizens and our passengers, and there can be no doubt that we â Europeans or non-Europeans â must fight to improve safety in air traffic and in international civil aviation.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
- A5-0388/2003 by Mr Pex, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of sanctions, including criminal sanctions, for pollution offences (COM(2003) 92 â C5-0076/2003 â 2003/0037(COD));
- A5-0413/2003 by Mr Poignant, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between registers within the Community (COM(2003) 478 â C5-0366/2003 â 2003/0180(COD)); and
- A5-0373/2003 by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision to strengthen the criminal law framework for the enforcement of the law against ship-source pollution (COM(2003) 227 â C5-0244/2003 â 2003/0088(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, a moment ago we talked about air safety.
Now we are going to talk about maritime safety.
The package we are going to discuss today constitutes the penultimate phase and naturally supplements the work carried out over the last four years.
I would like to remind the honourable Members that, in December 1999, we faced the accident, a tragedy which you are all well aware of; then we had the accident.
As a result of these two accidents, the citizens of the different European countries have looked to Europe and demanded responses.
We have taken many very important steps, and I believe we can safely say that during this legislature there has been a revolution in maritime safety in the European Union and a spectacular improvement in the guarantees of protection for our coasts and our citizens.
Today, Europe can say that it has a system which is at least equivalent to those of the best protected countries in the world, and now there is no country in the world with more stringent measures, unlike the situation four and a half years ago.
The risks and the seas are different, but we finally have a genuinely ambitious and appropriate system.
We must continue to make progress and today we are going to debate a fundamental element in the mechanism to combat and prevent the pollution caused by ships, namely the system of sanctions for pollution offences for which a part of the directive establishes a framework, and then there is the instrument in the criminal field.
In March 2003, the Commission presented its proposed directive on ship-source pollution and the introduction of sanctions, including of a criminal nature, for pollution offences.
Through this proposed directive, the Commission intends to essentially achieve three objectives: firstly, to define within Community law the concept of the illegal dumping of polluting substances in the sea; the proposal intends to incorporate into our legislation the provisions of the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, that is, the Marpol Convention.
Secondly, to guarantee that the people responsible for illegal dumping â not just captains and ship owners, but also charterers and classification societies, which in some cases be responsible for these actions â may be prosecuted and also be subject to penalties in certain circumstances.
And, thirdly, precisely defining the conditions under which responsibility may be established for each of the parties involved; the Commission believes that criminal responsibility may be established when spills are intentional and also, in the event of an accident, if the spill is due to serious negligence.
In other words, intention and serious negligence.
As the honourable Members know, in May last year, the Commission also presented a proposed framework Decision on pollution from ships.
This second proposal supplements the proposed Directive and essentially regulates the criminal aspects, that is, harmonisation in the field of sanctions and issues of judicial cooperation on criminal matters.
Now, the principle of incrimination and the imposition of the corresponding sanction must be established legally and, in the Commissionâs view, by means of the directive, which, in accordance with the Treaties in their current form, is the only genuinely effective instrument for truly incorporating sanctions into the law of all the Member States and will therefore be an effective deterrent.
The three objectives I have referred to are clear, viable and, in our view, inescapable.
Nevertheless, for certain Members States, the proposed Directive which is currently on the table goes too far: they see its objectives as overly ambitious.
The Council has not yet laid out its position in this regard, but I have heard the doubts of the majority of ministers, who are not convinced that we should continue along this route.
Some have the clear intention of greatly reducing the ambitions contained in the Commissionâs proposed Directive.
I must confess that the work in the Council is a great disappointment to me.
The work is moving very slowly and the delay has meant that we cannot respond either to the expectations of our fellow citizens or to the demands of the Heads of State or Government, who had called for Parliament and the Council to adopt this Directive before the end of 2003.
I am convinced that I can once again count on the support of this House.
The position Parliament adopts will be a determining factor and will contribute to moving the situation forwards.
I will now move on to the third issue, relating to the transfer of ships between European Union registers.
