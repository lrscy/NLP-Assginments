Mr President, this Summit was announced as the Summit of liberalisation and ended up addressing longer working hours.
In itself, I have nothing against longer working hours, and I think that this topic merits a debate.
However, the question is whether Europe will endear itself by persistently bringing out statements of this kind only.
In my view, it does not show much leadership when a presidency focuses on aspects of this kind rather than other aspects that are at least as important.
Discussion at Lisbon mainly concerned the knowledge economy and the importance of knowledge and human resources in this connection.
However, were decisions taken about lifelong learning, for example? No, this decision is being shunted to Seville where we are to get a resolution.
In my view, we should be very careful that this does not become an academic exercise.
If we want to take concrete steps, these will, above all, need to establish benchmarking.
Let us clearly agree on how much of our GNP we want to spend on education. Let us make it clear that learning and the right to learning are not solely determined by labour market data.
However, I do not only want to be downbeat.
In my view, the Summit has taken some important decisions, one of which is undoubtedly that on energy taxation.
We must prize this decision, and I hope that it will be implemented effectively.
A second point on which I should like to congratulate the presidency and the Summit is the attention to language learning.
Language education is increasingly in jeopardy.
In a number of Member States, it is considered unimportant, but I do not think this is fair, and we should address this issue as a matter of urgency.
Mr President, the Council's most bitter critics were those who attended late at night and turned out at the demonstration in the morning. So far, the worst they have been able to say is that Barcelona was a small step.
I would add that it was a small step in the right direction.
By way of clarification I should say that I think it is a step in the right direction because now we are no longer discussing the issues which concerned us five days ago.
Mr BarÃ³n is the exception to the rule.
We are not discussing the dogma of price stability any more, nor are we arguing for or against the Stability Pact. We have also ceased to debate the need or urgency of speeding up structural reform to attain three aims, namely a functioning market, the principle of social compensation, and sustainable development.
It is undiluted MÃŒller-Armak.
I should like to make two brief points on economic reform.
In the wake of Barcelona it is now crystal-clear that as far as energy and gas are concerned, liberalisation does not necessarily equate to privatisation. Those wishing to retain public concerns are free to do so.
It is also evident that liberalisation must take account of the basic principles of general interest services such as equal access, continuity of supply and consumer safety.
Speeches made from other benches calling for liberalisation to be postponed further therefore amount to excuses from a bad payer. I simply cannot understand why it is supposed to be good for industry to be able to chose a supplier whilst denying household consumers that same choice.
I only have one message for the Council regarding financial markets. Parliament has shown considerable generosity in approving the von Wogau report.
It has also shown considerable efficiency in approving the relevant measures.
I can take it on myself to provide an assurance that if the Council forwards us the eight modifications it proposed regarding financial services by express post, the relevant reply will also be dispatched by express post.
Please send us the common positions.
I should like to make one last comment on the subject of the institutional structures needed for these reforms: Seville.
The Council and the Commission would do well to consider what action is required at institutional level to ensure that the outstanding reforms are carried out.
What is the role of Parliament and of the Council in the legislative procedure (Article 202)?
Who actually controls economic policies?
To put it another way, are we heading towards an economic government or not?
Who represents the euro on the international stage?
Should we retain unanimity for fiscal issues when we number 27, so the smallest of all can veto any decision?
These are the issues the Council has outstanding.
I congratulate the Presidency-in-Office on the success of Barcelona. Congratulations are also due to the Spanish Government.
The latter would have been blamed for not providing enough police if unrest had taken place. Since there were enough police officers on duty, the authorities are being criticised instead for providing too many.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, votes are what counts, not shouting in the streets, and the signs are encouraging.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, who thinks that too few measures have been taken, I have to say that, as a Member and as vice-chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the measures proposed by national governments give me great cause for concern.
In the areas mentioned, the European Council is formulating objectives that in some cases are clearly cutting across the competence of Member States.
Even if open coordination is not specifically mentioned as a particularly suitable policy tool for these areas of policy, that cannot disguise the fact that the procedure that will continue to apply is that based on objectives and guidelines whose implementation by the Member States is subject to scrutiny at European level.
The end result is open coordination.
This procedure is highly undemocratic.
Neither the European Parliament nor national parliaments are involved in it. It amounts to a violation of the relevant treaties.
However, it is also an affront to the objective formulated by the governments in Laeken in December 2001 for the next intergovernmental conference and the most important theme of the convention, that is to say the dividing line in competence as between the EU and Member States.
What has become apparent from a constitutional point of view is the statement by the Barcelona Council that there should be a simplification of the process for the European Employment Strategy, and that in particular the number of employment policy guidelines should be reduced.
So who initiated this process?
It would be very difficult to demonstrate the need for a distinct division of competences more clearly.
All I can do is to call on the Heads of State and Government to respect the competences laid down in the relevant treaties and not to arrogate rights to themselves that are found neither in national constitutions nor in the European treaties.
The Council's exhortation to Member States to introduce more flexible working arrangements at national level will undoubtedly have a greater impact than utopian European targets and guidelines.
The Heads of State and Government should avoid not only the inflation of targets, but also an inflation of Councils, and should concentrate on realistic tasks for the European Union which are covered by the treaties.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the presidency and the European heads of State and government for their support and positive contribution to the process of revisiting the Treaty of Nice by Ireland.
Last June's referendum result was a major disappointment, particularly given the 30% turnout.
I continue to be perplexed at our Taoiseach's attempt to once again play the neutrality card in Barcelona in an effort to get the Nice Treaty supported.
I hope the Irish government will invest sufficient time in explaining the Treaty accurately and sincerely to all our citizens the second time around.
Irish people have, regrettably, been sold the benefits of the EU solely in economic terms while the moral and political imperative of assisting the countries of eastern and central Europe to rejoin the European family of nations has not been promoted.
I am confident that once this is done the Irish people will vote for the Nice Treaty and embrace the fact that it is a necessary provision for the enlargement of the EU.
If our Taoiseach's strategy is to insist upon a European Council declaration that Irish military neutrality is not affected by the Treaty of Nice, then he has once again misrepresented both the Treaty of Nice and Ireland's role in Partnership for Peace to his own people.
I would like to see him advocate unequivocally Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace and not play this duplicitous game.
It is, however, not surprising, coming from a government that has been talking out of both sides of its mouth on the EU for the past few years.
Difficult issues which this Irish government must face are attributed to Brussels bureaucracy or over-regulation, whilst any good news is claimed as an Irish ministerial achievement.
This attitude of risking the future of the fledgling democracies and emerging economies of central and eastern Europe has fed the eurosceptic vein in Ireland and is reflective of a government which would rather play short-term national political games for the sake of a few votes in an upcoming general election.
In conclusion, Mr President, for the record, Ireland has never been neutral nor could we afford to be.
It is not in our constitution nor our statute law.
Successive Taoisigh of the present government's persuasion including DeValera, Lemass, Cosgrove and Lynch have expressly stated that Ireland has no traditional policy of neutrality and would take foreign policy decisions on a case-by-case basis.
Ireland is today, and effectively always has been, a non-aligned country eager to play its own modest role in protecting peace and security around the globe.
The Nice Treaty in no way affects this status.
It will be up to the Irish parliament to decide what defence missions our forces become engaged in.
We are a proud people, proud of our long-term record of peacekeeping and peace-enforcing by our defence forces throughout the trouble spots of the world.
I believe we need to spell out clearly our present security and defence policy to the people of Ireland.
We must have an end to this type of dishonesty that characterised Fianna FÃ¡il's approach to the question of joining Partnership for Peace.
The Nice Treaty makes no change to the emerging Irish and European security architecture but it is the crucial next step to heal the historic divisions of Europe caused by war and destruction.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, at this time in the afternoon, after all the previous speeches, one feels that the vast majority of the points that can be covered have already been made.
Therefore, as a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to focus on and limit my speech to a few matters that were considered and decided upon at the Barcelona Summit, which many feel explain the success of the Summit and justify why it has been said that it went reasonably well.
As we can now see the end of the economic slowdown, there is a clear and determined commitment to get back to the Lisbon Strategy and to achieve the crucial objective that it set: full employment.
At times Europeans find it hard to believe, or, to look at it in another way, they tend to think, that Europe is always concerned with looking at what will have to be done in the future and that it is actually doing very little.
I would like to specifically highlight the decisions and agreements made at the Barcelona Summit, which, if properly presented, will enable those citizens who are currently not exactly enthusiastic to change their views.
There is, of course, the commitment to achieve full employment with more and better jobs and, what is more, before the end of this decade. There is also the commitment to tax reduction for the lowest salaries and to accentuate measures to motivate people to seek employment, to control unemployment and of course to encourage the incorporation of women into the labour market through various measures, many of which had already been highlighted here.
In addition there is the strategy for flexible extension of the length of the working life in view of the changes in our demography, the improvement in the transfer of social rights and employment mobility in general. These are all feelings and ideas, and therefore decisions, through which as European citizens we can take hold of and perceive Europe more and, what is more, we are going to take hold of it by strengthening the role of social partners, which makes us all jointly responsible in this magnificent task of constructing Europe, a Europe that is much more supportive and therefore fairer.
Thank you, Mr President.
I really have nothing to add to what the President-in-Office of the Council said in his first speech, particularly given that the majority of the Members that have asked me questions are not present.
In any case I would like to applaud the professionalism of the Presidents of the Parliamentary groups of the People's Party and the Socialist Party, who at least are present.
In any event, I would like to thank all those who have taken a positive view of the effort that the Spanish Presidency made in Barcelona, and say to those who expressed disappointment that it is logical and in the nature of things that the Presidency of the Union should be ambitious in setting these challenges, and it is also logical that not all the ambitions are realised, because that is part of the everyday life of the Union and has been since 1955. We are not going to create a new Union right now.
There is always an ambition to reach goals and then usually we have to make compromises, just as you have to do in Parliament, which does not achieve its ambitions all the time either.
I would therefore say that in this effort to adapt our ambitions to the realities of life and of political necessities, I think that it can be said that the results of Barcelona have been extraordinarily positive.
There have also been those who have highlighted certain elements while ignoring others, who are not aware of the true essence of the Lisbon Strategy, because the Lisbon Strategy provides a good balance between reform and economic liberalisation, social cohesion, the needs of education and research and sustainable development.
We cannot go further on some matters than on others. We need coordinated progress, and I think that there has been coordinated progress, because in all the areas that we have dealt with there has been positive and substantial progress that can be measured, and this is reflected in the conclusions.
Specifically, I have heard the repeated criticism that sustainable development has not been sufficiently reflected.
It surprises me that it should be said here that it is not enough that for the first time the Union has said that it wishes to, and formally undertakes to, ratify the Kyoto Protocol and that at the same time it has reached an agreement on development aid in Monterrey, which I think are two very important matters.
I think that this is much more than anyone could have expected.
The reason that Johannesburg was not mentioned more is that the Barcelona European Council cannot discuss Johannesburg further until the preparations for it begin in the United Nations.
We will discuss Johannesburg in detail in Seville, which is where the mandate will clearly be given in order for the Union to have a common position.
What there is in Barcelona at present is therefore sufficient and desirable.
Also, I would like to remind those who expressed their opinions on the demonstrators, attaching more importance to the demonstrators in the street than to the remainder of the European Council, and saying that they represent civil society, that, although those demonstrators are indeed European citizens, behind the European Council there are also many millions of silent citizens who voted for the parties represented by the governments that are there, sitting on the European Council, and that they are the true civil society.
That is the true civil society.
I do not wish to take away any legitimacy from those who demonstrate on the streets, but neither should we take away legitimacy from those who, through their political parties, support the governments who make the decisions.
I think that many of those who attach so much importance to those who demonstrate on the street have not learned the major lesson that European citizens taught to all of Europe when it came to accepting the euro.
They are the same people who said that people did not want anything to do with Europe or the euro, and so within a fortnight all European citizens accepted the euro, spontaneously and entirely voluntarily.
I therefore think that we need to learn a great deal from this about what people on the street think, and not think that it is only those who demonstrate, in what is a more than festive atmosphere, on the occasion of a European Council, who have democratic legitimacy in the Union, because that is not the case.
I would like to conclude by clearly expressing the Presidency's astonishment at the statement made by the representative of Herri Batasuna condemning the murder of an Italian politician by the Red Brigade terrorist group, while he has never protested about the numerous victims murdered by the terrorist group ETA, for which his party provides a political cover.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would first like to say that I think the results of Barcelona were positive overall. No one can deny this, although maybe there are those who wanted even more, and those, as we have heard today, who even wanted less in some respects, but in general the results were positive.
To a large extent the results were positive due to the work of three institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council, in other words, simply due to the correct functioning of the Community method, and I think that this is the first reason why we have to congratulate everyone here.
Barcelona produced results. Barcelona made progress insofar as, for a considerable amount of time, we have been working shoulder to shoulder, with particular cooperation from Parliament, making a considerable effort to enable those results to be produced.
Mr President, in Spain we say that the perfect is the enemy of the good, and that is what I would say to those who did not think that it was very much.
I think that we have to look at the results in all areas, including in foreign policy, on issues as important as the declaration on the Middle East, and I do not want to go on to other issues that are to a lesser degree within the scope of the Commission.
The balance is positive if we focus on matters that are very specifically the responsibility of the Commission and part of Community policy, when we talk about the progress on guaranteeing pensions, on employment, on the integration of the markets, on the creation of Europe, on providing a backbone in physical and spatial terms for its territory, for example through the interconnection of energy and transport, on support for environmental policy, not only in the specific environmental chapter, in which there are very important elements that were pointed out by Mr de Miguel a moment ago, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Monterrey agreements.
The same should be said of specific policies when, for example, in the transport chapter, in answer to one of the specific comments that has been made, we talk about promoting more environmentally friendly transport, such as the railways and maritime transport.
Considerable progress has also been made on energy, with a directive on the taxation of energy, something that is without doubt a key issue within the development model that we are advocating in Europe, which is in no way based on cheap energy, but quite the contrary.
When we look at all the progress that has been made, I repeat that the perfect is the enemy of the good, that there is a great deal of good and that the Community method has worked.
Finally, Mr President, very briefly, I must say that as a politician and a Member of Parliament for more than thirteen years - and I hope that one day the confidence of the Spanish people will mean that I can take on those tasks again - I want to make something very clear: political legitimacy lies in parliaments and democratically-elected governments, full stop.
Other types of demonstration, which represent what is called civil society, are very important, and any politician who wishes to continue to have popular support will take good note of what those demonstrations mean, and will incorporate what those social groups say as much as possible, but obviously what we cannot do is replace democracy and the democratic and political legitimacy of the votes that are cast for the representatives of the people with demonstrations, however important they may be, because they are completely different things and should not be confused.
They are different issues.
There were hundreds of thousands of citizens who demonstrated peacefully, as is usually the case with this type of demonstration, except at the last minute the hooligans appeared, whom we know and who unfortunately had not been intercepted by the State security forces in advance.
And there were a few problems.
However, Mr President, we repeat that legitimacy lies in this Parliament and in the national parliaments, and there was clearly legitimacy in the European Council with the Heads of State and Government of 15 democratic countries along with the Commission, which was taking part.
To conclude this debate the Presidency has received six motions for resolutions, which will be voted on at 7.00 p.m.
Mr Cox said at the end of the debate I should put forward my point of order so I request the floor.
You have the floor, Mr Gorostiaga, for a point of order.
Under Rule 122 I shall confine myself to rebutting the statement of one angry right-wing Spanish nationalist that breaches even the most basic norms of parliamentary courtesy.
It would be quite unacceptable if I were to refer to that colleague as the spokesman of the Spanish torturers, even if there is evidence of torture in Spanish police headquarters.
Such personal attacks must be ousted from this House forever.
I am confident that President Cox will do his best to avoid this kind of incident in the future.
Mr President, I am going to answer Mr Gorostiaga because I understand that he talked about me, and I will show respect where he has shown disrespect and parliamentary courtesy where he has shown discourtesy.
I just wished to point out that what I did in my speech was clearly point out that each time the President of Parliament courageously speaks out to condemn the cowardly murders by the terrorist group ETA, Mr Gorostiaga, taking advantage of the freedom that he has as a Member of this House, a freedom that his friends in the terrorist group ETA trample on every day, takes the opportunity to justify the unjustifiable.
Therefore, Mr President, the only thing that I wished to do was to ask how long we are going to have to tolerate this type of statement in this House, which is an offence to the memories of the victims and makes a mockery of the positions taken by Parliament?
Thank you Mr Salafranca.
This point of order has been sufficiently dealt with and we will now move on to the next item on the agenda.
The next item is the Commission and Council statements on the Annual Political Strategy for 2003.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 27 February the President, Mr Prodi, told you about the decisions taken by the Commission that day, most importantly the Commission's policy priorities for 2003 and the Commission's requirements in terms of human and financial resources.
As we said then, this year, for the first time, the three main institutions will conduct an in-depth dialogue on policy priorities and on the legislative and working programme for the coming year.
The dialogue will be conducted on the basis of the new understanding presented to the Conference of Presidents on 31 January and a new Council consultation procedure.
On 4 March we outlined the policy priorities for 2003 at the General Affairs Council, and we are involved in a structured coordination of work with the Greek and Italian Presidencies so as to achieve the best possible results with medium-term programming.
What we want to do is to base programming on a political dialogue with Member State representatives and citizens, thus using as a foundation the exercise of the Commission's exclusive right of initiative under the Treaty, in a process in which the different positions participate, and are listened to, as much as possible.
Of course in the final analysis the Commission must, I repeat, shoulder the responsibility laid on it by the Treaty.
But we shall exercise that prerogative in a way that is not only politically responsible, but also honest.
It should be done out in the light of day, not with a shopping list of 'good? intentions negotiated in the backrooms of any of the institutions.
In this respect I would like to urge the President of Parliament and Parliament as a whole to continue in their political efforts to promote the institution of Parliament as the supreme organ of democratic debate and codecision that can rise above questions of mere detail and of simply defending a few specific positions.
As you know, the Commission has set itself three priorities for 2003: firstly, enlargement, secondly, stability and security, and thirdly, a sustainable and socially inclusive economy.
From the time that it took up office, the Commission has been committed to the success of the enlargement process. Because enlargement remains a fundamental priority for the second half of our mandate.
From this point of view, 2003 will be a crucial year: we have to prepare to welcome into the Commission all the representatives, all the Commissioners from the new Member States and tackle the fresh challenges facing the Union.
But the Commission has decided to give priority to another area of action: first and foremost, stability and security.
Inside the Union our main objective is to speed up the creation of a European area of justice, security and freedom.
The fight against crime, in all its forms, including terrorism, and today more than ever it is once again appropriate to repeat that terrorism is included, is, and will remain, at the top of our agenda.
We should continue to pay particular attention to immigration and all the complex effects that it brings with it.
Solidarity with those who are trying to find a better life for themselves and their families must go hand in hand with a firm and orderly management of migratory flows at European level.
We need collaboration on border controls, exchange of information and common rules to govern the entry and re-entry of immigrants, and we also need to harmonise the rules governing the movement, handling, lives and conduct of all immigrants.
Outside the EU, another of our main priorities is to extend stability and security throughout the continent and to the regions bordering on the enlarged Union.
To achieve this, it is once again essential that we strengthen our partnerships with all neighbouring countries.
Our third priority for 2003, Mr President, is a sustainable and socially inclusive economy.
There are signs of recovery in the not too distant future.
However, the pace and strength of this recovery will also depend on how resolutely the Union implements the Lisbon Strategy.
The external dimension of this strategy is particularly important as it can help us to manage globalisation.
Our contribution should be directed towards distributing the fruits of recovery to as many countries as possible.
Ladies and gentlemen, another of the Commission's political priorities is solving the issue of inadequate human and financial resources, which can no longer be deferred.
The Annual Policy Strategy does not, therefore, simply identify our main political priorities, but also aims to ensure that the Commission has adequate resources for that task.
As President Prodi said on 27 February, this Commission will not undertake any mandate without having the necessary resources. This is quite simply because it would set us up for failure.
At this point we cannot properly prepare for enlargement without more staff.
So, after a rigorous screening exercise, the Commission has included in the Annual Policy Strategy a request for 500 non-permanent staff.
It will be clear to you that this is a rock-bottom figure, still well below what we need to carry out enlargement-related tasks in 2003.
We all know that the current ceiling for administrative expenses does not allow sufficient resources to prepare for enlargement.
So the Commission considers it essential to use the flexibility instrument.
It is not enough, but it is all we have.
We also have two other major aims: security and establishing a policy to promote a sustainable economy, which give the Commission more responsibilities.
However, to avoid having to ask for yet more staff we have decided to approve initiatives only if they can be carried out by internally redeploying our existing staff or simply by terminating some activities that are being conducted.
Mr President, this shows how seriously and rigorously the Commission is committed to its priorities, without ignoring budgetary discipline.
On the financial resources side, I would like to point out that the Commission and the Budgetary Authorities must urgently find a structural solution to the chronic inadequacy of Heading 4, external relations.
These tasks cannot be done properly under the current constraints.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the Commission is setting out the main areas of work.
This debate will be followed by debates in each of the committees, which will be attended by the Commissioners along with their members.
This will be the time to further define and prepare those main areas of work.
In any case, allow me to thank you on behalf of the whole Commission for your constructive and practical contribution to ensuring the best possible management of our priorities for 2003.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency listened with particular interest to the presentation by the Vice President, Mrs De Palacio, of the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2003, which is the first phase of the cycle of planning and programming of the priorities set by the Commission. The idea is not only to identify those priorities but also to analyse the best way of rationally using the financial and human resources of the Union.
I think it is particularly satisfactory that the priorities identified by the Commission, such as enlargement, stability and security, and a sustainable and socially inclusive economy, are very much in line with those that the Presidency itself and the European Union as a whole have defined and which have been confirmed by the European Council in Barcelona, about which the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Spanish Government, has just informed this House.
The Presidency welcomes the Commission's intention to enter into dialogue on the strategy presented, in which the budgetary implications will have to be a fundamental element.
There will therefore have to be careful preparation in order to link the debate on the strategic priorities with the budgetary procedure for 2003.
The Council has already had some exchanges of opinion and considers that the General Affairs Council in May could include on its agenda an initial political debate on the Commission's strategic priorities for 2003.
In this way the budgetary aspects, which in the Presidency's opinion should include the implications that enlargement could have in terms of expenditure such as the need for premises, could be analysed at the most appropriate time within the general framework of the budgetary procedure.
The Presidency is not ruling out the first political debate on the Commission's strategy being followed, during next autumn, under the Danish Presidency, by a fresh discussion closer to the time when the decision will be taken on the Union budget.
Mr President, the Presidency would like to repeat that it is prepared to support the strategic priorities proposed by the Commission and to look in detail at their budgetary implications at the appropriate time.
Mr President, my group welcomes the fact that this debate is taking place this evening because this is the first time that we have been able to have an annual policy strategy debate this early in the process of the budget for 2003.
The fact that the Council - although it might not be listening - is actually present in this debate is an important sign that the three institutions should indeed be working coherently together.
My first point is that we are looking at a significant change in the process of doing things where, firstly, we have a definition of Commission policy priorities, secondly we are trying to ensure the right match between tasks and measures for 2003 and, thirdly, that we welcome this idea of having a strengthened institutional dialogue so that we can ensure that the budget is actually collectively decided.
Of course, that debate starts here and now in March 2002.
So, are the priorities the right ones?
It is still very early in the day to know that but the fact is that we have been able to find: enlargement, stability and security, and the sustainable inclusive economy.
It is very difficult to find a subject which does not fall under those three but, in the light of the way in which this has been prepared, we in this House and our committees will find the right way in debates to put forward where we think the priorities lie.
There will surely be debates, for example, on enlargement.
Can the Commission, as it says, complete the linguistic and administrative preparations for enlargement during 2003?
Can it continue to implement the reform of the Commission so it will be entirely modernised by the end of 2004?
These are questions that we are clearly going to have to raise and the same applies to stability and security.
The wish is expressed to set up the European Food Safety Agency and get it operational.
As far as I know this decision has not yet been taken and, therefore, we need to be clear about what we are trying to do in these debates.
Clearly, in the sustainable inclusive economy there are a whole range of different issues in terms of having the human and financial resources available.
This raises the point of your 500 non-permanent posts, which we are going to have to examine in detail.
To conclude, this debate is something which is to be welcomed.
This document sets out a number of clear targets to be achieved in which we, in Parliament and the Council, will have to participate.
Hopefully we will be able to end the year with the better matching of budget and legislative procedures which we have been asking for.
I would conclude by noting that there is one major point on the availability of financial resources.
It clearly says in the document that payments will be restricted, not just for the repayment of outstanding commitments but that payments should be contained elsewhere in the budget so as to make sure we do not go over the ceilings required.
Therefore, 2003 will be an exceptionally difficult year but we have started early enough to find the right kind of solutions.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the Commission defines the broadening of its point of focus as one of its priorities for the year 2003.
Mr Elles has perhaps taken a somewhat cynical view of that.
Nevertheless, I consider it right and proper, because the impression might otherwise be created that, when we conclude the treaties with the candidate countries in 2002 - and I hope there will be ten of these treaties - everything will have been done and dusted.
This, however, is certainly not the case.
It would also promote the ratification process and the assent procedure in this House if we had some initiatives from the Commission, particularly if they were scheduled for the year 2003.
For example, the new Member States must be prepared for the assumption of full participatory rights within the European Union.
Practice is also needed in the peaceful and amicable solution of conflicts.
I hope this will not be confined to Cyprus; recent debates in this very House suggest that it is needed between Slovakia and Hungary or between the Czech Republic and Hungary, and even Austria and Germany are to some degree affected by it.
The entire cohesion policy has to be transformed and restructured.
Only today we had a hearing on the White Paper devoted to transport.
It is good that the Vice-President of the Commission is present.
If we really want to develop the trans-European networks and contribute to cohesion, 2003 will be a particularly busy year.
A great deal of assistance must be given to the future Member States to enable them to adapt to Community standards of administration and justice, for example in the fight against fraud.
And so 2003, especially in terms of enlargement, will be an absolutely decisive year.
That should not be underestimated.
But 2003 will also be a year in which we must try to provide answers to countries that are not candidates for accession but are considering the possibility of applying.
Ukraine is one of those countries.
We had Mr Shevardnadze here from Georgia too and had some discussions on that point.
In Russia too the subject is discussed.
In the last hour we have spoken about Croatia with a Croatian delegation.
There are questions here that we shall be asked to answer.
We have not taken any steps so far to draw definitive borders or to define what the Europe of the Union is to be, because there will still be a Europe beyond our frontiers.
So on these questions too we shall have to find answers, or at least provisional answers, in 2003.
Another task for 2003 is the development of some visions as to the nature of our intensified and institutionalised cooperation with those countries that will not be members of the European Union but will not be complete outsiders either.
Russia is one example; the countries of the Mediterranean region are others.
It is important that we develop new ideas, that we cooperate with those specific countries that are neither in nor entirely out of the European sphere.
This particular cooperation will also be very important as a means of fostering stability and security, the second defined priority.
In this respect, it has to be clearly stated that Europe must do its homework.
We cannot always rely on the United States to intervene.
Nor do we want to be constantly dependent on U.S. intervention.
One part of this is certainly the need to resist the hegemonic aspirations of the United States, but we in Europe must also learn to assume a more prominent role ourselves, at least in our immediate sphere of interest.
In this respect too, 2003 will be an important year, for example with regard to the funding of joint assignments.
Madam Vice-President, in order to do what it intends to do, the Commission naturally needs two things. The first is money, about which my honourable colleague will speak shortly, and the second is innovative governance and regulation.
Unfortunately, the Commissioner is speaking at this very moment to the President-in-Office of the Council, whom I also wished to address.
Perhaps he would have a moment to listen.
Mr Miguel, I wanted to say something to you.
Maybe someone could give the President-in-Office a set of headphones so that he can briefly listen to what I have to say.
I wanted to say something to you about the question of alternative governance and regulation.
I am grateful for the reply that Mr Aznar gave, but may I ask you to convey to him that his answer, following on from a previous reply he gave us in this House, did shed a little light for us on the domain of international cooperation but was certainly not entirely satisfactory.
The fact is that the suggestion put forward by the Commission and the speech delivered by Mr Cox, Parliament's President, in Barcelona made it clear that we need a political agreement between the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
When the heads of government deal with other forms of governance - which I welcome - I believe it is only right that the parliamentarians in this House should concern themselves with it too.
The Secretary-General may prepare something, but decisions must be taken by political bodies, of which this Parliament is one.
(Applause)
Two years ago I spoke in the debate on the annual legislative programme on behalf of the Liberal Group, and I was very critical of the old process which I described as the swapping of shopping lists between Parliament and Commission.
Now we have a proper process, a proper interinstitutional dialogue.
We have in front of us now a broad strategy tailored to the overriding political goal of enlargement and few of us would disagree with the broad picture and, indeed, the early attempt to attach budgetary implications.
Now the real process will start with detailed consideration in Parliament's committees and this is what is paramount.
At last there is meaningful involvement of Parliament and I have no doubt the committees will start to flesh out a final legislative programme.
This is a welcome change in our working methods and should allow us to plan and prepare our legislative work much better.
Added to these developments, the Legal Affairs Committee had an historic joint meeting with national parliamentarians, this morning, to discuss the EU legislative process and how Community law is implemented.
There can be no doubt that colleagues in national parliaments need fair warning of what we will be dealing with and when.
This will allow them to input to us or to hold their ministers in the Council to account in a meaningful way.
It was clear from our discussion that those Member States who allow their national parliamentarians early involvement in the process have far less difficulty implementing Community legislation.
Their citizens are more comfortable with the process and the final result has increased legitimacy.
That is the real connection we are all striving to obtain with our citizens so there are thankfully new winds blowing through our legislative process.
The convention may unleash a few more but I am glad to see that those wretched shopping lists have gone at the first blast.
The annual policy strategy for 2003 contains some key initiatives on the development of a sustainable and inclusive economy.
In particular, the Commission wishes to tackle the mid-term review of the CAP and the reform of the CFP.
Together these two major policy areas swallow half of the total EU budget but both the CAP and CFP have failed to meet their core objectives.
They have failed to safeguard jobs.
They have failed to secure a fair standard of living for our rural communities and they have failed to achieve sustainability.
With that record of failure radical reform is long overdue and I am pleased to see that such proposals are central to the policy strategy for 2003.
Indeed, in mid-April, the European Commission will publish its legislative proposals for the reform of the common fisheries policy.
The centrepiece of this reform package will surely be devolution, devolving fisheries management to key stakeholders in discrete fishing zones.
Although these committees will only act in an advisory capacity, at least initially, by involving fishermen, scientists and marine ecologists they will mark a dramatic step towards decentralisation of power, away from Brussels, and back to the grass roots.
At a time of collapsing fish stocks, diminishing fleets, lost jobs, decommissioning, tie-ups and lay-offs, such an initiative could not come too soon and is to be greatly welcomed.
In the EU we have far too many fishermen chasing far too few fish.
We need an overall cut in the capacity of around 40% of the fleet, but let me make a special plea to the Commission and to the Council.
Please do not export our problems of over-fishing and over-exploitation of resources out of the EU and into third countries.
Recent case studies in Mauritania and Senegal show that they have depleted stocks.
In Mauritania, catches of octopus have halved in the past four years.
Some species, such as sawfish, have disappeared altogether.
I applaud the policy strategy for seeking sustainable and inclusive objectives but let us remember such objectives must apply outside the EU just as much as inside.
Mr President, on the subject of the area of freedom, security and justice, the Commission reminds us first of all how the fight against terrorism must always be in the foreground.
On this point we can only say that we fully agree.
The barbaric assassination of Professor Marco Biagi in Bologna yesterday tragically confirms the need for this commitment.
We must, however, declare that we also agree with everything that the President-in-Office, Mr Aznar, has said here today, which is that right now we have the means to overcome terrorism.
Besides, all the European institutions have demonstrated great sensitivity and a sense of urgency in adopting the measures demanded by the sudden exacerbation of this kind of political crime.
It is in other sectors that the area of freedom, security and justice is being slow to develop, certainly through no fault of this Parliament and, in fact, not primarily through any fault of the Commission.
The European Union does not carry out the duties conferred on it by the Treaty of Amsterdam in the area of immigration and asylum because of the obstacles raised by the Council, its inability to reach an agreement on the Commission's proposals, and its decisions time after time to adopt individual repressive instruments that impoverish any policy in this area and by themselves make it inadequate.
It is a political problem to recover the will and the ability to use the instruments of civilisation to address this complex problem, which involves international relations, joint regulations and instruments for border control, and taking joint responsibility for the costs we have to meet and also for the objectives of cultural and economic enrichment that the challenge of integration poses for us.
It is also, however, an institutional problem.
The unanimity rule is paralysing; the lack of codecision is antidemocratic.
The principles on which the European Union is founded - democracy and the Rule of Law, and hence subjection to judicial control - need to be extended to all areas of action relating to the security and freedom of the citizens.
Including Europol in the Union's institutional framework is just one example of this need.
The Commission could very usefully contribute a well-argued set of proposals on these matters to the Convention on the Future of Europe, which has just opened.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we have a paper from the Commission on the table, on which I merely wish to say that I am astonished time and again by the consummate skill with which Commission officials can fill twenty-eight pages without saying anything of real substance.
This at least has the strategic advantage of ensuring that they cannot subsequently be compelled to honour their commitments.
May I say, Commissioner De Palacio, that these remarks naturally do not apply to the chapters for which you are responsible but to other chapters in this and other papers.
Nevertheless, this is what we have now, and so I believe we ought to comment on it.
As far as the single market is concerned, I can say on the basis of my experience of past years in this House that we are still far from having a single market which works truly effectively in every area.
Major deficits still exist.
I believe that the Commission should focus on the elimination of these deficits as one of its top priorities for 2003.
In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have just been debating the Directive concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services at second reading stage.
It has emerged once again that insurance services are one of those areas in which there is still no functioning single market but only compartmentalised national markets.
As I said, there are still considerable deficits.
The Commission's reports have shown that we have the same problem in other sectors of the economy too with the implementation of freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment.
We have a report from the Commission that has already been discussed in committee and will no doubt soon have further repercussions, a report which deals with specific deficits in the realm of freedom to provide services.
Time does not permit me to go into the various specific examples, but I would urge the Commission to continue the systematic pursuit of this approach and to ensure that we ultimately have a genuine functioning single European market.
Let me mention one last point that was also discussed this morning at the meeting with members of the national parliaments. In January, Parliament adopted a report on further steps towards convergence in the realm of civil and commercial law.
May I ask the Commission, and especially the Commissioners with the relevant portfolios, to forge ahead with these efforts and to present a Green Paper or White Paper as soon as possible to give us a firm idea of the direction in which we are heading.
This, I believe, is quite crucial as a means of ensuring that the single market not only exists and operates to the advantage of big business but that consumers and smaller businesses also have the opportunity to make full use of the options offered by the single market.
We are building the single market first and foremost for the people of Europe, not for the sole benefit of large companies.
Hence my plea to forge ahead with increased vigour and increased energy, even in the face of the opposition which, as experience shows, is always encountered in some Member States.
Mr President, I have learned the wisdom and educational value of tempering criticism with praise.
For this reason, Commissioner De Palacio, let me begin with a word of praise.
It is gratifying that we have finally managed to engage in a very early and timely debate on a strategic plan and that this dialogue between the Commission and Parliament and the specialised committee within Parliament has been launched in sufficiently good time.
I refer expressly to these two institutions, because the role of the Council, in my view, may be disregarded.
In Barcelona, we saw that the Council sets its own agenda and does what it wants and acts as a higher-grade specialised council.
That is why the dialogue between you, Commissioner De Palacio, as the representative of the Commission, and Parliament is the only one that counts in this context.
And then comes the criticism, but I can even present that in a favourable light.
Commissioner De Palacio, if you ever see a job vacancy that involves selling a defective product, apply for it.
You would give it your best shot.
You have tried to do your best for a document that I did not understand.
I marvel at anyone who has read this document and understood the message that is locked within its sentences.
I reflected on ways of sniffing something out of this text.
Would a guide dog help?
Or how about a Saint Bernard that can detect signs of life below an avalanche?
Some kind of tracker dog is needed, Commissioner De Palacio.
The Commission has managed to pepper this document with every conceivable reference.
The term 'consumer protection' crops up, and the concept of sustainability pops up here, there and everywhere, wherever it can possibly be squeezed in - sustainable transport, a sustainable economy, sustainable everything.
But the document did not reveal to me what you actually intend to do and what your priorities are.
At no point could I grasp what your real priorities are.
Yes, there is enlargement, and yes, there is sustainable economic growth, perhaps security and stability too.
But how you intend to achieve these things, Commissioner De Palacio, is concealed beneath a veneer of ornate prose.
So when you return to the Commission, tell your fellow Commissioners what we shall all no doubt be telling them personally: they need to do their homework better next year.
The challenge for us as a Parliament is now to take this skeleton you have presented to us and flesh it out with meaningful substance.
If this were a piece of schoolwork, it would be returned with the comment 'A good effort, but improvement is needed for next time'.
And that is my message to you.
Mr President, painstaking efforts are needed to find any reference at all to the political domain of agriculture and rural development in this 28-page Commission strategy paper for 2003.
The word 'agriculture' is mentioned all of three times in the course of one three-page section.
This is perhaps due in part to the fact that the codecision procedure does not yet apply to agricultural legislation.
At the same time, we are called upon for the first time to participate in the strategic assessment of issues such as enlargement, the WTO talks, the development of the Budget and the mid-term evaluation.
On enlargement, the plan is to conclude the accession negotiations with the applicant countries in 2003, and then enlargement could begin in 2004.
We are all well aware of the monumental tasks that await the Commission, Parliament and the Council in the areas of agriculture and rural development in 2003.
In this respect, enlargement will also be a top priority of agriculture policy in 2003 and will require great negotiating skills.
Yesterday's hearing on this subject in the Committee on Budgets highlighted the amount of work that is still to be done.
Close dialogue with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is essential, as is better use of the resources allocated to pre-accession aid.
In the WTO context, agriculture also plays a key role.
And so I say to our friends in the Commission that we expect you to provide us with continuous information and consultation on progress in the WTO trade talks.
You yourselves refer on page 14 of your crazy paper to a decisive phase in these negotiations.
On the Budget, following the result of the vote on the FÃ€rm report, or, to be more specific, the adoption by this chamber of Guideline No 9, care should be taken to ensure that the amended mid-term evaluation is taken into account as far as possible in the 2003 Budget.
This quite simple precept will cause huge headaches, particularly in view of the fact that the Member States are becoming increasingly accustomed to receiving substantial ring-fenced rebates of unused resources from the agricultural budget; these bonuses are particularly welcome, since they can save some countries from the prospect of an admonitory letter from Brussels.
The strategic imperative for 2003 must therefore be full and more efficient utilisation of the agricultural budget, including flexible use of resources for new rural development programmes.
One very important requirement is that quality must play a more important role in the allocation of aid under the common agricultural policy.
Even non-farmers can see the point of compensatory payments that are based on quality.
Mr President, as rapporteur for this year's budget, I have a number of matters to address in that connection.
First of all, I am really not as critical as Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
I think it is important for us now to acquire an annual policy strategy which also constitutes the Commission's guideline for next year's budget.
At present, all the institutions issue their guidelines in the spring, and the hope now exists that the Commission will also base its draft budget on ideas from the Council and Parliament.
If so, that would be a clear improvement.
Secondly, quite a few MEPs have pointed out that we need to strengthen the link between the Commission's legislative programme and the issues concerning the budget.
Up until now, we have all too often ended up in a position in which we have obtained draft laws and proposals for new programs and expenditure and for setting up new institutions and so on, with no account being taken of the budgetary process and the financial consequences.
It is especially in the sphere of foreign policy that a variety of promises are given.
There is still a fair amount to be done in this area, but this year's process is nonetheless a step in the right direction.
Thirdly, we can at least be pleased about the section on interinstitutional cooperation.
If it is going to be possible to create an EU that operates well, such cooperation and confidence are crucial.
It is therefore a source of deep concern to us to learn now that discussions of the new budget regulation, designed to reduce Parliament's influence, are being held within the Council.
The Council's budget committee is discussing reducing our opportunities to place sums in the reserve and to influence supplementary and amending budgets and so forth. If the Council continues along those lines, it will call the institutional balance into question in a way that Parliament will never accept voluntarily.
Fourthly, I want to address a factual matter.
It is gratifying that all the institutions are now highlighting enlargement, which is of course the most important task for our time.
I hope that, by no later than the budget conciliation in July, we shall be able to agree upon how we are to handle next year's administrative expenditure in such a way as to facilitate the preparations, partly by providing aid to construction, working on the language issues, deciding what staff need to be appointed and determining what regulations need to be drawn up if we are to be able to accept observers in our political groups.
If all the institutions contribute by regarding these matters as important, we shall in actual fact have a chance of reaching such an agreement by no later than July.
That would be an enormous boost.
Finally, I hope that, before the negotiations are completed, the Council and the Commission will also institute an exhaustive discussion with Parliament concerning the long-term economic consequences of enlargement.
I really do believe in enlargement, but we must not conceal from the taxpayers the fact that there is a price to pay.
That is a matter which must be taken seriously.
Mr President, although it may have no effect, given the amount of movement in the House, I would like to thank you all for taking the time to read the twenty-eight pages, including Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
I think that the twenty-eight pages succeeded in highlighting the positive elements, as Mr Swoboda said. Because there are some tables in Chapter 3, paragraphs 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, that give more specific details on the political proposals for the coming year.
I would like to say that we are at the beginning of the year; this is the start of the period of discussion and dialogue with the different committees by the different Commissioners, and then we will continue working so that throughout the autumn we can have debates, concluding the process in November with the formal presentation by the President of the Commission in the plenary.
Once again, I would like to congratulate you all and thank you for your work, and hope that this experience, which we are beginning with this debate today, will benefit the functioning of the institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
I hope that it will produce good results and that, in the end, we will feel that we have taken a step forward in interinstitutional cooperation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mr President, since I made a critical remark about the statements made by Prime Minister JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, who is represented here, for having explained - at least to me - that it is incumbent upon Parliament to send our political representatives to the interinstitutional working party.
That has clarified the matter, and I wanted to pass on this explanation to the House.
The next item is the vote.
Motion for a resolution RC B5-0180/2002
Mr President, in the interests of furthering our schoolchildren's education, we should publish the European Parliament's enthusiastic motions for resolution on the various summits, along with the harsh criticism of the summit that was recently expressed by a witness who cannot be reproached, since it was Mr Javier Solana.
The same applies to today's resolution as much as to previous ones.
It sends the public into raptures.
As far as we are concerned, we have seen the real situation and we say that a Europe, which is not a social Europe, is not our own.
I did not vote against the Barcelona European Council resolution, Mr President, because I am a staunch pro-European: I am in favour of Europe.
I did not vote for it, either, Mr President, because there is something in this document that I do not find convincing: above all, I am not convinced by something in the statement and the results of the Barcelona European Council.
What am I not convinced by?
The fifteen Heads of State and Government in the Council have agreed to make workers work five years longer, from an average age of 57 to an average age of 62.
They announced this brilliant proposal publicly.
Bravo!
Well done!
But rather than making those workers who already have a job work longer, would it not be better to commit to getting the unemployed who do not have a job into work? There are so many of them, and they are mostly young.
The Pensioners' Party is therefore against raising the pensionable age, whether on a voluntary basis, as it should be, or on a mandatory basis, for as long as there is still a single person out of work in Europe.
Mr President, the reason I and many Conservative, or European Democrat, colleagues abstained on the vote overall is that there is an unacceptable reference in Paragraph 37 to the UK/Spanish talks on the future of Gibraltar which in no way takes into consideration the views of the 30,000 Gibraltarians who clearly wish to retain their sovereign link with Britain.
The UK Labour Government has little interest in defending their cause, and has informed Gibraltar that it will be marginalised and financially pressured into falling into line with UK European strategic goals if they do not support the outcome of the talks.
It is my belief that if this becomes reality Gibraltar should seek self-determination or some sort of Andorra-type solution.
If the Spanish government disagrees it should consider what its response would be if Portugal were to insist on its treaty right to have Olivenca returned by Spain or Morocco were to insist on Ceuta and Mellila becoming theirs.
. (EL) ?he Communist Party of Greece is delighted that hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest about EU policy, a policy of poverty and unemployment, of privatisation and liberalisation.
These demonstrations are a sign of optimism and show that the grass-roots movement is stepping up its fight to overturn this anti-grass roots policy.
The leaders of the ?U, for their part, have stated that poverty and unemployment will be combated by developing entrepreneurship, reducing state aid and increasing employability and flexible work and they have been quick to formulate objectives such as speeding up the reform of pension systems and pushing the retirement age up five years by 2010.
This is the much vaunted "social model" which is supposed to bring about full employment and make the ?U the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world.
Infighting has stopped the privatisation of the energy market from being completed at this stage.
However, they are united on the Middle East, declaring that the Palestinian Authority bears full responsibility for combating terrorism and making friendly overtures towards Israel.
They have maintained a guilty silence on American threats to Iraq and plans to develop new nuclear weapons, but have little patience with the lack of progress on the "Euro army", which will allow them to take over from NATO in the FYROM.
The resolution by the European Parliament is a commendation of the anti-grass roots policy of the EU, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it.
The Barcelona European Council held on 15 and 16 March is another of those 'technical summits' that takes decisions which pass by unnoticed.
In this case, rather than decisions, the rules by which the Member States have to abide are being made progressively stricter by means of some far from democratic procedures.
In the run-up to the Council, Mr Romano Prodi sent a letter to the Heads of State and Government, setting out what - and I quote from that letter - 'the Commission expects from the Barcelona European Council'.
This is a particularly daring role reversal.
The letter launches, in particular, an appeal to tighten up economic coordination, a subject on which I have already spoken during the debate, and also voices the requirement for a more timely transposition of European legislation by the Member States.
The Council repeated these two points in its conclusions without questioning, in particular, the essential role of the national Parliaments in transposing EU law.
(Speech shortened pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(PT) As stated in the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the United European Left, of which we are members, the Barcelona Summit addressed some extremely important issues, specifically with regard to pursuing and speeding up the privatisation, liberalisation and deregulation of the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors and important aspects of workers' rights. The summit also insisted that the Stability Pact continue to be strictly applied.
Regrettably, the European Council once again attached the greatest importance to structural reforms of the labour market based on greater flexibility, greater job insecurity and wage moderation.
It is also a matter of concern that the Council recommended a five-year increase to the average retirement age, which, apart from anything, betrays the dangerous route we are taking of threatening social protection, which must be maintained and strengthened in order to provide support for the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
Therefore, as stated during the magnificent demonstrations staged by the trades union movement that ran in tandem with the Council in Barcelona, despite the attempts, worthy of our condemnation, by the Spanish Government and police to break up and suppress these events, what is needed is a change of policy and not more of the same.
It is crucial that we protect public services, put an end to liberalisations and to the increasing insecurity of the labour market, and crucial that we fight against neoliberalism and advocate a different type of society; a fairer society and one which demonstrates greater solidarity.
Hence our vote against the joint motion for a resolution by the other political groups, which we do not agree with.
With this vote, Parliament is being asked to ratify the decisions taken at the Barcelona European Council.
We are being asked to agree to the full liberalisation of the energy sector by 2004, regardless of public service obligations based on the principles of continuity of service, equal access and treatment of all users, land planning and protection of the environment.
We are being asked to give a free hand in the deregulation of air transport through the single sky project and in the continued liberalisation of the railways.
We are being asked to agree to increase the average retirement age by 5 years and to establish a pension fund.
We are being asked to approve structural reforms of the labour market introducing flexible working conditions, job insecurity and wage moderation.
In fact, we are being asked to say yes to the liberal Europe that has no social element.
No, we cannot vote in favour of the outcome of the Barcelona Council and we fully support the message sent out by 100 000 trade unionists and 400 000 protestors who peacefully denounced the 'Europe of capital' and called for a different kind of Europe and a different kind of globalisation.
. The Barcelona Council, despite the big talk by Tony Blair before it, was disappointing and timid.
The Council promised in the past to put sustainability in the forefront of European Development.
This Summit has paid no more than lip-service to this commitment.
The so-called 'liberalization' favoured by Blair's right wing caucus has hit the rock of French immoveability in relation to energy production in the domestic sector, so it remains the case that ElectricitÃ© de France can take over companies outside France while protected from converse interventions.
The rhetoric of liberalisation too frequently cloaks policies toward the single market that are dancing to the tune of monopolistically inclined interests of vast corporations.
Adam Smith's vision of a free economy unhampered by interventions of massive aggregations of capital is far from the reality that we see in the contemporary globalised economy.
In relation to Gibraltar, no one can fail to welcome progress between Spain and the United Kingdom.
But there is no reference to the people of Gibraltar.
What has become of self-determination?
.
(NL) We cannot live without work, but that certainly does not mean that an increase in employment enhances our lives.
This is where two opinions clash.
According to the Left, we must ensure that together we produce what we want to consume, whereby we distribute jobs and income as fairly as possible and protect people from high stress levels at work and long working hours.
The opinion from the Right, on the other hand, states that we must continuously pursue economic growth by forcing women with young children, handicapped people and many pensioners to do paid work.
Only the very elderly and those who can live off the interest on their own capital are exempt from this.
Economic growth is always upheld most forcefully by those who refuse to share their wealth with the less well-off and who, for this reason, want to deflect attention from the distribution issue.
In order to preserve the status quo in wealth distribution between rich and poor, they call for everyone to get more.
Today, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar, and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, are acclaiming the further liberalisation and integration of markets, cost reduction and a yet larger European share in the global economy.
Too few in this Parliament focus on the damage which the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits cause to the welfare of people, public services and the conservation of the natural environment.
The price is too high in my opinion. This is why I reject the outcome.
- (SV) I have abstained from voting in the final vote on the resolution, which was adopted by 211 votes to 58, with 34 abstentions.
The reason is that I object to paragraphs 25, 35 and 37.
According to paragraph 25, the European Parliament wishes to have a review of 'the open method of coordination between Member States in areas such as pensions, healthcare and education, to ensure that the European Parliament is fully involved in the work of the Council and Commission in these areas'.
Parliament thus brings open coordination into question as a method and wishes to introduce a process that abandons intergovernmental decision-making within these fundamental national areas of legislation in favour of the Community method and supranationalism, with the European Parliament as co-decision-maker.
As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I object to that development.
Paragraph 35, concerning Zimbabwe, should have been much more vigorous in condemning the widespread violence to which the opposition MDC movement has been exposed during the election campaign at the hands of President Mugabe's regime and of those who perpetrate outrages on its behalf, as well as in condemning the killings, including the continued, racially motivated murders of white farmers.
Paragraph 37, concerning Gibraltar, makes no mention at all of the people of Gibraltar and of their expressed political will.
Citizens are fundamental to a democracy.
Two days ago, they manifested their clear and unambiguous rejection of attempts by Great Britain and Spain to decide the fate of Gibraltar without listening to the people.
On this issue, the European Parliament is forfeiting the perspective of the people, and that is a serious matter.
I wish to raise a point of order concerning the conditions in which the debate has been held.
I would like to express my profound unease at the intolerable behaviour of Vice-President Vidal-Quadras, a member of the Spanish Partido Popular, in giving the floor to his political friend, Mr Salafranca, when under Rule 122 there was no reason for it, while denying me the right to reply to him.
You can check it on the video, Mr President.
This partisan attitude of Vice-President Vidal-Quadras ought to be condemned most firmly because the credibility of this House depends on it.
I have taken note of your point, Mr Gorostiaga.
That concludes the explanations of vote
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 14 March 2002.
May I inform the House that I have taken the chair because Mr Cox is on his way back to Strasbourg from Great Britain, having travelled there earlier today to pay his respects to the royal family on the occasion of the death of the Queen Mother.
We shall be observing a minute's silence in memory of the Queen Mother tomorrow.
Ladies and gentlemen, a tragic incident took place in the town of Nanterre in France on the night of Tuesday 26 March.
An armed man gunned down members of the municipal council during a council meeting, leaving eight councillors dead and fourteen very seriously wounded.
May I express my deepest condolences and sympathy on behalf of the European Parliament to the town of Nanterre, to the municipal council and to the victims' families.
I should also like to praise the courage of the members of the council who managed to overpower the intruder.
Elsewhere, JuÃ¡n Priede PÃ©rez, the only Socialist councillor in the village of Orio in the Basque country, was murdered by two terrorists on 21 March.
The House sent its condolences and sympathy to Mr Priede's family and to the Chairman of the Spanish Socialist party the very same day.
We also sent a message of support to the Spanish authorities.
In murdering JuÃ¡n Priede PÃ©rez, the terrorists demonstrated yet again that they deny not only the right to life but, in this case, the right to life of a man who had dedicated himself to the welfare of his fellow citizens.
They even deny the right to attend local political events and the right to exercise democratic rights.
Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to join me in a minute's silence for these two incidents.
(?he House rose and observed a minute's silence)
Mr President, I know that a resolution is going to be adopted on the problem of Israel and Palestine during this sitting, but I believe we cannot start it without remembering that there have been 200 murders in Palestinian territory and that the Palestinian people are being humiliated by the army of a State.
I therefore believe that we need this sitting to begin also...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, may I ask you to repeat your comment when we get to the debate on the Middle East.
Mr President, on a point of order, I should like, through you, to thank President Cox for his visit to the UK today.
In that context, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, may I say that a number of my British colleagues wish to participate at least in some way in the occasion of the state funeral of the Queen Mother tomorrow. That is to take place at 12.30 p.m.
I have raised the matter in my group, which supports my request, that the vote tomorrow might be brought forward to 11.30 a.m. so that all British Members who wish to can at least watch the state funeral at 12.30 p.m.
Mr President, I would like to thank you for the comments you made earlier and to say briefly to the House and to the citizens who are listening, that when terrorists become madmen and when madmen become terrorists and kill Members of Parliament, at a time when civilians are the target of increasingly ruthless attacks which seek to eliminate politicians and MPs, it is worthwhile recalling that these people, these MPs, are showing utmost courage to protect the public good.
Mr President, I would like, respectfully, to point out that, very often, when we rise and observe a minute's silence, the people in the public gallery remain comfortably in their seats.
Considering that those people are European citizens too, I feel that they should also rise and observe a minute's silence with us.
Mr President, on a point of order, in connection with the point raised by Mr Evans, I too would like to thank President Cox for his visit to London today to pay his respects on behalf of the European Parliament on the occasion of the death of the Queen Mother.
I hope that the Conference of Presidents can give positive consideration to the request made by Mr Evans that the votes be brought forward tomorrow morning, so as to enable those British Members, and other Members, who may want to watch the funeral on television to do so.
Thank you, Mr Murphy.
The draft agenda, as finalised by the Conference of Presidents of the political groups at its meeting on 4 April, has been distributed in accordance with Rule 110.
Tuesday:
The Group of the Party of European Socialists has asked for the vote on the joint debate of the six discharge reports of the Committee on Budgetary Control to be held at noon on Wednesday.
The Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, who tabled the request for the vote to be moved, has the floor.
Mr President, the postponement of the debate is proposed specifically in relation to the Morgan report referring to the other institutions.
But of course the discharge is a joint vote.
And the reason is that the Council has to take a step forward in relation to Parliament on the specific issue of the implementation of the foreign and security policy and its monitoring.
The Council has a positive attitude and it has to respond to the Commission tomorrow.
We believe that it is important to take this step and that to postpone the debate until Wednesday would help us to assess this positive attitude on the part of the Council.
We have therefore requested this postponement which, furthermore, will help to make tomorrow's voting time shorter.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, if I may be so bold, I shall take your intervention as being in favour of moving the vote to noon on Wednesday.
No one wishes to speak against.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Tuesday:
As regards the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East, which are scheduled as the first item on Wednesday, the High Representative for foreign policy, Mr Solana, has informed us that he can attend Parliament to give his statement after 5 p.m. on Tuesday.
As this is the case, the agenda for Tuesday afternoon could be scheduled as follows: joint debate on defence and arms from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., joint debate on the situation in the Middle East, with statements by Mr Solana and the Commission from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.
I should inform the House that, if this change is accepted, the debate on the situation in the Middle East will replace Question Time to the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group supports the proposal to timetable Mr Solana's statement for 5 p.m. tomorrow, and to combine it with a debate, so that the time from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. would then be available for it.
Members must also be aware of the fact - which we must view sympathetically - that Mr Solana cannot be here on Wednesday, as he will be on his way to meet the American Secretary of State in Madrid.
We in Parliament have to accept this reason for his absence.
I have, though, one request, and would be grateful if other groups could join me in making it.
I am, in particular, addressing Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, as I do not want to place conditions on our agreement to defer the vote on budgetary control. We have, though, accepted your argument, and I ask you to accept, when we prepare a resolution on the Middle East, that the vote be held on Thursday rather than on Wednesday.
Our group is not actually in favour of a resolution, but the Conference of Presidents took the contrary view that there should be one.
As democrats, we accept that.
We will also be joining in the negotiation of a resolution, although we already had a very sound resolution in the last part-session, and will be playing our part as the ground-rules of Parliament require.
If, though, negotiations take place on Wednesday in Madrid between the European Union - represented by Mr Solana and Mr Piquet - on the one hand and Secretary of State Powell on the other, it must be possible for the results of their discussions to find their way into the text along with everything else.
That will probably not be that straightforward in procedural terms, but the groups here should in any case be able to comment verbally on what comes out of Madrid.
It is, then, my urgent request that we should not vote on the text of the resolution on Wednesday - that would in any case be too late for the talks in Madrid - but should vote on Thursday, when the results from Madrid will be known.
I should be grateful if you could agree to that, for we too are accommodating when you bring to this House matters in which you have a justifiable interest.
Mr President, please allow me to correct Mr Poettering on some of his information.
There will not be a bilateral meeting between Europe and the United States on Wednesday in Madrid, but rather a summit chaired by the President-in-Office of the Council - Mr Aznar, a political colleague of yours - which will be attended by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, who is currently in Madrid, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ivanov, Mr Powell, Mr PiquÃ© and Mr Solana.
This summit will be dealing with a matter that this House has already voted on.
We believe it is very important that everybody should be there, including, if possible, a representative of the Arab League, but that is yet to be confirmed.
Therefore, the summit in Madrid on Wednesday is of particular importance.
I am not going to go into the debate we are holding tomorrow, but I believe it is important and essential that Parliament can speak with a strong voice in defence of the role of Europe and try to offer a glimmer of light and a degree of hope during these tragic times.
I therefore believe it would be politically timely for a resolution to arrive at the Madrid Summit alive and kicking, which is perfectly feasible.
Furthermore, in its Standing Committee of 6 April, the Parliamentary Assembly of NATO, which is not known for its Socialist tendencies, tabled a resolution which I believe is in accordance with what we ourselves would propose.
I believe and hope that we can achieve a resolution along similar lines.
I am referring to something very dear to the PPE-DE Group, the Parliamentary Assembly of NATO.
Therefore, I insist that, in accordance with the philosophy of President Cox, who is not here at the moment, but would advocate this, it is essential to keep up with events and therefore I believe it is especially timely that we should vote on Wednesday and that the result of the vote should be known in time for Madrid.
Mr President, we should not lightly move Question Time to the Commission.
It is all very well to play high politics in this House but to many of our Members Question Time to the Commission is extremely important.
Indeed, much of our work of scrutinising of the Commission is done through Question Time.
I accept the case on this occasion, since we wish to have representatives of the Council and the Commission present for the debate.
However, I would appeal to my colleagues in the other groups that we do not make a habit of moving Question Time to the Commission.
It is an important part of our work.
Our view on the question of the vote is that we are in a very fast-moving situation.
We will certainly know more by Thursday than we will by Wednesday.
There is a good case on this occasion for taking that vote on Thursday lunchtime and not on Wednesday.
Mr Watson, may I assure you that your comments on the matter of Question Time to the Commission have been noted.
Mr President, I have just returned from Jerusalem and Ramallah and I would, above all, like to support the principle of tomorrow's debate, whether or not Question Time to the Commission has to be moved, although this is also an important part of our proceedings.
This debate must be held in the presence of Mr Solana. My group and myself believe it is crucially important that the substance of our joint resolution provides a response to the unacceptably dismissive act of the Israeli Government with regard to Mr Solana and Mr PiquÃ©, the representatives of the European Union, in other words.
It is of secondary importance whether the vote takes place on Wednesday or Thursday.
If I have to choose, I would prefer to take the vote on Wednesday for the reasons given by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
But the main thing is that our position is unambiguous and is independent of the compromise reached and statements issued in Madrid.
Mr President, I will be very brief for I fully agree with what Chairman Wurtz has just said.
I would especially like to stress how important it is - and I am addressing Chairman BarÃ³n Crespo and Chairman Poettering, in particular - that, this time, Parliament adopts a resolution which is absolutely unambiguous.
I feel that we, at least, have all the tools necessary to be able to speak with one voice and that it is important that we do so.
My group would also prefer the vote on the resolution to take place on Wednesday, as Chairman Wurtz has suggested.
Mr President, although, like the vast majority of this House, I naturally regard the tragic problem of the Middle East to be an absolute priority, as Vice-President responsible for Questions to the Commission and the Council and on behalf of all those who have asked and wish to verify what the Commission's position is, I would like to add my voice to what the Chairman of the Liberal Group, Mr Watson, has just said.
We cannot cancel Questions to the Commission.
Change the time, find the right solution, but Question Time cannot be treated as a joker which, according to the Commission or the Council's ability to come here, can be thrown away by Parliament.
It seems to me to show a lack of respect to cancel these events and I trust in you and the House to maintain Question Time, even if we hold it at another time.
Mr Puerta, may I assure you that there is no intention of losing Question Time to the Commission.
It is just that there is a problem in this particular instance which I think we all understand.
Nonetheless, your comments have been noted, as were Mr Watson's.
Mr President, as this is the first time you have been in this situation, my reproach is not directed at you; in recent years, though, I have known many Vice-Presidents of this House who said in discussions of this sort on the issue of Question Time that they would endeavour to ensure that it did not happen again and that it was an exception.
It is, though, increasingly becoming the rule.
I can give you statistical evidence that this is a fact and so I ask you as a matter of urgency to put Question Time back at an hour when it is absolutely certain that it can take place.
It used to be held at the beginning of the Tuesday evening sitting and was always on time.
It has regularly been wrecked, every other or every third time, since being moved to the afternoon.
Nowadays we are regularly stopping at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday through apparently not having anything to discuss until 6.30 or 7 p.m.
We do not sit on Fridays, yet we do not have time for Members to exercise their elementary right, guaranteed by the Treaties, to ask questions.
This is absolutely unacceptable, and I am asking not only that this be changed, but also for the restoration, as soon as possible, of the Question Time with Commissioner Busquin and others, which many of us have carefully prepared for.
We do not want to be sent written answers drafted by civil servants, but to be able to ask supplementary questions, as is the custom in parliaments.
Mr Posselt, as I explained earlier, we are in a very difficult situation in this particular instance.
Your comments have been noted and I can assure you that there is no intention of doing away with Question Time.
We shall now proceed with two votes:
The first is on whether we agree to hold the debate on the Middle East on Tuesday, as stated earlier.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The second vote is on whether to hold the vote on the motions in question on Wednesday or Thursday.
(Parliament voted in favour of Wednesday)
Mr President, I would like you to clarify an earlier point.
You said we would be losing Question Time, but are we also losing the Commission communication at 5.30 p.m.?
You are quite right, Mr Provan.
We shall also lose the Commission communication at 5.30 p.m.
Wednesday:
I must remind you, now that we have taken these decisions, that the debate and the Council and Council communications on the Middle East will now be held on Tuesday afternoon.
I have a request from Mr Leinen for the debate to be held on Wednesday.
Mr President, extraordinary situations sometimes do call for extraordinary actions.
I would have liked the President of the European Parliament, after the vote on Wednesday, to call for a lunchtime demonstration in support of peace in the Middle East.
We have a wonderful atrium, which is at other times the venue for celebrations.
We have a wonderful square in front of the building.
All our aides, all our people here, would be able to join in.
All we need is a microphone, and if that is too much of a problem, then I would do my bit to get one.
I believe that an extraordinary action of this kind would send a strong signal that Europe is not willing to accept this spiral of violence in the Middle East.
Those were powerful images on Wednesday of all days, the most significant day for a peaceful solution in the Middle East.
I ask you, with your colleagues in the Conference of Presidents, to give some thought to that.
Thank you very much for your comments, Mr Leinen, which I shall relay verbatim to the President of the European Parliament.
Thursday:
As far as the topical and urgent debate is concerned, we have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and from the Group of the Party of European Socialists for a new item entitled 'EU position for the next special session of the UN General Assembly on Children' to be added beneath the title 'Human Rights'.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Similarly, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have asked that the title of the fifth item be formulated as follows: 'Torrential rain in Tenerife and eastern Spain and climate change'.
(Parliament gave its assent)
That finalises the agenda.
Speeches on points of order
Mr President, on a point of order, perhaps the House would like to know that at the Joint Parliamentary Assembly held in Cape Town, which was ably co-chaired by Mrs Kinnock, we passed a very strong resolution.
That is the good news.
The bad news is that under the new draconian laws which have been brought in by President Mugabe, the editor of the daily newspaper which printed the resolution, in full and accurately, has been threatened and charged with a USD 2 000 fine - or two years in prison if he does not pay it.
He has declared that he would rather go to prison than not tell the truth.
Since this House is founded on freedom of speech, could the presidency write to Mr Mugabe and say that we would not expect any harm to come to this man and that we support freedom of speech.
Mr President, I naturally support what my colleague, Mr Corrie, has said.
This would be the first application of the Access to Information Act recently adopted by the Parliament in Zimbabwe.
We should not underestimate the seriousness of the threats to these journalists on The Daily News.
We should accordingly be very careful not to inflame the situation in any way.
Therefore I would ask that we should perhaps consider writing to the Minister of Justice rather than to President Mugabe, and also that we should say that we are merely confirming the facts of what happened in Cape Town.
In the current situation we do not want to say anything that does not sound neutral.
I would just urge that we bear that in mind when the letter is sent.
Mr President, you mentioned that one person had been killed in the Basque country but, in fact, last week another person was killed by the Guardia Civil.
His name was Joseba Andoni Urdaniz.
You may have received incorrect information from the Spanish authorities.
Two people were killed.
(The President cut off the speaker)
As you know, we held a minute's silence in memory of the victims of terrorism.
Please let us respect the memory of the people we honoured.
Mr President, on a point of order, I want to make a complaint about my colleague, Mr Helmer.
He produces an electronic newsletter called 'Straight Talking' and in that he has written what I consider to be a very serious insult to Mrs Nicole Fontaine.
He describes her views as socialist verging on Marxist - which I think would come as a surprise to Mrs Fontaine, as well as to others in this House - but the most serious thing he says is that the title of her memoirs should be 'Mein Kampf'.
That is a serious matter and I would like to invite Mr Helmer, through you, Mr President, either to apologise and retract these remarks, or alternatively to explain them.
Mr President, I thank Mrs Read for giving such a good plug to my electronic newsletter.
If any colleagues wish to go on the circulation list, please let me know and I shall be happy to oblige them.
Mrs Fontaine gave a speech before the Lisbon Summit in which she criticised the evils of capitalism.
I therefore feel entirely justified in describing those views as socialist verging on Marxist.
The remark I made about Mrs Fontaine's book Mes combats was, as I recall, that humorists in Parliament had been saying that the German edition should be entitled 'Mein Kampf', which is, I believe, German for Mes combats.
Thus, I was merely repeating gossip, which I feel I am entitled to do.
I would say to Mrs Read, my regional colleague, that the issue of the speech which Mrs Fontaine made before the Lisbon Summit was aired in this Chamber nearly two years ago.
So she is a little behind the times.
Mr President, I only wished to say that I sent a letter to Mr Cox last week to inform him about a disaster which struck the island of Tenerife, specifically the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where unfortunately, as well as the material damage, seven people lost their lives.
I would be grateful if you could pass on our condolences to the Mayor of the city and I would also be grateful if on Thursday this House could support the motion for a resolution that some Canarian Members have tabled.
Mr President, the Council has requested that urgent procedure be applied when it comes to special restrictive measures aimed at certain persons in terms of what is referred to as the fight against terrorism.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has an extra meeting this evening.
I hope that account will also be taken of the fact that some of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have asked a number of victims of this terrorist legislation in the European Union to come here to the European Parliament on Wednesday, both for a press conference and a round-table conference.
There are three of them: Swedish citizens who have ended up in a rat trap.
This is a huge legal scandal, at least in my view and that of many others.
In this connection, I would also say how genuinely sorry I am that the Council is unwilling to be represented at this round-table conference.
I think it is downright disgraceful, given that these are in actual fact people who are not in a position to defend themselves.
They have not even been charged with any offence, yet all their financial assets have been frozen.
Mr President, may I inform the House that the international convention held in Nicosia on 5 and 6 March, to express solidarity with the Palestinian people and attended by 43 left-wing and other parties and organisations from 22 countries, adopted a resolution condemning Israel's all-out attack on the Palestinian people, the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian leadership.
?his resolution also expressed solidarity with the peaceful forces of Israel and called on the international community, and the permanent members of the UN Security Council, the European Union and the Arab League in particular, to exert pressure on Israel to comply with both the recent and not so recent resolutions of the United Nations.
One wonders how Israel can engage in this sort of barbarianism against civilians, including children, while the powerful nations on earth stand by and do nothing.
One wonders where it finds the courage to beat up Greek Members of Parliament, deny entry to a Cyprus parliamentary delegation and even stop high-ranking European Union officials from meeting President Arafat.
One wonders why the European Union does not use the means at its disposal to stop Israeli aggression, why it does not take financial measures, why it does not stop arms exports to Israel.
Under these tragic circumstances, our failure to condemn Israel and our silence make us accessories to the crime of genocide of the Palestinian people and murderers of peace.
Mr President, I will just come back to Mrs Read's remark and Mr Helmer's statements.
Mr Helmer obliges me to make a remark that I actually did not believe I would ever have to make.
I speak as one who, in this House during Mrs Fontaine's term of office, was often harshly critical of her.
I find myself now constrained to say that when Mr Helmer writes in his newsletter that Mrs Fontaine's statements bordered on Marxism or socialism, I must contradict him in the most emphatic terms.
Nicole Fontaine deserves many things, but to associate her with Marxism or socialism is false.
It is, Mr Helmer, as if one were to associate you with clever remarks.
That would be just as erroneous.
I must say that we cannot allow Members or representatives of this House to be smeared in this way, for, alongside the facetious comment, the recommendation that a representative of Parliament should call her book 'Mein Kampf' equates her with historical parallels which make it unacceptable in any way whatever.
I find that even in this House we have to be able to censure such a thing.
I will just ask the following of the ladies and gentlemen in the PPE-DE Group. This House envisages that politicians of the same political orientation join together in a group - how can the PPE-DE's people actually sit together with such a man in the same group?
Mr President, with reference to the Israeli-Palestinian question, I would like to draw your attention and that of the Members to the fact that our fellow Member, Mrs Morgantini, who went to the occupied territories with a delegation of members of the Italian parliament and Italian trade unionists, was seized and used as a human shield by the Israeli army.
I am quite aware that the situation is extremely serious and that this might seem an insignificant incident, but I feel that such treatment of a woman who, in addition to being courageous, is a Member of our Parliament, must be condemned.
I would be grateful to the President of this House if he could send a message to the Israeli Government, protesting at the treatment suffered by Mrs Morgantini.
Mr President, I am going to speak on the same subject as Mr Bigliardo but I have something different to say.
I am sorry - as I believe we all are - that Mrs Morgantini has suffered such an experience, but not because she is a Member of the European Parliament but because she is a European citizen: in other words, I would be just as concerned for any other European citizen.
However, even before Mr Bigliardo spoke, I wanted to ask that, in tomorrow's debate on the events in Israel and Palestine, the Commission call upon all the European citizens who are not officials of the United Nations, NATO or the European Union to refrain from indulging in macabre tourism out of curiosity and false solidarity.
Those who go to a land where there is a genuine war taking place do so completely at their own risk and peril and cannot hope to involve the international community.
They do not need any of this sort of tourism down there: our solidarity must be displayed within our own towns and countries and in parliamentary chambers.
Two or three delegations of left-wing members of the Italian parliament have been stopped at Tel Aviv airport and sent home again: they did no more than visit the inside of the airport, creating further disturbance and generating further concern.
I do not think there is any need for this.
I therefore ask the Commission to call explicitly on the European citizens not to indulge in this sort of tourism.
Mr President, I would just like to reply to Mr Schultz.
He makes two points.
The first point is a political point about Mrs Fontaine's attitude contained in her speech at Lisbon.
There she made a speech attacking capitalism in very clear terms.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr Helmer, we have, I think, discussed the matter in detail.
You have had a chance to express your views and the honourable Members have had a chance to form an opinion on certain matters.
Let us not now enter into a whole debate. I think we have exhausted the subject.
Mr President, I would just like to make a brief observation, namely that the situation with Mr Helmer is one thing and the attack on another group is another matter.
Firstly, anyone who is acquainted with the range of Europe's Social Democrats and their historical background over the past ten to fifteen years should not make statements about such diversity in the way that Mr Schulz just has.
Secondly, there is no arguing about matters of taste, and on that we are once more in agreement.
Mr President, on a point of order, I am rising to ask you to contact the Colombian authorities and to ask them to clarify the situation and to guarantee the safety of two fully accredited human rights workers who are in the Bolivar province of Colombia under the aegis of the Corporation of Professional Community Services (Sembrar).
They are two EU citizens.
One is an Irishman, GearÃ³id Ã Loinsigh, and the other is a German woman, Gudrun Christa Kern.
They are two fully accredited human rights workers.
They travelled to the region on 13 March to meet, by appointment, the board of management of the South Bolivar Agri-Mining Federation.
They ran into considerable difficulties, initially with the fifth brigade of the national army there, and subsequently having their hotel ransacked.
I am asking through the presidency of Parliament that you contact the Colombian authorities and ensure their safe passage to carry out the work they have been asked to do by the Irish Government and the Irish NGO, in the case of the Irishman, and I am sure the same applies to the German woman.
Mr President, I wish to follow on from what Mrs Doyle has said.
Mr GearÃ³id Ã Loinsigh is a personal friend of mine and two years ago I travelled with him to Colombia.
These people, who are working with a human rights organisation, were invited by the local farming and mining community to investigate human rights abuses in a particular area.
As soon as they arrived in that area they were confronted by the army asking them why they were there, etc. Then they recommended that they stay in a specific hotel which was known to be frequented by death-squad personnel.
Fortunately they did not stay there, but at midnight that night that very hotel was raided by death squads.
Parliament has a duty to send a clear message to the Colombian authorities.
This issue of death squads, of the paramilitaries, and of their backing by the Colombian authorities has to be addressed.
The UN office in BogotÃ¡, which is co-financed by the EU, has on about 100 occasions issued recommendations to dismantle these paramilitaries.
The Colombian authorities are basically doing nothing but paying lip-service to these recommendations.
The UN and Amnesty International have both confirmed that paramilitaries are involved in about 75-80% of human rights violations in Colombia.
It is about time that the Colombian authorities lived up to international norms, and Parliament should send a clear message that if anything happens to these two human rights workers then they will be held responsible.
The next item is the debate on the report (?5-0047/2002) by Mr Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision concerning security in connection with football matches with an international dimension [12175/1/2001 - C5-0067/2002 - 2001/0824(CNS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, sport in general, and football in particular, occupy a very special position in society, both in defining behaviour and in the collective imagination.
The crowds which regularly travel to big matches, and big international matches, in particular - as well as the number of television viewers - is quite simply staggering.
Professional football today is highly popular; it is a massive game, a massive spectacle and, it has to be said, a massive business.
Too often, unfortunately, the big matches - and especially the big international matches - are also the stage on which unacceptable aggression, rioting and violence are acted out with scant regard for sporting principles or the respect due to persons and property.
Furthermore, no Member State totally escapes the risk of disturbances, even if some international matches are more sensitive than others and the supporters of some clubs or national teams are seemingly easier to control than others.
It is precisely in order to more effectively prevent and control the risk of disturbances during international competitions that the Kingdom of Belgium took the initiative to put forward a proposal for a Council decision on which we are due to vote tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft decision is based on three observations.
First of all, the number of football matches taking place at international level is currently increasing rapidly, such as the various European competitions, the European Championship and other tournaments, which, owing to the increase in the number of travelling supporters, entails greater risk of disturbances, or even violence, during competitions.
The second observation is, in order to prevent disturbances and to maintain law and order in connection with football matches is to have, first and foremost, it is essential to have an organised and efficient system for exchanging information regarding the risks that some matches present - and more specifically, certain types of supporters who travel to matches - and therefore, secondly, to improve coordination between the organisations responsible for security.
In this respect, we must recognise that the current system of cooperation between police forces, based on non-binding agreements and ad hoc contacts fostered at each match, has demonstrated its weakness if not its inefficiency.
It is also unreliable, slow and inconsistent.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, the draft decision proposes that each Member State formally establishes or designates a police-run national football information centre to act as a single, central and direct point of contact between the authorities and the police force of the Member States responsible for ensuring security at international football matches or competition with an international dimension.
Each national football information centre must therefore have the necessary resources and qualified staff.
It goes without saying that the operational needs are not the same in Finland, Austria, France, Germany, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands.
The various national information points that are established or designated must therefore function as information exchange networks providing data of a general nature - such as the number of supporters travelling, high-risk groups, the presence of hard core groups - and personal data, in other words, supporters posing risks to law and order and security.
In adopting the proposed report, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs gave its approval to the broad guidelines of this proposal for a Council decision.
It also approved 19 amendments, which all seek either to strengthen the operational nature of the network or, Mrs Buitenweg, to increase the protection of citizens when exchanging personal information.
If it adopts the report, the House will demonstrate its will to combat hooliganism more effectively and, in doing so, it will help professional football to confirm its main purpose, which is to provide enthusiastic supporters with a high standard of play, thus preventing a handful of savages from turning stadiums and host cities into training camps for rioters or battle grounds for rival gangs.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Deprez warmly on his report.
It was not an easy task, because the Council continuously submitted updated versions.
Despite this, he succeeded in presenting a sound report on this important matter in which citizens feel very closely involved.
I wholeheartedly endorse his proposal as long as it deals with the proper exchange of information and better coordination with the bodies that are responsible for security at football matches.
It would certainly benefit efficiency if information were to be centralised within one establishment for each Member State, which could then act as a port of call for all those involved.
This is essential, and works very well in the Netherlands, for example.
I should like to warn you, however, that the privacy and personal rights of the individual supporter may not be flouted in the process.
Article 4(3) is of crucial importance.
National and international legislation forms the basis for collecting, exchanging and using information.
Acting against actual football violence should fall within the remit of the judiciary and not of sports bodies that organise football matches.
Controlling football vandalism, however, is not only a matter of more effective police action.
In my view, it is far more important to change the mentality of the supporter.
Sport and both professional and amateur football fulfil a broad, social function.
Experts have ascertained that football-related violence originates, for example, in the pursuit of masculinity and status and the battle for territory.
This must change, and clubs, supporters' associations and the players themselves clearly have a role to play in this.
In addition, the UEFA has a major role.
This organisation knows - as no other - the problems which can occur, through its close contacts with the national football bodies and extensive experience in organising football matches.
I should like to call on them to cooperate.
I should also like to urge the national information points to closely involve sports clubs, supporters' associations and the UEFA in its activities, so that these can be implemented as well and effectively as possible so as to enhance security at football matches with an international dimension.
Mr President, firstly I would like to respond on behalf of Mr Cashman who is a Socialist Group shadow on this report and cannot attend this evening.
He would like to inform the House that the PSE Group welcomes this report and the measures in it intended to prevent the activities of hooligans and organised thugs at matches.
We will, however, need to monitor the way these monitoring centres carry out their functions to ensure that the football community is fully engaged in the exchange of information.
Most important of all is the need to ensure adequate resources both in financial and personnel terms.
It would be wrong to raise expectations to a level which cannot be met.
We can, of course, defeat hooliganism.
The proposals indicate we have the will to do the job, but the resources must follow.
Then I would like to intervene personally in this debate.
I too would like to add my support to Mr Deprez's report and its amendments, specifically, his amendment 10 calling for closer cooperation and an organised exchange of information.
If the European network of national football information centres is to be effective, then we need to address the current weaknesses in the system of information exchange and ad hoc contacts.
On Friday, I visited the football intelligence unit in the Greater Manchester police service.
Unfortunately, we have a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling football-related violence in my city.
The assistant Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police has read this report and he welcomes the initiative in the light of what he calls "different standards in dealing, for example, with Manchester United away fixtures and England away fixtures".
On Friday the unit was preparing for two key matches on Saturday.
One of those was Oldham versus Stoke City: the last time these two teams had met, known hooligans had rampaged through the town, wrecking property and attacking people.
In the UK we have pro-active football legislation to deal with our hooligan problems.
This allows us to impose banning orders; so, when a hundred of those fans arrived in Oldham, they were immediately arrested because they are banned from attending any matches.
Those banning orders also apply to international matches.
The football intelligence unit has a sophisticated database of so-called 'football prominents', using the latest digital image technology to update and record cases.
Let me tell you where the unit believes the EU information exchange system has to do better: 150 fans were deported from Charleroi in June 2000.
Among those arriving in Manchester airport were Belgian nationals, some of whom may not have been involved in any hooliganism at all.
Rounding up and deportation without prosecution does nothing to help the intelligence network on hooliganism.
A list of, and report on, the deportees was then sent to the intelligence unit: very helpful as far as it went, but the report contained no information. Officers could not read it because it was not in English, and they could not act on it because the information did not allow for any further action due to prosecution or conviction.
During Euro 1996, German fans arrived in Manchester.
As a result of German data protection and privacy laws, no lists of known hooligans could be passed on to the local intelligence forces and the officers working in the unit therefore had no information accessible in a usable format to tackle the hooligans.
So there is an issue here, Commissioner, in that we do need to standardise our information formats while recognising that there are different cultures on policing and information collection across the EU.
Perhaps we need to consider some form of information protocol.
This was the idea of my own football intelligence unit officers.
We need to deal with hooliganism pro-actively not re-actively.
On the issue of cost, which is an amendment tabled by Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, no doubt it would be useful to have a study on whether clubs should pay more for the policing of hooliganism.
The difficulty is, however, who pays those costs after hours in cities where football hooligans are still engaged in activities.
In 2004 we will be hosting the final of the European championships at Old Trafford in Manchester.
Our priority has to be to protect the law-abiding supporter and clamp down on hooligans who spoil the game.
We need a practical, pro-active approach to information sharing for national monitoring centres.
Their existence alone, Commissioner, will not guarantee the end of football hooliganism.
The proposal to set up a European network of permanent, national football information points, in other words, to enhance cooperation between the Member States where the enforcement of law and order in international football matches is concerned, is a Belgian initiative which is based on the experience gathered at Euro 2000, the European national teams championship, which, as you know, was organised jointly by Belgium and the Netherlands in June 2000.
The proposal and report are sound, and the initiative is excellent in my view.
I should, however, like to make two observations.
First of all, the proposal only applies, of course, to EU Member States.
You may ask, what about the countries outside the European Union, many of whose clubs also take part in international competitions?
Turkey, Romania and Croatia also play teams of the EU Member States.
I hear you say that candidate countries will obviously need to adopt the acquis communautaire, and that is right.
But that is not now nor in the immediate future.
For some of them, that is not until 2004 at the earliest.
And then, what about the others?
What about the non-candidate countries?
It may be possible to link up with the UEFA and with the national football unions, to find a way round this.
Secondly, greater involvement and cooperation by the clubs and supporters' associations is important to improve the climate and the quality.
And I believe that specific efforts must be made in order to achieve this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, major international football matches are the absolute high point for supporters; for law enforcers and local authorities, however, they are often expensive nightmares and, for the people living in the vicinity of sports stadiums, often a source of distress and a great deal of misery as a result of the damage caused to their front gardens, to cars, to pavement cafÃ©s etc. The list goes on.
This Council decision is first of all directed at a hard core which, so far, has been able to exploit the loopholes in the exchange of information between the different police services.
The effective coordination of the exchange of information is therefore not an unnecessary luxury.
However, let it be clear that this is, first and foremost, a preventive instrument which must allow for effective risk assessment.
Incidentally, Mr Deprez' report is very good.
He managed to clarify the original text and also to tighten it up, by, inter alia, devoting more attention to the times before and after the games.
A well-oiled network of 'football' information points must be able to deploy forces in a targeted and effective manner.
The international football competition takes up a great deal of energy and resources of the police services involved, resulting in the risk that other tasks may be carried out to a lower standard.
The key question surrounding instruments of this nature, however, is how the law-enforcing bodies themselves can be monitored.
An almost self-evident first step in this is to inform the individuals involved about the fact that they have ended up in this database and to grant them access to this.
A counter-argument could be that this could hamper the monitoring function of the police services and offer the people included on the database a tactical advantage.
I, however, believe this to be a misapprehension about what actually happens.
This is not purely about a self-evident right, namely that of knowing whether or not you are included in a database. It is also about issuing a clear warning which also has a deterrent effect.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking quite frankly, I can summon up but little enthusiasm for couch potatoes who sit in front of the telly or in a football stadium for ninety minutes watching a small round leather thing and about two dozen men in jerseys, leaving their seats in the meantime only to roar with enthusiasm, or wring their hands in shock.
It is not that, though, with which we are dealing here, for the protection of fundamental rights -which I believe to be threatened by this proposal - only makes sense if it applies to all the people in a State, and not only to those whose thoughts and actions enjoy the State's approval.
Within the so-called area of freedom, security and justice, the Deprez report aims at the actual gathering of more information on football hooligans.
Over and over again during discussions on the proposal, the rapporteur disputed that this would, in the long term, entail travel bans, preventive custody and the infringement of fundamental rights, as no measures are envisaged over and above the collection of data.
I will take an example from the country in which I was elected in order to make clear how, in my view, it will certainly not, in the long term, remain just a matter of gathering data.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, there has already been a legal document, according to which hooligans who are allegedly equipped for violence may have their right to leave the country restricted.
A year ago, though, that was used, not against hooligans, but against people who were equipped to demonstrate and wanted to travel to Genoa.
Some of those who had originally voted for this law have since said in the media that this was far from being what they wanted.
They had, they said, voted for the law at that time only on the presupposition that it really only applied to football hooligans, and not to people who wanted to express their political views.
I think this shows very well what can happen to documents of this sort.
I would be surprised if this really were only about the gathering of data, for what is a database for if nothing is done with it afterwards?
It is very easy to see through the political manoeuvre that lies behind it.
A new target group - the hooligans - has been found, which is well suited to legitimising police measures in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, and thus measures are justified which very definitely restrict the protection of fundamental rights and which are then extended to other people.
This, then, means in the long term that this will not just be a matter of gathering data, but that travel restrictions, preventive detention and so on will very definitely find their way into this 'fortress Europe' policy, which will then be applied to other groups.
If you want to give your approval to that, if that is your understanding of the area of freedom, security and justice, then you should indeed vote in favour of the Deprez report.
Mr President, the Council's initiative and Mr Deprez' report plug a huge gap in legislation to prevent and suppress hooliganism and violence at football matches, which have taken on explosive dimensions over recent years as a result of the Member States' failure to apply efficient measures.
Without doubt, the commercialisation of football and the profit motive are the prime cause of violent episodes at football matches.
Brawls are no longer led by wild crowds of fans, they are led by organised mafias using fanaticism and violence to serve specific illegal purposes which have nothing to do with the love of sport.
In short, it has been suggested that violence at football matches sells, it brings in a profit.
Violence at football matches is organised and orchestrated nowadays, frequently using sport as a front for common crime, such as selling drugs and laundering dirty money, according to an investigation carried out in Britain.
Over recent years, various groups of hooligans have been making blatant use of new technology, mobile telephones and the Internet, to organise their activities and, of course, to mislead the police.
This being the case, we cannot create a European area of freedom, security and justice unless we first create a network of information points and reinforce police and judicial cooperation between the 15 Member States in order to suppress violence at football matches.
Of course, the sports associations still have a crucial role to play in distancing themselves from hooliganism and teaching their fans the importance of friendly competition, collaboration, dialogue, respect for other people's differences and peaceful coexistence.
Finally, I should like to point out that the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens will be a important opportunity to revive the Olympic spirit and the ideals of the Olympic truce and peace, as an alternative political proposal to the mindset and culture of violence.
Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Deprez, and indeed the Belgian State, for this excellent report and excellent initiative.
It is true that the scourge of violence, often organised violence, has plagued international sport, particularly international football, for too long.
We wholeheartedly support initiatives that are aimed at increasing cooperation between authorities in different Member States.
They are a vital tool in the battle to keep sport clean and to keep it as it should be.
We like you to consider one small, but important, textual amendment.
The proposed decision is flawed in one respect: it appears to assume that each Member State is represented by just one single national team.
This is not so, as you well know.
My own country, for example, is represented by an independent Scotland team, despite the fact that Scotland is, for the time being anyway, not an independent Member State.
We have a long footballing pedigree and indeed the first international football match ever played was the game between Scotland and England in 1872.
Scottish supporters - the so-called 'Tartan Army' which is tartan, but not an army - have for quite a few years now had an unparalleled reputation for good behaviour and good humour.
It is for this reason that I and my EFA colleagues have tabled three amendments to the Council text.
They will not change the substance but they will give recognition to the distinctive footballing and indeed legal histories of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England.
Do not speak about the national team, but about national teams.
I see Mr Deprez accepts the point and I am most grateful to him for that.
Mr President, the fact that three speakers have taken the floor on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is striking and, in my view, illustrates at least two points.
Firstly that we, unlike Mrs SchrÃ¶der, are very much interested in 22 men running in shorts after a ball.
And secondly, that our group also wants to seriously address the problems surrounding these matches.
I too should like to bring one amendment to your attention which has already been touched upon by my fellow MEP, because I hope that you are still prepared to endorse it.
It concerns the amendment which stipulates that, if data is stored about persons who constitute a danger to public order, these persons should be informed of the fact that their data has been recorded.
This is a different situation from that in the case of criminals, for example.
I can imagine that, in the case of criminals, it is not helpful if, while the investigations are still under way, they know that they are being pursued.
In the case of persons who constitute a danger to public order, however, it has a very preventive effect.
They know that they are being monitored.
As a result, anyone who has been wrongly registered can be removed from this register, but it also acts as an effective deterrent, in fact.
If people know that they are being watched, they will think twice before misbehaving again in this way.
I hope you will be able to endorse Amendment No 22, nevertheless.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
The next item is a report (A5-0036/2002) by Mr Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision setting up a European network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes [11658/2001 - C5-0499/2001 - 2001/0826 (CNS)].
Madam President, following on from Mr Deprez's excellent report, it seems to me rather tragic that I have to address this House on matters which frankly, here in the twenty-first century, we should not have to be debating, let alone dealing with: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
Only a few short years ago, I was the UK minister responsible for legislation, setting up the appropriate mechanisms for dealing with war criminals from a past era.
It is therefore particularly sad that we have a situation where there are still many extremely evil people in the world who behave in a manner which is totally unacceptable to all decent people who believe in democracy and the freedom of individuals, as I do.
I want to say a word or two about this report, because some people have commented that it is unnecessary to have a system of contact points in Europe to deal with these matters, that there is already plenty of cooperation at police level, for instance, and justice ministry level.
Sadly, that is not the case.
Although we had the statute for the International Criminal Court in July 1998, this is ultimately a matter which is still the prime responsibility of national governments and national criminal jurisdictions.
The cooperation between national governments and national police enforcement authorities, for instance, is absolutely critical in bringing to book some of the rather more unpleasant people who we need to deal with, owing to the international and horrendous nature of their crimes.
I remember, as minister, speaking to my Polish opposite number, Mr Miller, - who, coincidentally, is now the Polish Prime Minister - about certain war criminals.
Although Poland is not currently a member of the EU, but hopes to be before too long, it was clear that there was much work which still had to be done in an attempt to produce a more cooperative effect between the different law enforcement authorities.
One of the possibilities is, as my report suggests, to have contact points which are readily identifiable in the different nation states.
Indeed, an amendment which we have tabled to the report makes it clear that we believe that we should not leave this as a vague proposition to be determined at some point in the future, but that it should be clearly the case that the contact points should be based in the police or justice departments of the Member States.
That is the first point.
It is also important, as was noted in the previous debate, that we look at the latest methods and make sure that there is a coordination of those methods in bringing about the necessary prosecutions and convictions.
The issue of data, for instance, is most important.
There were concerns shown by some people about the privacy of individuals and the rights of defendants that might be effected by a duplication or by a different approach to data matters.
I am trying, in this report, to bring about consistency.
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino would agree that we need to have more consistency in a cooperative effort.
I do not agree with everything that happens on a European basis, but here we have a situation where there is a clear need for cooperation at a level at which we are consistent in our approach.
We also need to have systems in place which can be easily recognised and easily transmitted between the nation states that are concerned.
Cooperation is the key to success.
It is the key to success in the areas which Mr Deprez has spoken about.
It is the key to success in the areas that I am proposing here.
It is a necessary measure.
This report underlines this need and, above all else, it shows the determination of all of us in the different states of Europe to get together to deal with the more unpleasant people who sadly still exist on this globe.
Madam President, this Dutch initiative is fundamentally to be welcomed.
An initiative of this kind towards European cooperation in more effective prosecution of crime deserves support, especially when the crimes in question are as detestable as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
I aimed to keep the initiative on exchange of information among the contact points as simple as possible, something which the Germans and the Dutch supported in Council.
That being so, I would have considered it right to refer, in Article 2(2) to the law on judicial assistance between Member States currently in force and laid down in bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Whatever the rapporteur may think, such an agreement does indeed exist between all the Member States; it is the one that was adopted by the Council of Europe on 20 April 1959.
Over and above that, there is a new judicial assistance agreement dated May 2000, which is adapted to more modern circumstances but has not yet been ratified by all the Member States.
This new judicial assistance agreement would already represent a marked simplification, and would also make the creation of a new procedure superfluous.
Now, the rapporteur was in agreement with the reference to the existing agreement, but was not willing to support the deletion of the procedure in Articles 3 to 6, which was to be newly introduced.
As I did not want to risk the committee adopting such a contradictory report, I finally refrained from submitting the amendments I have referred to, but I still have serious misgivings.
Equally, though, I would like to emphasise that I see the creation of a European network of contact points as extraordinarily important.
I also hope that the success of this network and of this important initiative will not be impaired by procedural disputes.
I congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report.
Madam President, my group very much supports the report by Mr Kirkhope.
It is very important in that it has not changed the spirit of the Dutch proposal, and we will be voting in favour of it.
The creation of networks or contact points in each Member State for war crimes is extremely important.
It is important that there is contact with the police and judicial authorities in order to facilitate cooperation in the Member States in relation to war crimes.
This is exemplified by current developments in international law, and in particular the success of the UN tribunals on the former Yugoslavia and on Rwanda in tracking down and prosecuting persons who have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. This action is attracting more public interest and support than ever before.
There are cases where people who have committed crimes against humanity have more or less escaped unpunished - for example the Pinochet case - and there are other cases where a blind eye is turned to war crimes and to major international human rights abuses until the occasion arises when it is politically correct to challenge them.
We have to challenge these abuses from the very beginning.
It is important that this report is not aimed at establishing a central coordination department.
The initiative basically leaves implementation up to the Member States, which must then supply information about the places that have been set up.
The initiative also highlights one of the important problems, data protection, which can develop with the transfer of data and information.
We also must never forget that data protection is an extremely important issue and it must not be left out of any of these debates.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission supports the Dutch proposal to create these contact points for crimes of genocide, because we feel that this is a reasonable proposal, which seeks to achieve a structure that is flexible rather than unwieldy.
This proposal does not affect the existing legal mechanisms for judicial assistance, but represents an important additional measure in that it enables the Member States of the European Union to fulfil their obligations as laid down in the Statute of the International Criminal Court established in Rome by Convention in 1998 and which is ready to enter into force as soon as the necessary number of Member States ratifies it.
Cooperation in this field between the States of the European Union, on preventing this type of crime, has already been subject to a common position, issued by the Council on 11 June 2001.
We therefore feel that the initiative by the Netherlands is part of a coherent and consistent approach to these particularly odious crimes on an international scale.
The Commission agrees with the emphasis placed by the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, whom I should like to congratulate on his excellent report, on the need for this type of cooperation mechanism not to affect guarantees for the protection of personal data or to endanger the rights of those on trial to a defence.
Common rules apply here, primarily the European Convention on Human Rights and the Council of Europe conventions on such matters, and this is another example of issues which, together with those on which Mr Deprez has drawn up a report, we are considering as the legal base for guaranteeing the protection of personal data in the field of judicial cooperation in the European Union.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
The next item is a report (A5-0082/2002) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a framework programme on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union - Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters [COM(2001) 646 - C5-0694/2001 - 2001/0262(CNS)].
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission, in the person of Commissioner AntÃ³nio Vitorino, on the excellent initiative that it has presented.
We often criticise the Commission - and rightly so - but today it is only fair to congratulate it on the initiative that it has presented and which provides a positive response to the recommendations made by the European Parliament when it approved the Kessler report to bring together the five programmes covered by Title VI in a single framework programme.
As we all know, under the terms of Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union is obliged to pursue the objective of providing its citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by initiating actions in conjunction with the Member States in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters too.
This was the rationale underlying the creation of the five biannual financing programmes under Title VI that are due to end in December 2002 and that were - and still are - Grotius II, designed for legal practitioners, OISIN II, for Member State law enforcement authorities, STOP II, for those responsible for combating trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, Hippocrates, in the field of crime prevention in general, and Falcone, for those responsible for action to combat organised crime.
The proposal we are debating here today establishes a single framework programme that is intended to bring together and provide a harmonised legislative and operational framework for all the actions that fall under Title VI of the EU Treaty, reflecting developments in Community programmes in general and the experiences of five years' work on the ground.
Consequently, we have, in our opinion, managed to ensure that the actions we have supported are more consistent and have an even greater impact, to make possible a more effective use of financial resources, to prevent potential overlaps between the various programmes and to fill in existing gaps.
Although I consider the approach that the Commission is following to be fundamentally correct, I felt it would be appropriate and sensible to table some amendments with the following objectives:
firstly, to make the programme's line of action clearer, and to make the wording more precise, not least because projects submitted are to be evaluated for conformity with the programme's objectives. In these circumstances vague, meaningless terms have to be rejected;
secondly, to give our endorsement to the inclusion in the programme of cross-border projects in the field of assistance to victims of crime, in addition to the promotion of police and judicial cooperation.
We will, in this way, be promoting the effective protection, in the Member States, of the interests of victims in criminal proceedings, specifically through the creation of a network of contact points.
It might also, for example, prove appropriate to provide for an independent evaluation to be undertaken on the implementation of the framework decision, accompanied by proposals for improvement for every country;
thirdly, to acknowledge that it is important and appropriate to involve the applicant countries, but also that it must be made clear that they must participate in both drawing up and implementing the project.
Merely taking part in the project as what amounts to a 'consumer', cannot be considered to be sufficient;
fourthly, to state that the power of initiative to draft proposals cannot be confined only to the public sector of the Member States and of the applicant countries; it must be extended to NGOs, universities and other interested parties;
fifthly, with regard to financing, a maximum co-financing of up to 70% has been provided for although, in some cases, it could reach 100%. These are specific projects and complementary measures.
A hundred per cent financing from the Community budget could be justified only in the case of projects which were in the very best interests of the European Union and which could not be carried out with a lower rate of funding.
However, it should be emphasised, and I am sure that this is also the approach of Commissioner AntÃ³nio Vitorino, that the underlying idea is to attempt to finance the greatest number of projects possible with the resources available;
my last but one point is that the Commission's proposal is consistent with this Parliament's desire to provide greater support for projects promoting the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, but it is rather difficult to accept a proposal that exceeds the existing financial perspective.
Hence the proposal that this framework programme should operate in the period 2003 to 2006, following which it must be renewed in accordance with the new financial perspective.
To conclude, I find it regrettable that the position of the European Parliament does not demonstrate the appropriate degree of prudence.
I have therefore proposed that Parliament should be given the option of being involved, which will surely give it the opportunity to exercise its responsibility as budgetary authority in the best possible way.
The construction of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the fundamental objectives of this Parliament, and therefore, its involvement is of the greatest importance.
. (DA) Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for having incorporated most of the Committee on Budgets' amendments into the report.
The proposal tabled by the Commission does in fact combine five existing programmes - Grotius II, Oisin II, Stop II, Hippocrates and Falcone - in one, and I think that the proposal is broadly in line with Parliament's wish to secure more aid for projects that can give people in the European Union an EU with greater security.
Internal security is of course one of the priorities also emphasised by Parliament in the guidelines for the budgetary procedure for 2003 - next year - which were of course adopted at the last sitting here in Strasbourg.
Part of the thinking behind the way in which the programme has been put together is that, in future, there should be a closer link between police cooperation and judicial cooperation. For the Committee on Budgets, this is, moreover, an aim with the not insignificant effect of making for a better use of financial resources.
It is gratifying that the candidate countries too are to be given the opportunity to participate in those projects that are financed under the programme, but it must be clear that, as a budgetary authority, Parliament cannot accept a situation in which the financial estimates are exceeded.
The programme ought, then, to be limited to the period 2003-2006 in its initial phase, and in that way shortened by a year.
That means, of course, a corresponding reduction in the framework appropriation, and the programme can subsequently be extended.
Finally, I think that it is important for the budgetary authority to be listened to if it should nonetheless become necessary to increase the appropriations to the programme, for the consequence of increasing the appropriations to this programme must not be reduced appropriations to other programmes also financed under category 3 of the financial estimates.
Madam President, the Union treaty makes it our duty to create an area of freedom, security and justice for Europe's citizens.
The Council proposal is an important step in this direction.
Admittedly, it does nothing more than combine five already-existing programmes, but this combination creates homogeneity and clarity, which is particularly necessary in the difficult area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
The combination of the programmes can now serve to prevent overlapping and close loopholes.
The creation of a single framework programme will also further improve the uptake of financial resources.
Only cross-border criminal prosecution and enforcement can combat contemporary criminality, for those who commit crimes are taking extensive advantage of the freedoms of the European Union.
The EU's citizens will also feel their sense of security reinforced.
They know that there are no no-go areas for the law in its pursuit of criminals.
They will be pursued right across the EU, and in like manner.
It is in this context that the amendment on the publication on the Internet of the results of the investigations and studies cofinanced under this programme is particularly to be welcomed.
This is a further step towards the greater transparency that we need in order once again to bring the advantages of European cooperation to our citizens' attention.
Greater protection for victims is especially to be highlighted and much to be welcomed.
It is the victims who have most to endure, but who are far from receiving the best protection and care.
It must therefore be ensured that effective protection of victims' interests in criminal proceedings can be guaranteed.
It is particularly to be welcomed, in view of EU enlargement, that the Council proposal can take into account the candidate countries and involve them in projects.
What cannot, however, be accepted is the way in which the Council proposal disregards Parliament; in particular, Parliament's sovereignty in budget matters makes it necessary for it at least to be informed concerning the progress of the programme and not to get a report only as late as 2005.
The rapporteur should therefore be supported in his efforts to bring about an amendment on this point.
I would like, in conclusion, to congratulate Mr Coelho on his report, in particular on his success in achieving, as was necessary, more precise use of language.
Madam President, this report is, of course, of little importance in the broad political scheme of things.
From a financial point of view, we are concerned here with less than one per mille of the EU's annual budget, and the direct political consequences are cause neither for approval nor contradiction.
What is at issue here is a programme on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
As a lawyer and democrat, I have to say that cooperation and development are always to be welcomed and that they can be useful and increase our awareness, but it is very difficult to take the rhetoric seriously.
The report's explanatory statement includes the following words: 'If the European citizen is to be offered an area of freedom, security and justice, we have to ensure that criminal investigations, prosecution and the execution of penalties can take place efficiently across borders?.
It is as if freedom, security and justice had not been invented until these decisions were made, but the fact is of course that by far the greater part of judicial criminal investigation and police work is done nationally and locally.
What we have here is a rhetorical device that is part of, or to be seen as a stage in, the process towards unified decisions in the fields of policing, the law and criminal investigation.
Where the funding is concerned, it may be pointed out that EUR 65 million is not to be sneezed at, and it is one more item in the long list of programmes interfering with the EU's administrative procedure.
I must not dwell any further upon this matter but just point out in conclusion what is so curious about the Commission's statement that these programmes have been assessed.
In that case, they were assessed in 2000, irrespective of the fact that the majority of the programmes were not adopted until 2001.
That really is an impressive act of clairvoyance which bodes well for the projects.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Carlos Coelho and by congratulating him on his excellent report.
I must emphasise that the aim of this proposal for a framework programme is to rationalise and simplify the implementation of the programmes of police and judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters, thereby complying with the specific request made by the European Parliament in the Kessler report.
As to the content of this framework programme, this covers all five of the previous programmes and also the implementation of actions linked to the plan to combat drugs, for which the European Parliament had created a specific budget heading, due to end in the course of this year.
The programme covers all the fields that are and that must be subject to European action, which demonstrates the commitment of the public authorities and of the beneficiaries of the projects, with whom we are in close contact, and also reflects the results of the external evaluation carried out two years ago on, of course, the development of the programmes that preceded the evaluation.
The Commission is sometimes accused of being a schizophrenic institution, but we have not yet reached the point of assessing things that have not yet been done ?
With this in mind, the basic legal provision was voluntarily confined to laying down the broad guidelines, because the Commission felt that the task of defining priorities more precisely must be left up to the annual programmes, year by year, in line with developments in the political situation and the actual requirements of the situation as regards crime.
From this point of view, the amendments tabled to Article 2, emphasising one specific issue or another, are, I believe, hard to accept.
The Commission takes the view that in the framework programme, objectives must be defined in general terms, leaving it up to each annual programme to define its priorities.
Nevertheless, all matters and issues to which amendments have been tabled are, as I understand it, fully covered by the general wording of the Commission proposal and can be included in every annual programme.
The framework programme also highlights the concept of partnership.
This element is crucial, because projects must be developed not only through broad European participation, but also - and from their very inception - in the context of close cooperation between the main players involved in the various countries.
The amendment tabled by the rapporteur that defines this concept of partnership more clearly is, therefore, totally acceptable to the Commission.
As Mr Coelho stated, the countries that are candidates for accession can already participate in projects.
The Commission would like to go further and, in line with European agreements, has developed a system of financial protocols that will enable organisations established in the candidate countries to be equally eligible to submit projects on the same basis and according to the same rules as Member State organisations.
I therefore welcome the amendment also tabled by the rapporteur on this point, which proposes a wording that I consider to be fortuitous, because it further clarifies the concept of the eligibility of the candidate countries.
With regard to the remaining amendments, the Commission can accept those that have an effect on the recitals and which enrich the text, or certain explanations, such as, for example, the more explicit reference to the inclusion of universities, NGOs and police academies as eligible organisations.
In relation to the request to bring forward the interim report to June 2004, the Commission would propose that the date of June 2005 be maintained.
Instead, we propose that the presentation of the annual report be brought forward to June 2004 so that the European Parliament can be informed as quickly as possible on the first results of the implementation of the programme to have already produced effects that are likely to be assessed.
Finally, on the duration of the programme, I must admit that, in relation to other existing programmes in the European Union, the argument of 'a legal base providing for its implementation beyond 2006', in other words, beyond the lifespan of the financial perspective, has not been used.
Bearing in mind, of course, that the financial envelope for the period after 2006 will always be dependent on the financial perspective adopted following 2006, we would, therefore, ask Parliament to ensure that the limitation on the legal base does not stop at 2006 and could cover actions programmed up to the year 2007, with the proviso, naturally, that a given financial appropriation will always be dependent on the new financial perspective.
Lastly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the European Parliament for the support, the boost and the encouragement that they have given to this important task of rationalising programmes in a particularly sensitive area: the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters at European level.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on:
report (A5-0080/2002) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law (renewed consultation) [15525/2001 - C5-0022/2002 - 2000/0801(CNS)]
report (A5-0099/2002) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law [COM(2001) 139 - C5-0116/2001 - 2001/0076(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all quite familiar with the history of this framework decision.
We are being consulted a second time because the framework decision, on which we first expressed our opinion two years ago, has been revised.
In the meantime, however, the Commission expressed a general reservation about the framework decision, to the effect that environmental protection is covered by a large number of Community acts, most of which make provisions for administrative penalties, and that the issue should therefore be dealt with by means of a first-pillar instrument.
The Commission insists that, given the environmental degradation in the Union, existing penalties are clearly inadequate.
The proposal for a directive, which is the subject of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report, must therefore be seen as complementing the draft framework decision.
According to the Commission, a first-pillar instrument must be adopted which takes precedence over a third-pillar instrument.
That means that, when an area falls within the Community sphere of responsibility, it is legally impossible for the Union to adopt common rules by means of a third-pillar instrument without encroaching on the Community's powers.
I would point out that Parliament agrees with the Commission on this point: in the sitting of 15 November 2001, with a procedure without debate, we adopted a recommendation on criminal penalties and Community acts, point 6 of which, to be precise, called upon the Council not to undertake any action concerning criminal law in the field of the environment before the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law had been adopted.
Now then, these two documents - the framework decision and the directive - complement each other and are designed to be used together, so as to avoid inconsistency with two documents saying different things about the same subject.
