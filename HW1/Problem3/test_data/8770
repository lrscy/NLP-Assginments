e) fundamental intervention in the global problem of poverty will free whole societies in Asia and Africa from the despair which feeds terrorism;
f) the European Union must avoid Mr Berlusconi's divisiveness and Mr Blair's sermonising and take a calm and friendly approach towards Islam.
We wish, once again, to state our total condemnation of the terrorist acts witnessed in the United States and, once again, pay respect to the suffering and the struggle of the victims' families and of the American people and call for the fight against terrorism not to contribute to creating more victims.
The fight against international terrorism will only be totally effective if it is carried out under the auspices of the United Nations and this is why we specifically reject the use of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which runs the risk of dragging the European Union and the international community into a spiral of violence with incalculable consequences.
It is also our view that the fight against terrorism, which is, of course, necessary, must not be used as a pretext to undermine individuals' fundamental rights, freedoms and protection under the law, or affect essential aspects of the sovereignty of the European Union' s Member States, including militarisation.
What we do feel is important is that, in parallel with the fight against international terrorism, we pursue the fight against money laundering, including the abolition of tax havens.
Our vote, therefore, reflects our profound disagreement with some of the joint resolution' s main aspects, voted for by a majority in plenary, although we support most of the remaining points.
I voted against the resolution for several reasons.
I believe that bringing to justice those responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States should not mean suffering and terror for other innocent people.
It is vital that any action taken in response to these atrocities does not trigger more attacks like it or even worse.
The international community has a duty to seek to understand what may have led to these terrible crimes.
It must try to understand because to refuse to do so will contribute to the likelihood that much worse lies ahead.
I believe that the United States, and the coalition of countries that has been formed, must be sensitive to global security as a whole.
If the US responds with attacks on Afghanistan it too will be killing innocent people and two wrongs never make a right.
I strongly feel that we, as politicians in the democratic world, have a great responsibility to uphold the principles of non-violence and to ensure that such unjustifiable violence does not escalate.
.
(NL) The fact that people should kill themselves and many others in the terrible manner of 11 September in New York and Washington is a sign of hate and desperation.
You can only combat terrorism by helping to remove the breeding ground for violence, not by causing yet more outrage.
The way in which Israel seeks out and liquidates violent Palestinian opponents only appears to evoke more sympathy for violent resistance.
There is now the threat of that very mistake being repeated on a global scale.
When it comes to matters of climate, armament and racism, the US President sought isolation.
The formation of a coalition of the rich and powerful, led by him, against the poor and rebellious will be counter-productive in the long run.
I side with the only American politician who had the courage to vote against the warmongering, following in the footsteps of those few German socialist dissenters at the beginning of the First World War.
The money we are about to waste on war would be better spent on prevention.
Within Europe, this would involve making ourselves as secure as possible against attacks, something which would be possible if we did not privatise airport security and air traffic safety and if we paid closer attention to safety standards for very tall buildings.
Outside of Europe, it would involve helping to solve the problems of poverty, neglect and injustice.
British Conservatives strongly support measures which are specifically designed to combat terrorism in all its forms.
In this spirit therefore, we have supported the motion for a resolution and the counter-terrorist legislative measures being adopted by Council.
However, we do not support the proposition that 'combating international terrorism implies a distinct strengthening of the relevant EU competencies', or that the EU should have responsibility for negotiating agreements on judicial and police cooperation with the US, which are properly a national responsibility, given the very different constitutional, judicial and operational traditions of key Member States such as the United Kingdom.
We see no connection between the need for a resolute response to the recent terrorist attacks and the call for intensification of efforts to operationalise the European Security and Defence Policy.
On the contrary, recent events underline the need for stronger transatlantic ties, and an enhancement of NATO, rather than the potentially divisive pursuit of some autonomous EU military capability.
In addition, we wish to ensure that any new counter-terrorist legislation is also used to bear down on those terrorist organisations, such as the IRA in all its forms, and ETA, that have been conducting terrorist campaigns from and within EU Member States over the past several decades.
Stability and Growth Pact (RC B5-0602/2001)
The collapse of liberal dogmas is becoming increasingly apparent.
The 'stability pact' and the anti-democratic powers that the European Central Bank has been given operate in an extremely restrictive fashion, at a time when radical change in the direction of European integration is becoming particularly pressing.
The demonstrations by trades unions and other organisations that arose as a result of the meeting of the Ecofin Council in LiÃšge and debates at the European Citizens' Congress have highlighted the urgency of the social and democratic demands made by movements that are opposed to the prospect of globalisation in line with the current capitalist globalisation.
The Ecofin Council, however, once again demonstrated its inability to communicate.
It did not make any proposal in proportion to what is at stake.
Its debates continue to be characterised by a total lack of transparency and responsibility, as illustrated by the fate of the Tobin tax.
Ministers went back on their public commitments in referring the matter to the Commission, which we know is hostile to such a decision, no matter how elementary it may seem.
In the same vein, the burning question of tax havens was only voluntarily broached from the specific angle of the fight against terrorism.
The governments of the Union are not yet ready to change direction.
This is the fundamental issue hidden behind the joint resolutions put forward for the vote.
And this is the reason why we will vote against them.
Japan is now experiencing a recession.
The United States are not far behind, Europe is seeing considerably less growth and a recession is not completely out of the question.
In order to prevent a global recession, it makes perfect sense to boost economic activity by means of coordinated action with Japan and the United States, through increasing public expenditure up to a limit of 3% of the public deficit of each EU Member State, on the condition that:
the purpose of increasing expenditure is to improve public investment and to encourage private investment; and
at the same time, efforts are redoubled to implement structural reforms that stimulate employment, investment and competitiveness.
The Stability and Growth Programme must, therefore, be made more flexible, in addition to the flexibility resulting from 'automatic stabilisation' , and this is why I abstained on the motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE-DE Group.
Hieronymi Report (A5-0286/2001)
The adoption of the "Television without Frontiers" directive was a milestone in Community legislation.
Yet, here we are, over ten years on, and the editorial changes needed to protect viewers and European cultural productions have still not been made.
Below are the three most important points:
a) viewers need to be protected from the flood of advertisements by strengthening the binding arrangements in the directive and controlling and punishing televisions stations which infringe them;
b) minors need general protection at Community level from advertising and from programmes which desensitise them to violence and anti-social behaviour; and
c) stricter, specific measures are needed to promote European productions and make it easier for producers in small countries to break into the wider European market.
, FÃ€rm, Hedkvist Petersen, HulthÃ©n, Hans Karlsson, Theorin (PSE), in writing.
(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats believe that it is vital that minors be protected from television advertising aimed at children , as this group is particularly susceptible and may have difficulty differentiating advertising from other programming.
In Sweden, TV advertising aimed at children under 12 is totally forbidden under the Swedish Radio and Television Act.
According to Directive 97/36/EC, advertising must be clearly identifiable as such.
Children under a certain age cannot appreciate the difference between advertising aimed at children and normal children' s programmes.
Slightly older children can appreciate the differences but not understand the purpose of the advertising. (Research report by Gunilla Jarlbro of Gothenburg University).
We therefore believe that this must not be promoted, which is why we are voting against this part (paragraph 1 aa) of the report.
First and foremost, I must thank both our rapporteur in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mrs Hieronymi and the whole of the Committee for the high-quality work they put before us and their interesting reaction to the third report from the Commission to the Council, the EP and the ESC on the application of Directive 89/522/EEC "Television without frontiers" , whose main objective is to put a legal framework in place to promote the free movement of audiovisual broadcasting services within the single market and to guarantee certain general interests such as the promotion of cultural diversity and the protection of consumers and of minors.
Many reasons can be given to justify my vote in favour of this report; I shall simply mention them.
Taking into account that 98% of homes have a television, the report firstly and quite rightly points out that the social impact of television is becoming increasingly significant, especially for children.
Meanwhile, regarding the protection of minors, the report asks the Member States to step up their dialogue, to define common solutions without threatening their independence in terms of national restrictions for the protection of minors.
This can be put in another way by saying that the audiovisual sector plays an essential role in democracy and informing the people, and is therefore emerging as a reflection of the level of freedom of expression and plurality of ideas that can be expressed and understood.
Moreover, the report also highlights the extent to which the audiovisual sector is a leading sector both in the economy and for employment in the European Union: in 1997, the audiovisual sector employed more than a million people in Europe and its revenue should increase by 70% between now and 2005.
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
BerÃšs Report (A5-0307/2001)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 January 2002, economic and monetary union will be completed.
For each Member State, there will be a continued and binding obligation and need to consolidate public budgets on a sustained basis. This is set out not only in the Commission report but also by the rapporteur herself.
I fully support this objective. I therefore welcome the report's proposal that the current requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact be expanded with new and individual objectives for each country.
Consolidating the public budget is the main priority for every government in order to create the required scope for action.
As a representative of Austria, I know what I am talking about.
Despite all the difficulties and a mountain of debt, the new government is working to ensure that the ambitious goal of achieving a zero deficit remains in place.
FÃ€rm, Hedkvist Petersen, Hans Karlsson (PSE), in writing.
(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have abstained from voting in the vote on paragraph 2 and recital B.
Paragraph 2:
It is good that the Eurogroup is developing its cooperation on monetary issues.
However, to transfer all cooperation on economic policy to the Eurogroup would be wrong.
We do not, therefore, support a possible amendment to the Treaty in order to strengthen the Eurogroup' s powers in the economic area, in any case not until we have more concrete proposals.
Against the background of EU enlargement, it is particularly important that Member States outside the Eurogroup have the opportunity to take part in economic cooperation.
Recital B:
We do not wish to give our support to progressively binding legislation in the economic area, at least not until we know more about the specific implications.
The report makes the indisputable observation that "Economic Europe is not yet a reality".
The reasons for this are no mystery.
Each national State is, more than anything else, concerned with protecting the interests of its own capitalist class and favours national policy most suited to that objective.
The ruling classes have no need, however, for the European institutions to harmonise their policies, apart from settling national rivalries, in order to improve the profitability of their capital to the detriment of the working classes.
In terms of freezing salaries, widespread lack of job security, mass redundancies, savings on public services and attacks against social protection, capitalist Europe has no need for institutional harmonisation in order to be united.
The BÃ©rÃšs report considers that "sound public finance" is the prime condition for "strengthening economic policy coordination within the euro area".
However, it does not say how that financial balance should be reached.
Who should pay?
Capitalist companies or consumers through VAT?
Who should benefit more from budgetary spending?
Public services or private employers?
Without tax gifts to capitalist companies, budgets could be used more for public services without being in deficit as a result.
This is clearly not the line taken in the report.
Under these circumstances there was no question of us supporting it with our vote.
The BerÃšs report is interesting because it acknowledges the failure of a social liberalism that thought it could combine acceptance of the Treaty of Amsterdam with genuine social policies in Europe.
The report advocates the coordination of economic policies, but realises that the institutions that could perform this do not exist.
The ECB is obsessed with one single issue, Parliament is powerless, and the Eurogroup is semi-clandestine.
The report simply begs it to please keep Parliament informed.
The report does however contain a large amount of truth, as throughout there is concern about the institutional void and regressive policies that risk being implemented under the influence of neo-liberal dogma.
But instead of saying out loud what is being discussed increasingly widely, that it would be reasonable not to apply the Stability Pact, the report is content to advocate coordination of 'their respective stability programmes' .
This quite pitiful desire to limit damage cannot make us forget that the shackles were put in place with the active support of liberal socialists, particularly in Italy and France.
This is why we did not lend our support to vague and ill-conceived orders that, more than anything, serve to make us forget that we have in fact made a huge mistake.
. (EL) A single currency requires a single economic policy.
This, basically, is the conclusion drawn by both the Commission report and the rapporteur's report.
Member States are being further restricted in the exercise of economic policy to a framework of decisions taken in advance and national parliaments are required to do no more than observe or, even worse, execute decisions taken by the ÃU.
This is an attempt to undermine the workers' facility to react, as they are doing more and more decisively, to the choices made by big business.
The EC report welcomes the EU's anti-grass roots policy and includes proposals whose sole function is as an alibi for the rampantly neo-liberal economic and social policy of the ÃU and the tragic impact which it has on the lower classes, such as prior agreement on the allocation of fortuitous or exceptional tax revenue - just to make sure nothing is spent on the social security sector.
Integrating the "issue of the ageing population" into national budgets is another move in the same direction.
While the report posits that unemployment still affects 14 million Europeans and that the economic and social situation has not improved, it remains faithful to the policy of structural change and unemployment sharing.
The involvement of the national parliaments in the form of an annual evaluation of the application of the broad economic policy guidelines decided in the European Council and the debate on the stability programmes approved by the Commission and the Council, are no more than a semblance of democracy, the aim of which is to entrap national representations in Community procedures, especially when it is proposed to strengthen the role of the Commission and impose sanctions on Member States which fail to apply the economic policy imposed by Brussels.
It is an attempt to make national institutions accessories to a process which, on the pretext of coordinating economic policies within the broad economic policy guidelines, is further subjugating wage measures and social policy measures in general to the suffocatingly restrictive criteria for cohesion and of the Stability Pact.
The Member States are expressly called on to "coordinate their actions and refrain from adopting tax, budgetary or wage policies".
The break-up of the guaranteed national insurance system, in conjunction with wage cuts and the fact that working hours and costs are arranged to suit employers, are demonstrably increasing poverty and social exclusion among the working classes and reducing the quality and extent of services offered.
Obviously, the more measures passed to restrict income and workers' rights, the greater the pressure for more structural measures, and the more the signs of slump in the economy increase, the stricter austerity policy becomes.
Peijs report (A5-0306/2001)
I voted in favour of the excellent report presented to us by Mrs Peijs for the following reasons.
As we all know, the last 30 years have seen an excessive increase in public spending in Europe, which has forced Member States to raise taxes to an unsustainable level.
It is, therefore, crucial that we reduce the tax burden, by implementing the reforms necessary to achieve this, so as to improve incentives for employment and for business activity.
The attempt that is being made to define a sustainable method of tax relief is, therefore, to be applauded.
I hope that the Commission will continue in its efforts to guide national governments' approach to tax relief, specifically by establishing a 'code of conduct' .
With regard to the issue of trying to ensure that the largest possible proportion of the active population has access to the labour market, it is essential that we abolish the social, fiscal and administrative obstacles preventing women and older people from returning to work and/or from remaining in work.
This is particularly important because features of demographic change have been - as the United Nations' report for 2000 quite rightly points out - a slowdown in the growth of the population of active age and the increase in the population over 65 years old, which raises the enormous concern of maintaining the social security system or even of trying to prevent potential economic hardship arising as a result of having an insufficiently large workforce for our labour markets.
It is equally important that we give priority to the access of young people to the labour market as well as to lifelong learning, which will require an increase in public and private spending in the fields of education, research and development, along with, of course, the respective structural reforms, so that the effective transition to a knowledge-based society can go ahead.
This report demonstrates little concern for the social and economic situation of certain Member States and dwells on the need to pursue budgetary consolidation and compliance with the Stability Pact.
This is a very short-sighted position, which is why we propose it be removed.
What is really required is the immediate suspension of the Stability Pact and a thorough review of its objectives, criteria and bases.
We also disagree with the idea that public investment is not a solution to the crisis or that it is generally poorly managed and led, which is why we have tabled a proposal for an amendment that highlights the importance of public investment for economic growth and employment.
A degree of commitment to solving social problems, job creation and combating social exclusion and poverty require no longer attaching priority to maintaining monetary stability at all costs, when we know that the consequences of this will be further unemployment, wage caps and more poverty.
Deplorably, the various amendments we tabled on a thorough rewording of the report have not been adopted.
The Peijs report is a true neo-liberal anthem that portrays public finances and social protection as the root of all evil.
For example, the report contrasts inevitably "ill-managed" public investment with the private sector, which is, naturally, efficient.
Its main function is to once again affirm the neo-liberal dogma codified in the "Stability Pact" signed in Amsterdam in 1997, and to condemn the adjustments suggested at the Gothenburg summit on automatic stabilisers.
Now that the economic climate is changing due to a persistent wage moderation policy, the report affirms the right to inflict a fresh recession on Europe.
It advocates blindly applying a policy that everyone will notice goes against the announced objectives for growth and employment.
When the economy slows down, the Stability Pact contributes to the chaos by slowing business down, because in reality it aims to achieve an unemployment level that will bring salaries back down and increase profits.
We must vote against this report, as applying it would pose a genuine danger to the workers of Europe.
.
(NL) Fluctuations, with their peaks and troughs, are characteristic of a market economy.
At times of economic stagnation of growth or when consumption levels fall, there is no sense in talking people into unrealistic optimism.
This would be a form of deceit and would lead to recklessness in consumption and risk-bearing investment.
It would be better to expand existing governmental provisions or to introduce new ones.
This was the method successfully used in America under Roosevelt during the `30s crisis, and with which western Europe was successfully rebuilt after 1945.
For that matter, it was also the method by which authoritarian states such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were able to build economies which were much stronger than outsiders had predicted.
In all those cases, whether we agreed with them or not, the result was an unexpected number of satisfied people.
Instead of learning from that, we now see a reversion to the primitive standpoints of the 19th and early 20th centuries preceding these successes.
Tax reductions, in favour of high incomes and big business, are now considered to be positive, while government spending is considered to be very negative.
The report by Mrs Peijs fits in with this now predominant trend.
As I expect poverty and instability as a result, I am not in favour.
Longo report (A5-0299/2001)
Prominent in this report is a whole set of demands for speeding up the process of liberalisation in various sectors.
It even criticises the Stockholm European Council for not having fixed a timetable for the definitive liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets, which is unacceptable.
We also reject its call for Member States to move ahead rapidly and in a uniform way on opening up the energy, transport and postal services markets.
It therefore comes as no surprise that it attacks the public monopolies, specifically in the field of electricity, that it calls for the local call market to be opened up or that it considers that the privatisation and liberalisation of public services will lead to lower prices and higher quality.
. (EL) The real world today is a world in which huge monopolies abuse dominant market position, where gigantic companies merge, consolidate or are taken over on a daily basis and where monopoly groups acquire terrifying power, invariably accompanied by thousands of redundancies, which have a huge impact on employment, and the monopolisation of wealth-creating resources, markets and consumers.
There were 345 new mergers in 2000, to quote the report, thanks to increasingly flexible legislation which fosters the creation of large monopolies which acquire dominant market positions.
However, this is of no concern to the ÃU. What does concern it is setting a timetable for the definitive liberalisation of the natural gas and electricity markets, speeding up the rate at which the energy, transport and postal services markets are liberalised and safeguarding universal access to services of general interest, in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy.
It is also concerned with abolishing state aid.
However, the desperate attempt to abolish state aid is really an attempt to increase the profits of the already strong players and to consolidate their market position by excluding new competitors and applying the law of the jungle, the law of might is right and the supremacy of monopoly interests.
State intervention does not, of course, touch the heart of the capitalist system and it often strengthens companies and businesses on a selective basis.
However, without state intervention, even with the tiny, balancing role which it can play, the gulf will widen constantly to the detriment of less developed areas and sectors and the poorest sections of society, given that structural measures and denationalisation are carried out not for their benefit but to strengthen the profitability of big business.
That is why the constant pressure for measures such as the proposed register of state aid and the subsidy scoreboard is intolerable.
All the choices made by big business illustrate how worried it is about the possible renationalisation of competition policy (i.e. control by the Member States, not the Commission of the European Union), which is why the report proposes an international competition system in the framework of the WTO.
The competition policy applied has resulted in large branches of European industry dismissing workers and losing important shares of the global market and hundreds of thousands of jobs.
The disgraceful concentration of power, in strategically important sectors, has put the economy of entire countries in the hands of speculative multinational groups, with everything that implies for the workers.
The loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs has caused unemployment to spiral.
The workers are facing the biggest attack yet on their employment and social rights, they are watching their standard of living being eroded, poverty spread and the public sector and productive base in most countries in the Union being restructured and dissolved in the name of rampant and catastrophic competition, in the name of an absolute market economy and in order to promote the monopoly aspirations of big business.
That is why protests against globalisation and the prevalence of the uncontrolled rules of the market economy are growing day by day.
We consider that the competition policy applied is responsible for all this and we intend to express our complete opposition to it by voting against the report.
Huhne report (A5-0301/2001)
In spring last year, together with the Council, we adopted the Electronic Commerce Directive which is due to come into force on 17 January 2002.
The pillar of this Directive is the country of origin approach.
When the report before us was discussed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the first time, I was surprised to find that some members of the relevant Committee wanted to call this country of origin approach into question again for online financial services.
Yet this is quite absurd.
If the European Parliament and the Lisbon European Council have set a deadline of 2005 for establishing an integrated market in financial services, we cannot afford to adopt incoherent legislation or keep re-examining decisions which have already been taken, unless we have very good reason to do so.
This applies not only to some Members of this House but also to the Council, whose vote last Thursday on the Directive on Distance Marketing of Financial Services I greatly regret.
We opted for the country of origin approach - so we should now apply it in a targeted and coherent fashion.
I would also like to join the rapporteur in congratulating the Commission on its initiative in establishing the European Extrajudicial Network (EEJ-NET) and the Financial Services Complaints Network (FIN-NET).
Simple, cost-effective, non-judicial procedures for cross-border redress can only enhance consumer confidence in the development of cross-border financial services.
Naturally, consumers must be made aware of the existence of these networks, and I therefore also support the proposal that all websites providing online financial services should advertise these networks.
Berger report (A5-0310/2001)
The services sector is of fundamental importance to the future development of the European Union' s economy and already accounts for the largest share of its GDP and more than two-thirds of employment.
It therefore deserves our full attention to ensuring improvements in its quality and to maintaining employment.
The main concerns of the Commission, however, as stated in its communication, focus on establishing an internal market for services, studying the obstacles to the free movement of services across national borders, proposing their removal, and working towards speeding up the liberalisation of postal services, the distance selling of financial services, acquisition proposals and value added tax on digital products.
The rapporteur, as well as agreeing with the Commission proposal, highlights the need to speed up and complete the process of liberalisation in sectors such as postal services, electricity and energy, which we are bound to reject, since, in general, this is designed to demote the State to a role of merely regulating the activities of public services, establishing supposedly independent regulatory bodies, which are directly or indirectly controlled by economic and financial groups.
By and large, the results of liberalisation are redundancies, increased prices for public service provision, a reduction in the quantity and quality of service provision and the rejection of the right of universal access to public services.
Khanbai report (A5-0263/2001)
The Khanbhai report makes an extraordinary analysis of one of the most serious challenges facing the world today; the fight against the main communicable diseases in the context of poverty reduction.
Communicable diseases kill around 10 000 people every day in Africa, with 35 million people throughout the world contaminated with Aids.
HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis are, therefore, a terrible threat to the social and economic development of the poorest communities, and as Mr Khanbhai argues, require a rapid, effective and wide-ranging response, in which the EU must take the lead.
These diseases cause not only human suffering and an extremely high number of deaths, which are in themselves justification enough for such a response, but also cause a drastic reduction in life expectancy and in the labour force, with all the social and economic consequences that this entails They seriously disable large working populations, retard social and economic development and destabilise communities that are already weakened.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur when he states the urgent need to create an Infectious Disease Fund, which is crucial to providing medical treatment for those affected, to identifying carriers, to prevention and research and to the development of new medicines and vaccines.
.
(NL) In questions to the European Commission, I have already on a number of occasions strongly recommended measures to ensure that medicines to combat prevalent fatal diseases are available to inhabitants of the Third World.
Remedies against tropical diseases are often available to foreign tourists from rich countries, but not to the large majority of the local population.
Existing medicines, which have worked effectively for many years, are even being withdrawn from the market. The reason for this is the lack of spending power in those countries to buy these medicines.
If we see medicines as mere commodities, protected by patent rights which ensure that the cost of earlier development expenditure is forever passed on, there will be no medicines available to poor countries and certainly not to their poorest inhabitants.
Such medicines often cost more than the annual income of people living there.
The proposals by Mr Khanbhai for international recognition by the EU of the right of developing countries to produce generic treatments for epidemic diseases without having to pay the costs of intellectual property rights, as well as the stimulation of production of treatments for diseases caused by poverty and the periodical review of the TRIPs agreement are essential to reach a solution.
The report makes a number of good points.
However, they pale before the sheer extent of the misery and shame suffered by millions of people throughout the world, especially in undeveloped countries, where they are still living in poverty, deprived of even basic access to health, and dying from infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and so on. It is even more of a disgrace when there is the certain prospect - based on official studies and research - that the situation will get worse.
The acceptance that health is a "global public good", as the report rightly points out, cannot be reconciled with the fact that a large proportion of the world's population is deprived of access to education, housing, employment, food, safe drinking water, conditions of hygiene and health services.
More than 5 million people a year die from infectious diseases, mainly in underdeveloped countries, while a handful of multinational pharmaceutical monopolies continue to patent, profit from and speculate with drugs, even going so far as to withdraw drugs which, although they save lives, fall short of profit targets.
It is not right to channel any additional resources for developing research to the private sector in the form of incentives rather than to public research centres.
It is insulting and hypocritical to state that the "global public good" of health is being hit particularly hard in underdeveloped countries, while at the same time imposing structural changes on these countries by reducing expenditure on the public service sector, especially the health and education sectors.
It is unacceptable to rely on the "charity" of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for action to safeguard this "global good" and to trust in "better cooperation" and "partnership" between the public sector, NGOs and the private sector.
Health is a fundamental and inalienable human right, it is the most important factor of social justice and human dignity and it cannot be ruled by market regulations and the laws of profit.
It is of prime and capital importance to use public-sector means to fight disease and secure the right to health.
However, a radical approach to the problem involves hitting at the root of poverty, at what sustains and exacerbates it.
The report hardly even touches on this sort of solution to the problem, making do with regurgitating constantly repeated "analgesic" announcements and proposals.
Overturning the social policy system and policies which apply the established imperialist and monopoly interests which generate and spread poverty and misery, which have no hesitation in crushing and sacrificing entire populations and nations to their cause, is the only solution to the problem.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Support for a framework agreement in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0617/2001 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
B5-0626/2001 by Mrs Pack and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
B5-0634/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group;
B5-0643/2001 by Mr Swoboda and Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0653/2001 by Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
B5-0660/2001 by Mr Lagendijk and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,
on support for a framework agreement in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Mr President, I think that two messages must be sent to Macedonia today.
The first should be to the government of Macedonia.
Much gratitude should be conveyed, as well as admiration expressed, for the courage demonstrated by the Macedonian government in proposing amendments to the constitution and giving the Albanian minority the place required by a modern democracy.
It has been difficult, and the European Union must express its heartfelt gratitude to the Macedonian government for what it has done.
The second message I think we should convey to Macedonia should be addressed to the NLA, or what is known as the liberation movement.
It will be appreciated that this originally emerged under Milosevic - I shall not go through the whole story - but now there is only one thing to say to the NLA and to its remnants in northern Macedonia, and that is: the struggle is over now; all weapons must be handed in now; there is now no reason at all for the NLA to continue with the activities of which it has been guilty - and I use the word 'guilty' advisedly, for the NLA is of course a very mixed organisation, certain aspects of which do not bear too close examination.
Now, the Albanian population has been accorded its full civic rights.
That is the way to solve problems involving minorities.
I myself come from a border area between Denmark and Germany, in which we solved all the problems 45 years ago by according both minorities, north and south of the border, full rights in a modern democracy.
That is what Macedonia has now also chosen to do.
It is the right way, and both parties deserve our thanks.
Mr President, although our views on the NLA might differ slightly, I endorse Mr Haarder's comments that the task now is to preserve peace. Peace is still a precarious commodity in Macedonia, perhaps because faith in a shared solution, a shared state and a shared society is not yet fully established.
This is not surprising, for something like this takes longer than sitting at a negotiating table and engaging in negotiations.
However, if we look at the Framework Agreement, I think it is very important that renouncing violence is the first priority.
This is a democracy; it does not need violence to bring about change.
In a democracy, it must be possible to talk about change, conduct negotiations and then bring forth legislation to achieve change.
The second point is the country's integrity.
We do not need new borders or new states painstakingly drawn along some sort of ethnic lines, but which can never be drawn precisely.
We only need to look at the capital Skopje to see how impossible this is.
I have never understood why both sides - even if only briefly - have actually talked about the option of dividing the country.
Thirdly, this is a multiethnic state.
Many countries are multicultural, but this is a multiethnic state with a significant Albanian minority which cannot treated in the same way as a five or six percent minority.
Its status must be enhanced.
Its status has been enhanced, and we think it is right that these minority rights are being expanded beyond the usual extent.
I believe that overall, a good compromise has been found.
We will be in Skopje in the next few days.
We will stress the need for the remaining necessary measures to be put in place.
For our point of view, this continual prevarication and threat that there will be no agreement and coordination after all, or that there may be recourse to violence once more, are incomprehensible and unacceptable.
I hope that just as we are able to discuss Macedonia with a greater sense of satisfaction today, this prevarication will give way to a genuine feeling of satisfaction and acceptance within the next month or so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the weapons have been collected, so it is claimed.
The NLA has been dissolved, so it claims.
We all know that there are still a great many weapons in Macedonia, and the issue of a criminal association is still on the agenda.
It includes those who want it.
I still assume that most Albanians want it. I also assume that most Macedonians want it.
However, the problem in many Slav Macedonian heads has not yet been resolved - otherwise, we would never have had the problem in the first place.
In recent years, nothing was done to enable the Albanian minority - a substantial 28 percent of the population - to participate genuinely as citizens on an equal footing.
If this issue had been addressed seven or eight years ago, instead of just two years ago, and if progressive measures had been taken to make all citizens equal, the rebels would not have had such an easy ride, in my view.
It is a pity - also for the Macedonian people - that it now looks as if there is only a response when criminal elements appear to be overrunning the country.
It is a pity, but it is the fault of all the political parties on the ground.
Ultimately, we have now achieved what this House has always asked for.
As Mr Swoboda has said, I would also like to remind you that we do not want a divided country.
Macedonia is a state.
It should continue to be a state, and it should not be divided along ethnic or national lines.
Anyone who considers this option puts the entire region at risk.
That is something which is extremely dangerous.
I very much hope that this new Parliament will also now try to implement the laws as quickly as possible.
The problem is that we are now hearing that what they have already voted for is being called into question again, and that sessions of parliament are constantly being postponed.
Obviously, there are reasons for this.
In Tetovo, for example, repeated attacks are being carried out on the Macedonian police.
We must ask ourselves why this is happening.
We must therefore be very diplomatic but firm with all our colleagues in Macedonia and ask them to make genuine efforts to progress with the Ohrid Agreement.
We must not allow any recourse to this dreadful idea of holding a referendum in order to put off these constitutional changes indefinitely.
That must not happen.
Hannes Swoboda, Joost Lagendijk and I will try to bring influence to bear on our Macedonian colleagues over the next two days.
I also think it is very important for an amnesty to be granted in whichever way is appropriate under the laws of the country, but this should not apply to crimes to be investigated in The Hague.
I think we should make a fine distinction here.
Naturally, I very much hope that the parliament will now put in place the laws necessary to strengthen local autonomy and give the minorities - which, after all, are majorities in some regions of the country - the opportunity to take genuine responsibility for their fellow citizens.
I think that if they pursue this course, as Johannes has said, we will have peaceful situations by the end of this year.
Mr President, we support the motion for a resolution, but we find it all very optimistic and hard to believe.
Did the August agreement really ensure that the multi-ethnic society and the single rule of law were in fact maintained?
We say and we hope that it did.
But the only evidence we have at the moment is that weapons are being collected and the National Liberation Army has been disbanded.
However, we do know that determining in advance how many weapons would be handed in was hardly conducive to being taken seriously.
How were the numbers calculated?
Just as we also know that it is the easiest thing in the world for a resistance movement to say that it is disbanding and then to regroup without further ado.
That is why we share the incredulity, the degree of difficulty which the Slav Macedonians appear to be having in making further progress.
We hope they will make progress.
We want to remain optimistic, but the only serious argument for being optimistic and supporting the line taken in the motion would be, first, a stable political line, not double and triple messages coming out of the European Union and ÃÃÃÃ, as has happened in the past, with catastrophic results at political level; secondly, real, generous financial assistance - and soon - and, thirdly, to give European prospects to all the Balkan states at long last, and to this particular country as quickly as possible, so that there is a way out of the crisis, hope and prospects.
Mrs Pack has, I think, rightly pointed out that there are still many problems in front of us.
But all in all, the peace process in Macedonia may still be considered a small miracle.
I fully agree with the words of Mr Haarder in congratulating the Macedonian government and pointing to the courage that government has shown.
Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, a Gordian knot has been cut.
The minority rights of the Albanians are guaranteed, the operation 'Essential Harvest' has succeeded, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia remains secure.
The multi-ethnic society is indeed being given another lease of life and dialogue is central to the parties.
We must continue to pay attention to this region, to the whole of the Balkan region.
The Afghan crisis, the war on terrorism, must not distract our attention from this part of the world.
We must invest in the stability of the Balkans.
We must invest in the stability of Macedonia.
We must ensure that sufficient support for the execution of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is being granted.
We must provide good guidance for refugees returning home.
We must see to the re-building of that country.
And I wish here to underline the words of Mrs Pack.
The political history of my own country has demonstrated that only forgiveness, only reconciliation can guarantee real peace in a country.
And so amnesty for the revolutionaries is indeed important.
This does not mean the revolutionaries who may possibly be accused before the Court of Justice in The Hague.
It concerns the others, for whom a regulation is required.
I hope that our fellow MEPs who are departing tomorrow for Skopje will be able sufficiently to alert our counterparts over there to this problem.
I also fully support extension of the mandate of the European Agency for Reconstruction in that region.
Macedonia should be brought under the scope of that regulation, and I also hope that we as Members of the European Parliament will be paying enough attention to the work of the European Agency for Reconstruction, so that we may be sure that the European taxpayer' s money is well spent in an efficient and timely manner in that region.
Mr President, if the constitutional changes and reform laws in Macedonia come into force - and we hope that this will happen soon - the country will have minority rights legislation which far outstrips the standards in the majority of European countries and most EU Member States.
We always talk very pompously about European standards - which, in reality, do not exist in this form - and often demand that other countries meet criteria which many of our own EU Member States are not prepared to comply with themselves.
Nonetheless, I am gratified by this positive development in Macedonia, not only in the wake of the most recent acts of violence but over the last two years since the Georgievski government embarked on a reform course in this area.
Once again, the violence has jeopardised this process.
I am pleased that the European Union and other international organisations, including NATO, have succeeded in shoring up the process, so that the reform course has not only continued but has actually improved and accelerated.
However, this should not be a reason for us to fob off the Macedonians with mere thanks, as it were.
Like Mr Haarder, I too believe that we owe them a debt of gratitude.
However, this gratitude must be of a practical nature.
We must finally take action in response to the scandalous handling of the issue of the country's name.
We must finally take action on the financial resources for Macedonia, which must be used to benefit the country as a whole, including the very underdeveloped east and south and not just the capital or the few regions which were particularly affected by the crisis.
What is very important is that we must finally begin to recognise that this country is our partner, based on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
We do not need any special instruments, we do not need a (pseudo) protectorate status, which is obviously still being mooted in some circles, also in connection with the idea of special agencies etc. I regard Macedonia as our partner.
The Association Agreement is the instrument through which we can channel our cooperation. We must continue to work with Macedonia in partnership and assist it in its progression towards membership of the European Union.
Mr President, we want to start by pointing out that clashes in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are continuing even now, despite the fact that the rebels are supposed to have handed in their weapons and disbanded.
As far as handing in weapons is concerned, the NATO "emergency harvest" operation involving 4,500 men only recouped 3,300 weapons, i.e. not even one gun per NATO soldier, while NATO sources are quoting a figure of tens of thousands of weapons.
Thousands of refugees are still unable to return home and the de facto division of the country continues.
At the political level, the Slav Macedonian parties are under tremendous pressure to make constitutional changes, changes opposed by the majority of the people.
The European Union representative, Mr Solana, is already in Skopje, together with the Commissioner for External Relations, Mr Patten, trying to speed up the process for the so-called "political dimension" of the agreement. To put it simply, this means that they are exerting pressure to get the fine points of the amendments to the constitution, such as a general amnesty for the rebels, voted through and, more importantly, to avoid a referendum at all costs.
The future of the country appears to the intermediaries to be too important a matter to be left in the hands of its citizens.
The ÃÃÃÃ and European Union operation has not resolved any fundamental problems.
The only thing that foreign intervention has done is to bring the rebels into contact with government officials.
Apart from the NATO corps of 200 soldiers which is now stationed in the country, intolerable pressure is also being exerted by the so-called donor meeting.
We again reiterate our fear that, unless various forms of foreign intervention stop, not only will the communities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia be unable to ever reach an agreement, they will face a new Kosovo.
Mr President, if the Macedonian Parliament accepts the constitutional changes forced by rebellion and foreign intervention, this means that the large Albanian majority in the north-west regain their rights.
Within the former Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, the Albanian language was the language of administration and education.
This right was suspended following the independence of Macedonia.
The situation is comparable with the language rights of the Hungarian minority on the southern edge of the equally new state of Slovakia.
National minorities which become a majority often appear to have no understanding for the other language groups within the territory of their state.
In 50 years' time, the roles will be reversed as Albanians come to form the largest group in Macedonia.
Only through an agreement based on equality can two peoples find a way to live peacefully as good neighbours.
In that respect, much can be learned from the government structures of multi-lingual federal states such as Belgium, Switzerland and Spain.
From that perspective I can now, in contrast to 3 May, consent to support for Macedonia.
Mr President, the Commission fully shares Parliament's view that the Framework Agreement of 13 August is crucial to peace and stability in FYROM and that the Macedonian Parliament should be urged to adopt the measures recommended under the agreement.
Commissioner Patten and EU High Representative Solana are in Skopje today to underline the importance of, and convey the urgent need for, constitutional changes and a revised law on local self-government, as foreseen under the agreement.
We face truly formidable challenges over the next few weeks and months in FYROM.
The EU is fully behind the Framework Agreement and is committed to providing financial assistance, including assistance for emergency aid and for measures in support of the agreement.
We have provided over EUR 10 m in humanitarian assistance through ECHO since the crisis began; EUR 54.5 m under CARDS in 2001, which includes a recent top-up of EUR 12 m for housing reconstruction, local infrastructure and support for host families; EUR 12.8 m under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism to repair and reconstruct houses, to repair electricity and to support confidence-building measures, such as mine clearance, election monitoring and police training; and EUR 50 m in macro-financial assistance still to be disbursed from a previous macro-financial package, which is being combined with an additional grant of EUR18 m to help FYROM cope with the specific needs arising from the crisis.
This assistance is, of course, conditional on an IMF agreement with the Macedonian Government.
The Commission and the World Bank are ready to organise a donor meeting on 15 October, provided that the Macedonian Parliament adopts the necessary constitutional changes set out in the Framework Agreement.
It is not an overstatement to say that the effective delivery of EU assistance could be critical to the success of the Framework Agreement and, therefore, to peace.
Our paramount concern is to ensure that we act quickly and flexibly.
We have therefore decided to propose an extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction, which has an excellent track record in delivering assistance throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The agency has people on the ground and direct experience in the region, notably in the sort of emergency reconstruction that we will need to deliver in FYROM this autumn, as well as in longer-term assistance of the type it is now overseeing, for example in Serbia.
We therefore urge Parliament to give positive consideration to our proposal to extend the mandate of the agency.
Beyond the Framework Agreement, we are determined to pursue a strategy of closer integration of FYROM into the European mainstream, simply, first of all, by implementing the new Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed in April.
A lot has to be done in this area and FYROM must demonstrate that it can live up to international standards by respecting minority rights and show that its democratic structures are stable enough for it to pursue its path towards European integration - in simple terms, to become a member of the European family.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.

United Nations World Day to overcome extreme poverty
Mr President, would dedicating a resolution from this House on extreme poverty on this occasion be giving in to opportunism?
I would like to remind you that on 17 October 1987 Father Wrezinski, with 100 000 people, talked about the life of the poorest families and people in our whole society and since that day, the World Day to overcome extreme poverty reminds us each year that it is our duty to unite in respecting human rights when they are violated.
If we adopt this resolution today, we are paying tribute not only to the commitment of the families and people who face extreme poverty themselves, but also to the commitment of all the associations and citizens who stand beside them.
Also, throughout the European Union, especially since the Lisbon summit, the public, national and European authorities are constantly highlighting the fight against exclusion and particularly the need for an integration policy.
It is in this spirit that today, on behalf of my group, I am presenting this resolution, which asks the Member States to develop real strategies aimed at equal access for all to fundamental rights such as education, housing and healthcare as well as culture and sustainable employment.
It is also in this spirit that we are asking the European authorities and, as far as we are concerned, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in cooperation with the Commission, to make an assessment of the policies conducted in the field every 17 October and thirdly, we ask, for the future of course, that a stone be laid in the square in front of the European Parliament in Brussels in honour of the victims of poverty like those laid in the squares at the Trocadero in Paris, the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, in Berlin, Rome and at the UN.
It is a simple but nevertheless important tribute that we want to pay today by putting forward this resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I start my speech proper, I wish to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Secretariat and the Bureau to the fact that, at least in the Portuguese version, paragraphs 2 and 11 of the Resolution are practically identical, probably as the result of a mistake in the drafting of the text.
Perhaps it would be possible, following the vote, to merge the two texts, because they are practically the same.
The purpose of celebrating this day is to discuss the serious nature of social problems as striking as extreme poverty, which affects more than one billion people across the world, who are forced to live on less than one dollar per day.
We do so in the footsteps of the person who proclaimed this day in 1987 and following the decision of the United Nations in 1992, which enshrined it throughout the world.
We must, of course, look at the programmes that we ourselves have put together to attack poverty and social exclusion.
Here I would draw your attention to the resolutions of the Lisbon, Nice and GÃ¶teborg European Councils and to the work, on which consensus has already been obtained between Council and Parliament, on the programme of cooperation in the fight against social exclusion.
I wish, once again, to pay tribute to the work of our fellow Member, Ilda de Figueiredo.
Specifically, however, we must have an idea of the problems and of our strategy.
We are facing very old problems that concern world development and we must think about the scandal that is war and corruption in so many countries that subject their citizens to the most abject poverty.
Some things have been done in our countries to combat disease, need and profound social inequalities; there are new challenges that we are aware of, specifically in the context of the information society, but there are also new problems, affecting what we in Portugal call the 'new poor' .
This is a problem that greatly affects pensioners and the elderly and I am sorry that the compromise motion did not go further than it did.
I think that there is a certain prejudice here against talking about the word 'family' , but we must be aware that the weakening of the family unit makes us all more vulnerable. It makes individuals lonelier, which is largely responsible for the contradiction we see today, which is that our societies are richer and, yet, we feel increasingly insecure.
This is highly relevant to this problem, which we must look at seriously and with our eyes wide open.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, poverty in the world is a violation of human rights and an intolerable breach of human dignity.
It affects hundreds of thousands of men, women and children.
This poverty has increased in the last six years.
In the European Union there are 65 million people living on less than 60% of the national average income, to say nothing of the differences within the Member States.
It is thanks to social transfers and social assistance systems that the poverty level has remained at 18% in the Union.
But with the slowdown in economic growth, we are in danger of exclusion and poverty being aggravated again.
An analysis of the proposals from the associations and the work of the Intergroup on the European fourth world clearly indicate that the fight against poverty and exclusion should become a vital element of sustainable development.
The objectives set should be pursued and integrated into all policies, with more resources.
I regret that the financial provision for anti-poverty programmes is still inadequate.
The Laeken European Council should adopt political measures on income, employment, housing, health, education, training and culture.
Parliament should also have objectives guaranteeing the right to quality housing for all, against the constant withdrawal of employment and services and re-establishing citizenship and equal rights.
This is also why, on the occasion of the World Day against poverty, which will take place on 17 October, the European Parliament, in cooperation with the associations concerned, should also promote initiatives to raise awareness and to mobilise people to eliminate poverty and destitution.
I hope that this day will enable us to make a further commitment to implementing programmes against poverty, by developing economic and social policies that really deal with the underlying causes of that poverty.
Violations of human rights in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam
Mr President, the prospect of economic reform in Vietnam has certainly improved over the past few years. However, there is still no progress as far as political reform is concerned.
There is a constant flow of reports about the arrest, detention and ill-treatment of dissidents in Vietnam.
Defenders of democracy, critics of the communist regime, religious communities and former refugees who want to invest in Vietnam are still at great risk.
International human rights organisations are still not getting a hearing from the Vietnamese government.
They are also banned from monitoring developments and carrying out inspections in the country.
The central government is doing its level best to block any form of communication between the dissidents and the rest of the world.
International donors must challenge human rights violations and must call for political reform in Vietnam in addition to economic reform.
I am very much in favour of strengthening the economic ties between the European Union and Vietnam.
However, as one of the country's biggest donors, the European Union must take a firmer stance and do more to ensure that human rights are respected there.
I would also strongly advocate an independent investigation into the well-being of Mr Binh Vinh Trinh and other investors in Vietnam.
Having made a fortune abroad by working extremely hard after fleeing from Vietnam, as many people did a few decades ago, Mr Trinh started investing in his native country again.
However, he was arrested under the pretext of illegal investment, and brainwashed in solitary confinement, all of his possessions were seized and his investments were confiscated.
This acts as a deterrent and naturally has an extremely negative impact on the decisions of other investors.
There must be proper legal protection of foreign investments and investors in Vietnam and the corruption there must be brought to an end.
This is an essential precondition for future economic and political development in Vietnam and her links to the world economy.
In addition, Vietnam must protect, safeguard and guarantee human rights.
There has been absolutely no progress in Mr Trinh's case over the past few months.
He is still on the run and none of his or his family's unlawfully seized possessions have ever been returned to him.
As soon as he sets foot in Vietnam, he will be put straight back into prison.
I call on the government of Vietnam to make a gesture by respecting the rights of Mr Trinh and other investors and those of other political dissidents.
Mr President, twelve years ago, a Czech human rights activist in Prague wanted to appeal to a Western head of government for help in the face of his impending imprisonment.
This Western head of government did not receive him.
A few months later, the human rights activist became President of Czechoslovakia. His name was VÃ¡clav Havel.
From then on, the Western head of government had a great deal of difficulty in getting an audience with the Czech President, who refused to receive him because he wanted to make it clear that this failure to respond to human rights violations and the flouting of human dignity was unacceptable.
European Union states are pursuing a similar policy today with regard to Vietnam.
It is a policy of autosuggestion.
It is claimed that Vietnam is pursuing a reform course.
It is also claimed that Vietnam no longer has such a repressive regime as before.
Yet the reality sends out a very different message.
Persecution of human rights activists has increased.
Injustice and the suppression of press freedom have increased, as has the suppression of religious freedom.
If we look at the reality of the situation, we must recognise that this regime cannot be set on a reform course without massive external pressure.
Economic and geostrategic interests, too, cannot be sustained in the long term unless there is a stronger emphasis on the rule of law throughout South-East Asia, but especially in Vietnam.
That is why it is in the European Union's interests to abandon its policies of autosuggestion at last and speak out about human rights violations in Vietnam.
The European Parliament adopted this approach with regard to Central and Eastern Europe before 1989.
It was fairly isolated at the time, but events proved that it was right.
The European Parliament is pursuing the same course today on Vietnam, and I appeal to the Commission, and especially, of course, to the Council and Member States to adopt a more pro-active human rights policy with regard to Vietnam and genuinely send out a clear signal, for in this region of the world, we are dependent on this important country, with its great culture, returning to a more democratic course based on the rule of law.
Only then can it be a real partner - also in the economic field - in the long term.
Mr President, Vietnam has once again flouted its international commitments and its own Constitution.
The conviction, following a botched trial, on 26 September, of 14 members of the mountain ethnic groups for having peacefully demonstrated in favour of freedom of religion and the establishment of an autonomous area in their province is a fresh illustration of this acknowledged contempt for human rights.
They went to join the dozens of prisoners of conscience who are rotting in jail in atrocious conditions, while international human rights observers are unable to get into the country to do their job.
The failure to respect individual freedoms should not be tolerated in a country that claims to be democratic and which we have ourselves supported in its fight for independence.
The use of the death penalty - more than one hundred sentences passed in 2000 - is also unacceptable.
Vietnam, which is an economic and trade partner of Europe, and which has also ratified the international convention on civil and political rights, must respect its international commitments and stop persecuting ethnic minorities.
Political liberalisation must go hand in hand with economic liberalisation.
Without that, the country cannot be considered by the European Parliament as a democratic State.
Mr President, today I must join with the authors of the joint resolution in standing against the failure to respect human rights in Vietnam.
The European Parliament has spoken out many times on this matter, the last time only three months ago, to condemn the violation of the freedom to practice religion.
The country, which is still run by a Communist party, still represses, on a daily basis, any group or individual considered to be a threat by those in power.
My fellow Members have already said that the freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, religion and association, rights of ownership and the right to vote are flouted.
What is also serious is that no international organisation or independent observer is authorised to come and monitor the human rights situation in the country.
Let us recall that in April, Vietnam celebrated the 25th anniversary of its reunification.
The Vietnamese government, which has signed many international conventions on human rights, had an excellent opportunity on that occasion to reaffirm the commitments it had given in that respect.
Vietnam is demanding a place on the international stage and has potentially everything in its favour to become a prosperous country.
Reality, unfortunately, shows the situation to be quite different.
The Vietnamese people live in poverty, their society is in decline and the country is still under-developed.
By signing a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union in 1995, Vietnam gave a formal commitment to respect human rights and promote democracy.
The joint EC/Vietnam Committee that met in September in Hanoi reconsidered all the aspects of relations with the European Union, including the joint agreement on democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law.
I call on Parliament today to give its full support to the European Commission in implementing its partnership strategy in the region.
We must all encourage the process of reform in Vietnam.
Respect for fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression and freedom of conscience should constitute the basis of sound and constructive cooperation with that country.
Health situation in the Republic of Uzbekistan
Mr President, Uzbekistan, the land of Bukhara and Samarkand is now in our thoughts as the border country of Afghanistan with Taliban-linked extremists operating in its territory.
We acknowledge that there are human rights problems in that country to be tackled, but we welcome its partnership in the fight against terrorism.
Yet not many of us are aware of the other crisis in Uzbekistan.
Reporters report on the problem and potential problem of refugees in the area.
They do not report on the 13 million people affected by one of the worst droughts in history in the area, that started in the spring of last year.
They do not report that six million children under 14 are affected.
They do not report that drinking water and irrigation water is in desperately short supply, that most of the crops in the affected areas have failed, that poor-quality drinking water and sanitation problems have resulted in one of the highest levels of ill health in the region.
They do not report that only 54% of the people in urban areas in Uzbekistan have access to sewage networks, or that only 3% in rural areas have such access.
As a result, parasitic infection is rife and the third cause of infant deaths is diarrhoeal disease.
Malnutrition and poverty have reached crisis point.
We need urgent action to supply essential drugs and equipment, to strengthen water-quality control, to support and monitor nutrition programmes, to train health workers and conduct health education programmes.
We also need to help the country change from its heavy use of agrochemicals, its diversion of rivers and its poor drainage system.
I commend this motion to the House.
Mr President, anyone who visited Uzbekistan during the Soviet era was enchanted by its glorious Islamic heritage, its thriving markets - especially compared with the markets elsewhere in the Soviet Union - and its lively atmosphere.
We are therefore especially concerned about the situation in Uzbekistan today, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is no longer a booming country; it is a country in a difficult political situation, scarred by hunger and environmental devastation.
Intensive cotton farming with excessive use of fertilisers has undoubtedly contributed to this environmental disaster.
Furthermore, as the previous speaker has just pointed out, Uzbekistan is now in a situation in which we must fear the worst over the coming weeks and months, especially in light of developments in Afghanistan.
The European Union is called upon to help the region as a whole - for in a situation of economic privation, environmental devastation, and a permanent threat from Islamic fundamentalist or terrorist groups, it would be an even greater disaster if the European Union failed to help the people in this region by supporting them in their efforts to overcome the catastrophic environmental and health situation and assisting them to achieve a modicum of economic prosperity, and above all by providing basic foodstuffs.
I am sure that Commissioner Nielson, who is the appropriate person to participate in this debate today, is already giving thought to these issues and making preparations with his staff for what has to be done today, but above all, what must be done in the event of further disasters, e.g. in response to refugee flows from Afghanistan.
Our task is not simply to deliver great sermons.
This is not a clash of civilisations; it is not a campaign against Islam. What we must do is to take practical action during the coming weeks and months and show the people that we genuinely wish to express our solidarity and support with more than just words.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mr Swoboda's words.
I am the chairman of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Uzbekistan.
Please allow me to give a personal account today.
Last June I spent an entire week travelling around Uzbekistan with a European Parliament delegation.
We visited the Karakalpakstan region, the region where they are struggling with the serious problems of the Aral Sea.
The situation there is disastrous.
Commissioner, could I have your attention for a moment?
We met the people there.
We met the relief workers.
They expressed their thanks to our delegation, they spoke to us and they gave us messages, but they also told us: We have seen so very many delegations come and go.
When will something finally be done about the water problem in our region?
When will the European Community, when will the whole international community help us to actually do something together with the other countries in this region?
The situation there is disastrous, including in the area of public health.
Mr Wiebenga and I visited the local hospital in Nukus where patients with TB are treated.
The situation there is degrading.
The sewers in the basement are broken. They are absolutely overflowing with human excrement.
There are mosquitoes flying around.
The stench there is unbearable.
Patients have to keep the flies and mosquitoes off their bodies, with the result that patients who should really be staying for three months leave.
They go home.
They infect members of their families.
They infect other people around them.
I believe that as an international community we must take our responsibility seriously.
I therefore hope that the Commissioner will be able to promise us some concrete measures soon.
Otherwise the text of the resolution that is before us receives my unqualified support.
East Timor
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, East Timor is the first new State to emerge freely and democratically onto the international stage at the start of the new millennium.
The European Parliament must take pleasure in this result.
The issue of East Timor has been on our international agenda for a number of years.
We have given voice to those who have fought to return dignity to the Timorese people and to have their right to decide on their own destiny recognised and we have condemned the violation of human rights by Indonesian troops and by militias sponsored by them.
I must emphasise the work undertaken by so many Members of this House.
In particular, I wish to refer to Carlos Costa Neves, who has chaired the inter-group 'For East Timor' and who has taken part in each of the European Parliament' s missions to that country.
We may have helped the people of East Timor to regain freedom and democracy, but we also have a responsibility for helping them to consolidate their gains.
East Timor needs help from the international community: political, technical and financial help.
Without this assistance, it will not be possible to rebuild what was destroyed, assemble a new administration and ensure the necessary development.
This is why we call on the international community: to provide more support and assistance.
Our compromise resolution, therefore, calls for an extension of the United Nations mandate, for the return of the refugees who wish to return to their countries and for the fight against the impunity of those who have committed crimes and who have violated fundamental rights.
Lastly, I must say that I am glad to see a considerable degree of consensus and multiparty support for the candidature of Xanana GusmÃ£o for the Presidency of East Timor.
This Sakharov prize-winner could be a reference point for unity and could make a fundamental contribution to consolidating the new democratic institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, normally at this stage in the proceedings, we discuss accidents, disasters, calamities and all manner of things that cause us deep sadness and pain.
As Mr Coelho has already said, East Timor used to be one such case.
Today, however, is a joyous occasion.
What we have seen and heard today is the success of the process in Timor.
At this moment, I should also like to tell this House of the gratitude of the Portuguese and, of course, of the Timorese people, for the increasing solidarity that their cause has enjoyed in the European Parliament and which has spread throughout the world.
Mr Coelho has already mentioned the various resolutions and the high point, which was the award of the Sakharov prize to Xanana GusmÃ£o, the distinguished leader of the Timorese resistance, who will be, by broad national consensus, the next President of the country.
This should serve as an example to us of how, with tenacity and patience, we can achieve positive results and help good causes.
Three years ago, anyone in this House who said that this would really be happening today would definitely have been called crazy.
Three years ago, we could not have imagined the referendum of August 1999 and the overwhelming consensus of the Timorese people.
It would have been impossible to imagine that the tragic crisis following the referendum would be overcome and that, on 30 August this year, we would have the first elections of a new, free and independent State.
We must continue to help East Timor.
We made a major contribution to winning the independence for which they were fighting, in defence of their identity.
We must keep this sense of responsibility alive and remain vigilant to the potential dangers in a geo-political context that remains highly uncertain.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the East Timorese people on the conduct of the peaceful and democratic elections for the Constituent Assembly on 30 August.
I am particularly honoured to be able to speak about East Timor today as I was the Chief Observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission in the country between 23 August and 11 September, and was able to see for myself just how important these elections were for the people of East Timor.
Before I turn to substantive issues, however, I would first like to congratulate UNTAET and especially Sergio Vieira de Mello on their work, which was often carried out under very difficult conditions.
I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the Independent Electoral Commission, the European Commission both here and in East Timor, and the smooth cooperation with UNDP, the Embassy of Portugal, and the Belgian EU Presidency.
East Timor has taken the first step towards independence and the founding of a separate state.
What is especially important now is the continued support of the international community and the European Union, for the country faces enormous challenges.
It is therefore essential that the UN peacekeeping units and civilian police remain in the country until East Timor is able to take over these security tasks itself.
The EU Member States must lobby hard for this with the United Nations.
It is important for the European Union and the United Nations, as well as other donor countries such as Portugal and Germany, to continue their technical and financial assistance, for the Commission and the Council to take a positive stance on East Timor's application for accession to the ACP - the "Everything But Arms" Initiative, for example, could take effect immediately - and for the EU to support the East Timorese government in developing a master plan for the country's development.
In this context, the EU should focus particularly on rural development and health.
The entire administrative sector must also be strengthened and, in some areas, built up from scratch.
However, it is education, above all, which will be the basis for and a key element of all the development projects - for one thing is clear: these democratic elections are an extremely important step for the country's future.
However, we must not forget that this is just the first step out of many which must be taken towards a functioning democracy and civil society.
For East Timor's further institutional development, it is also important for the EU to participate in the arrangements for the presidential elections and the necessary voter education.
There are many other examples, but one thing, above all, must not be allowed to happen: we must not withdraw from responsibility now that the foundation stone for an independent state has been laid and abandon the people who are only gradually beginning to recover from the trauma of the dreadful events of 1999.
Instead, let us be prepared for the fact that our support will continue to be needed for many more years.
As a key factor in this context, the assistance must be coordinated efficiently if it is to achieve its objective.
After my many discussions in the country itself, I am certain that the East Timorese people are aware of the problems facing their country and understand only too well how difficult the way ahead will be.
Let us work together with the East Timorese people as equal partners.
We will also be sending out a positive signal to the international community - that it is possible to resolve problems peacefully and initiate development, especially at the present time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the tragedy in East Timor, one of the most beautiful pages in recent history has been written.
The principles of an ethical international policy have triumphed in East Timor.
The example of this country gives us further hope that world history is not merely a succession of barbaric acts and cruelty.
At a terrible time, in which fear and apocalyptic concerns prevail, East Timor represents a ray of light and hope.
Elections to the constituent Assembly in East Timor have been the crowning glory of an impeccable democratic process that does honour to the United Nations and, above all, to the people of Timor.
Not all is rosy, however, in Timor as you all know.
It is a very poor country, has an economy to rebuild, a State to organise and health, education and social protection systems to create.
Only with the help of the international community, specifically the European Union, will Timor be able to turn its independence into something marvellous and a fine example for the rest of the world.
My own country, Portugal, will certainly devote a great deal of affection and support to Timor, since it has become both a Portuguese and a universal cause.
Colombia
Mr President, Colombia - one of South America's oldest democracies and a country which, unusually for this continent, has not been prone to military dictatorship - is tragically a victim of 37 years of civil war and terrorist activity, which have destroyed infrastructure, killed 40 000 people and corrupted its civil and military authorities through guerrilla involvement with the drugs trade.
It seems from the events of 11 September in New York that democracies are particularly vulnerable to terrorism, which has no respect for the ballot box as a way to achieve change in societies.
Now - and in spite of Colombian President Pastrana's concession three years ago of a large demilitarised zone the size of Switzerland, where 17 000 of its guerrillas roam at will - the FARC, instead of pursuing a legitimate, peacefully negotiated settlement, continues its policy of kidnapping and murdering civilians.
Last Sunday it killed the much-loved former culture minister, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, and on Tuesday Congressman Octavio Sarmiento.
I am sure that this House will join me in sending a message of condolence to their grieving families.
Pastrana's policy of granting concessions to the FARC, labelled a terrorist organisation by the USA, has remarkable parallels with the policy of Britain's Tony Blair of granting early release to IRA killers without a prior insistence on the arms decommissioning to which they had already agreed.
Curiously, three IRA suspects are currently under arrest in Colombia for advising the FARC on how to conduct murderous campaigns, on which, as we know, the IRA is an expert.
I do not have a clear answer to President Pastrana's dilemma, as only 18% of Colombians in a recent poll supported suspending peace talks, scrapping the demilitarised zone and resuming full-blown civil war.
Only the Colombian Government can decide what is best for the future of its country and what price it is prepared to pay to achieve peace.
Nevertheless, I am sure that, as well as supporting this resolution, this House will join me in praying for the long-suffering people of Colombia and in hoping sincerely that the FARC and the guerrillas will see the folly of their evil ways and that the Colombian Government will achieve a policy of reconciliation without compromising justice or freedom.
Mr President, it would appear from the last speech that the Government of the United Kingdom is responsible for the violence in Colombia.
I would like to state that up to now, in the documentation I have seen, I have not found any involvement by the Government of the United Kingdom in the violence in Colombia.
The fact is that in Colombia people are being killed - the revolutionaries (the FARC) kill them, the paramilitary organisations linked to the Government kill them - and to make any kind of pronouncement right now as to the guilty parties in Colombia seems premature to me.
At present there is a situation of violence and those responsible for that violence are in fact the Europeans, because we Europeans left in Colombia, as in many other countries, a trail of injustice, of social differences, which persist to this day.
The European Union has been concerned with Colombia for a long time.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to influence events in a very positive way.
But we have at least succeeded in increasing the country' s economic activity to the point where, today, 40% of Colombian exports are destined for the countries of the European Union.
I believe that in the European Union we are faced with a somewhat desperate task, because the years are passing and the violence continues.
The violence also affects us closely.
For example, in Madrid, forty Colombians have been assassinated in the last six months by Colombian drug trafficking organisations, by hired assassins who come specially from Colombia to kill their fellow citizens.
If the events of 11 September have demonstrated anything it is that violence in the world has no limits, that in a globalised world violence affects us all and that therefore, any action we take in a faraway country such as Colombia ultimately benefits our own citizens as well.
We have to protect our citizens and the citizens of the whole world in lands as remote as Colombia.
I know that the Commission and the Council are restricted in terms of achieving such results.
If the Colombian Government, if a large number of people dedicated to achieving the pacification of the country in the country itself (writers, intellectuals, etc.) have failed to achieve those results, it is unlikely that we will be able to achieve them, but I believe - I am availing myself of the presence of the Commissioner, who deals with a very sensitive area concerning this issue, to say this - that we should continue our efforts.
Rather as in the myth of Sisyphus, we should continue rolling the stone from the bottom of the mountain to the top, despite all events to the contrary.
I am convinced that both the Commission and the Council will agree with Parliament on continuing to help the Colombian Government and the political leaders of good faith of that country to find a solution to put an end to the escalation of violence, which seems to be plunging Colombia, that magnificent and stupendous Latin American country, ever more into the abyss.
I therefore hope that, between the three institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, we may help in some measure in the pacification of Colombia.
Mr President, the political violence in Colombia is a crucial obstacle to peace and development in the country.
No other country in the world has as many murders of active trade unionists as Colombia.
The Colombian Left has been, and continues to be, subject to a terror campaign without parallel.
Unfortunately, there is a clear risk that the violence will be further stepped up ahead of the presidential election.
The resolution criticises both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries for the violence.
Criticism can fairly be levelled at the guerrillas for kidnappings and violence against the native population.
However, it is quite clear that the paramilitaries are responsible for the majority of the political violence.
At least 90 percent of the political murders are carried out by the paramilitaries or the military.
The paramilitaries would not be able to conduct their campaign of terror without indirect support from, and acceptance by, the regular police and military.
Therefore, Colombia' s government also has direct responsibility for stopping the paramilitaries' campaign of terror in the country.
The EU' s role must be to uphold human rights, support the peace process and oppose the military escalation of the conflict inherent in Plan Colombia.
The demilitarised zone must therefore, also continue as an important precondition for dialogue between the government and the FARC guerrillas.
Colombia can only achieve peace and real democracy if human rights are respected.
If it is not possible for Colombia' s Left to operate openly and legally, without having its representatives murdered, the guerrillas will not lay down their weapons.
It is therefore crucial that the terror campaign against the Colombian left is recognised and combated.
This applies especially to the UniÃ³n PatriÃ³tica, to which the murdered Member of Parliament Octavio Sarmiento belonged.
The UniÃ³n PatriÃ³tica has had at least 4 000 of its members shot by the paramilitaries.
Criticism of this could have been expressed even more clearly in this resolution which we are about to adopt.
Despite this, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that the text of this resolution is sound, and it is vital that, in the future, we carefully monitor and react to developments in Colombia.
Mr President, "Chronicle of a Death Foretold" was the title of a novel by GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez, that has now become a sad reality in the birthplace of the winner of the Nobel Prize for literature.
The eight bullets that assassinated Yolanda CerÃ³n, head of social care in Tumaco, were also foretold and once and for all destroyed the already precarious working conditions of human rights activists on the ground.
For a year the paramilitaries have reigned in the town of NariÃ±o.
The government lets them do as they will and the list of the dead gets longer.
Just before killing Yolanda, the paramilitaries publicly executed thirteen peasants in Teima.
On Sunday morning, the former Culture Minister, who had previously been kidnapped, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, was murdered during a chase between the army and the guerrillas.
Then, the day before yesterday, the paramilitaries assassinated Octavio Sarmiento, a Member of the National Congress.
We know that anyone who defends human rights in Colombia is a target for the paramilitaries.
A clean-up campaign was even announced in August.
The government had already withdrawn the legal basis for the existence of the paramilitaries in 1989, but has never done anything to seriously dismantle them.
On the contrary, the law on defence and national security, ratified by President Pastrana in August, made the situation even worse.
The law, which is a real blank cheque for all sorts of violations of human rights, extends the army' s powers and freedom to act in a frightening way and reduces the power of the public prosecutor.
The close links between the army and its illegal right arm, the paramilitaries, is well known and the "Human Rights Watch" report, published today, only serves to underline this.
The European Union needs to question the bases of its cooperation with Colombia.
We are still waiting for the first six-monthly report on the progress of human rights in Colombia promised one year ago.
If the European Union takes defending human rights seriously, it should explain its criteria and mechanisms for evaluation and effective protection to us.
If it takes the peace process seriously, it should encourage the pursuit of dialogue between the government and the guerrillas, categorically exclude the paramilitaries from the negotiations and support the report from the committee of experts, published on 28 September.
Finally, if it takes its own commitment to legal reform seriously, the first thing the European Union must do is to support the widespread calls for the law on defence and national security to be repealed.
Mr President, I will respond to each of the five issues.
The UN World Day to overcome extreme poverty is a welcome opportunity to highlight the continuing unacceptable levels of poverty and social exclusion across the world and to stress the need to intensify efforts for their eradication.
Being able to lead a life free from poverty and social exclusion is a fundamental human right.
While the challenge of combating poverty and social exclusion is particularly acute in developing countries, it also remains an issue of major concern within the European Union.
The most recent available evidence shows that 18%, or over 60 million of our population in the EU, are at risk of falling into the category of being among the relative poor.
This is a very high figure.
At the European Councils of Lisbon, Nice and Stockholm, Member States made a commitment to promote sustainable economic growth and quality employment which will reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion as well as strengthening social cohesion in the Union between 2001 and 2010.
The intention is to reaffirm and further enhance the importance of the European social model and to ensure that social policy has an equal status alongside economic and employment policies and that all three reinforce each other.
To underpin their commitment, the Council developed common objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
It also agreed that these objectives be taken forward by Member States from 2001 onwards in the context of two-year national action plans against poverty and social exclusion.
Furthermore, the Council established a new open method of coordination which encourages Member States to work together to improve the impact on social inclusion of policies in fields such as social protection, employment, health, housing and education.
The national action plans and the development of comparable indicators provide the framework for promoting exchange of good practice and mutual learning at Community level.
This will be supported from 2002 by a five-year Community action programme on social inclusion which was finalised following a successful conciliation session involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 18 September.
All Member States submitted their national action plans against poverty and social exclusion during June this year.
The Commission has been analysing these reports and expects to adopt a draft joint inclusion report on 10 October.
This will be the first time that there has been such an EU-level analysis documenting and comparing the situation on poverty and social exclusion across all Member States.
It is intended that the joint report will be adopted at the Employment and Social Policy Council at the beginning of December so that it can be tabled and reviewed at the Laeken European Council.
Parallel to the work on the national action plans against poverty and social exclusion, work has been going on to develop a list of common indicators in the field of social inclusion.
This will also be presented to and adopted at the Laeken European Council.
On the basis of these developments, the Laeken European Council is expected to define the priorities and approaches that will guide efforts and cooperation at Community level.
The issues and concerns raised in the debate on these resolutions are thus well reflected in the initiatives that are being taken.
However, a key challenge for the future will be to ensure that all Community decisions, in economic and employment as well as social, policies, are assessed for their impact on social cohesion.
While a lot is now happening, there is no room for complacency.
Days like the United Nations World Day for the eradication of poverty provide an important opportunity to remind us of the urgency of the challenge we face if we are to build a more inclusive and peaceful world free from the scandal of poverty and social exclusion.
Looking at the global aspect of this challenge, the first and most important point of criticism is the pathetic level of official development assistance, which is now 0.24%, far from the 0.7% that was promised.
This is where everyone will be looking on that World Day and we must come up with a European answer to that problem.
Another issue we will be facing is financing for development in March next year.
Ãhe policy of the European Union towards Vietnam, as to all other countries, is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns both publicly and in private where abuses or any deterioration in the situation are observed.
We have to draw attention, however, to the tendency of the Vietnamese administration to want to control the pace of change and to maintain "social cohesion" during transition to a market economy.
Of course, I do not need to remind you that the European Union is opposed to capital punishment.
In the case of Vietnam, the number of offences where the death penalty can be applied was reduced last year.
Juvenile offenders, pregnant women and nursing mothers were also excluded.
We welcome this progress, but we want to see the abolition of the death penalty altogether.
Our principal concern remains that of freedom of opinion.
The original "offence" of Professor Nguyen Dinh Huy in 1992 was to be a co-founder of the "Movement to Unite the People and Build Democracy" a movement supported by Vietnamese exiles in North America.
Before that, he had been an active anti-Communist.
The detention and interrogation of 15 people last month reported by Human Rights Watch was apparently linked to a request to the government to set up an independent "National Association to Fight Corruption" .
The common thread in all these cases is that, despite some real progress, Vietnam remains a country little accustomed to public dissent.
The situation of the Montagnards in the central provinces arose from a complex set of unresolved old problems, but was certainly exacerbated by the lack of effective channels of communication between the local people and the central government.
What is needed in Vietnam is continued progress in the country' s reform programme, so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and to appreciate the value of accommodating dissent in the system of government.
When Mr Patten was in Hanoi last July he took the opportunity to raise some of these concerns with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister.
Next month, we will be holding in Hanoi a meeting of the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission, at which all aspects of our relations will be reviewed, including our shared commitment to respect for human rights.
We shall continue to raise particular issues of concern and individual cases and to encourage continued progress on human rights in Vietnam.
On the situation in Uzbekistan, the Commission shares the European Parliament' s concern about the present situation in Central Asia.
It is clear that the drought is causing damage in the Aral Sea area and particularly in Western Uzbekistan.
For example the Amu Darya, where the major problems lie, is reported to have 70% of the normal water level in its upper reaches and just 40-45% in the lower stretches.
In addition to natural causes, some structural reasons can explain the present situation such as poor maintenance of water-irrigation systems, inadequate water management at regional level between the newly independent states, and agricultural practices which are water demanding such as rice and cotton.
Lack of sustainability would be the short version of what this is all about.
The July 2001 UN assessment mission to Western Uzbekistan has attributed the absence of water to fundamental structural problems (such as irrigation and crop policies).
So what is needed are ways to improve water management and agricultural practice.
These activities are of a developmental nature.
The response so far here is not falling within ECHO's mandate as such.
We are, however, looking at this region from a humanitarian aid point of view, where we see a real risk of a negative fall-out from the situation in Afghanistan.
In fact, ECHO will include a strengthening of the ability to do something relating to this part of the world in a package soon.
The absence of democracy, transparency and accountability, corruption at all levels and misuse of the flow of assistance provided by the international community are all part of the problem.
Since the independence of these countries, no real effort for maintaining the water system has been made.
In addition, national rivalries between the countries in the region have blocked cooperation and also international efforts have been made more difficult.
We have been active in Central Asia in trying to develop long-term projects linked with the structural causes of the drought.
A Tacis programme has been developed to fight against the consequences of the drying of the Aral Sea.
The Commission thinks that only long-term reform by the Uzbekistan Government itself can solve the current problem.
Emphasis should be put on: the creation of alternative forms of employment in the drought-affected areas to improve the irrigation systems in use in these affected areas and, in general, improve water conservation; the introduction of more drought-resistant and less water-hungry crops through further research into new crops, pilot schemes, model farms and whatever is necessary to farm in a sustainable manner in this environment.
Definitely a more effective allocation of water throughout the region is needed.
We hope that Tacis can develop activities to address these issues, in particular at regional level, but the challenge is huge relating to our actual means.
Let me turn to East Timor.
The democratic elections on 30 August were a cornerstone in the transition towards independence.
The Commission was pleased to see how peacefully the electoral process took place.
The outcome - with no two-thirds majority for a single party - will require the Constitutional Assembly to work together and to seek a consensus.
This will hopefully stabilise the political landscape even further.
I think we can be justly proud of the contribution made by the European Union election observer team, and I am happy to congratulate Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler on his leadership of the team of 24 Observers.
We will certainly look into the possibility of sending another observer team to the presidential elections in 2002.
In general, I am very pleased with the cooperation with the Parliament and Parliament can be pleased with itself because of its ability to deliver high-quality electoral observation.
The next steps in the formal process will be the adoption of a constitution, hopefully before Christmas this year, followed by the election of a head of state by popular vote, probably around May 2002.
Then will come the withdrawal of UNTAET and the declaration of independence.
This process seems to be well on track.
At the same time, the evolution of the political process appears to be equally well under way.
The highly commendable performance of UNTAET, the recent nomination of an interim cabinet and the further "timorisation" of management functions in the administration have all contributed to this process.
East Timor' s regional anchorage will add an additional foundation.
East Timor is at an historical juncture.
The emergency phase is over.
We now have the chance to get the ambitious independence process right.
The international community has to consider now the long-term development issues.
The Canberra Donors' Meeting last June outlined the current, clearly unsustainable, economic situation and signalled the need for further international assistance.
There is a narrow tax base, a lack of skilled entrepreneurs, and rural poverty leading to demographic pressure on the urban areas.
But there is a realistic perspective for substantial oil revenues coming on stream around 2005-2006. This could change the picture dramatically.
The national budget could double and could hopefully ensure financial cover for basic state functions, as well as some stimulus for the economy.
We need to support the effort of the East Timorese to manage these oil activities better than what we have seen in many other developing countries.
Statistics will tell us that it should not be very difficult to do it much better, which may not even be good enough, but definitely it is an opportunity.
I would say that so far, so good.
It would be wonderful to have best practice demonstrated in this field.
Lack of transparency in this area is case-by-case across the world the real reason for a lot of trouble.
Against this politico-economic background, and as one of the major donors for East Timor, the Commission has identified its future role accordingly.
We anticipate the need to support one of the poorest countries on Earth until oil revenues provide a more stable economic basis.
We will seek to create a development relationship based on a partnership philosophy. This means taking a realistic view of all the requirements.
We are currently drafting a Country Strategy Paper, outlining the sectors.
Most likely rural development and public administration will be where we concentrate our activities, suggesting appropriate financial targets for 2002-2006 within these sectors.
This is how we will try to do it: focussing both on poverty alleviation and capacity building.
As was said in the debate, East Timor will also be able to benefit from the 'Everything But Arms'Initiative, helping it to develop its foreign trade.
Finally, I turn to Colombia.
The Commission shares the deep concern expressed by Parliament concerning the deterioration of the situation in Colombia, in particular, the continuation of human rights violations.
The Commission is seriously concerned with the situation of the Peace Process in Colombia after the recent events that have taken place and it is waiting for the evaluation of this process announced by President Pastrana.
The Commission intends to maintain its support to the Colombian people through ECHO.
EUR 10 m are being spent this year.
In addition, the Commission has approved under its human rights budget, four new NGO projects worth over EUR 3 m.
As announced by myself in Brussels on 30 April at the third meeting of the Support Group for the Colombian Peace Process, the Commission is currently finalising its proposal for a programme of a "Peace Laboratory" in the Magdalena Medio region in Colombia.
This programme envisages the support of actions and movements already being implemented by civil society at local and regional level.
The Commission sincerely hopes that conditions on the ground will allow an early implementation of this programme.
The Commission will continue encouraging the Colombian Government and all other relevant political forces to remain strongly committed to the peace process in Colombia, especially during this time of unrest.
As Mr Medina Ortega said, this reminds us very much of the labours of Sisyphus.
It is true that it is hard to see progress, but there is no doubt that any relaxation or any type of giving up would definitely make things worse.
This is our simple analysis and this is why we continue.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
Southern Caucasia
The next item is the joint debate and then the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0618/2001 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus;
B5-0624/2001 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on developments in relations between European Union and the Southern Caucasus;
B5-0630/2001 by Mrs Schleicher and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group PPE-DE, on developments in relations between European Union and the Southern Caucasus;
B5-638/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Southern Caucasus;
B5-0649/2001 by Mr Linkohr and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus;
B5-0661/2001 by Mr Gahrton and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and also a little impertinent to speak before the Chairperson of my delegation, Mrs Schleicher, whom I would have preferred to follow.
However I thank Mrs Schleicher, Mr Posselt and my other colleagues who have contributed to raising, and now, debating a subject that is forgotten, that of the Southern Caucasus.
I dare to hope that following the tragedy in New York and Washington, some of us have been made more aware of the importance of this area of the world, of the importance of a region that is in fact the doorway to central Asia, now a hostage of the Russian Federation, as is, to a large extent, not only the Southern Caucasus but also the Northern Caucasus, which is in an even more tragic situation, whether Commissioner Nielson likes it or not.
The Northern Caucasus, as we all know, is experiencing the tragedy of Chechnya, a tragedy that is continuing and that sees opposition from the European Union.
The resolution before you contains a number of very specific proposals.
Most importantly, the Commission and the Council have been asked to draw up an overall strategy for this region of the world, a strategy that could reverse the current constant tendency towards the deterioration of the situation.
The reason that living conditions in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan are so difficult, particularly Armenia and Georgia, is the constant, daily work of the Russian Federation, which the European Union is not acting against in any specific way.
This is so true that even an apparently harmless issue such as the opening of delegations in Bakou and Armenia has not yet been resolved by the Commission.
The problem has been raised on numerous occasions by this House, by Mrs Schleicher as Chairperson of the delegation with those countries.
During our meetings in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, we have been asked to speak many times.
We have done so and we still have not had an answer.
This is a case that has been open not only for a few months, but for a few years.
Either the European Union must understand that this region is strategically important, particularly for its energy supply, and start to discuss and propose a policy, or in a few months' or a few years' time we will witness the birth of the new Balkans, a little further away from us and therefore perhaps a little less uncomfortable than the Balkans of the 1990s.
I think, nevertheless, that it is up to the European Union to give a response.
These countries are part of Europe, they are already members of the Council of Europe, they feel European and in their heart of hearts - they do not dare to ask openly because the Commission and the Council have made it understood that it would not be very appropriate - their ruling classes want to belong to the European Union.
We need to respond with action, with investment, we need to re-establish confidence, we need to take our entrepreneurs, investors and companies there.
It is quite a small market but, and I repeat this especially for the benefit of the Commission, it is the gateway to central Asia, a strategic region which, as we have seen over the last few weeks, is particularly unstable.
I therefore think that the European Union urgently needs to strongly intervene in this region.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, due to the tragic events of recent months, foreign and security policy is currently at the top of the public's agenda.
In the light of the events in the Middle East and America, it is easy to forget that the situation in the Caucasus is just as explosive.
The problems faced by Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - including the relations between these three states - still give cause for concern.
Political instability repeatedly threatens the still incomplete independence process.
As a result, violent conflict within these countries is often the focus of public attention.
Yet the history of Europe - especially the history of the European Union - shows that despite the differences and conflicts of interest between states, it is possible to form alliances and thus transcend borders.
Where war once dominated the scenario, we now have peaceful and democratic co-existence.
It is based on the establishment of democratic structures and an emphasis on commonalities, which helped the Western European states to overcome their differences.
In the light of the global coalition against terrorism in all its forms which has emerged since the dreadful attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001, there is thus a need to support the states of the Southern Caucasus in their efforts to combat terror and violence which, sadly, are still a feature of daily life in these countries and threaten many people's lives every day.
The region's democratic structures are still quite new and fragile.
The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that disunity is incited from outside, and the neighbouring states in this region could try to impede or halt the democratisation process for their own interests.
For these reasons, one of the European Union's key tasks must be to give more support to the democratisation process in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Democracy is the only basis for lasting internal stability which in future will also transcend borders.
However, the European Union and the present Belgian Presidency should focus solely on providing assistance and support; under no circumstances should they intervene in these countries' internal affairs.
In specific terms, this means promoting these states' cooperation and cohesion, also as regards the possibility of a free trade area which must be set up without external influence.
The initial elements of trilateral cooperation are already in place; however, they must be expanded and supported in order to counter existing external influences successfully.
If these countries' shared rich cultural heritage is integrated into this process, I am confident that in the medium and long term, important results and successes can be achieved.
As Chairman of the European Parliament's Southern Caucasus delegation, I regard the EU Ministerial Troika's visit under the Swedish Presidency last February as the basis for necessary initiatives.
The joint motion for a resolution tabled by seven parliamentary groups signals the broad agreement between Members of the European Parliament on this issue.
I hope that the Commission, too, will make our concern its own.
Mr President, I think it would be useful if we concerned ourselves with the Caucasus, possibly with permanent observers and little rhetoric.
This historical moment is pushing us towards regional cooperation even in destabilised areas and towards perhaps unforeseen alliances in the interests of greater stability.
If I wished to make a point about the resolution, it would be this: the three countries - Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia - perhaps should not always be treated like Siamese triplets: their recent histories differ, their problems differ and their efforts to build a genuinely democratic system differ.
It would be unfair if any of the three had to wait until the others caught up in the democratisation process.
In this context it would, of course, also be necessary to analyse what the West and the major countries have done in such regions and to analyse, for instance, whether the ethnic revolts in Georgia are local or led from outside, and if so by whom.
I would then like to know why we hear so little about the Minsk Group, founded to seek a compromise between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Is it still meeting?
Even that is not clear.
The European Union should develop a political role that is more obviously adventurous and daring in the region, as the document states - this is the main message - beyond the conference of the three Southern Caucasus states and the European Union.
Given the situation, however, a discrete presence of Russia and America might be considered somewhat useful for a proper balance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how far is the European Union going to let the situation in the countries in the Southern Caucasus deteriorate before it finally decides to fully commit itself to the region, in keeping with local and regional expectations?
Europe needs to provide enough funds to support its policies, and that is far from being the case for the Caucasian regions.
A few months ago in this House, members of the delegation for relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia urged the European Union to become involved and to commit to a firm and determined policy for the region, where geo-strategic interests are at stake that are both significant and varied.
We cannot continue to say one thing and mean another.
Our commitments need to be followed by specific actions.
Implementing a Commission delegation in each of the countries would send out a strong political signal.
It would be irresponsible to make these countries, who are struggling to affirm their identity, complete their transition process and establish a real democracy, believe that they can count on the political support of the European Union when the reality is that nothing is actually taking place and secretly it is only the oil and gas in the Caspian sea that are of interest.
That would be unacceptable.
Although the Swedish presidency took an initial step by visiting the countries concerned, what has actually been achieved?
And has the report by Mr Gahrton, not been put back to a later date in the schedule?
Moreover, as my fellow Members have said, this is a matter of urgency: does the OSCE not describe the situation as a state of no war?
Let us not forget the powder keg of the impassioned claims on Nagorno Karabakh and the desire for independence of some regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Yes, Mr President, yes Commissioner, the European Union has an essential role to play in this region.
It should take the initiative of a Europe/Caucasus conference with the various States in order to establish, through a non-violent solution to the conflicts, lasting peace and sustainable development.
Mr President, we pointed out years ago that the Caucasus and Central Asia threatened to become the Balkans of the future.
Hardly anyone has shown any interest in this region; among the heads of government, only the Pope seems to have shown any concern, and what the Pope is among the heads of state, Ursula Schleicher is here in the European Parliament. She has shown exemplary commitment to this often forgotten region.
My fear is that the events of 11 September will be misused in order to create new spheres of influence, with entire nations and ethnic problems being forgotten or sacrificed to energy supply interests.
After President Putin's speech in the Reichstag, many people have forgotten that he was the person who reignited the war in Chechnya, and that as the head of the secret service under Mr Yeltsin, he incited and manipulated the conflicts in Migrelia and Nagorno-Karabakh.
This is why these European regions are entitled to our solidarity, and we must ensure that we have a presence there.
I therefore appeal to you, Commissioner, to put President Putin's words to the test.
If he is genuinely interested in improving the situation, tell him you are going to Chechnya, that you want to test the water for more openness and a greater presence for the European Union. As regards the three states of the Southern Caucasus, we need Commission delegations at last, not only in Georgia but also in the other two states.
This is a region which affects Europe's vital interests, not only in strategic and energy supply terms, but also as regards human rights and our cultural links with this region.
The EU has strengthened its ties with the region since the entry into force of the partnership and cooperation agreements with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in 1999.
Since the EU Ministerial Troika's visit to the Southern Caucasus last February the EU has been looking for further ways to support efforts to prevent or resolve conflicts, as well as contributing to rehabilitation.
A Political Directors Troika visit followed in September.
The EU is also stepping up its dialogue with the relevant interlocutors, including Russia, Turkey and Iran.
It is true that what could be called "frozen conflicts" are a serious impediment to the development of the region.
The EU is keen to see further and rapid progress made by the OSCE Minsk Group for Nagorno-Karabakh, the OSCE Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia and the UN Group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Abkhazia.
The Commission has participated in the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia since April 2001 and provides funds for rehabilitation projects.
External actors such as Russia, Iran and Turkey play a key role in the region.
Any effort to stabilise the Caucasus will have to take their interests into account.
In particular, the role of Russia is paramount.
The EU has raised the issue of developments in the Caucasus in its political dialogue with Russia, supporting all efforts to defuse tensions and resolve conflicts.
In particular, we have encouraged Turkey to explore any opportunity for normalising its relations with Armenia.
Mr Dupuis mentioned the issue of our delegations.
I agree that this is a problem but, unfortunately, not one which the Commission can do anything about.
We are a victim of the decisions made in this House on this matter.
It was not the Commission that wanted to limit the number of our delegations to 120.
Our view is that it is normal for the EU to have delegations everywhere.
We are told to open a delegation in one place or another, and at the same time we are asked to stick to that limit.
This is an impossible job.
Please make up your minds and help the Commission to expand the coverage of delegations.
That is my response to the comment made by Mr Dupuis.
Concerning the impact of the work of the support group, we had our last meeting in Russia on 2 August.
I am sorry to inform you that no progress was made there, and so the outlook is not very encouraging.
Turning to Mr Posselt's comment on the risk to this region of negative fallout from the events of 11 September and thereafter, this is something we will include in the analysis.
We will try to release more money for ECHO this year from the emergency reserve.
We are including this region because we fear and predict that humanitarian aid requirements will increase as a foreseeable, indirect consequence of the said events.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Political situation in Myanmar (Burma)
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0622/2001 by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;
B5-0639/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the political situation in Burma;
B5-0650/2001 by Mrs Kinnock and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;
B5-0656/2001 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Burma;
B5-0657/2001 by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;
B5-0664/2001 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Van Orden, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the political situation in Myanmar/Burma.
Mr President, Commissioner, for ten years, a whole world of citizens, politicians and journalists have taken an active interest in, and been horrified by, the fate of Aung San Suu Kyi.
Despite the enormous support she enjoys among the Burmese people and the crushing victory she and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won in 1990, she has not been able to take on her leadership role formally.
On various occasions, she has been kept isolated, and now she has been under house arrest for a whole year.
The Nobel Peace Prize and our own Sacharov Prize have drawn attention to her and to her courageous struggle, but they appear not to have swayed the Burmese junta.
The general human rights situation in Burma is alarming.
Representatives of political parties are kept in isolation, thousands of people are in jail for political reasons, dissidents are persecuted and religious and ethnic minorities harassed.
Forced labour and torture are commonplace.
According to Amnesty, there are around 2 000 political prisoners, including journalists and several elected parliamentarians.
The EU Troika and UN observers now confirm that there are some signs of change.
Several prisoners have been released, attitudes towards the NLD have softened and several party offices have been allowed to open.
From a situation in which there was a total refusal to engage in dialogue, discussions have now taken place, and a process of reconciliation may be underway.
It would be very welcome in a country which, for so many years, has been governed by one of the world' s toughest military juntas.
It may be the case that a window of opportunity has now been opened.
In anticipation of further signs and surer indications that the junta really would like to enter into dialogue and accept the demands of the NLD, the EU should not however relinquish its common policy.
When the Council meets at the end of this month to discuss Burma, it is important to keep the sanctions in place for the time being and to keep the pressure up so that the dialogue continues, genuine steps towards democracy are taken, human rights are respected and, especially, Aung San Suu Kyi is released and allowed to take her place as the elected leader of the Burmese people.
Mr President, the situation in Burma is disastrous.
Hundreds of thousands of people are living, without any real humanitarian aid, packed into refugee camps in Thailand, China and Bangladesh.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced into labour or displaced against their will.
The political system is corrupt and repressive.
The democratic opposition has been suppressed since it was elected on 27 May 1990, and more than 2000 people are in prison.
Amnesty International condemns the institutionalised torture that takes place in these countries.
All these human rights violations are crimes against humanity that need to be stopped and denounced in order to be definitively condemned.
Who finances this regime besides the revenue obtained from the illegal sale of drugs?
Well, there is TotalFinaElf, also present in Angola, Congo, Chad and Cameroon, and additionally found to be connected with the sinking of the Erika and in the accident in Toulouse.
I think that this company, and this regime, should be boycotted.
More than ever we need to support Burma' s democrats.
The European Union should affirm that Aung San Suu Kyi is the only real chance for Burma and must take every possible measure as quickly as is possible to move this military dictatorship towards democratic transition.
Mr President, I believe that this is the sixth resolution on the situation in Burma that we have introduced along with fellow MEPs.
It is now more than 10 years since Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi won the election there by a large margin.
The country was subsequently taken over by a military dictatorship.
It is also more than 10 years since the elected parliament was dissolved and many of the members of parliament were murdered, went missing or fled.
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned and then placed under house arrest.
Her house arrest continues to this day.
The repression continued even after she had won the Nobel Peace Prize for her peaceful resistance and was subsequently awarded the Sakharov Prize by our Parliament.
This same repression was also unleashed on the population, and in particular on a number of minority groups, with unprecedented viciousness.
Many people fled, with the result that there are many refugees in neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and India.
However, there now seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel.
A number of political prisoners have been released and talks have been going on between the junta and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi.
Nobody knows what the outcome will be, however, and on that point I would like to warn the European Commission against making any premature concessions to the Burmese military government until it is clear that they are genuinely willing to release all political prisoners.
Or that they are genuinely willing to stop repressing minority groups.
Or that they will genuinely allow refugees to return.
Or that they intend to restore democracy or allow Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi to take her place as president of Burma.
In December, it will have been 10 years since Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize.
If there are still no positive developments by then, the European Union will have to step up its measures and put a freeze on investments, for example, just as the United States has done.
We call on the Commission and Council to exert more pressure so that democracy can finally be restored in Burma and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi can take her rightful place.
Mr President, anyone who knows this paradise in South-East Asia as I do, having visited it several times in the last fifteen years, is bound to be appalled by the chronic supply shortages, the catastrophic infrastructural situation and the brutality of this highly repressive regime.
Yet political systems like the regime in Burma/Myanmar only survive if there are enough states and private companies prepared to keep them alive through economic links.
If we want to change the political system, we must also exert appropriate economic pressure.
The double standards involved in calling for democracy while engaging in intensive trade with this country really should stop.
However, this means that pressure must be brought to bear on those who single-mindedly continue to cultivate their economic links with the military regime with utter disregard for the need for democratisation.
Mr President, like the honourable Members of Parliament the Commission welcomes what could be called the positive developments that have occurred in Burma/Myanmar, in particular the on-going talks between Aung San Suu Kyi and the ruling SPDC, the release of a growing number of political prisoners and the reopening of 20 party offices of the National League for Democracy.
This said, it has to be acknowledged that the improvement in the political climate in the last year is clearly only the beginning of a process which now should be further deepened.
Thus, we still need to see a clear move towards a process of constructive dialogue and achieving respect for internationally accepted standards of human rights.
We have no guarantee of irreversibility in this respect, so we have to be cautious and we have carefully noted the advice given by Members in this debate.
We should encourage the government to continue this progress by fully responding to the concerns of the international community, as articulated by the United Nations Special Envoy, Mr Razali.
At this stage, it is very important to strike a careful balance between recognising the progress achieved so far and maintaining a firm pressure for continued efforts, which can pave the way for democratic reforms.
I am convinced that Members share the Commission's hope that the on-going talks will lead to concrete results, which could enable the European Union to consider positive measures to support the process.
As regards the situation of the ethnic minorities, the Commission shares the concerns voiced by Members and remains convinced that a lasting political solution in Burma/Myanmar must be based on agreement between the SPDC, the democratically elected "opposition" and representatives of ethnic minorities.
All EC humanitarian aid to Burma/Myanmar is provided through NGOs or international agencies.
The Commission is currently exploring the possibilities of increasing humanitarian aid to Burma in full compliance with the terms of the EU's Common Position on Burma/Myanmar.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
Patenting of human genes
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0633/2001 by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the human gene register BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer);
B5-0641/2001 by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the human gene register BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer);
B5-0651/2001 by Mr Gebhardt and Mr Paciotti, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human gene register;
B5-0663/2001 by Mr Lannoye and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human gene register;
Mr President, I regret that I must remain seated.
On 30 March last year, Parliament declared that people and their genes or cells in a natural environment cannot be patented.
However, if a patent is granted to Myriad Genetics, this will create a monopoly situation for one particular company.
This means that there is a danger that certain genetic tests and some of the DNA diagnostic tests in Europe will be commercialised.
Three applications for patents on sequences and applications of a breast cancer gene have now been accepted by the European Patent Office.
Applications from Myriad for patents on the BRCA2 gene are still being processed.
If these patents are awarded, this US company will have a monopoly on the BRCA gene and consequently on the DNA test.
This means that abnormalities in patients from families with a history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer will only be able to be detected with this American test.
If Myriad is going to use a similar system in Europe to the one it uses in the United States, the samples from all future laboratory tests will have to be sent to the United States, which will also be very expensive if the analyses have to be done there.
This means that there is a danger that a monopoly may be created, which will put the quality of European diagnostics at risk.
It also means that the availability of data for analysis purposes and the development of new diagnostic applications in our own molecular and testing laboratories will be limited, which will push up the cost of breast cancer screening and therefore of health insurance.
Not only Parliament but also everyone in society who is involved in this has registered objections in this regard.
We therefore ask for this monopoly position, which is in nobody's interest, to be opposed and the patent application to be rejected.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it will not only horrify a great many women to see that a US company, through the patenting process, has effectively acquired ownership of 'breast cancer genes'.
The fact that in the race for money and profit, a great many people's health is put at risk is enough to make anyone's blood run cold.
Yet this is exactly what threatens to occur following the award of patents on the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes.
As a worst-case scenario, many patients may face delays in the early detection of breast cancer as a result of these patent awards.
Yet with this type of cancer in particular, early detection is crucial to increase the chances of recovery.
Furthermore, the virtual monopoly on test methods pushes costs so high that early detection of breast cancer is no longer available to many women.
Nor should we ignore the extent to which the BRCA patents are impeding research in Europe.
One of the leading cancer research institutes - the Institut Curie in Paris - has highlighted this situation and provided impressive and conclusive proof.
It is very welcome that this prestigious research institute has taken action and, with the support of the French Ministry of Health, is initiating an opposition procedure to the patent award.
This House will certainly not be making a mistake if it supports this position.
A welcome step would be to call upon the responsible agencies to lodge immediate appeals against the award of the BRCA patents with the European Patent Office in Munich.
It is also important that we should appeal to the institutions and governments of the EU Member States to lodge similar appeals as a matter of urgency.
We owe this to the women affected. This is the least we can do for them at this point.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next Tuesday, in response to an application by the Netherlands which is supported by Italy and Norway, the ECJ will decide on the Patent Directive's compatibility with the Treaty.
Today, the European Parliament, through its vote, will decide between the reality and the Directive.
The BRCA patents in particular make it clear that the price of medicines is being increased unnecessarily and that monopolies are being created which impede effective diagnosis and therapy and block research into new and useful drugs.
The time has come for the Commission - and I call upon the Commissioner present to make a statement on this issue - to put an end to the conflicts surrounding the interpretation of this Directive, either by amending the Directive or adopting guidelines.
In my view, the Commission should not bury its head in the sand and say, well, we know that many Member States have problems with this Directive because they do not know how to apply it; we know that the European Patent Office interprets it in a particular way.
I therefore urge you to make a statement on this issue.
The human body must not be degraded to biological material.
Human genes or living organisms or elements thereof must not be subject to patent law.
A discovery must not be recast as an invention.
We must prevent monopolies on human genes impeding research into new and useful drugs.
We cannot stand and watch the early detection of breast cancer falling by the wayside simply because patent rights are to be created for something which is not an invention but, at the very most, a discovery.
Action is required not only by the European Parliament - we have, I believe, made it quite clear with this resolution that we are not prepared to stand and watch - but also by the Commission and the Member States.
