All initiatives to promote sport are, therefore, always welcome.
In line with the old adage 'a healthy mind in a healthy body', sport must start at school and it is extremely important that everyone, both men and women, enjoys identical conditions, which are also appropriate to their level of involvement.
The under-representation of women in decision-making on sporting matters in sports federations and associations is not a problem specific to sport, but is an issue that needs to be duly addressed in this area too.
The Union must encourage women's participation, although we believe that some of the proposals constitute excessive interference, both in the competence of the Member States and in sports associations' ability to manage their own affairs - in other words, a dual breach of the principle of subsidiarity.
.
(FR) I have to admit that this report already has one merit: it amused me.
The title, 'Women and Sport', might itself have been confusing, but the content is entirely beyond comprehension!
I have read and reread this crazy report and I have still not grasped the ins and outs of it.
I did pick out some classic passages, on access to sport as a fundamental right, on sport as a highly sexual and stereotyped area where the dominant models of virility and femininity are reproduced but also broken, and on socially discriminatory and sexually stereotyped treatment by the media, which leave us speechless.
But no, I can definitely find no justification for this report other than enabling an MEP to indulge in a style exercise that is worthy of the greatest humorists, So after 'Women and Sport' roll on a report on 'Sport and sexual minorities'!
Who was it who said that 'in politics, talking without saying anything and not saying anything for the sake of talking are the two major principles of those who would be better to keep their mouths closed'?

(FR) Breast cancer and cancer in general are a scourge which is not, in my opinion, inciting Europe and its Member States to take sufficient action in terms of research, prevention and quality of care, but also in terms of psychological monitoring of patients, who are often left alone to face this cruel illness.
I therefore support everything that is done to remedy that situation, and I would like to highlight the funding that I succeeded in having adopted by the European Parliament and the Council when I drew up a report on the sixth framework programme for research and development.
I therefore do of course support the excellent and relevant report by our colleague, Mrs JÃ¶ns, and her constant efforts in this respect.
.
(PT) The incidence of breast cancer has been steadily increasing.
The report that has just been adopted argues that the prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of the disease must be improved.
According to the WHO, 216 000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the European Union in 2000, and in that year 79 000 women died of the disease.
This is the most common cancer in women, affecting one in nine and is the most common cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 55.
The risk of developing breast cancer is 60% higher in Western Europe than in Eastern Europe, hence the proposal to create, by 2008, the conditions required for a 25% reduction in the average breast-cancer mortality rate in the EU.
The Member States are invited to offer all women aged between the ages of 50 and at least 69 a mammography every two years, as laid down in the European Directives on Guaranteeing the Quality of Mammographic Screening, since only eight of the fifteen Member States currently have national screening programmes.
All women suffering from this form of cancer must have the right to be treated by multidisciplinary teams.
Hence our vote in favour of the report.
.
(PT) I congratulate the rapporteur on this report, which is so important and timely.
Its importance and timeliness are confirmed by data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which states that in 2000 more than 79 000 women died from breast cancer.
The broad majority achieved in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities also confirms the aptness of the report's content, since there were only two abstentions and no votes against it.
Amongst the rapporteur's suggestions, I would highlight making the fight against breast cancer a priority for health policy, implementing a two-yearly screening model for all women between the ages of 50 and 69 and the regular attendance of doctors and paramedical staff on further training courses.
Something else that will be crucial is a clear commitment to cure this and other types of cancer.
I, like many others, believe that cancer remains the real 'disease of the century', which must be given priority.
.
(FR) Breast cancer is the principal cause of death among women.
In 2000, in Europe, this disease of the industrialised world lead to the death of more than 79 000 people.
In Belgium alone, no less than 10 000 new cases of breast cancer and 3 500 deaths are recorded every year.
There is a lot of work to be done.
That is why I voted in favour of the report by Mrs JÃ¶ns, which is very comprehensive, sometimes too much so, and proposes some interesting routes for reducing the death rate by 25% by 2008.
In order to achieve this, the report rightly stresses identifying the risk factors, coordinating national policies and screening programmes.
It is crucial that mammograms are free across the Union for women between 50 and 69.
It is just as essential to seek out women who are not so well informed and less accessible.
Mobile screening programmes, which have been running Belgium in the province of LiÃšge, for more than ten years, have enabled more than 70 000 people to be examined.
So many women who, without the mammobile, would not have automatically done the test at a doctor's surgery or hospital.
Mr President, I am in something of a crisis as far as the Rules of Procedure are concerned.
We are dealing here with explanations of vote.
We now have written explanations of vote. They are used to ensure that Parliament does not have to deal with everything.
We now come to Explanation 5/2003.
In the English version, there is a reference to 'crimes', while the German version has 'Verbrechen'.
In the German text a Verbrechen is an offence (Straftat) carrying a penalty of at least one year's imprisonment.
I believe this to be too strong a term, and therefore when I signed I added, 'I sign this subject to the reservation that the correct translation would be Straftat'.
The same problem occurs in Danish: Forbrydelser also means Verbrechen.
I would ask you to pass on the question to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure as to how we should proceed in such a case.
The interpreter was in despair and said that 260 people had already signed and he could not now replace the German and Danish language versions.
In any case I should like to make it quite clear for the Minutes that my signature was not given for Verbrechen, but for the correct translation of the English word 'crime', which is Straftat, a term that includes both Verbrechen and Vergehen.
I do not know what the original language version was, but the normal procedure is to ensure that all versions correspond to the original language.
We have noted the point you have made.
Mr President, I am entitled to make both a personal statement and a statement concerning the Rules of Procedure.
Mr van Hulten has invited me to respect democratic decisions.
It was a democratic decision of this House that this report should be dealt with this afternoon.
Therefore it is not I who have gone against a democratic decision.
Secondly, you have taken Rule 145 as your basis, and I should like to draw your attention to Rule 145(2), which states quite clearly, 'If the proposal or request is carried, only one member may speak from each political group which has not yet provided a speaker in that debate'.
That means that, if Rule 145 had really been applied, an opportunity to speak would have had to be given to one Member from each group!
I am therefore really asking that these things should be clarified.
The clarification is simple.
Every single speaker in the debate had withdrawn, so there was no debate anyway.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.51 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, in the Minutes from yesterday I am not entered as present, when I was clearly there and took part in all the roll-call votes.
I have already asked for this to be rectified.
Thank you.
I will also be able to confirm that you were present.
The next item is the report (A5-0157/2003) by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman on relations with the complainant in respect of infringements of Community law [COM(2002) 141 - C5-0288/2002 - 2002/2148(COS)].
Mr President, respect for Community law is a fundamental part of the future of Europe.
The European Commission, which has to ensure that Community law is applied, has to maintain special relations with citizens who are witnesses to, or the actual or alleged victims of, violations of Community law and who lodge complaints with its services.
The communication that inspired this report demonstrates the Commission's desire for transparency and efficiency.
As it committed to doing, it publishes in consolidated form its internal rules of procedure governing its relations with the complainant.
It also ensures that it keeps in contact with the complainant throughout the investigation of his complaint according to a strict schedule.
It was following an own initiative report and criticisms made against the European Ombudsman when a complaint was closed, and also repeated requests from the European Parliament, that the European Commission has reconsidered its administrative methods for dealing with relations with the complainant.
It should be noted that the Commission enjoys discretionary powers with regard to assessing complaints and deciding whether or not to commence infringement proceedings and to refer a case to the Court of Justice.
This is not, therefore, about reconsidering the way in which complaints are handled but about enabling citizens to be informed, in particular about the progress of the examination of their complaints.
We note with satisfaction that the Commission's proposal is entirely a step in the right direction.
We consider that the administrative measures taken by the Commission as regards the consideration of complaints are particularly welcome and that they allow complainants to be regularly informed of the stage reached in the proceedings.
Moreover, we regard the maximum one-year period that the Commission has undertaken to comply with in order to respond to each case as entirely reasonable, given the number of complaints lodged and their complexity.
The only point that seems to me to be missing from this communication, however, is the situation when a complaint and a petition are lodged at the same time.
As you know, the Commission is not the only institution to respond to citizen's questions regarding the proper functioning of the institutions and the correct application of Community law.
The European Ombudsman and the European Parliament, through its Committee on Petitions, also receive an increasing number of complaints.
A complaint lodged by a citizen may therefore also be the subject of a petition to Parliament lodged by the same citizen.
This is when two complaints are lodged at the same time, each of them being treated differently according to the institution with which it was lodged, according to a different timetable, which, you will understand, is a source of confusion for both citizens and the institutions themselves.
It seems both desirable and logical for decisions made by Community institutions regarding complaints, appeals or petitions to be coordinated between the institutions concerned in order to provide an effective service for citizens.
This is why we are urging the Commission to revise the interinstitutional agreement, which dates from 1989.
It should also be considered that this was when the position of Ombudsman was introduced and the right of petition was recognised in many Member States, which considerably increased the number of appeal cases.
Despite all of the Commission's competence in processing complaints, citizens should still use the Committee on Petitions, which considers and responds to the problems raised in a more political way, but the Commission and Parliament obviously complement each other in order to ensure the effective service required.
Moreover, the need for information is going to increase in the years to come, with the arrival of ten new Member States in the Community.
Allow me to finish by mentioning something very promising that the Commission has done: creating Solvit.
The purpose of Solvit is to settle, very quickly - and when I say very quickly I mean within ten weeks, with four additional weeks in the event of additional problems- recurrent cross-border problems concerning the internal market, and to prevent legal actions.
What is different about Solvit is that it involves Member States in a partnership with the Commission for investigating the case.
This is evidence of integration, which is enjoying growing success, and the Commission is to be congratulated on this progress, the ultimate aim of which is to make life simpler for citizens in terms of respect for Community law.
. Mr President, the Commission is pleased to note that Mrs Fourtou's draft report welcomes the communication on relations with the complainant in respect of infringements of Community law.
This communication serves two purposes.
The first is to raise public awareness of the procedural rules which apply to complaints handled by the Commission.
The second is to tighten internal discipline as regards notification given to complainants at the main stages of proceedings, including, where appropriate, when cases are closed.
The Commission is ready to work with Parliament to examine ways of improving coordination of the two bodies' response to state measures which are incompatible with Community law, such measures being brought to the institution's attention either via petitions or complaints.
Mr President, it is well known, and those of us who are members of the Committee on Petitions have been well aware of it for some time now, that this Parliament and the institution of European Ombudsman are not overly happy about the way in which the Commission has been handling complaints by European citizens.
There have frequently been many criticisms in this respect.
Therefore, the Ombudsman, in relation to a complaint concerning the Macedonian Joint Venture, stated at the time that the Commission would have to reconsider its operating methods in respect of complaints by citizens, in other words in respect of the intercommunication between the Commission and European citizens.
So now we have this communication from the Commission, which recognises that the handling of this intercommunication requires a better framework, mainly from an administrative point of view, in the area of permanent personal contact with the citizens who have submitted the complaint or petition, and in the area of the classification of complaints, treating them properly and reasonably.
The report by Mrs Fortou has arrived in this context, and I would like to congratulate her on her work.
The agreement must be maintained up to the end.
We call on the Commission to welcome the proposals in this report, which make a great deal of sense.
I reiterate, therefore, that we give our full backing to this report, and to the Commission we say that we are at a particularly opportune and interesting moment, coinciding as it does with the accession of 10 further Member States, to pursue this action.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Fourtou on her report and to thank her.
My group is of the opinion that the Commission communication is a step in the right direction, since it recognises how important the role of complainant is in the exposure of infringements of Community law.
The Commission must welcome the citizen as the provider of a service, and must look after citizens' interests.
Only in this way is trust created, and the feeling conveyed that the EU is a Union for its citizens.
The citizen must always be shown ways in which he can assert his rights as a citizen of the Union.
This must also apply to the Commission even if it turns out that the Commission is for once not the right body to which to turn with a complaint.
The citizen must have the feeling that this is what Europe is, and I say Europe because we must remember that many citizens do not make any distinction between the institutions.
The citizen must therefore be given an answer.
Therefore I particularly welcome the fact that this communication includes this aspect.
I would have liked the wording to be more clear, however, in particular by stating that the Commission must in all cases show the complainant an alternative means of recourse to law.
Citizens must be dealt with and informed individually and personally.
The Commission must inform the complainant immediately and consistently.
Here it is also important that the complainant really does have the opportunity to present his complaint to the Commission in person and to explain it in more detail.
The good intentions of the communication must now be put into practice and must not be allowed to remain merely a theory on paper.
Like the rapporteur, I too am basically of the opinion that the one-year time limit for processing complaints is sufficient.
That means, however, that the one-year time limit must be the rule and that the citizen is able to rely on really obtaining an answer within one year.
I do not believe the excuse that the Commission does not have enough staff in order to do this to be a valid one.
Like Mrs Fourtou, I regret the fact that the communication did not make any connection with the petition procedure.
For years the Committee on Petitions has been demanding intensified inter-institutional cooperation.
This has already been referred to in the Perry-KeÃler report.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating not only the rapporteur on the report but also the Commission on the communication.
For us it represents an important step in recognition of the role and legitimate rights of citizens who file a complaint with the Commission.
It is also the first time the Commission has adopted public rules on how to deal with infringements of Community law by Member States.
Those public rules are often a marked improvement on the practice in a number of our Member States.
Secondly, I recall that when the previous Ombudsman, Mr Jacob SÃ¶derman, asked the Commission to adopt rules on how to treat complainants, his recommendation was to recognise that the complainant was a party to an administrative procedure.
While my group considers that this should be the final objective, it also considers that the adopted code is a genuine improvement.
Perhaps there will be an opportunity to advance further through the adoption of an administrative law for the Union's institutions and agencies.
Thirdly, I want to mention an area on which my colleague, Mr Wyn, and I tabled an amendment which was rejected by the committee - which is unusual because our committee normally shows very good sense.
The report at the moment states that the Commission enjoys a discretionary power in relation to its consideration of complaints.
While we recognise that the Commission needs a certain discretion as to if and when it opens an infringement procedure, the discretion has to be used in compliance with the Commission's obligations to ensure that Community law is implemented and applied.
Article 211, which makes the Commission the guardian of the Treaties, and Article 226, which gives the Commission the right to open infringement procedures, constitute the essential safeguard in the Treaties for the application of the acquis.
Therefore, we are concerned about this view of the Commission's powers of discretion being extremely wide and would prefer to have them described as providing a certain margin of appreciation.
Finally, I want to stress, as the Convention is coming to a conclusion, the importance of maintaining the Commission's role in monitoring the implementation of Community law.
The number of complaints received by the Commission and the number of petitions to Parliament clearly show that citizens need that opportunity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her very short and succinct report.
It is very much to the point, and that point is that we need more transparency and commitment on the part of the Commission in its administration and towards the citizens of the Union - something that has already been mentioned.
I believe that a time-limit of one year is not only appropriate, but is even very generous.
We have Member States where commitment to schedules is the order of the day.
We should try, together, to get rid of double-tracking when it comes to dealing with complaints.
That has already been mentioned too.
That is one of the objectives of this House, and especially of its Committee on Petitions.
The Commission still has difficulties with administration that is transparent and people-friendly.
It has happened to every one of us that at some time we have had to defend the relatively small number of officials - some seventeen or eighteen thousand - that the Commission employs, because most of the time they behave towards the public as if they had about a hundred thousand.
I do not need to remind you of the game of hide-and-seek that the Commission is currently playing in connection with the EUROSTAT scandal, where one has the feeling that the Commission has not yet learned that modern administration has something to do with transparency.
We only have to look at last year's report by the Ombudsman, which shows that in the year 2002, Commissioner, 75% of complaints were about your institution.
Of those complaints, there were many that could have been settled relatively easily and at little cost. In fact, 27% of the complaints by EU citizens were concerned with lack of transparency and refusal to provide information.
Once again it boils down to transparency.
Mr Prodi publicly promised something quite different when he took office three years ago.
A further 15% of complaints were concerned with avoidable administrative delays.
The issue of late payments has now become legendary in the Union.
I believe that there is great potential here for improvement at little cost.
We just need goodwill, and I think it would be a good idea if we could agree, Commissioner, that, in relation to the commitments that you have entered into, whereby everything will be dealt with within a year, Parliament could receive regular reports from you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates on cases of breaches of human rights.
The next item is the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0293/2003 by Mr Hartmut Nassauer and Mr Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Indonesia, in particular on Aceh;
B5-0298/2003 by Mr Luigi Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Indonesia, most particularly in Papua and Aceh;
B5-0301/2003 by Mr Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Indonesia, in particular on Aceh;
B5-0302/2003 by Mr Proinsias De Rossa, Mr Martin Schulz, Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath and Mr Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in the Indonesian province of Aceh;
B5-0307/2003 by Mr Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Indonesia, most particularly in Papua and Aceh;
B5-0311/2003 by Mrs Matti Wuori, Mrs Patricia McKenna and Mrs Nelly Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in the provinces of Aceh and Papua, Indonesia.
Mr President, today we are looking at one of the most difficult foci of crisis in Asia, one that threatens to become ever more dangerous, and we cannot grasp this subject if we merely fall back on the usual clichÃ©s.
Indonesia is a world of many peoples, and, in geographical terms alone, it far exceeds any of our European dimensions.
In that part of the world one cannot measure everything by the same yardstick.
We have the problem that Aceh is an ancient historic Sultanate, which has had a significant cultural influence on the region.
Aceh was a great seafaring nation. Aceh has also had a religious influence on the area.
It was from there that Islam spread so extensively throughout Asia, and the island has developed a very strong and healthy sense of identity.
In the colonial period, Aceh, like many other nations in this region, was simply brought into line with all the others and then, after decolonialisation, it became a part of the new artificial State of Indonesia.
Now we certainly do not want to call into question the integrity of this State of Indonesia, which, on economic and strategic grounds alone, is one of our most important and valuable partners.
On the other hand, we have to look at the reality of the situation, and the reality is that in Indonesia they have made the mistake of trying to solve the problem of the over-populated islands of Bali, Java and Sumatra by coming up with what is known as the Transmigration Policy, in other words they have tried to resettle people from these islands on other islands with a different cultural and historical make-up, and to outvote other population groups, which has led to a whole range of ethnic and religious conflicts.
These conflicts are not, as in the Moluccas, simply conflicts between Muslims and Christians, but in Aceh they are also between Muslims and Muslims, or between different ethnic groups.
For that reason we must approach this subject with great caution.
On the one hand we must demand, very clearly, an end to the use of force in Aceh and an end to the terrorist activities taking place in the region. On the other hand, however, we must also demand that the Government of Indonesia, which is our partner, meets its obligations, and that means fully implementing the autonomy arrangements for Aceh and ensuring that democracy and the rule of law prevail there, and that, above all, humanitarian organisations, international observers and the international media have access to the region.
Indonesia should have nothing to hide; it is our partner.
However, the way in which Indonesia deals with the self-aware Aceh province and its freedom is also an important criterion.
Mr President, the borders of the developing world are largely a product of European colonial administration.
People who wanted to stay together were split up because the areas they lived in were divided up between colonial occupiers.
Conversely, people who would have liked to have had an independent state were allotted to large, powerful neighbours who wanted to conquer the areas they lived in.
It is becoming difficult to change the way countries are divided up in a peaceful manner, particularly if oil or metals have been found in the ground in such areas.
Indonesia is a product of more than three centuries of Dutch colonialism.
Five large islands and innumerable small ones were brought together under one administration in order to supply what the nineteenth century author Multatuli called a North Sea robber state with cheap raw materials and commodities.
The two areas in which the Indonesian army is now trying to destroy separatist movements, Aceh on Northern Sumatra and West Papua, were the last to be added to the Dutch colonial empire.
They were occupied by the Dutch colonial army as late as 1900, and this was preceded by a bloody war in Aceh.
The Netherlands had very little interest in the island of New Guinea, which was initially divided between the Netherlands, Germany and Great Britain and which was inhabited by Papuans whose way of life had not changed since ancient times, until Indonesia broke away from the Netherlands in the War of Independence.
This was the last colonial foothold in Asia at the time.
The Netherlands had to cede this territory 40 years ago under pressure from America, which was looking to establish good relations with Indonesia.
The promised referendum for the residents about whether or not to join Indonesia never materialised.
In 1945 the Netherlands once again tried to divide Indonesia into an independent, densely-populated Java and a number of satellite states in the region linked to the Netherlands.
Many Indonesians, and certainly their rulers and their military, still regard the fact that they made this split impossible as a great success.
The powerful role of the Indonesian army, which has been guarding minerals and suppressing ethnic minorities for many years, can be explained by this, as can the long-standing occupation of the former Portuguese Timor and an earlier attempt to annex the former British Malaysia.
Indonesia's current problems were caused by Europe and America.
It is therefore a good thing that the European Parliament is concerning itself with these wrongs.
Unlike in the past, this must not be done through military intervention from outside but through diplomatic, and, if necessary, economic pressure.
In order to enable the Indonesian peoples to achieve democracy and self-determination, we must always take these causes and sensitivities on board.
Mr President, the political fragility of the Indonesian confederation is evident.
The proverbial Emerald Belt is threatening to crumble in its easternmost region, Papua, and in the west in Aceh.
The countermeasures coming from Jakarta, particularly the military ones, are still producing a reverse effect.
They are undermining the central authority's promises of autonomy, both in Papua and in Aceh. This is encouraging dangerous radicalisation.
Any escalation of the long-standing conflict between Jakarta and GAM rebels could create a new hotbed of international Islamic terrorism, particularly in Aceh, which has always been very passionate about its independence, as the Dutch know to their cost.
This terrifying prospect should encourage Jakarta to act tactfully.
The involvement of the outside world, the Commission and Council, is an absolute must.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, peace and the rule of law in Indonesia have taken a major step backwards, with the breakdown of the ceasefire and renewed hostilities in the province of Aceh on the one hand and with the fresh outbreak of tensions in Irian Jaya, also known as West Papua, on the other.
Indonesia is one of the world's largest countries, and has the unique feature of suffering not only from the problems arising from its geography and history and, in particular, from the process of decolonisation - to which Mr Meijer referred, and in which lies the root of the problems of the former sultanate of Aceh - but also from the problems posed by Indonesia's brutal repression and dictatorship and by its expansionist approach, which led to the annexation of Irian Jaya and the military takeover of East Timor.
These two latter facts help us to understand the gravity and complexity of the situation facing that country today.
The decolonisation of East Timor, which followed the fall of the Suharto dictatorship, represented an historic step in reversing both this internal expansionist intent, which was typical of Indonesia, and the attitude of the western world which had, by commission and by omission, supported the takeover of this small South-East Asian nation, which had only recently come into being.
As we know, this was not a peaceful action and could only succeed because external military force was used, after the United Nations proved unable to deal with Indonesia's armed response on its own.
Having said this, and whilst acknowledging that we should not always declare ourselves against any armed action, all the evidence suggests, as indicated in our joint resolution, that we must do everything possible to bring this armed conflict to an end and to ensure that dialogue reopens between the Indonesian Government and the separatist movements in Aceh, as well as the representatives of Irian Jaya.
Over and above accepting responsibility for all measures necessary to re-establishing the ceasefire in Aceh and dialogue in Irian Jaya, we must also establish an external policy for Indonesia, based on respect for human rights, for minorities and for inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue.
These principles must furthermore take precedence over geopolitical or economic considerations, which are always poor counsellors in these situations and which have provided such poor results in the past.
These principles must also take precedence over determinist considerations such as territorial integrity or the right to self-determination, which are sometimes difficult to define at the outset.
Aceh never wanted to belong.
That was the case under Dutch colonial rule, and that has actually never changed.
For geographic, ethnic, religious and in particular economic reasons.
Revenues from natural gas are an ongoing source of tension.
Should this go to the Indonesian Government or to the military, the rebels or the inhabitants themselves?
The population has been terrorised, both by the Indonesian military and by the GAM rebels, since 1976.
From my own experience I know how dangerous it is just to travel from one place to another in this territory.
Over the years, negotiations between the GAM and the Indonesian military have never delivered anything significant.
The actual reason for this could well be that both parties have an interest in allowing this anarchistic situation to continue because they both earn well from it.
After the last negotiations failed, the Indonesian Government proceeded to launch a large-scale military offensive which could easily degenerate into terrible excesses on both sides.
The Jakarta Government has sworn that it would respect human rights, but who is able to observe that in this mountainous jungle terrain?
It is therefore of the utmost importance that international observers go to the area that is adequately protected by the military.
The European Union must exert all possible pressure on both the Indonesian Government and on the GAM and urge them to arrive at a peaceful settlement with fair arrangements concerning the distribution of minerals.
Military solutions have never lasted in Aceh.
It is particularly regrettable that Papua's Special Autonomy Act has been withdrawn and has been replaced by a new law that divides the territory into three provinces.
It finally seemed as if a solution had been reached which would make everybody happy and would guarantee stability.
But Mrs Megawati has paid too much attention to the military and does not have the political courage to implement her own will.
The Papuans no longer want to belong either as a result of this policy, and that cannot have been the intention.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the historic circumstances show that we as the European Community cannot remain disinterested with regard to what is happening in Indonesia, Aceh and Papua New Guinea.
The war which is still continuing and which has been going on for the past 27 years in Aceh shows that the consequences of the colonial era are still having an impact today.
We must convince the Indonesians that political solutions are the only way to settle these political conflicts.
A concrete and clear weapons embargo on the Indonesian Government would be an initial step, but we must also be able to convince the Indonesian Government that a country with 150 million inhabitants and so many thousands of islands should not be governed as a unitary entity.
If there is a will for self-determination and autonomy, both in Aceh and amongst the Papuans, this must be taken into consideration.
12 000 victims in Aceh, cruelty on a daily basis, infringements of citizens' rights, rapes, attacks on villages; this must be stopped and a political solution must be found.
In Papua too, they must return to the solution that offers the prospect of autonomy.
We are not in favour of separate states coming into being everywhere, but we cannot allow a disastrous centralism imposed against the will of the people and by military means to be the ultimate solution.
This political issue must be resolved in a fair way, so that peace can prevail and so that the natural wealth that is present in such massive quantities can be extracted for the benefit of the entire population and with the participation of those who have been living there for centuries.
The West must not make itself an accessory to Indonesia's military solutions, but must continue to press consistently for a political solution that offers the prospect of autonomy, even if it is within the framework of an Indonesian state.
Mr President, Indonesia is currently engaging in its largest military operation since the invasion of East Timor in 1975, against the GAM rebels in Aceh following the breakdown of a five-month-old cease-fire, and already there are reports of widespread suffering and human rights abuses.
The conflict has its origin in the fact that although the Sultanate of Aceh was never technically incorporated into the Dutch East Indies it was one of the territories handed over by Holland to Indonesia in 1949, following the UN-sponsored talks between Indonesia and the former colonial power.
The Acehnese, although fellow Muslims, almost immediately began fighting for independence, and the province was given special status.
The unrest is exacerbated by the Indonesian Government's exploitation of the province's gas and petroleum resources as well as the policy of transmigration which has seen many Javanese come to live and work in the province's coastal and industrial belts.
The earlier cease-fire, which was aimed in part, from the EU's point of view, at ensuring Indonesian support for the worldwide fight against terrorism, whilst protecting the human rights of the Acehnese, is clearly now defunct.
President Megawati understandably wishes to prevent Indonesia falling apart.
The army appears to have persuaded her, unwisely, that a military solution is possible.
It is highly unlikely that the military option is the only one that will work in the long term.
A political solution now needs to be found quickly.
Mr President, the Indonesian Government must formally put on record its opposition to human rights violations such as unlawful killings, including extra-judicial executions, disappearances and torture.
It must make clear to the security forces that any violations will not be tolerated and that perpetrators will be brought to justice.
Both sides have to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian law - and be seen to adhere to them.
There must also be a proper chain of command for security personnel.
They must be made aware that they will be held criminally accountable for carrying out atrocities - not only the people who carry them out, but also those who give the orders.
Crimes against women and children should not be tolerated under any circumstances.
Unfortunately these continue at present.
The Indonesian Government must take measures to protect the human rights defenders and members of the press who speak out about these atrocities.
Mr President, I would like to divide my speech into two sections: I will first of all discuss Aceh and then I will go on to look at Papua.
As far as Aceh is concerned, the Commission, together with the presidency, is one of the four co-Chairs of the Tokyo Conference (Japan, United States, European Union, World Bank).
This Conference encouraged the signature of a cease-fire between the Indonesian Government and the Aceh rebels based - and I must stress this - on the territorial integrity of Indonesia.
The Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is the most comprehensive endeavour undertaken to resolve a conflict that has been going on for 26 years in which 12 000 have lost their lives, the majority of them innocent civilians.
The Commission, by way of its Rapid Reaction Mechanism, contributed EUR 2.3 million to the deployment of 50 international observers in the province of Aceh.
Unfortunately, the situation on the ground has meanwhile changed dramatically.
On 17 and 18 May in Tokyo, the Commission, with the other co-Chairs, participated in extensive talks lasting 11 hours between the Indonesian Government and the GAM (Free Aceh Movement) in order to save the cease-fire, which was in a precarious situation.
Unfortunately, the talks failed, which resulted in the Indonesian president imposing martial law and launching a widespread military operation.
Since then, the Commission must confirm what the Members have said.
The situation is very grave, the information we are receiving is more and more worrying and the human rights violations are extremely serious.
We are also very concerned about the request to international and non-governmental aid organisations to leave the province and about the military censorship imposed on the press bodies covering the situation on the ground or reporting the events taking place in the province.
As far as the Commission is concerned, a military operation will not produce sustainable peace in Aceh, even if supposedly implemented with the best of intentions.
We are therefore firmly convinced that the key to peace resides in good governance, justice, respect for human rights, the democratic process and development.
We take note of the statement by the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, Mr Yudhoyono, according to which his government will respect the Geneva Convention and humanitarian law in the province of Aceh.
The international community will, however, have to call on the Indonesian Government to guarantee access to the province for NGOs and international humanitarian bodies and to guarantee their safety, as this is a vital precondition for the rapid and transparent provision of assistance, needed desperately by the citizens and the populations most affected.
We are convinced that the only possible option is to renew dialogue around a negotiating table.
The statement by the Indonesian Government, in which it stresses that it is still open to talks, confirms our opinion.
We therefore encourage the government and the GAM to propose as soon as possible a framework allowing for the resumption of these negotiations.
Like the other advocates of this initiative, the Commission will always be available to facilitate this process by any means possible.
I am now coming to the second aspect of the parliamentary questions, namely the situation in Papua.
You are no doubt aware that the Papuan Special Autonomy Law was passed by the Indonesian Parliament in 2001.
In 2002, following the conclusions of a study carried out jointly by Indonesian and European experts, the Commission mobilised funds from its Rapid Reaction Mechanism to support the implementation of this law by the Indonesian authorities, making available to them an expert on decentralisation issues and Indonesia.
I strongly support the fact that this initiative was based on the European Union's strict respect for the territorial integrity of Indonesia and that it had received the full support and collaboration of the Indonesian authorities.
Halfway through 2003, the Commission proposed technical assistance for the Provincial Government of Papua and the implementation of the Special Autonomy Law.
The launch of this programme has not yet been approved by the Indonesian Government.
The Commission hopes that this delay is due solely to technical reasons.
The Commission is aware of the Presidential Decree of 27 January 2003 creating three new provinces in Papua and the fact that the Indonesian Parliament, which must confirm the creation of these provinces, has not yet had its say on the matter.
We are no less concerned about the consequences application of this decree could have on the implementation of the Special Autonomy Law for Papua.
We are convinced that the path opened by the Special Law should be taken by the Indonesian authorities.
The Commission calls on the Indonesian Government to implement the Special Law and maintains its offer of assistance in this framework.
Similarly, the Commission reiterates its support for the territorial integrity of Indonesia and is mindful of respect for human rights in this province, as in all the other provinces of Indonesia.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0297/2003 by Mrs Marianne Eriksson, Mr Fausto Bertinotti, Mrs Yasmine Boudjenah and Mrs Luisa Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma;
B5-0303/2003 by Mr Walter Veltroni, Mrs Glenys Kinnock, Mr Margrietus J. van den Berg and Mr Martin Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi (Burma);
B5-0305/2003 by Mr Geoffrey Van Orden, Mr Nirj Deva, Mr Thomas Mann, Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen and Mr Lennart SacrÃ©deus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Burma;
B5-0306/2003 by Mr Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Burma;
B5-0310/2003 by Mrs Patricia McKenna and Mrs Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Burma.
Mr President, a never-ending drama seems to be unfolding in Burma.
For years, a brutal junta has been terrorising the people of Burma, who live in extreme poverty.
The regime bullies thousands of forced labourers, thousands of political detainees languish in the country's prisons, and the President, once democratically elected with an overwhelming majority, the holder of the Nobel Prize - and also the holder of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize - was imprisoned for years and then, after a short period in which the hope of a thin silver lining of democracy could be seen on the horizon, was arrested again on 31 May this year together with nine other members of the country's parliament.
As you have no doubt learned from the media, it is not clear how many human lives the enforced military takeover has actually cost, or what fate the Deputy Chairman of the persecuted party, the National League for Democracy, has suffered.
It is possible that the President herself was injured in this latest attack.
This is a really serious reversal, given that exactly a year ago the release of Aung San Suu Kyi raised hopes that the regime was ready to carry out reforms.
In this spirit of hope, a political dialogue was begun, under the supervision of the UN Special Envoy Razali Ismail, but it is to be feared that on his visit, planned for tomorrow, he will be prevented from meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, and that this will result in a further hardening of attitudes.
Military might, political persecution and taking away the freedom of people who, in defiance of all repressive measures, continue to fight for democracy - all these must not be tolerated.
The Council has therefore been invited to reintroduce, with immediate effect, the sanctions against the regime which had been temporarily suspended.
However, it must also be clear that the Council, the Commission and in particular Parliament, in the interests of the people of Burma, do not want to close all doors in Burma.
In other words, we are still ready to help to encourage a process of national reconciliation, but there must also be signs that such a reconciliation process is desired and pursued by all sides.
As long as terror and military might prevail, however, no one can hope for tolerance from the European Parliament and from the other European institutions.
Mr President, the arrest at the weekend of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burmese National League for Democracy, is deplorable and shows that the military regime in Burma has no intention of democratic reform.
Reports of personal injuries are all the more alarming.
This turn of events also calls into question the effectiveness of EU action against the military dictatorship.
We demand the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as the release of all political prisoners and the lifting of restrictions against the NLD, universities and other institutions.
The very worrying deterioration in the political situation in the last few days is just the latest twist in a story of consistent human rights abuses.
Anyone who expresses opposition to the regime is subject to harassment and arrest and goes in fear of their life.
Ethnic minorities such as the Karin and the Shan continue to suffer violent oppression, and there are over 130 000 refugees in camps on the Thai-Burma border.
Regrettably we witness yet another example where the efforts of the European Union and the wider international community to encourage change have brought few tangible results.
Clearly we have not yet hit the regime where it hurts.
The EU's extension of its travel ban against the regime, and assets freeze, were agreed in April but suspended until October in the hope of some improvement in the situation.
The situation has clearly deteriorated, and the Council should take action immediately to implement the measures that it agreed in its common position.
This situation could best be resolved if the Burmese regime were to respect the results of the 1990 elections, as the international community has consistently demanded.
The Burmese generals are really doing everything they can to remain in power.
Opponents are being silenced.
The opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has spent half of the past 14 years under house arrest.
She has now been arrested again, allegedly for her own safety.
The junta is completely paranoid and controls the administration, justice, the economy and the private lives of the Burmese people.
There is absolutely no democracy whatsoever, and the people are being kept ignorant.
Anyone who has had an education is distrusted.
Every time there is a student demonstration the government closes the university.
The country has been in crisis for the past 14 years, and there is a shortage of everything except corruption, which is flourishing.
The regime practices systematic discrimination against the Rohingya people.
There is absolutely no sign of any rapprochement between the government and the opposition.
In order to pull the wool over the eyes of the West, cosmetic steps are taken every now and again, such as the visit of the UN envoy Razali.
Burma has one of the most corrupt regimes in the world.
The international community has tolerated this for much too long.
The more than 1 000 political prisoners must be released immediately, and all repressive measures must be rescinded.
The European Union must make Burma an important point on the agenda of the ASEAN conference in Bali.
As long as pressure from neighbouring countries remains minimal, the generals will be in no hurry to pack their bags.
The European Union must also further intensify its sanctions policy.
We must put a complete stop to business contact, which also means no investment.
There is a risk that the resoluteness of the generals will result in a feeling that there is actually nothing we can do, but we owe it to the patient and extremely tenacious Aung San Suu Kyi and the poor population of Burma to do everything we can to drive the generals from power.
Mr President, I agree with and support most of what has been said, but I wish to raise two points.
The first concerns the whereabouts of Aung San Suu Kyi.
She has not been seen for many days, in fact since the end of May, when it was reported that up to 70 people were killed by the junta army and that she suffered a head injury.
The fact that she has not been seen and that her whereabouts is unknown raises serious concerns about whether she is alive and what kind of condition she is in.
This Parliament and the institutions have to send a very strong message to the Burmese authorities that international bodies must immediately have access to her.
It is of crucial importance.
We need to know immediately what kind of situation she is in.
My second point concerns the resolution itself, which contained a call for new elections.
I understand now that all the political groups have agreed to this being removed.
I am glad, because it would send a very dangerous signal at this time.
In other words, it would mean giving in to the logic of the generals, not accepting the decision of the people and basically undermining the National League for Democracy.
I am glad that the parties who wanted this in have agreed to take it out, because it would be a really dangerous and very bad signal to send at this time to the military regime in Burma.
Mr President, Commissioner, in Burma twenty leading opposition members have been arrested, including Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the holder of Parliament's Sakharov Prize, and the President of the League for Democracy.
Over one hundred offices of the League have been closed down, its supporters have been persecuted and arrested, and according to our information just recently seventy sympathisers were killed in the North of the country by armed troops of the military junta.
In the past few years, after the European Union had quite rightly suspended trade-facilitation measures and blocked foreign capital, the first positive effects were felt.
In 2002 Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest, and there were justified hopes of reform, and so the EU decided to withdraw certain sanctions until the end of the year.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is asking that the Government of Burma should now release from arrest the Nobel Prize winner, her fellow-campaigners and the political prisoners.
Persecution and murders must be brought to an immediate end.
Universities, schools and the offices of the League for Democracy must finally be reopened.
We are also asking for free elections under independent international observation.
If the military junta continues to refuse to introduce a course of reforms which is so badly needed, then the visa ban must be extended and capital must remain frozen, without any possibility of licences being granted.
The ASEAN States, the United Nations and the international community must be made to discharge their obligations, so that pressure from Europe receives wide support.
Mr President, allow me to begin by saying that I fully support the calls made in the motion for a resolution.
It must be beyond doubt that there is a need to tighten up the EU's sanctions against Burma.
With the arrest of Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and 19 other members of her party, the military junta has of course again shown that it does not wish to improve conditions of democracy in the country.
The junta's statement that Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested for the sake of her own safety is an insult to the intelligence of any thinking person, and I entirely agree with Mrs McKenna that we must immediately demand to know where she is, and obtain access to her.
It can therefore only be hoped that more stringent international sanctions will cause the military junta to mend its ideas.
I think it important that the Council should intensify its demands in terms of human rights and continue to support the UN's special envoy.
It should demand that all prisoners be released unconditionally and that a genuine dialogue with the opposition be resumed, for it is of course only through dialogue involving all the relevant political actors that a solid and legitimate democracy might be re-established.
Mr President, the Commission agrees totally with what has been said here in Parliament. We are very concerned about the recent events, the harassment and the political violence experienced by Aung San Suu Kyi and the supporters of the National League for Democracy during their movements in northern Burma.
The confirmation by the Burmese authorities that Aung San Suu Kyi and leading members of her party would be detained for their own protection is of great concern and the Commission fully supports all of the calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her party leaders.
The decisions by the Burmese Government to detain Aung San Suu Kyi and her collaborators, to close the offices of the National League for Democracy and to close the universities are significant steps backwards for the international reconciliation process and they must be suspended as soon as possible.
It is now high time for the Burmese Government to show that it is committed to the national reconciliation process by working with Aung San Suu Kyi, the NLD and the other democratic forces in the country to restore democracy and to ensure respect for human rights and the rule of law.
In this respect, and in light of the imminent visit to Burma of the Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Razali Ismail, on 6 June, the Commission calls on the Burmese authorities to cooperate fully and constructively with Mr Razali and to allow him to meet freely with Aung San Suu Kyi and the other democratic leaders.
As regards the application of the sanctions mentioned in the Union's common position on Burma of 28 April 2003, I can assure the Members of Parliament that the Commission is monitoring the situation very closely and is ready to support the implementation of these sanctions as soon as possible if the situation does not improve.
Allow me to say, from a personal point of view, how much I respect and admire this great politician, Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of our Parliament's Sakharov prize, the Nobel Prize for Peace, and a torch of democracy and freedom.
I truly hope that she is well and that with the help of all of the democratic forces she will be able to come through this for her own sake and that of her people.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon following the debates.
The next item is the joint debate on six motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe:
B5-0287/2003 by Mr Geoffrey Van Orden, Mr John Alexander Corrie, Mr Nirj Deva, Mrs Jacqueline Foster, Mr Neil Parish, Mr Charles Tannock, Mrs Mary Elizabeth Banotti, Mr Michael Gahler, Mrs Eija-Riitta Anneli Korhola, Mr Klaus-Heiner Lehne, Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen and Mr Lennart SacrÃ©deus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Zimbabwe;
B5-0299/2003 by Mr Luigi Vinci, Mr Joaquim Miranda and Mrs Luisa Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Zimbabwe;
B5-0300/2003 by Mr Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
B5-0304/2003 by Mrs Glenys Kinnock and Mr Martin Schulz, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
B5-0308/2003 by Mr Bob van den Bos and Mr Jan Mulder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
B5-0309/2003 by Mrs Nelly Maes, Mr Didier Rod, Mr Paul A.A.J.G. Lannoye, Mrs Inger SchÃ¶rling and Mrs Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Zimbabwe.
Mr President, on numerous occasions the European Parliament has called for a widening of sanctions against the Mugabe regime and their rigorous enforcement.
Yet there has been effectively no response from the Council.
At the moment when the whole question of democratic accountability in the EU is under discussion, it is time the Council took more notice of European Parliament resolutions.
The Council did renew, but in a weakened form, the sanctions against the regime.
The travel ban against Mugabe and senior members of his regime has not been effectively enforced.
Indeed, only last month the Trade and Industry Minister attended an EU meeting in the EU capital, Brussels, organised by the ACP, an institution created by the EU.
We cannot even manage to enforce a travel ban in respect of our own institutions.
In November last year it was left to the European Parliament to enforce the sanctions by denying the Zimbabwean representatives access to the European Parliament.
That, of course, led to the postponement of that meeting, but we have to face this down.
If African countries are willing to wreck the ACP for the sake of defending Mugabe, let them do it, but let us stop making exceptions all the time with respect to this travel ban.
The situation is very much more serious at the moment.
There are daily troubles in Zimbabwe, food and fuel are increasingly in short supply, inflation is running at 50% a month, and consumer prices will rise by 300% at least in the next few months.
Zimbabweans are starving, 12.6 million are in need of food aid, and the strikes and demonstrations which have been taking place are evidence of the failure of the international community to act effectively against Mugabe.
This resolution calls for us to renew our efforts.
Mr President, intimidation, rape, land theft, murder, fraud, electoral fraud, deprivation of liberty, starvation: these are the instruments that Mugabe's reign of terror uses to throw the once prosperous Zimbabwe ever deeper into ruin in a staggering spiral of violence.
Cries of distress from individual victims are still reaching us today from this humanitarian disaster.
What are we to think, for example, of a secretary of the MDC, the opposition party, who was attacked in her house one night by one of Mugabe's teams of gangsters?
The accusation: being a prostitute of the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.
The punishment: having the barrel of a gun inserted into her vagina, with death threats and other demands I do not wish to mention here.
It is in this horrifying context that Tsvangirai called on the stricken population to stage a week of peaceful protest.
The dictator, who will stop at nothing, attempted to suppress this cry for help with the now routine arrest of the opposition leader.
Like the present resolution, I also find it incomprehensible and extremely unbelievable that the Council, circumventing the prohibition on travel which it imposed itself, is in consultation with this criminal regime in Brussels.
This is an affront to the Zimbabwean people in need, as is the willingness of other African regimes to maintain contact with the regime.
With the greatest possible emphasis I call on the Commission and the Council to reject this regime without compromise.
In accordance with paragraph 5, I would also ask the Council to set an example to the international community and actually follow a general strategy of restoring democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in Zimbabwe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Zimbabwe too the situation seems to be developing into a never-ending story.
I myself was able to experience the escalation in violence when I visited the country on the occasion of the parliamentary elections as an election observer, albeit under the wrong label, because I was not recognised as representing the European Union.
Over thirty opposition politicians lost their lives in these disputes, and we are now seeing a renewed escalation in violence.
We must now face the fact that not only is Mr Mugabe using live weapons against peaceful demonstrators, but he is also using hunger as a weapon against his people.
It has already been mentioned here today that over half of the population is dependent on food aid.
We too, therefore, find ourselves in a quandary: if we do not want to let the people starve, we have to help them, but in so doing we are also unintentionally helping to keep Mugabe in power.
Prices for essential goods are soaring in Zimbabwe. The rate of inflation is exploding, and is currently the highest in the world.
The economy is in ruins; exports and tourism, once flourishing sources of income, have collapsed.
The rule of law, once so dependable, has been set aside, and the most recent outrages have shown that the Council was right to agree to the sanctions against the Mugabe regime.
However, those sanctions are not being consistently applied.
This must be demanded as a matter of urgency!
If we expect these measures to make any impression on the regime, then they must also be consistently applied.
We had this problem with an ACP meeting, which broke up as a result.
We shall continue to come up against this problem, and if the Commission grants a travel permit for ACP talks or other meetings, then the regime will be strengthened still further, and our position, namely that we are in favour of the restoration of the rule of law and democracy and in favour of the protection of human rights, will be weakened.
This in turn weakens our position within the ACP meetings too, where we are, after all, trying to get our African partner countries on our side, and that is certainly no easy task.
We have experienced many disappointments.
We have even experienced the situation in which we have not received support for our position in favour of the rule of law, for the protection of human rights and finally for a life fit for human beings in that country, complete with full democratic rights.
I would like to emphasise, however, that, in a secret ballot, a good quarter of those present at the ACP meeting agreed with us, and some delegates even dared to say so openly, and to condemn, very forcefully, what is happening in Zimbabwe.
However, we must remind all those who sit around the table with Mugabe in Africa that to support such a regime cannot be to follow the path of legality.
We need to make our position absolutely clear here, and so, too, must the Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy with the tone set by Mrs Junker, and I would like to ask the British Conservatives to show a little more subtlety each time they put Zimbabwe on the agenda.
We have done this often here, with precious little result.
There has been no other country about which we have accepted so many resolutions with so little effect.
Let us keep things in perspective.
Zimbabwe is not the country with the largest number of victims of war or violence in Africa, but that does not detract from the fact that the situation is deteriorating dramatically.
The economic situation in the country has never been so bad and is worsening every day.
7.2 million of the 12.4 million people are starving, there are violations of human rights, and so on. Torture is the order of the day, and the arrest of journalists is making a mockery of freedom of the press.
The people of Zimbabwe, however, have the will to bring about a peaceful transition.
The MDC is exerting pressure through strikes and political actions, and we must support this pressure.
We must support Mr Tsvangirai, who was the moral victor in the elections.
If the elections had not been falsified, he would now most likely be the head of state.
The opposition is exerting this pressure, but - and we noticed this during the ACP conferences - more and more African countries are willing to exert pressure.
This has not always produced results, but it was important that Mr Mbeki of South Africa and the president of Nigeria both exerted pressure on 5 May, even if this does not seem to be producing immediate results.
But who are we to think that everything can change in an instant.
How does Europe handle this pressure?
Parliament is continually asking for all dialogue to be brought to an end.
Is that the right method?
The Council is obviously pursuing a different method and wants to impose sanctions as long as these do not stand in the way of normal dialogue within the international organisations.
We must know what we want once and for all.
I call on Parliament to exercise pressure and to continue to do so and not to continually remain divided as to the way in which we do this.
I support any healthy measure that will place the Mugabe government against the wall, but I also understand that the people of Zimbabwe, who have already suffered so much for the sake of democracy, also want to avoid a bloody war.
We must know what we want, the Council must know what it wants and must not add a sentence about Zimbabwe in some back room somewhere, like in the G8.
This will not help us at all.
We share the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe, but we are also dreaming that democracy will ultimately prevail.
Mr President, I wish to address the person who ought to have been in the public gallery today, namely Mr Mugabe. Your task, Mr Mugabe, was to give the people of Zimbabwe freedom, democracy and the rule of law.
Instead, you have given the people of Zimbabwe oppression, terror, ill-treatment, torture and killing.
Your task, Mr Mugabe, was to give the people of Zimbabwe a new future and a new equality, including equality of rights.
It was emphatically not to create an inverted racism or to degrade and oppress people because of the colour of their skin, their political views or their party allegiances.
Your task, Mr Mugabe, was to give the people of Zimbabwe food and a future.
It was not to give them hunger, famine, despair and death.
Your task was, moreover, to become a part of Zimbabwe's history, of its bright and positive history.
It was not to enter the history books as a notorious, cruel, narrow-minded and malicious dictator.
Mr Mugabe, I have had the privilege of meeting many worthy campaigners for human rights and democracy in your splendid country, Zimbabwe.
The violence committed against them by your troops and soldiers will not prevail.
In a year's time, you will no longer be the leader of Zimbabwe.
Mr President, I wonder how often we want to continue going through the Zimbabwe ritual here in the topical and urgent debate process.
We have passed so many resolutions that we refer to them only en bloc, and hardly even bother to count them anymore.
I could really just play back a recording of my last speech, because fundamentally nothing has changed there, unfortunately.
If anything things have just become worse for the people in Zimbabwe.
Even those who have written for our esteemed Commissioner the words that she is just about to say to us could probably, in the main, have substituted what they wrote last time, because the situation has not changed.
The real political problem facing the EU is not so much what it does as what it does not do.
I would like to say to the Council, which as usual is not present, that one can do wrong even by doing nothing.
Must it come to a situation like the one in the Congo?
What Mrs Maes said was right: there are worse situations in Africa than the one in Zimbabwe.
Do conditions have to become like those in the Congo?
How many deaths will it take before the Council at least stops making the Zimbabwe Minister for Industry and Trade welcome in the EU, or even takes effective action against Mugabe?
We are sending an intervention force to the Congo.
Obviously the requisite number of people must have been killed there.
In the case of Zimbabwe, however, we did not even refuse entry to a minister.
I am very much in favour of our attempting, jointly, under French leadership, to restore peace in the Congo, but I would also like to say clearly that we cannot accept it when France, on the subject of Zimbabwe, has for years prevented or delayed effective measures or has actively blocked them.
The Council must obviously face up to its responsibilities here and, if necessary, we must invite the relevant individual governments to come and explain themselves to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Mr President, I imagine that the Council representatives have taken note of the comments made by the Members.
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is aware of the fact that conditions in Zimbabwe are very unstable, to use diplomatic language.
We are monitoring this week's events very closely.
We know that the climate is deteriorating, that political violence is on the increase, that there are more and more human rights violations and breaches of the rule of law, and that the human suffering is getting worse.
We strongly condemn the repressive measures taken recently with regard to the opposition, in particular the arrest on Monday of the leader of the opposition, Morgan Tsvangirai, and other members of the MDC, the Movement for Democratic Change.
These measures are part of the government's efforts to crack down on the strikes the MDC has called for this week.
Given the gravity of the situation, the Commission fully supported the publication on 3 June by the Council presidency of a declaration by the Union on Zimbabwe.
We are equally concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and are therefore playing an active role in the measures to respond to the most urgent cases.
Over the past year, we have contributed almost EUR 93 million in the form of emergency food and humanitarian aid in order to relieve the suffering of the Zimbabwean people and to ensure that they were not penalised.
We are going to continue with these projects to provide direct assistance to the country, particularly in the social sector and as regards respect for human rights and the rule of law.
As it normally does, the Commission is continuing to explore all avenues of dialogue in the hope of improving the situation.
We support all of the pressure from the international community, the African heads of state and the SADC that may be exerted on the Zimbabwean Government to encourage it to respect human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles.
We must once again, and relentlessly, emphasise that these concepts are essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement that links the European Union and Zimbabwe.
In this context, the Commission welcomed the recent initiative by three African presidents to encourage the resumption of dialogue between the parties.
It fully shares the concern expressed at the Evian G8 meeting regarding the terrible situation in this country.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Motions for resolutions on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law:
Joint motion, tabled on behalf of the PPE-DE, PSE, ELDR, Verts/ALE, GUE/NGL and EDD Groups, on the situation in Indonesia, in particular in the provinces of Aceh and Papua (B5-0293/2003, B5-0298/2003, B5-0301/2003, B5-0302/2003, B5-0307/2003, B5-0311/2003)
(Before the vote)
Mr President, could you accept, by way of a verbal amendment, that I am left with only the most famous names among human rights activists.
There are untold numbers of them, but the first two, Nazar and Kautsar, must stay.
The others must go, because we do not want to name any more names.
The human rights organisation we want to mention here is Amnesty International.
We urge immediate acquittal instead of release.
Is anyone opposed to Mrs Lambert tabling this oral amendment?
Mr van den Bos has the floor.
Mr President, it does not seem to me to be a good idea to stop elections from being held.
That would naturally make a very odd impression.
I understand the Greens' argument, though.
The opposition parties are of course currently not yet ready for the elections and could be manipulated.
My group would only be in favour of them if the words 'without delay' could be scrapped.
We would then vote in favour of them.
If matters proceed as formulated by the spokesman, we will vote against them.
Mrs Lambert, are you in agreement with the arguments put forward by Mr van den Bos?
Mr President, the substance of our oral amendment would mean that what we were asking for effectively is that the results of the earlier elections stand and be implemented.
'Without delay' changes the meaning of what we are attempting.
We could not accept that, so I presume we will just have to vote.
Mr President, I should like to ask that in future the votes should be held at the time indicated in the order of business, because then it would be possible for Members to be here.
Mr RÃŒbig, it was anticipated that we would proceed to the vote following the debates and that is what we have done.
I should like to thank my colleagues, particularly Mrs Fourtou, Mr Oreja, Mr Manders and Mrs Echerer, for supporting this initiative for a written declaration.
I want to thank all Members who signed it, even if at times they felt overwhelmed by our enthusiasm and over-zealous attempts at persuasion.
It is clear that piracy has now reached epidemic proportions in Europe and poses severe risks to consumer health and safety, with fake toys, medicines and spare parts coming into the EU.
In 2002 alone seizure of such goods doubled in the European Union.
I believe that this declaration sends a strong signal from this House to Member States and to accession countries to act to crack down on piracy.
Parliament has now called for action, with this majority support.
The Italian presidency should now take up this issue and put it to the top of their agenda.
We hope that Member States will not ignore or dismiss this House's wish for action.
That was the last item on the agenda.
The Minutes of this session will be submitted to Parliament for its approval at the beginning of the next part-session.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m.)
Mr President, this debate on Strasbourg is not scheduled.
Can we move on to the explanation of votes please?
The deep grievances of Portuguese farmers against this profoundly unfair common agricultural policy are longstanding.
It is always being said that Portugal and its agriculture benefit less than any other European Union Member State from the CAP.
I voted for the amendments advocating the complete rejection of the European Commission's proposals because I wanted to register politically the fact that the Portuguese people were unhappy and disappointed with the Commission's original proposals. These did not even begin to constitute a satisfactory response to our legitimate expectations.
Nevertheless, I do acknowledge the excellent work carried out by Mr Cunha, as well as the need for CAP reform. The latter is indispensable both for financial reasons - that is to say, reasons linked to negotiations with the World Trade Organisation - and because of consumers' demands and the need to respond to a new type of demand, oriented less towards production and more towards the rural world.
I believe that the European Parliament's position has the merit of directing the reform towards more reasonable, balanced and fair positions, principally because of the gradualism and prudence it introduces.
I would still like to give Commissioner Fischler the benefit of the doubt, as he guaranteed at the end of the debate that the Commission would now support Mediterranean produce as strongly as it has supported other production.
For these reasons, I supported most of Parliament's proposals but abstained from the final vote.
This resolution is a shameless confession of what the ?U means by 'cooperation' with the Balkan countries.
At the same time, it reveals to the most disbelieving why Yugoslavia was bombed and what the purpose of breaking it up was.
Within the framework of a clearly neo-colonialist policy, the European Parliament is calling on the Balkan countries to come into line with euro-unification and euro-Atlantic standards, to set integration into the EU as their sole prospect, to change their political structure and their internal legislation and to condemn their past.
It is also calling on them to ensure they create a reliable system of prosecution, personal records and information, train their police in accordance with Europol standards, cooperate fully with the 'court' on Yugoslavia and reform their education systems in line with EU standards.
These are the foundations on which the Greek Government and the ?U are building their policy in the Balkans: subjugation, abolition of any concept of national independence, in order to facilitate the penetration of the monopolies and the plundering of peoples and countries.
In voting against this disgraceful text, we the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are emphasising that there is an increasingly urgent need to step up the peoples' fight against the imperialist expansionism of the ?U, against monopoly interests.
A democratic Turkey is welcome in the EU - provided that conflicts with neighbours and minorities are solved.
Turkey constitutes a test of principle for the EU.
Is the EU to remain a closed-off Judaeo-Christian fortress with its claws out or to become a broad organisation of cooperation between all European peoples, nations, regions and linguistic and cultural groups?
For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the answer is clear: we hope that Turkey will continue on the path of reform so that formal negotiations concerning EU membership can be begun next year.
I am in favour of Turkish membership provided that the country, for example, reduces the role of the army in political life and, if need be, completely abolishes the National Assembly; that the country's minorities - the Kurds, Armenians and Syrians - are given the same rights as other citizens; and that freedom of expression is guaranteed.
The report also repeats an old desire from previous EP resolutions in 1987 and 2002 to the effect that Turkey must acknowledge the genocide that took place in Armenia in 1915.
A reconciliation between Turks and Armenians must not fall through because of an historic argument of interpretation, but it is rather odd that contemporary Turkish politicians have such difficulty in acknowledging an historical fact without reservation - that, in desperation, the Fascist Young Turkish regime ordered the mass murder of Armenians, something for which the Young Turkish leaders were punished by Turkish courts after the war.
In paragraph 4, the report calls upon the Convention 'to provide a legal basis for sport in the future Treaty of the Union, recognising its cultural, educational and social functions and including a reference to equal access for women and men to participation in sports and related responsibilities'.
I am able to concur with everything that is being said in this House about sport - but not that the EU should be given the right to legislate in respect of this area too.
That is why I have voted against the report.
A Swedish proverb says that 'if you are too greedy, you easily lose the lot'.
The EU neither can nor should take upon itself the right to legislate in respect of sport.
That would be extending the EU's jurisdiction too far, and without the EU having the ability to comply with this responsibility.
The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are unambiguous in indicating that centralised legislation at European level far away from the sports associations, clubs and practitioners would not add any value to sport but, on the contrary, afford it significant disadvantages.
.
In the year 2000 around 216 000 women in the European Union fell victim to breast cancer and of these, 79 000 died.
Breast cancer is the most common cause of death among women aged between 35 and 55.
We must reduce the breast cancer mortality rate in the European Union.
Only eight out of fifteen Member States in the E.U. have nation-wide breast cancer screening programmes.
Each E.U. Member State must guarantee that women aged between 50 and 70 receive a mammography every two years based on European guidelines.
These programmes should be required to meet certain quality standards.
Each mammograph must be read independently by two radiologists.
The image quality and radiation doses of the equipment must be monitored regularly.
I welcome the allocation of EUR 400 million for cancer research under the Sixth E.U. Framework Research Programme.
Further research must take place into the relationship between breast cancer and potential risk factors such as tobacco use.
I would urge the European Commission to bring forward a proposal for a recommendation on mammography and to do so at the earliest opportunity.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 5 June 2003.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would point out that, yesterday, 17 June, was the twentieth anniversary of the arrest of Enzo Tortora.
I expect that this name will not mean much to many of the Members, but it will certainly have great significance for the Italians.
He was a very famous television personality, elected as a Member of the European Parliament to the ranks of the Radicals of Mr Pannella.
He was fully acquitted, after many years of legal proceedings: he was the victim of judicial error and media persecution, of an abuse of media power.
This is something which, I regret to say, still happens today in many countries.
I would just like to pay tribute here to his civil campaigns and to Mr Tortora himself, so that his memory is not lost in this House too.
Mr President, I have asked to speak on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on a point of order in order to draw your attention to the situation of Vincent Reynaud, originally from Strasbourg in France, and Thierry Falise from Belgium.
These two journalists and their interpreter have been secretly detained since 5 June in Vientiane in Laos.
They have been accused by the Laotian police of cooperating with bandits in a professional capacity in relation to the murder of a Laotian security officer, while in actual fact they were preparing a report on a minority group living in the mountains.
They are currently facing capital punishment.
On behalf of my group, I call on you, Mr President, to take immediate action to ensure that the Laotian authorities free the journalists, Vincent Reynaud and Thierry Falise, and that justice and truth prevail as we are very much concerned and emotions are running high.
I am happy to do that.
Mr President, on behalf of this Parliament, I would like to ask you to speak to the Moroccan Government, and in particular the King of Morocco, to call for the release of a Moroccan journalist, Mr Lmrabet, who yesterday was sentenced to three years in prison, simply for having written articles criticising the situation in Morocco.
Mr Lmrabet is on hunger strike; he therefore risks dying if there is no outside intervention.
I would therefore ask the President - and we are ready to forward the file to him - to speak to the Moroccan Government in order to try to save this journalist's life.
Please supply the relevant material and I will follow the matter up as you request.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take the floor to protest against the abuse levelled at the European Union by the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro during a rally a very short time ago.
The terms he used in the course of his three-hour speech constitute accusations against the European Union - not only against the Commission, which has imposed a few token diplomatic sanctions, but also, by extension, against Parliament, which approved a vote of protest here.
Fidel Castro's insults, his absurd accusations, show that the Cuban dictatorship is disintegrating and that the Cuban dictator has become no different from so many other Latin American dictators.
Moreover, we must make no concessions to Fidel Castro.
The wave of repression which has crashed down upon Cuba and swept writers, intellectuals and free men into prison must be energetically repelled by this House.
The issue of human rights in Cuba is a pressing one.
Furthermore, the myth of Fidel Castro and his aura must not deceive us: Mr Castro is now a dictator, and the situation in Cuba is unbearable for the world's democratic conscience.
We must persevere in this struggle and not permit ourselves to be dismayed by the abuse at which he has become so adept.
Mr President, I wish to protest about the Greek Presidency's intolerable attack on Cuba.
This is a case of open intervention in the internal affairs of this country, incitement to subversion and paving the way for military intervention.
The Presidency is keeping quiet about the provocative activities of the US representative in Cuba where, as he himself admits, he is recruiting agents by paying them millions of dollars to turn against their socialist homeland.
While demonstrating such sensitivity about the death penalty and human rights in Cuba, it will sign two judicial cooperation agreements with the USA in Washington on 25 June.
Thus, it is handing over the citizens of the Member States, bound hand and foot, to a country in which death penalties are executed on a daily basis, thousands are held without trial or defence, Cuban terrorists and hijackers roam free and Cuban patriots are held without defence because they uncovered plans for American terrorist activities against Cuban leaders, not to mention the hundreds in Guantanamo.
Hypocrisy?
Complicity?
Without doubt both!
The millions of Cubans who recently demonstrated their support for the socialist revolution in Havana, and the manifestations of solidarity with Cuba throughout the world are the speechless response to the presumptive invaders and their European accomplices.
Colleagues, it is my sad duty today to mark the deaths of four German soldiers, part of the international security assistance force in Kabul, on 7 June 2003.
These deaths occurred during a terrorist attack on the Kabul military airport where the soldiers were waiting for their flight home after several months of service in Afghanistan.
29 of their comrades were seriously injured.
These German soldiers are the first casualties by enemy action since Germany decided to take an active part in out-of-area military missions.
I wish, on behalf of the European Parliament, to communicate our condolences for these victims and to their families, and to express our sympathy with the German Government and the armed forces.
(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)
The next item is the extraordinary debate on the European Convention.
IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Klaus HÃ€nsch, let me congratulate you and the 30 colleagues from this House, along with President ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, his vice-presidents and the other members of the Convention for a truly remarkable achievement.
You have produced a draft Constitutional Treaty which is clear, which is balanced, which is based on a single option and which could work.
The ultimate vindication, if one was needed, of Parliament's total belief in the Convention method an open, inclusive, participatory and democratic preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference.
The results of the Convention are also innovative.
It was an operation which was originally conceived to address some of the business left over at Nice, and then broadened to answer a catalogue of questions from Laeken.
The Convention has now produced a constitutional blueprint with a broad institutional balance.
The proposal represents a radical improvement on our existing Treaties - way beyond what many may have expected.
The first reactions, as I have followed them in this House, have broadly endorsed the result of the Convention.
I am aware that nobody in an exercise like this can be 100% satisfied.
But no politics anywhere can please all the people all the time.
I am sure everybody can think of various improvements to different Articles, but to draw up a balanced project for tomorrow's Europe to which have contributed 28 national parliaments, 28 governments, the European Commission and the European Parliament and to get, at the end, a coherent result is something which should not be minimised.
It should not be lightly discarded or unbundled.
Those who would seek to unravel the broad consensus which has been created would bear a political responsibility and risk a result that would tend towards the lowest common denominator, precisely the result which the Convention wished to avoid - and it ably managed to do so.
Some further work is required, and the Convention has expressed a wish to complete its work on parts 3 and 4 of the Constitutional Treaty in the first two weeks of July.
I hope the Convention will be authorised to proceed in this way, in particular as regards the part 3 of the Treaty on the policies of the Union.
We hope that the Convention will find the means to avoid gridlock on European Union decision-making, through excessive reliance on the veto mechanism.
In this way it will achieve coherence with the rest of the text which responds to the double challenge of enhanced democracy and greater efficiency.
The European Council is expected to convene an IGC later this year.
I support the approach that the conference should be as short as possible and should conclude its work in good time for the 2004 European Parliamentary elections.
I also strongly recommend that the Accession States should play a full and equal role in the IGC.
I intend to ask the European Council in Thessaloniki to consider how best to associate the European Parliament with the working of the IGC.
There is widespread recognition that in previous IGCs European Parliamentary participation played an important and constructive role.
It is in the logic of the progress, the participation and the shared ownership that has emerged from this Convention that the role of the Parliament should be enhanced in the dispositions that would be made for the next IGC.
Having the Treaty agreed well before the next European elections is essential.
Our voters, the citizens, have the right to know what they are voting for, and what role the Parliament they elect is destined to play in the wider Europe of tomorrow.
I also hope the new Treaty will contribute to making the next elections, along with the historic enlargement - although our sixth direct elections - our first real European elections.
I conclude, as I began, by congratulating our colleagues who contributed so effectively to the deliberations of the Convention; by acknowledging, on behalf of the European Parliament, our debt of gratitude to all the conventionnels and to the leadership of President Giscard d'Estaing.
A sound basis is now available to the governments.
The Convention has given its lead.
We call now on the governments to give theirs.
Mr President, thank you very much for your words and I would like to congratulate you on having called this plenary session just a few days after the closing session of the Convention and just a few days before the European Council in Thessaloniki.
This Parliament will be the first to debate the draft Constitution.
And it is with emotion that I would like to point out that, in 1997, it was this Parliament, in a report for which Mr Dimitris Tsasos and myself were rapporteurs, that approved the replacement of the intergovernmental method with what we then called the Community method for the reform of the Treaties.
That Community method, enshrined in the Resolution of 19 November 1997, is the Convention.
The European Parliament's option has therefore been a successful one, because I would like to say quite seriously that, in the 16 months of the Convention's work, we have done more than in ten years of Intergovernmental Conferences.
Firstly, Mr President, we have a Constitution.
I remember how this Parliament was also a pioneer, through the report by Mr Olivier Duhamel, in calling for the constitutionalisation of the Union.
This constitutionalisation is going to increase efficiency and is going to produce a Union of results.
Many of our requests are in the text: the pillars disappear, the Union has a legal personality, we are going to reinforce the Community method, we have guaranteed the Commission's monopoly on initiative, a legislative procedure in which the Council and Parliament are on an equal footing will become the normal procedure.
We have also achieved a move from unanimity to qualified majority in many areas, and this Parliament will be involved in 70 of them, when at the moment it is involved in 34.
We also have a great simplification of methods, Mr President: we have ended up with five decision-making procedures and we have managed to use a language which was far-removed from the Community jargon.
But we have also democratised the Union, starting with the first article of the Constitution, which speaks of the Union's double legitimacy, something which this Parliament has always advocated as a Union of states and citizens.
When I entered this Parliament in 1992 it was a consultative assembly.
After the Constitution this Parliament will be a Parliament worthy of its name.
And this democratising effect also impacts on national parliaments.
I would like to pay tribute to Mr Napolitano and his report, for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, because we have created a means for involving national Parliaments in the Community procedure by means of the early warning system.
I would also like to say to all of those people who have always noted a degree of rivalry between the national Parliaments and the European Parliament that our main allies in this Convention have been the national Parliaments.
And I would like to pay tribute to them for that.
I also believe, Mr President, that we have done something enormously important, something we have fought for in this Parliament, which is to integrate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution.
We called for this before Nice and we did not achieve it, but the Charter of Fundamental Rights is now going to become the document which will give Europeans their identity.
And not only have we reinforced the representative institutions, but also the participatory ones.
The Constitution has recognised the role of non-governmental organisations and associations, and we have incorporated popular initiative as an instrument for semi-direct democracy.
Mr President, when Mr Giscard d'Estaing was asked last week who had won, he said that in terms of this Constitution the European Parliament had won.
I believe the citizen has won.
I believe this is a triumph for the European citizens, who are going to have a Union capable of producing better results, a more transparent Union and, above all, a more efficient Union.
And allow me to say that, as Chairman, I have been very honoured to carry out this task.
Very honoured because the 32 members of the delegation - we have not distinguished between members and substitutes - have done exceptional work in defending the positions of Parliament and in providing technical and political support at all times for myself, for Klaus HÃ€nsch and for Andrew Duff.
Please let me say one more thing, Mr President: go to Thessaloniki.
I believe that this Parliament's political message is a very clear one.
You have said that this Constitution represents radical progress.
I believe this is the most important advance the European Union has made since the Treaties of Rome, and I am therefore convinced that the Intergovernmental Conference is not going to improve it.
I believe that we should defend this text, which has been presented without options, as the European Parliament wanted, to the end.
At the end of this process, moreover, Mr President, I believe we must put it to a referendum.
Certain governments, such as the Spanish Government, have asked that such a referendum take place on the same day as the European Parliament elections; and I believe this would represent the culmination of this democratising element contained in the European Constitution.
Thank you very much to everybody for your help.
Without your help, without everybody's help, this would have been impossible.
Mr President, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the consensus on the draft Constitution which we reached in the Convention last Friday has been described as historic, and indeed it is - for look at what has been achieved.
We have drafted a Constitution for over 25 sovereign states and peoples who, for centuries, were pitched head-to-head in plunder, war and devastation.
That is without parallel in history.
We have drafted a Constitution for a multitude of peoples and states who all have long histories of their own, who speak different languages, who maintain their own identity and yet who want to shape their destinies together.
That is without precedent in the history of Europe and the world.
What is new about it?
I would like to mention just six points which I think are especially important.
Firstly, the Constitution sets forth the rights and duties of citizens.
We have made the Charter of Fundamental Rights an integral and legally binding element of the European Constitution.
Secondly, the famous 'four freedoms' of the Treaty of Rome were also promises for the future.
Today, these promises have been fulfilled.
The new Constitution contains a new pledge in Article 2 and Article 3, namely sustainable development, justice, security and solidarity for Europe's citizens.
Thirdly, the most important contribution to democracy and to the 'ownership' of European policies is clarity.
Citizens must be able to identify which areas can be regulated by the European Union and which cannot.
They must also be able to identify who bears responsibility for political decisions and who does not.
In this respect, the Constitution makes significant progress.
We have created a division of competences which, for the first time, defines the competences between the Member States and the European Union more clearly than before, and I would remind the older Members of this House that Parliament has failed twice in the past to achieve this goal.
We have greatly simplified and reduced the number of decision-making procedures.
Fourthly, the European Parliament: codecision on matters of legislation will be the rule in future.
Today it is the exception, but in future, it will be the rule, and that is a quantum leap compared with the current situation.
After all, the President of the Commission will be elected by this Parliament. This enhances his political legitimacy and will increase the importance of the European elections.
Fifthly, we have tackled the issue of institutional balance.
We have strengthened all three institutions: the European Parliament, of course, but also the Commission, especially the Commission President, whose role is considerably enhanced, and we have also strengthened the Council, in the person of the President of the European Council.
Sixthly, the European Union is not a global power, but it has a global power's responsibility.
At present, it cannot do justice to this responsibility, but we have tried to ensure that it can do so in future.
We have created the position of a European Minister for Foreign Affairs.
However, we realise that simply creating this position certainly does not achieve commonality on foreign, security and defence policy issues.
That cannot be regulated by a decision; it is a process, and the position of Foreign Minister will have to ensure that this process towards commonality is initiated and kept on track.
Finally, I would like to point out that there were no models for what we have drafted.
This constitution cannot be a copy of any nation-state's constitution.
The nation-state of the nineteenth century is not the blueprint for Europe's architecture in the twenty-first century.
We had to reinvent ourselves in the Convention, not only in substantive terms: we also had to reinvent our working methods.
We have not always achieved what we set out to achieve, but no Intergovernmental Conference since the Treaty of Rome has produced such significant changes, with such a far-reaching impact, as those now envisaged by the Constitution.
With this Constitution, we can put the European Union, the 50-year-old organisation of European states, on a new footing.
Treaties are based on mistrust born of past experience.
Constitutions are based on confidence in the future, and with this Constitution, the citizens of Europe are linking their destinies to create a better future.
Let us, here in the European Parliament, clear the way for this process and make sure that the governments face up to their European responsibility.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr HÃ€nsch.
I would also like to say right away that our group can support the draft Constitution.
Not all the dreams have come to fruition.
If we consider the challenges facing us, especially the enlargement to twenty-five Member States, Europe's role in matters of war and peace, and worldwide developments, I would have liked to see something a little more courageous.
I would have liked to see majority voting in foreign policy - but this is something which I hope we can still discuss during the negotiations on Part III.
With twenty-five Member States, how can we make any progress on certain aspects of tax policy if we do not have majority voting, and if we fail to make further improvements here in Part III?
In other words, measured against the challenges, we cannot be satisfied, but what has been achieved is better than what we had before, and that is the essential point.
It is better than what we have at present, for Europe has never been developed in a single step.
Even with twenty-five countries, we still cannot enshrine 'finality', because no agreement can be reached on this.
Walter Hallstein was right, as always, when he said that European union is a creatio continua - an ongoing process of creation.
The progress which can be made at a specific moment in history is written down and enshrined in treaty form - and now in the form of a constitution - and is the basis for further development and progress within the European Union.
This is the perspective from which we should view this outcome.
I agree with Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr HÃ€nsch when they say that this is a truly magnificent achievement.
If we look at our own nation-states and see how often it takes years of dispute to amend a tax law or perhaps revise a provision of the constitution, and how lengthy and difficult a process achieving a decision or an agreement can be, I think it is a miracle that so many nations, represented by their governments and parliamentarians, have been able to reach agreement on a common constitution.
That is almost unprecedented in constitutional history.
In all our countries, our constitutions were created as a result of new beginnings, crises, disasters and war, when there was social and political consensus in the country, but not in normal times.
The fact that this has nonetheless been achieved has a great deal to do with the fact that the majority of this Convention was composed of parliamentarians, who - unlike the diplomats at the Intergovernmental Conferences - think in terms of solutions, not competences.
For this reason, on behalf of my group, I would like to send one message to Thessaloniki.
What the parliamentarians have drafted must not be reopened by the diplomats, for nothing legitimates their doing so.
(Applause)
This is why we must defend what has been achieved, especially through the parliamentarians' work.
Even if every one of us has an issue where he or she is not entirely satisfied, we must put it to one side and refrain, for the next six months, from making fresh demands.
Instead, we must defend what has been achieved and postpone other desirable things for the time being.
After that, we will have a chance of achieving them.
I am also quite optimistic that every one of the governments that are now moaning wants a different thing changed. However, one would cancel out the other, and that is probably the safest guarantee that at the end of the day, the text will go through more or less as it stands.
I believe that a Europe of citizens has also been created.
What has been founded is a Europe of states and of citizens, safeguarded by fundamental rights.
At the elections, the citizens will vote on the head of the executive because linkage has been established between the elections to the European Parliament and the election of the executive.
We see that this has occurred on the basis of a value-oriented constitution.
My group battled hard to include a reference to Christianity; we were not successful, but what has been achieved is a value-based constitution, with religious life being enshrined as an element of significance for the future, and values are, in any case, set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We have more scope for action.
We have clarity between the institutions.
We have found an equilibrium - despite the President of the European Council - which seems to me to be reasonably well-balanced.
For this reason, we should vote for the draft Constitution and then have further discussions next week during the negotiations on Part III, if at all possible.
In particular, we should ensure that we are more effective on the key foreign policy issue, but we should also remember that through closer cooperation, we have made much more progress than has been discussed in public so far, including the option of an obligation to provide support.
I think that for this reason, it is good work and this House should endorse it.
(Applause)
Mr President, almost 20 years after the European Parliament, elected by universal suffrage, produced a draft Constitution, the 'Spinelli draft', we are achieving a text for a Constitution for a European Union made up of 25 States and 480 million citizens.
I believe we must welcome this historic success of the Convention, which has produced a democratic draft whose contents largely correspond to the hopes we had placed in this enterprise.
I would first of all like to express my gratitude for the work done by the European Parliament's Delegation led very competently by the two Members who have represented it in the Presidium: Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr HÃ€nsch, who have acted as a coherent team fighting from the front but also protecting their rear.
I believe that this has added coherence and seriousness to our representation and has helped our political families from throughout the enlarged Union to be able to work and mature in this House - which is the home of democracy in Europe - and to be able to create a common doctrine which has been specifically reflected in the text.
Without making a very detailed analysis and assessment - this is a job we will have to do during the summer and which will have to be carried out by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - and in passing, Mr President, I would like to complain on behalf of my group because Mr Napolitano has not been given speaking time as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
He will speak within the speaking time allotted to the Socialist Group, but I do not believe that this is a correct way of proceeding.
I would like to say on behalf of my group that we must celebrate the fact that we have a single text without options, without red cards; a text which opens doors and does not close them, and also one which is of a manageable size.
I believe these are important elements on the basis of which we must work and make progress.
We must defend what we have fought for tooth and nail and we must continue working; our two representatives have given a brief summary of what has been achieved.
I would like to point out, in relation to the evolutionary clauses and the new date of 2009, that we must continue to work, drawing conclusions, creating doctrine and strengthening the European institutions.
I would like to mention certain points which the Socialist Group sees as absolute priorities: to strengthen the social Europe and to defend Europe in terms of its economic governance, making progress in the field of taxation with regard to the internal market and majority decision-making in the field of foreign, security and defence policy; and we believe that this must also contribute to finding a better balance within the interinstitutional triangle.
Our job must therefore now be to try to consolidate this Constitution as a basis for subsequent work, but we must work on the basis of what we have agreed, what has been achieved, which is an indication that we are able to act, and this is tremendously important at a time when the European Union was being portrayed as moribund and incapable of taking action.
Furthermore, I believe we must welcome something which is also very positive, at a time when we have observers from the future member countries, and that is that they have participated fully in the work of the Convention before actually joining the Union.
They are working shoulder to shoulder with us and playing a significant role, and this is being demonstrated in popular referendums.
Over the last week we have had two significant successes in Poland and in the Czech Republic demonstrating that this is not just a market, but a shared project of coexistence, and we believe we should welcome it when so often distrust has been called for.
Finally, Mr President, please allow me to comment on an important aspect, because we always talk about architecture and we must also talk about personalities, we must also support - and I would ask that this be done in Thessaloniki - the Council's Agreement returned this week on the Statute on European Political Parties.
I believe that Parliament has done significant work.
We must thank the rapporteur, Mr Jo Leinen, for the great work he has done.
It is clear that having protagonists who genuinely demonstrate that we are capable of organising ourselves is a fundamental element of European construction.
And finally, Mr President, I would like to ask you on behalf of my group, when you go to the Thessaloniki Summit, to express the clear will of the whole House that the text which has been produced openly and democratically be respected, and also to say, on our behalf, that we want to be properly represented in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference; not just making use of previous experiences but with a representation which is in line with our participation and our dignity.
Mr President, I too thank all those who have represented this House on the Convention.
It is said that 'success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan'.
The draft Constitution agreed by the Convention last Friday is blessed with many proud parents.
Of these, the European Parliament can claim more than its fair share of paternity, since we led the calls for the Convention method to be used to avoid a repeat of the failures of Nice.
We owe much to the Belgian Presidency of the European Union, which gave us the visionary Laeken Declaration.
While the birth was difficult and the baby is not as pretty as we hoped, the European Constitution born on Friday 13 June 2003 deserves a long and fruitful life.
Liberals everywhere will rejoice that fundamental rights now lie at the heart of the Union's basic law.
We welcome the establishment of a single legal personality for the Union, the unification of the pillars and the extension of democratic control by the European Parliament.
Crucially, this shorter and simpler treaty should also be more accessible to Europe's citizens since it sets out more clearly who does what.
Of course we would have liked to go further in some respects.
We hope that the post of Chairman of the European Council will in time be merged with that of Commission President in an integrated Presidency.
We want to see the legitimacy of the Commission strengthened by a real election of its President by the European Parliament.
We seek a greater role for regions with constitutional powers.
And we would like greater recourse to majority voting, even in a sensitive area like foreign policy, so that the Union can act more decisively abroad.
There is still work to be done.
The extension of qualified majority voting needs to be given concrete expression in the policies in part 3 of the constitution.
We also urge the Convention to be ambitious in creating a lighter procedure for amending part 3, through voting by super-qualified majority and without recourse to national ratification.
At Thessaloniki, the Heads of State and Government will be granted custody of the new-born constitution and will bring it to maturity in the Intergovernmental Conference.
Having been so central to its conception, our governments will not be able to disown the constitution lightly.
The European Council will have to decide the composition and the duration of the IGC.
The parliamentary component of the Convention must be fairly represented at the talks - as you, Mr President, have said.
Since members of the Liberal caucus under my colleague Andrew Duff have made such a great contribution to the work of the Convention, we insist that Parliament's representation should reflect this.
On the length of the IGC, if Member States seek to unpick one part of the deal, others will pull at it too and the whole fabric risks unravelling.
For that reason, we urge that the IGC be kept short and stick to the essentials of the text agreed by the Convention.
This brings me to my final point.
The most open and democratic institutional reform in our Union's history deserves to be brought to a fitting conclusion.
It is no use making the EU simpler and more accountable if politicians do not then explain it and argue the case for active engagement in Europe
Speaking personally, I hope that my own government will at last shake off its reticence and take the case for Britain's membership of this refounded European Union to the people in a referendum.
Whether they ratify by way of referendum or parliamentary debate, I hope that other countries too will seize the opportunity to have a great debate with their voters.
That way, our people can again feel ownership of the European project.
Mr President, 'not perfect, but unhoped-for': the words of Convention Chairman ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing are entirely fitting.
Despite some criticisms, which every Convention member could probably voice from their own standpoint, the result of the Convention's work is to be commended.
What is significant, however, is that the Convention has presented the results of its work in a joint paper, which will be submitted to the summit without an alternative.
The previous speakers, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr HÃ€nsch, have underlined the major progress achieved through the Convention's work, and I endorse their comments.
From my perspective, we can indeed describe it as a milestone in the history of European integration, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank both of them particularly for their work in the delegation and their work in the Convention's Praesidium.
What is especially important, to my mind, is that democracy in Europe has been significantly enhanced, not only the rights of the European Parliament or the national parliaments, but above all, direct democracy and citizens' participation in the development of the European Union.
The fact that we will have a citizens' initiative as a mechanism in future and that people can get directly involved in European politics is something I see as extremely important, especially in terms of developing a European public arena.
I fully endorse this.
I am in favour of holding a referendum on the Constitution in every Member State.
I would like to point out to everyone that an initiative has been launched for this very purpose with more than 100 supporters in the Convention and I myself am a signatory to it.
I hope that in Part III, it will be possible to make further progress with European integration, especially in the social field and services of general interest, where we can link in with the work on Part I.
Let me follow on from Mr HÃ€nsch's comment a moment ago.
He said that the European Union is not a global power, but that it does have a global power's responsibility.
I must say that I am very alarmed by what the EU Foreign Ministers have just agreed in Luxembourg: for the first time, the European Union is threatening the use of military force against countries which flout disarmament commitments and are involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Naturally, this is not targeted at the USA, which simply withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2001!
It is not all that long since US Secretary of State Colin Powell painted a graphic picture to the Security Council of the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
That was followed by the war, and as you all know, weapons of mass destruction have still not been found.
I am frightened by the fact that the EU Foreign Ministers are now following the same line of argument as Powell and apparently want to endorse the Bush doctrine.
Admittedly, the declaration does state, by way of restriction, that the UN Security Council will play what is described as a key role in measures threatened by the EU, but this does not allay my fears.
The declaration conflicts not only with international law but also with the Convention's draft Constitution!
Article 3 (4) commits the European Union to strict observance of international law and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter.
We all know that threatening the use of military force to resolve conflicts is prohibited under international law.
We cannot allow the Constitution to be undermined even before it enters into force!
Mr President, the Convention came to an end last Friday with a glass of champagne for everybody, but, in actual fact, the work is not yet finished.
The Convention still has to meet and debate.
I hoped to hear today from our representatives what they intend to do in this Convention, and I urge them strongly not to sit back and think that it is all over now, that nothing can be changed and that, what is more, we have won.
We still have to do as much as we can now, before the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Indeed, we know - as Mr Brok has said - that we will have to fight to avoid the governments, freed of the vociferous presence of the Members of Parliament and ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, being let loose on a Constitution which is currently uninspiring, not least in that it fails to live up to the expectations of the majority of the citizens or, I believe, the majority of the members of the Convention.
I do not agree with those who feel that the pseudo-Constitution we have today is the best we could have achieved, and I believe that it was a serious strategic error on the part of Mr Giscard-d'Estaing and the Praesidium to allow the Convention to be polluted from the outset by the intergovernmental method that it was trying to leave behind.
Only during the final days of the Convention was it understood, at last, that submitting to the terms of the most sceptical governments could have caused the entire venture to fail, and the backing of national and European members of Parliament was sought, as well as the support of the much-maligned Commission, working together with the Presidents and the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Convention.
Nevertheless, this measure was belated and ineffective, for it was not the fruit of months of work but improvised at the last minute.
History is not made with 'ifs' and 'buts', but, given that it is not all over yet, we believe that these last few weeks must be used to further improve on the compromise reached, that we must learn from our errors and endeavour not to repeat them.
For our part, we will endeavour to exert as much pressure as possible as regards four issues which we consider to be extremely important.
Firstly, it is absolutely essential to remove the unanimity obligation for the revision of the Constitution and give the European Parliament power of ratification.
Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, my friend and fellow Member, we are not and will not be a constituent Parliament because, as things stand, not only will we not have the power to ratify the Constitution but we will not be consulted on the convening of Intergovernmental Conferences either, as we are at the moment.
Thus, we are in danger of losing powers in this area, not gaining them.
Secondly, we must work hard to extend the role of the European Parliament in key sectors such as trade policy, cooperation in judicial and criminal matters and the drawing up of the Financial Perspective: the die is not yet irrevocably cast in this area.
It is unthinkable that the European Union should continue to participate in major negotiations such as WTO negotiations without any supervision by the European and national parliaments.
Thirdly, it is incomprehensible that, in the twenty-first century, after Chernobyl, after the majority of the current Members of the European Union have decided to stop using nuclear energy, there should be an explicit reference in the European Constitution to the promotion of nuclear energy.
This is an error which could cost us dear in terms of public opinion, an error which we can still correct.
Lastly, I do not believe that merely including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Part II of the Constitution has much significance for the citizens and legal residents of Europe without a corresponding, definite extension of the possibility of appeal to the Court of Justice, first and foremost in matters of judicial and criminal cooperation.
This is our programme for the period between now and the last Convention meeting, scheduled for 10 July.
We are searching for support both within and outside the Convention, in the hope that the Chairman, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, and his Praesidium will be able to guide it towards a result which is still within their reach today.
When the Intergovernmental Conference opens, it may well be too late.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the draft Constitution completed by the Convention really was the excellent document whose echoes resound through the speeches of my fellow Members, and if it responded to a need genuinely felt by the peoples of Europe, the champagne drunk in this room a week ago would have been drunk in our countries too.
The hymn which was sung here would also have been sung in our countries. That, however, was not the case.
The celebrations spread no further than the walls of this building; in other words, the current is still not flowing.
That is a serious problem which, by all appearances, the Convention has not solved.
We want Europe to work better, but we do not think this is the way to go about it.
Once again, the wrong method has been used, and we fear that this text may mark a return to the tensions and frustrations which prevailed in Amsterdam and Nice.
We take issue with the desire to suppress all memory of the past, of history, of values intertwined with our roots.
I am speaking specifically of the Christian topos inscribed and engraved all over our experience.
We believe that the Convention served to clarify our options and their consequences.
It did not, however, serve as a pretext for hasty decision-making - far from it!
Furthermore, a look at the Nice or Laeken agenda is instructive.
Are the Treaties really going to be simplified?
Can a Treaty containing more than 400 articles and at least five protocols represent a genuine attempt at simplification, or might there have been a failure there?
What can one say, moreover, about the participation of the national parliaments, which have made few really significant advances in terms of their participation in European integration?
Laeken called for more democracy and transparency.
Even the way the Convention works, however, is a bad example and a bad omen for the future: its functions are subordinate to the supreme whim of its President and to what I might dub consensocracy, a form of democracy without elections, where not a single vote has taken place.
Laeken also asked the European Union to grow closer to its citizens.
I am not sure this has happened.
If the idea of doing away with the rotating presidency goes ahead, indeed, I am afraid that the Union will move much further away from its citizens.
What do I expect from governments, then?
I expect them to take this responsibility to their citizens seriously as a basis for their work.
I expect them to respect democracy and to listen, listen to their people.
The people have a legitimate right to take decisions, since that right is bestowed on them democratically through the electoral process and legally through the Treaties.
Mr President, constitutions belong to the people.
They limit politicians' power between elections, referendums and constitutional changes.
A constitution is the people's protection against the politicians.
The draft EU constitution has instead become the politicians' protection against the people.
Thirteen out of 25 prime ministers, elected on a quite different basis, are at the centre of power.
Six or seven of the 13 will be people who can no longer be elected in their own countries and who can share the power among themselves after each election to the European Parliament.
They must have an eye to the election result, but they themselves decide if they have had enough of an eye to it.
In that way, Mr Blair can become President, Mr Fischer Foreign Minister and Mr Aznar President or Vice-President of the Commission.
It is five years' consolation for all those who are finished in their own countries.
EU leaders elect each other and are not accountable to the electorate.
One of them must have a majority in the European Parliament, but Parliament cannot elect a second.
If the Commission is elected, it can be overturned by a 2/3 majority, but Parliament still cannot elect a second one.
It is an historic paradox that you have to be a democracy in order to enter the EU, but that the EU is not itself a democracy.
If the European Convention were to apply for EU membership on the basis of the present draft constitution, we should have to say that there were very fine objectives and values in Articles 2 and 3, but why have you forgotten democracy?
Why does the electorate not have the final say?
Why must the constitution not be approved by referendum in all the countries?
Mr President, the Convention's conclusions, which are going to be discussed at the Thessaloniki Council, should have responded to one global question: how can we bring Europe closer to the citizens?
Yet it is difficult to see how the text proposed responds to the question in any way whatsoever.
What is worse, it is clear to see that before long another treaty will be required to resolve the conflicts of power or clarify the obscure procedures the new text wishes to establish, for example in relation to the common foreign policy.
However, above all, this text moves in completely the wrong direction.
In order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, we need more real democracy.
The Convention takes the approach of enhanced supranationality, in other words false democracy, by widely applying qualified majority voting and codecision, without any safety net for the national democracies as such, by establishing a European Constitution superior to the national Constitutions, and by transferring to the Union competences in the area of fundamental rights through the incorporation of the Charter.
In these conclusions, I do not see anything that is going to bring Europe closer to its people, but I do see a great deal that is going to move it further away from them.
In the wake of the new treaty, if it follows the Convention's proposals, we will be in exactly the same situation as before, and the democracy, the understanding, the affection of the people as regards the Union will not have progressed one little bit.
If we want to re-establish contact between Europe and its people, and I will say this once more, we must get rid of the feelings of remoteness and powerlessness the people feel in relation to Brussels.
There is only one way to achieve this: we must once more allow the national democracies to play an active role in European decision-making, for instance by giving them the right to control subsidiarity or by counterbalancing the Community mechanisms through a right of veto or non-participation that should be granted to each national parliament.
Mr President, all of the timid proposals in this direction have been systematically reduced to nothing by the Convention.
One day they will have to be introduced once more.
Mr President, the speeches that we have heard from our Convention representatives stand in stark contrast with what our own citizens are being told by our national leaders in relation to what is contained within the Convention document.
In the United Kingdom, the UK Government representative, Peter Hain, has dismissed the document as a mere tidying-up exercise, and although the UK Government is wont to correct Mr Hain from time to time, on this occasion our Prime Minister has promoted him to Leader of the House of Commons, so we might imagine that he approves of that statement.
But we do not have to rely upon Mr Hain's statement of some weeks ago: in the last 24 hours the British Foreign Secretary has given his judgment upon this Convention document.
He has told people in the UK that there are no significant constitutional changes, that there is no significant change in the relationship between the EU and Member States, that the IGC will not be concluded until next year and that the UK will have a veto in relation to each and every decision.
The document, he says, is a draft, and like any draft it is open to improvement and amendment.
But now we are engaged in the hard bargaining, the last-minute agreements reached by democratically elected Heads of State, and the Treaty must ultimately have the unanimous support of all Member States.
I shall just refer to a few areas: on foreign and defence policy, he says that a guarantee has been won, and that even if such proposals are put forward in relation to common and defence policies, 'we will oppose them and we will have a veto'.
On the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Foreign Secretary said in the last 24 hours that 'the net effect of our proposals will ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not in any way extend the Union's competence or powers'.
Finally, in relation to economic matters he says 'we do not support the existing text of Article 13, we do not support tax harmonisation, we have a unanimity lock on these proposals through the use of a veto.'
That is the message that people are getting in the United Kingdom.
It is not surprising in the context of this contrast that 88% of people in the United Kingdom in a massive recent poll indicated that they wanted to have a say in a referendum on these proposals.
I am delighted to see that Mr Watson, somewhat late in the day, has started reading the Daily Mail and has now concluded that is a call that he personally should support as well.
I look forward to seeing his press release, although I am bound to say I do not think his remarks today about qualified majority voting on foreign policy, and national parliaments having no say in relation to ratification, will be any part of what appears in the UK.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, but I feel I must also express some opinions and concerns as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The committee of which I am Chairman, and Parliament in general, were strongly in favour of the Convention and advocated the drawing up of a European Constitution.
Work has begun on the Constitution.
The Convention has succeeded in fulfilling its task, and this gives us great satisfaction.
When we are called upon shortly to express our opinion on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference, as the current Treaty lays down, we will assess the draft adopted by the Convention as well.
We will be in an even better position to do so when we have seen the text - which needs further improvement, as Mr Brok and other Members have said - of Parts III and IV of the draft.
As well as this deep satisfaction, we would like to express our appreciation of, and gratitude to, our representatives for their endeavours in the Convention and, in particular, in the Praesidium, to uphold the positions of the European Parliament.
Of course, the draft adopted by consensus represents common ground between different positions: some of our representatives' proposals met with substantial resistance, echoes of which were heard in this Chamber just now.
Our opinion must, therefore, be neither triumphalistic nor dogmatic, and it must not fail to express our concern, particularly on two points.
Firstly, the risk of a change in the institutional balance of powers due to the creation of a new position at the top of the Union, the position of full-time President of the European Council.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs declared itself to be fully against this, proposing alternative or compromise solutions, but they were not accepted.
Secondly, the possibility that the unanimity obligation would obstruct the decision-making process in key fields in a 25-Member State Union.
We hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to go further: on this and other matters, we are determined to prevent regression in respect of the Convention's conclusions.
We must, however, look closely at the unknowns which will affect the future of the Union.
Maintaining a critical attitude and ongoing vigilance does not mean being destructive or pessimistic but serves to give fresh impetus to the process of integration and European unity.
Altiero Spinello taught us that: without his criticism of the Single Act, the progress made at Maastricht and Amsterdam would not have been achieved.
Mr President, you said in your opening remarks that the package that we have symbolises a radical improvement upon the present system.
That is true, but it does more than that.
Mr Straw and Mr Hain are profoundly wrong.
It is a settlement that entrenches what is truly important, it discards what is not, and strengthens the capacity of the Union to act effectively abroad and inside the Member States.
It ensures that the citizen will not be abused from the greater power that is to be exercised at the federal level.
The European Council should accept the proposals, without qualification, as the basis for an agreement at the IGC.
At Thessaloniki we should not see this pirouetting around a convoluted formula designed to deceive.
Were the IGC to seek to open up the package, it is certain that the results will be inferior.
What the 15 were unable to agree at Nice will certainly be impossible for 25 to agree at the future IGC.
The leaders at Thessaloniki must listen to the voice of consensus as expressed through the Convention and through this Parliament, and build the future of Europe with courage.
Mr President, it is being proposed that the European Union should have a constitution.
The Convention has produced one: it approved the draft version based on a federalist consensus in a way reminiscent of a Politburo-style dictatorship.
Once again it is a matter of a coup d'Ã©tat on the part of the big countries.
Qualified majority decisions take away small countries' right of veto, which, however, the three big countries still have when acting in concert.
The Member States are to lose their permanent voting Commissioner, although the right of initiative with regard to all EU legislation will remain a Commission monopoly.
The fact that there is to be a president and that foreign policy will not be in the hands of the Commission will make the EU a more decentralised federation than the federalist European Parliament's delegation would have liked.
With the constitution the EU will be militarised and NATO has been written into it.
When the other pillars were toppled a new NATO pillar was erected.
The non-aligned countries must not sign the declaration regarding collective security guarantees to be annexed to the constitution.
The collective defence of the EU in the constitution could also mean collective unlawful invasion.
Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating not only our own representatives at the Convention but also the Convention as a whole for the tremendous work which it has carried out.
However, this should be seen as one step in the process, not the end of the process, because we must move on to an Intergovernmental Conference , we must get the approval of the 25 governments and there will be changes within that process.
One of the most important issues to come out of the Convention discussions has been the reiteration of the doctrine of conferral.
In fact, for the first time, specific mention was made of that doctrine whereby the Union can only operate on the powers conferred upon it by the Member States.
Those powers are clearly delineated between the institutions and the Parliament as a whole.
Secondly, some Members have referred to this as the 'constitution' of Europe.
A constitution by its very nature requires and needs the endorsement of the people.
Therefore I join with other colleagues in appealing to all Member States not only to comply with their own constitutional obligations, but actually to put this forward to a referendum of the people within the Member States to give it the kind of endorsement and approval that it requires.
Thirdly, the question regarding institutional balance is fair and maintains the equity and equality between the Member States.
We should not forget that the European Union and its institutions were unique in building the foundations for a unique situation and we can continue that evolution of unique institutions for the future development of Europe.
Mr President, the Convention will have been an enriching experience for those who participated in it.
However, it will also have fully justified the judgment of a French philosopher who spoke of a Europe obsessed with its powers but indifferent to the results it achieves.
There is no doubt that the draft Treaty, the so-called constitutional Treaty, that the Convention has produced in no way responds to the Laeken mandate.
It does not respond to it as regards democracy since the Convention has organised a Europe that has no contact with the outside world, where various elements have slightly changed place.
Parliament cannot actually complain about the progress made, but it is very far from what we call democracy, in other words the direct participation of the people in the decisions that affect them.
I will not talk about foreign policy, where we have very clearly been sold a lemon given that 18 out of 25 European countries have no desire for a European policy as such in this field.
I would reiterate what Mr Crowley said: if it is a Constitution, it must be put to a referendum, and if it is not put to a referendum by the people of Europe, it will not be a Constitution, because none of the citizens will feel committed to or protected by it.
Mr President, I understand that you are going to Thessaloniki tomorrow or the day after.
Perhaps our Parliament should vote on a resolution that would, I believe, bring together a broad range of all of the viewpoints represented here in order to send a strong message to the Council and to the countries that this text should be put to a referendum of the people of Europe when the time comes.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention has only just finished its work and, already, the various Member States and candidate countries are starting to distance themselves, to express reservations or vetoes on one point or another.
I am afraid that that is the price of intense activity which was certainly difficult and, at times, even ineffective, tending moreover towards the lowest common denominator and, therefore, of necessity beset by continual negotiation.
Every little change to the system is deferred until 2007 or 2009, and I really do wonder what our citizens will think when they are called upon to ratify its content.
What we feel was missing, Mr President, and is likely to continue to be missing is a vision from a global perspective of the imperative need to make determined, innovative changes to the functioning and competences of a genuine United States of Europe.
Instead, I have the impression that, far from being a base document, what will remain of the Convention's work after it passes through the IGC filter will be along the lines of Amsterdam, if not even Nice.
Mr President, I believe that we all feel a certain satisfaction when we are part of an historic moment, whatever the context, and this is definitely an historic moment for, irrespective of different positions and disagreement, which we have heard expressed again today, I fully agree with what Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo said.
For the first time in history, we have succeeded in reconciling sovereignty with the protection of rights, leaving behind the concept of demos we have known and launching Europe towards future horizons whose limits will be for us alone to decide.
Of course, there may well be a few minor flaws but, seeing as the preamble contained an extensive discourse with reference, not least, to Thucydides, I would like to draw the House's attention to the principle of the ancient Greek philosophers: history is never completely flawless because, if it were, it would not be perpetuated.
I will not comment on the text of the Treaty but limit myself to one warning and one regret.
One point on which we as Parliament must take care is the requirement of unanimity in decision-making.
We have achieved a text which, without a doubt, launches the Community method and spirit towards new horizons and, given that the Constitutional Treaty with its many facets is a key card for us to play if we are to achieve greater European competitiveness, the requirement of unanimous decision-making in a 15-Member State Europe - as we have seen - has already, at many sensitive times and in many sensitive cases, created difficult, not to say impossible situations.
Well then, opting to preserve unanimity in a 25-Member State Union may have very serious consequences, especially if the decisions hinge on economic or tax proposals.
I fear that if we were to take the option of establishing a right of veto, which is still on the cards, we would ultimately be shooting ourselves in the foot, for this would ultimately reduce the European area - which is, in fact, the largest or one of the largest common markets in the world - to a mere collection of national interests.
We must take care to avoid this.
The regret is that I listened, with some surprise, to the debate held on the preamble to decide whether our religious, or rather Christian, heritage should be included among the factors making up our common identity.
