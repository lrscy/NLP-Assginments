I particularly like the way you have stressed yet again the importance of voluntary initiatives, which many of us believe are so crucial to the success of CSR, and the way you have highlighted that usage of CSR is indeed mushrooming.
I am sure you welcome, as all of us hopefully in this House will, the announcement in yesterday's Financial Times that a number of business leaders will be launching a CSR academy in INSEAD Fontainebleau this coming Friday.
It shows that business has already got the message, which will now be cascading through more and more levels of business.
We should support you and the work that you are doing, and make sure that we recognise that "voluntary nature" is writ large in everything we do from here on.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her kind words and offer my sincere congratulations to her and to Commissioner Liikanen for this White Paper.
I am very happy to restate Parliament's support for the development of a European framework on corporate social responsibility.
I thank the Commissioner particularly for shifting its focus and taking forward our proposals for a multi-stakeholder forum and for a greater commitment to the international dimension and the international impact of European businesses worldwide.
I would like to ask the Commissioner three questions:
First, in section 7.6 the Commissioner says rightly that public financial support to enterprises by Member States should be made subject to compliance with ethical standards.
Will the Commissioner confirm that she will apply this argument to the Commission's own aid to business?
Secondly, will Commissioner Diamantopoulou repeat her assurance, made to Parliament on 30 May, that if business fails to make progress on annual social and environmental reporting within the two years, the Commission will consider making such reporting mandatory?
Finally, when in section 4.3 the Commission says it will discuss CSR-related legislation with Member States, could she say which legislation she has in mind?
Mr President, I too must express my delight at the fact that the voluntary element has been emphasised in this communication on corporate social responsibility.
It was something to which Parliament attached a lot of importance when we issued our opinion and, in the same context, we also attached importance to the exchange of best practice.
I should like to ask the Commissioner how this multi-stakeholder forum is to be organised.
We proposed that use be made of the Dublin Institute which already has experience of the exchange of good practice between the two sides of industry and which has a large network.
Is the Dublin Institute involved in this multi-stakeholder forum?
Have the costs there will be in connection with providing small and medium-sized enterprises with information about corporate social responsibility been included in the budget?
Mr President, I thank all the Members of Parliament for their great interest in and support for this proposal.
The Commission did its best to take into account the comments from your side.
As to what will happen next, it is very important that we respect the spirit of the communication where we say that the forum now has a key role to play.
In the forum all stakeholders will come together and reach conclusions and then we will make an assessment.
If we now pre-empt the conclusions, before the forum is set up, we will not be acting in a proper way.
Secondly, corporate social responsibility - the whole idea was launched years ago by Jacques Delors when he turned to businesses and asked for their support and contribution to agreed European objectives.
It has been a voluntary activity.
It is very important that this activity should be fully taken into account when organising future work, including fora.
I am sure that Mrs Diamantopoulou is much more familiar with the work of the Dublin Institute and its experience in that field and I am sure the Commission is ready to take that into account.
As far as the ethical criteria for Community funding are concerned, it would be totally unthinkable that any Community funding could be provided on the basis of criteria which do not fully respect the ethical standards which we share in our Treaty and our values.
If there are some cases which appear to show the opposite, we must act accordingly.
Mr President, I wish to answer two questions.
The first concerns Mr Howitt's question on what we mean by this proposal for the CSR concerning the legislative frameworks of the Member States.
We already have data on existing legislation in all Member States and it would be very useful if we could disseminate best practices, not only in terms of business practices, but in governmental practices as well, so that we can see whether successful results are produced by an obligation or a regulation in a Member State.
We can then disseminate the results to the other Member States.
As Mr Liikanen has said, we cannot prejudge the final result after two years of the forum.
We very much hope that, because of this huge and very constructive contribution by companies and other stakeholders during our consultation process, by the middle of 2004 we will have a concrete report and that the Commission will present its initiative on the basis of this report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the social responsibility of enterprises presents a real challenge.
Enterprises, though, consist of employers and employees.
What worries me is that bankruptcies increased by 19% in Europe and by 32% in Germany last year.
That means that, in Germany alone, 50 000 companies closed and over 100 000 workers lost their jobs.
I would therefore be most interested to know which representative organisations of employers you intend to bring together here and if you will be discussing models of optimum training and further training once you have done so.
Of course there are business networks which are already very active on this issue of corporate social responsibility and of course there are European interlocutors who represent enterprises and SMEs at European level.
As far as the problem of job losses is concerned - because it is true that there has been a huge number of job losses during the last two years - I would just like to remind you that there is another Commission initiative concerning social re-structuring.
This initiative was launched some months ago and it invites social partners to work in partnership with local authorities and governments in order to find new ways to save jobs.
Mr President, I should like to ask a bit more about this forum.
How big is it?
How often will it meet?
Where will it meet?
How much will it cost?
Who is going to pay for it?
Can you fill out the detail?
Mr President, about 40 organisations will participate in this forum.
It will meet twice a year and there is no particular budget to service the forum.
There is an internal budget which concerns the Commission and aspects of the organisation of the forum, but not as far as participants are concerned.
Mr President, just a follow-up question.
Will the sessions of the forum be held openly and in public?
Will MEPs, therefore, be able to attend, as observers, any of these sessions?

Any observers in this forum and, of course, Parliament will be invited from the very beginning and there will also be observers from international organisations.
We need to have participants from the Third World since there is an international dimension to corporate social responsibility.
Commissioner, I should like to stick to my question if I may. How many of the 40 organisations will be sent as representatives of employers?
Do you already have a ballpark figure?
No, I cannot be more specific at this time.
When we are ready I will announce it in Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The sitting will be suspended for two minutes.
Question time to the Commission will follow at 6 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.58 p.m. and resumed at 6.00 p.m.)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0253/2002). The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Question No 54 by Ewa Hedkvist Petersen (H-0487/02):
Subject: Measures to ensure legal certainty
A debate has ensued in the Swedish Parliament about legal certainty in conjunction with the adoption of a European arrest warrant.
The current guidelines as to how the Member States should meet the requirements of legal certainty are far too weak. In order to progress with legal harmonisation, fresh, clear rules must be drawn up.
Otherwise, there is a risk that the reforms will increase uncertainty and mistrust of the project. There should, for example, be a limit on the length of time suspects may be remanded in custody before trial.
At the beginning of the year, the Commission drew up a consultation paper on this matter.
What practical measures does the Commission plan to take on the basis of the outcome of the consultation process?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, the Commission has published a consultation document on procedural safeguards for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings on the web-site of the Directorate-General for Justice and Home Affairs.
The deadline for responses fell due on 15 April 2002.
Having studied the responses, the Commission intends to adopt the following practical measures: a meeting of experts will be held, in September, in which the various measures submitted for consultation will be discussed; on the basis of these discussions, the Commission intends to produce, at the end of 2002, a Green Paper on safeguards in criminal proceedings, which will probably cover the issue of time limits on pre-trial detention.
In addition to the work that has already been undertaken on the general aspects of procedural safeguards, the Commission has begun to study the issue of remand in custody and of alternatives to such detention.
This issue will be the subject of another Green Paper, to be presented at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2003, which will examine the issue of legal certainty in relation to individuals who are remanded in custody.
In accordance with the case law of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights, the concept of a reasonable period of time before the trial cannot be translated into an exact number of days, weeks, months or years, or into a variety of terms set according to the seriousness of the offence.
The competent European bodies in the field of human rights have approved very long periods of remand, of up to two-and-a-half years.
Detention will only be justified, however, if it is considered necessary to achieving a legitimate objective.
When considering whether the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, specifically Article 5(3), are being complied with, the European Court always studies and assesses the adequacy of the grounds for detention in accordance with the standards of respect for individual freedom and for the presumption of innocence, which underpin any detention without trial.
The framework decision on the European arrest warrant is based on the principle of mutual recognition, which also requires mutual trust in the criminal justice systems of the Member States.
In order to achieve mutual trust and the respect required for a true area of freedom, security and justice, standards of protection conferred on suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings must be equivalent throughout the Union.
People travelling abroad should be confident that the existing standards offer equivalent protection whatever the Member State so as not to impede their free movement for fear of encountering a system operating lower standards.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
As we make a framework decision in the EU which means that EU citizens can be extradited and taken to court for crimes in all Member States, we must also guarantee the Rule of Law.
This was also clear in the reply, which pleases me greatly.
This lies at the heart of our union, and we have declared this in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Citizens must be aware of their rights.
I listened with great interest to what the Commissioner said about time spent on remand.
It is clear that there are various reasons for different lengths of time on remand, but it is still important that citizens know what times apply and that it is possible to have a decision on remand time reviewed.
I therefore wonder whether the right to a review of arrests could be a consideration in the issue of remand times.
I also wonder whether there may be a need for some form of EU function to guarantee the Rule of Law which I seek and on which the Commission will clearly be drawing up proposals.
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I fully agree with you and I would draw your attention to the fact that the European arrest order must respect fundamental rights, and specifically the principles laid down in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which refers to the European Convention on Human Rights in the field of procedural safeguards.
And when an individual's freedom is under threat, the European Convention on Human Rights clearly provides for the possibility of revision by referral to a judicial body.
Following this consultation, the Commission intends to look into whether a legislative measure is needed at European level to approximate these rules, which are common to the Member States and which are contained in the European Convention on Human Rights and, in this way, to increase mutual trust between Member States, whilst at the same time providing guarantees of legal certainty.
I hope to be able to present the conclusions of this investigation to Parliament and the Council at the end of this year.
Question No 55by Marit Paulsen, who has been taken over by Olle Schmidt (H-0493/02):
Subject: Concentrations in the foodstuffs sector
The foodstuffs sector in Europe is currently marked by a clearly increasing degree of concentration, since a few perishables retail chains have taken control of ever larger shares of the market.
Excessively close cooperation - particularly on the purchasing side - between such large chains jeopardises free competition and the consumer's freedom of choice.
There is also a serious risk of regional products and small producers being excluded from the market, since they cannot stock the large volumes required by the large-scale system.
Has the Commission ever been forced to restrict the concentration of ownership in the trade in perishables in Europe?
If so, what are its views about the threat to the freedom of choice and European diversity in the foodstuffs sector?
If no restrictions have been imposed, does not the Commission consider that it impose them as soon as possible?

The honourable Member is right in pointing out that the last few years have witnessed a number of concentrations between large retail chains in Europe and in that respect the Commission has had to review among others such transactions as Rewe/Meinl, Carrefour/Promodes and Ahold/Superdiplo.
The Commission will generally review parties' positions by distinguishing the different product groups and distribution channels.
In the Carrefour/Promodes and Rewe/Meinl cases, for example, the Commission has observed that, in those instances where the share of a particular client in the turnover of a particular supplier reaches beyond a certain level, risks that the supplier might go out of business as a result of losing this particular client will appear.
The Commission will therefore examine whether the respective and combined shares of the parties in the turnover of their suppliers reach critical thresholds.
Where suppliers face a limited number of powerful clients, each representing a significant share of their turnover, the risk of the creation of a collective dominant position on the part of purchasers might arise.
In the Carrefour/Promodes decision the Commission assessed this risk on the French market, but concluded that the criteria necessary to find a collective dominant position had not been met.
Another factor taken into account in assessing market power on the purchasing market is the possible vertical integration into production on the part of a retail chain or its strategic use of own brands.
The analysis of the purchasing market will be particularly relevant in those cases where the merged entity would be a major player on the retail market.
As may be apparent from what I have just said, the Commission remains sensitive to the issue of purchasing power on the part of retail chains.
I will do my best to replace Mrs Paulsen who put the question.
Commissioner, I understand from your reply that you actually share the concern of Mrs Paulsen.
The question contains a suggestion that the situation is extremely serious across Europe.
The Commission needs to take special measures and review the situation.
From the Commissioner's reply, I understand that you share the view that such a review is necessary.
What we would like to see, and what Mrs Paulsen would like, is for Commissioner Bolkestein to promise here and now that the matter is being monitored carefully and that there is a readiness to implement measures and carry out an investigation and an analysis.
Finally, I would just like to tell Mr Bolkestein that in my country, Sweden, where we have the highest food prices, there is a movement to improve the situation.
We know that food prices account for a great deal of what European citizens have to pay out each month, not least those on the lowest incomes.
I well understand the concerns of the honourable Member who has just spoken and his fear that diversity in the foodstuffs sector might be reduced.
I should like to repeat that the Commission has reviewed the latest developments in that area.
Indeed this is reflected in the latest decisions which the Commission has taken in the Carrefour/Promodes case, about which I spoke earlier.
While the Commission currently has no official position on possible future developments in that sector, it wishes to underline that it will take the same care as before to analyse and decide on the potential impact of any future concentration in the relevant area.
I should like to assure Mrs Paulsen and Mr Schmid, her replacement, that the Commission will keep this matter under active review.
Everything depends on first making a correct analysis.
If circumstances are such that the Commission should take a legal position in this area, I assure Mrs Paulsen and Mr Schmid that it will not hesitate to do so.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, commercial chains are generally well capitalised, which is obviously not the case with the small and medium-sized enterprises in competition with them.
On the contrary, most small and medium-sized enterprises have no capital of their own and no venture capital.
What effect do you think the Basle II negotiations will have on this?
Have you already drawn up a sort of Basle II opening balance sheet for each country in order to see how these new rules will impact on our small and medium-sized enterprises?
I would like to state clearly that the Commission is of the view that the Basle II negotiations concern the capital adequacy of banks and not of retail chains whether or not they are well capitalised.
Basle II concerns the capital base of banks.
Small and medium-sized enterprises also enter into the Basle discussion because, particularly in Germany, they are financed with long-term credits.
These credits are valued by banks in a different way from short-term credits and this is why the whole issue of small and medium-sized enterprises enters into the Basle discussion.
This is perhaps neither the time nor the place to discuss the ins and outs of the Basle proceedings, although I remain at the disposition of the honourable Member to go into detail into this area.
I would like to assure Members of Parliament that the whole Basle II discussion takes the position of small and medium-sized enterprises fully into account.
In these discussions we are working towards a satisfactory solution which will take adequate account of the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises.
To that extent I believe that the honourable Member will have no need to worry.
Question No 56 by Brian Crowley (H-0500/02):
Subject: The euro and bank charges
Is the Commission aware of the practice of banks in the eurozone applying charges to euro withdrawals being made from ATMs machines in another Member State, does it agree that such charges on euro transactions are unjustified and contradict the spirit of the euro, and will it investigate and report back on this situation as a matter of urgency?
The question by Mr Crowley concerns withdrawals of money from cash-dispensing machines.
The Commission is aware that charges for withdrawals of euro notes in the euro area differ if the transaction takes place outside the country of residence.
However, the situation changed yesterday, 1 July, because Regulation 2560/2001 on cross-border payments in euros was adopted on 19 December last year.
Charges for withdrawals of euros from cash machines and for the use of euro payment cards must be the same for both domestic and cross-border transactions as from yesterday.
Until yesterday payment card issuers could impose a different set of charges on cross-border euro transactions.
That is no longer possible.
At the moment the law states that the charges that apply to a domestic transfer of money - i.e. cash withdrawals from cash dispensers - must be the same as those applied across borders.
A feature of the regulation, which I have just quoted, is simplicity.
The rules stipulating identical charges is easy to explain to tourists using a payment card or a bank card for withdrawals from cash machines.
The Commission issued a press release at the end of June explaining the new rules, which I assume will be to the satisfaction of Mr Crowley.
This Parliament played an important role in the drafting of the regulation, which provides an example of the practical advantages that Community action can bring to every citizen of Europe and of other countries, should they be in the euro area - advantages as soon as they wish to withdraw money from a cash dispenser.
I thank the Commissioner for his response.
I have to declare a personal interest in this matter.
As someone who has a bank account in Brussels, occasionally comes to Strasbourg, has a bank account in Ireland and travels to other countries, I have noticed in my transaction charges over the recent past huge costs per transaction, particularly here in France, as against in Belgium.
I am delighted by the fact that Regulation 2560 of 2001 has now come into operation as of 1 July.
I also welcome the fact that we have a press release from the Commission on this.
However, if we discover that banks have failed to comply with their obligations regarding similar or equal charges both domestic and abroad, and if we find that there are usury rates being added by banks with regard to operation of a card from one Member State to another, what action can be taken by an individual consumer, without going through the whole rigmarole of making an official complaint to the Commission?
What action has the Commission taken to ensure that the public is fully informed with regard to these rules and their rights?
Maybe an onus on banks to put up notices in all their branches displaying these rules and regulations could be one way.
Mr Crowley began by saying that he has a personal interest in this matter.
May I reply by saying that we all have a personal interest in the matter.
It applies to all citizens of euroland who travel abroad and who wish to obtain their cash from a cash dispenser.
It is a commodity which is available to all citizens, and all those who leave their own country to go to another part of euroland will be happy with it.
Mr Crowley also asks what users of cash machines can do if they find out that the charge for cash obtained abroad is not the same as the charge for cash obtained domestically.
There are three ways in which users can obtain redress.
Firstly, they can go to a bank and complain, ask why the bank does not do what the law says.
This can be followed up in writing, and I am sure the bank will take notice.
That is the second way of obtaining redress.
If, however, the user is of the opinion that the answer given by the bank is insufficient, he can go to a banking ombudsman. In French this is a mÃ©diateur bancaire.
He can obtain the services of such an ombudsman on the Internet via "FIN-NET". This provides a list of all such ombudsmen who can deal with any problems of that nature.
If that does not work then the person concerned can address the authorities in his or her Member State because in this case, as elsewhere, enforcement here is carried out by national authorities.
I am sure that the national authorities in Ireland will be sufficiently alert and active to help any dissatisfied customer in obtaining what he wants.
These three ways of obtaining redress should prove to be quite adequate.
As regards the last point on how the Commission intends to tell all 370 million citizens of Europe about this facility, I would firstly like to say that the tourist who goes abroad, at least within the euro area, will immediately know about this facility because when he draws cash out of the wall he will see on the slip what the charges are.
He can think back to what has happened domestically and thus will immediately know whether the law is respected or not.
Secondly, the banks are under an obligation to inform customers not only about the rates which they charge on transferring money or obtaining money through cash dispensers abroad, but also to advise all their customers if there is a change in the rate.
One of the other stipulations of this regulation is transparency.
Because there is transparency, customers will know what they are asked to pay and they will be able to compare that with what other banks charge.
It is hoped that in this way, competition will see to it that the lowest charges possible are being charged to the customer.
I hope this answer satisfies Mr Crowley.
I hope he is happy with the situation which I am sure he has wanted to see for many months.
Mr President, out of purely general interest, I would like to ask the Commission if Mr Crowley's question had anything to do with the timing of the regulation becoming effective or if it was just coincidence.
You will certainly understand that this is, in a certain way, a matter of interest to Members.
At the same time I would like to say how glad I am that the matter has been settled.
I am not sure whether I understood the question, but I believe that the honourable Member wants me to say whether the question by Mr Crowley was organised by the Commission today so that the whole thing could be explained again publicly in Parliament.
I can assure the honourable Member that the Commission is very adroit and active in organising sufficient support for what it does, but in this case, it was a purely fortuitous occasion.
Mr Crowley and I have not met all that often.
I do not know his telephone number.
I am sure he does not need any prompting from any Commissioner to ask in Parliament what he wishes to know.
This regulation on the charges for cash withdrawals was passed extremely quickly by both the Council and Parliament.
I can recall no other instance where a regulation was approved and adopted so quickly.
That is because the public has wanted this sort of regulation for many years.
Mrs Korhola made a point of insisting on that.
Fortunately the Commission is now able to assure Members of Parliament that as far as cash withdrawals are concerned, the situation is as Parliament wishes.
Next year there is the possibility that the same sort of thing will apply to transfers of money other than by cash dispensers.
Question No 57 by Bernd Posselt (H-0513/02):
Subject: Agreement concluded with the Czech Republic concerning traditional recipes
Reports continue to appear in the Czech media that 'Utopenec' (an extremely popular sausage speciality which consists of a sausage pickled in a glass jar with vinegar, paprika and onions, consumed slice by slice, and which is also available in restaurants, where it is kept in an airtight glass jar) and the traditional method of distillation used in the making of the famous Moravian plum brandy 'Slivovitz' would have to be prohibited in the event of Czech accession to the EU.
Has the EU already concluded agreements with the Czech Republic with a view to saving these traditional recipes, or what stage have the negotiations reached?
Part I
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the following to say in response to Mr Posselt's question: the Commission is not aware of any application from the Czech Republic for an exemption from the acquis communautaire on EC food laws for Utopenec sausages.
The Commission therefore assumes that the method of manufacturing and distributing Utopenec complies with the Community's food safety laws or at least will do so at the time of accession.
Nor did the Czech Republic make any specific application to register Utopenec as a traditional or local product during the course of negotiations, although it did so for other products.
However, the Czech Republic has notified us of its intention to make further applications for registration once it has acceded.
As far as Slivovitz is concerned, the manufacturing method used for it does not comply with the Community definition of fruit spirits set out in Article 1(4) of Regulation No 1576, because ethyl alcohol, i.e. industrial alcohol is added to Slivovitz.
According to the regulation, a spirit drink to which ethyl alcohol is added loses the right to use the generic name fruit spirit in any form in its presentation.
The Community therefore takes the view that Czech Slivovitz cannot be granted a permanent derogation from the definition for fruit spirits.
The Czechs could continue to use the name Slivovitz for these spirits, but they would either have to label them as spirits or change the manufacturing process so that they comply with the rules for fruit spirits.
Thank you, Commissioner, for such a precise reply.
This issue is very important in Czech domestic politics and the eurosceptics are making a real song and dance about it.
Thank you for clarifying the situation as regards Slivovitz, although I must say that I think Moravian Slivovitz is one of the best there is.
As far as Utopenec is concerned, I shall investigate the matter.
I should just like to point out to you that this is obviously a hygiene issue.
I would be most grateful if you could look into this and, when you have a moment, let me know what specialities have been included in applications for derogations.
Mr President, my dear sir, I should be glad to comply with your final request and let you have a list of products for which applications for derogations have been made; that is a perfectly straightforward matter.
As to your second question on whether all the food standards are complied with during the manufacture of the sausage, the Czechs do of course still have time to make changes before they accede and, as they have not notified this as a matter for negotiation, they will have to do so.
For the rest, I am most obliged to you for raising this question here, because the fact of the matter is that eurosceptics in the Czech Republic keep spreading these false reports in the international press and there is absolutely no foundation for them.
Question No 58 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0496/02):
Subject: Steel tariffs and jobs in Europe
The USA has decided to introduce 30% tariffs on steel produced outside that country in order to protect domestic production.
The EU has responded by imposing tariffs on US products.
Has the Commission assessed what impact the US tariffs will have on jobs in the steel industry in Europe?
If so, does the Commission also have specific statistics per country from which it is possible to assess the impact of the fall in production on the individual Member States in the EU?
In response to the protectionist measures taken by the United States, the European Union has put in place a three-pronged strategy, whose aim is to enforce respect for our rights within the multilateral trading system.
The first point is to bring action before the WTO seeking condemnation of the American measures; the second point is to adopt a European safeguard designed to maintain access to the European market whilst protecting it from trade flows which, without access to the US market, would stream back to the European market; the third point is to demand compensation from the United States for the losses suffered by European exporters as a result of the American measures, which is in line with our understanding of the WTO texts on safeguard clauses.
We have not yet imposed additional customs duties on American products, but we now have a Council regulation that was adopted on 13 June 2002 and which gives the Union the option of suspending tariff charges, to use the appropriate language of the WTO, on certain American products, as of the 18 June 2002.
Our main objective is to obtain, in the short term, an exclusion and/or compensation package, which may mean further time will need to be spent at the negotiating table, and we shall, as agreed with the Council, report back before 19 July on the progress made on this issue.
In the light of this report and our recommendations, a decision may or may not be taken to impose additional duties on a limited number of American products, to a value of approximately EUR 400 million.
This regulation will impose increases in custom duties on a trade amount equivalent to the loss incurred, in other words for a much greater amount, of more than EUR 2 billion, if the United States do not withdraw their measures after they have been condemned by the WTO, which means towards the middle of 2003.
The question is; what is the impact of the American measures on employment?
An assessment of the impact of the American measures on employment in the steel manufacturing industry in Europe is both difficult and premature.
Difficult because the American measures only have a limited life span and because, following the increase in steel prices in the United States and elsewhere, European steel companies tend to delay their reaction to events for several months and continue, therefore, to employ workers whom they have trained and who are competent and productive.
Premature because the impact will depend on the level of exemptions that we obtain from the American Administration and also on the openings that European steel industries find in other markets for products that are banned from sale in the United States.
This being the case, it is clear that European steel companies that must pay these customs duties - which can increase prices by up to 30% - are at a huge disadvantage compared to companies that do not have to pay them.
At this stage, therefore, we cannot give any more statistics.
We do not have any specific statistics on the impact of the American measures in each Member State, since this is managed at Union level and since our partners in dialogue are the steel companies, most of which are now based in several European countries.
Paradoxically, it is in the United States where the impact on employment risks being acute, particularly in the sectors of the American economy that use steel and which will probably be the most affected in the short term, due to their inability to pass price increases onto their own customers or due to the fact that such a situation will lead these customers to look to other continents.
I would like to thank Commissioner Lamy for his reply.
I can understand that it may be good negotiating tactics not to be too precipitous in assessing the number of jobs, the amount of export income and the export volume we are losing.
Will the Commissioner consider at a later stage, when it becomes necessary, producing some form of statistical background?
Many ordinary citizens wonder about the future consequences.
I am thinking in part about people in a number of places in my own country, Sweden, e.g. BorlÃ€nge in Dalarna, which has a large steelworks.
Do you believe that this will be a long-term conflict with the US, or are you hopeful that the countermeasures currently planned by the European Union will lead to the Americans coming to their senses?
Our aim, Mr SacrÃ©deus, is to avoid there being a 'later', by that I mean that the Americans withdraw these measures as soon as possible, in other words, before they are condemned by the WTO - which would obviously be the best solution, but quite unlikely, to be honest - or when they are condemned by the WTO, which should happen, we estimate, towards the middle of next year.
Therefore, this is a 'later' which is not 'very late', and that is our main aim.
In the meantime, we wish to make use of all our rights within the WTO to put pressure on the United States so that, as I said, we can obtain compensation and/or exemptions, so that the impact on our steel industries - as and when the Americans grant exemptions, which are, in fact, derogations to the tariff increases in aid of our exporters - is as positive as possible.
A number of exemption packages have already been announced, more are expected and we must continue to exert the necessary pressure.
We shall use the measures that the WTO allows us to take in view of our interests and the fact that the United States will ultimately have to comply with international rules.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. First may I thank Commissioner Lamy for his strategy on this issue.
One the one hand, consistently enforcing our rights at WTO level is, I think, an essential starting point.
On the other, at the end of the day, the lack of competition for steel products on the American market is pushing prices up and causing quality problems, which in turn means that European industry has a better chance of selling processed products from the European Union.
Do the statistics already show that European products are now being sold much more successfully on the American market?
Mr RÃŒbig, the answer to your question is yes.
The protectionist measures taken by the US have caused a significant price increase in the American market.
Elsewhere, including in Europe, prices are currently suffering a short-term decline.
The price difference between the American market and the European market has increased.
To take the example of hot-rolled steel, the price in Europe is approximately EUR 250 per tonne compared with EUR 400 per tonne in the United States.
The difference is therefore considerable.
This difference can be compared to a safety net, created by the American protectionist measures, which leads to a more comfortable situation for American manufacturers in terms of their prices, profitability and finances.
We are told that they are supposed to make use of this safety net for restructuring.
The question is to know whether, in the very short time that the WTO is allowing them and that we are allowing them, there is a realistic chance that the American industry will restructure and tackle the problems relating to their competitiveness that lie at the root of their problems.
We have not yet received an answer to this question, but my personal prediction is unfortunately not optimistic.
The second point is I think that we are trying to protect the Union's interests and to ensure compliance with international trade rules.
If all the members of the WTO decided to use the safeguard clause in generating the interpretation that the Americans are currently using, there would undoubtedly be chaos in a number of world markets.
I would like to reassure Mr RÃŒbig, so that he knows that when the Council of Ministers and Parliament are united in support of the negotiator, the negotiator's task is made much easier.
The Wall Street Journal came to the conclusion that the shift by Mr Bush to declare these steel tariffs in March, followed by his agricultural subsidies and his protectionism on timber with Canada, was the turning-point from being a free-trade regime to a protectionist, America-first regime.
Would you think this is the case or are your friend, Mr Zoellick, and Mr Bush still genuinely free trade?
Mr Purvis is forcing me to comment on press articles, which is always extremely dangerous, but let us say that, once again, I am not entirely in agreement with what is written in the Wall Street Journal.
This has happened before and it will certainly happen again.
At this stage, I believe that it would be excessive to describe the measures that the Americans have taken as a turning point in their trade policy.
At least that is what we were told, when we met with them, both by Mr Bush at the European Union summit, and Mr Zoellick, with whom I speak on a regular basis.
I personally feel that the measures were primarily taken as a result of election fever - which I hope will pass - rather than a complete change of direction.
In fact, the outcome, Mr Purvis, will be determined in a few weeks' time when the last word will be spoken on the issue of Fast Track legislation, which is now called Trade Promotion Authority.
When Congress, namely the Senate and the House, decides to grant the American Administration the authority to negotiate both multilaterally and bilaterally, we will see, essentially, whether American policy continues to practice trade liberalism, which has, admittedly, occasionally deviated from the accepted path, as usual, to protect United States' interests, or if, on the other hand, we shall again experience much more testing times, in which case our own options will certainly be reviewed very carefully.
Question No 59 by Margrietus J. van den Berg (H-0508/02):
Subject: The TRIPS Agreement and access to medicines
Would the Commission outline the progress which has been made at the WTO towards meeting the Doha commitment to ensure that the TRIPS agreement does not obstruct affordable access to medicines in countries with little or no domestic manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical industry?
Would the Commission confirm that the EU will press for a solution which ensures access to medicines for WTO member countries on terms equivalent to those set out in the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and medicines?
Does the Commission accept that an agreement to allow production for export under Article 30 of TRIPS most clearly meets the spirit of the Doha Agreement, by locating any decision on compulsory licensing only in the country of consumption?
The question is concerned with intellectual property rights and access to medicines.
You know that the Doha Declaration on intellectual property rights and public health instructs the WTO Council for TRIPS to find an expeditious solution to the problems facing WTO member countries whose production capacity in the pharmaceuticals sector is insufficient or non-existent or who are experiencing difficulties in the effective use of compulsory licensing.
These poor countries have neither sufficient flexibility nor the capacity to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies located in the countries which are able to issue a compulsory licence.
It is therefore perfectly possible that they will encounter more difficulties than other countries in benefiting from any sizeable reductions in the prices of essential medicines.
We, for our part, believe that an expeditious solution is a solution that would enable the situation within the WTO to be resolved before the end of the year.
The WTO Council for TRIPS has held several meetings recently.
In March, the Union submitted a communication proposing two courses of action.
The first of these is based on the interpretation of Article 30 of the intellectual property agreement and the other is based on an amendment to Article 31.
We were the only WTO member to propose a written document adopting a clear position.
Other Members made oral proposals and four options were put forward: either to interpret Article 30, to amend Article 31, to declare a moratorium on the settling of disputes or, finally, to make provision for a system of derogations.
A further meeting of the Council for TRIPS took place last week and at that meeting we submitted a new document, based on our reflections and on our examination of proposals from various quarters, suggesting an amendment to Article 31.
We propose that a new paragraph be added to that article, establishing a clearly defined exception to the restriction laid down by Article 31 in the area of the granting of export licences for pharmaceutical products manufactured under compulsory licence.
We believe that, as things stand at present, Article 30, which is an alternative, only authorises overly limited exceptions to the rights attached to exclusive licences, and that the solution we envisaged at Doha goes further than the limits laid down by Article 30.
Moreover, we must take into account the positions of our partners, and propose a solution that we think will ultimately be acceptable to most of the members of the WTO.
With this in mind, an amendment to Article 31 would have better prospects than a clarification of Article 30, in so far as no member of the WTO has ruled out the possibility of amending Article 31, whereas some members, and not the least important ones, are firmly opposed to any clarification of Article 30.
The developing countries in question, which are our main concern, have indicated that they would be willing to look at the amendment to Article 31 that we have proposed.
In fact, we believe that adding a provision to this agreement on intellectual property would provide a clear, legally reliable and permanent solution that would not disrupt the current regulatory framework, i.e. that of Article 31.
This agreement, reworded in the way we are proposing, would clearly specify that a country that is unable to produce a medicine may ask another country to grant it a licence for export purposes.
This proposal seems to us to be the most simple and, ultimately, the most likely to resolve the problem raised in the Doha Declaration which has forced us to seek a solution to this issue.
That is our position.
Other views are being expressed in Geneva and we shall continue, in the spirit in which we have acted so far, to try to find a solution that will reconcile the major principles of intellectual property, on the one hand, with the possibility, on the other, of enabling the poorest countries to have access to the medicines which are absolutely essential to them.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for his answer.
In my view, Parliament has fought with him a successful battle towards a breakthrough in Doha on this score.
He rejects a waiver, a moratorium or an exemption by way of solution, and we share his view on this.
Regarding Articles 30 and 31, he states that he intends to obtain support so that what we set out to do there can actually be achieved.
Needless to say, we are aware in this House of the pressure of the United States and also of a number of Member States.
The pharmaceutical industry is probably behind this.
What is now up for discussion is whether it is possible, if use is made of Article 31 - and you are aware that we are now awaiting the legal opinion which we have requested as Parliament - to assume that the country that at some stage asks to import a licence from a different country, is allowed to take this decision regarding its own health situation at its own discretion.
Indeed, many legal experts claim that, where Article 31 is concerned, this decision is no longer in the hands of the country in question but is to be taken at WTO level.
We would like to have certainty in this area.
In principle, Mr van den Berg, I admit that the way in which you present the problem is correct.
As I have already pointed out, we have to reconcile the major principles of intellectual property with the ability of those countries which do not have a pharmaceuticals industry to obtain supplies of generic medicines by means of imports.
We do not think that the derogation is a good idea, because it is only a temporary solution which, as it were, merely patches up the problem in the hope that better days will come.
I do not believe that this is a good way of reconciling, in the eyes of the public, these two imperatives which we have to obey.
We favour Article 31 over Article 30.
In the case of Article 31, the problem of determining whether the country requesting imports of generic medicines is experiencing an emergency situation is not a question that must automatically be referred to the WTO.
Together, we can formulate a restrictive definition, as we did in the case of Article 6 at Doha, of what constitutes a national emergency.
I would remind the House that, in the cases to which Article 31 applies, the country which wants to import medicines will have to ask either a developed country that has the production capability and which holds a compulsory licence, or another developing country.
If the latter solution is chosen, the developing country which will be responsible for supplying the generic medicines in question will, by necessity, benefit from doing so.
I believe, therefore, that, from this point of view, there is no risk of the system being too restricted, which is, I believe, what is worrying you.
On the contrary, I believe that it is precisely by making use of Article 30 that we would multiply the imperatives involved, which would make access to the medicines more difficult.
Question No 60 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0469/02):
Subject: Visit of delegation from Commission environment directorate to Greece
A delegation from the Commission's environment directorate recently visited Greece for the second time within a period of three months to investigate the circumstances surrounding complaints against that country.
What were the findings of the investigation into the complaints?
What was the Commission delegation's assessment of the infringements of Community environment law in Greece?
In particular, did the Greek authorities notify the Commission's delegation of the measures they have taken to comply with the Court of Justice ruling concerning Greece's failure to protect the Caretta caretta turtle?
In the context of meetings between the Commission and national authorities in order to examine the application of European Community law in Member States - the so-called package meetings - a delegation from the Commission Environment Directorate-General visited Greece in May this year.
The main objective of the meeting was to debate on issues related to atmospheric pollution.
In particular the Commission inquired about measures adopted by the Greek authorities to transpose and implement Directive 96/61, the so-called IPPC, and reviewed technical issues related to infringements and complaints concerning bad application of Directive 84/360, concerning combating air pollution from industrial plants.
In addition, the Greek authorities provided updated information on several other infringements, including the caretta caretta case - the loggerhead sea turtle.
The Greek authorities have promised to submit to the Commission detailed replied for all those cases.
The information contained in those replies will be assessed with a view to checking whether Greece has respected its obligations under European Community environmental legislation.
In particular regarding the measures to comply with the Court's judgment concerning failure to establish and implement an effective system of strict protection of the caretta caretta sea turtle, the Greek authorities have described the system of protection which contains the legislative and concrete protection measures.
The written notification to the Commission is under way.
Commissioner, you said, did you not, if I understood you correctly, that you have not yet evaluated the answers given to you in Greece?
None of them?
I should like in particular to take the example which you too referred to of the caretta caretta.
I do not know what you have been given in writing, but dozens of testimonies and on site inspections, including by me personally and by environmental organisations, have now proven that what is down in writing is not being applied. And never has.
Be that as it may, will you be evaluating the answers given to you?
We have not yet received the replies, the notifications, from Greece.
We expect the notification on the caretta caretta case in July.
For the rest of the issues raised in this so-called "package meeting", we expect the replies before the end of this year.
We will have a chance to assess them as soon as we have received them and then come back on these issues.
Question No 61 by Nuala Ahern (H-0482/02):
Subject: Tritium measured off the Welsh coast
What assessment has the Commission made of the report by the United Kingdom National Radiological Protection Board, issued in May 2002, on the levels of radioactive tritium measured in the sea off the west coast of Wales and the Bristol Channel; and has measurement of tritium releases from Member State countries been part of the Commission's Marina II radio-ecological study?
Thank you for your answer Commissioner. I take it, and I would like an expression of concern from you, that nuclear regulators have miscalculated the health risks from one of the world's most widespread nuclear pollutants.
Adults are twice as likely as previously thought to develop cancer after being exposed to tritium and this particular tritium was discharged by a factory.
However, the discharge of Tritium from the BNFL Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria and Chapelcross Nuclear Power Station, to mention only one discharge, is extremely large - millions of litres of tritiated water and air every year.
In fact the dose could be 12 times more dangerous for children according to the recent study.
I think this is a major cause for concern, since the regulators have miscalculated.
I am glad that you say that it will be referred to in the Marina II study.
But as these facts have only recently come to light, it seems unlikely that the study can look very closely at the issue and I would like an assurance from you that it will be seriously followed up.
There is always reason for concern when we see changes and an increase of discharges into our waters.
We also assume that the UK authorities will look at this seriously.
I understand that they have initiated research on the problem and will look at the reasons for the increase in the doses.
It is also an issue for the Commission in the sense that EU legislation does not provide for maximum permitted levels of tritium in foodstuffs.
Together with the International Commission on Radiological Protection and with a group of experts set up under the terms of Article 31, the Commission is currently discussing the possibility of fixing maximum permitted levels of tritium in foodstuffs.
That is an important piece of information for you and of course the Marina II study will also have to look into this issue.
We take it seriously, we will continue our discussions and we will definitely follow up.
It is an obligation for us to follow these cases very closely and to make sure that we act accordingly.
Question No 62 by Carlos Bautista Ojeda (H-0471/02):
Subject: 'PescaÃ­to Frito'
Does the Commission know whether Fisheries Commissioner Franz Fischler knows what 'pescaÃ­to frito' (fried fish typical of Andalucia) is?
Does the Commission know where the 'pescaÃ­to' which most of the citizens of southern Europe currently consume comes from?
Does it have proof as to which fleets are now catching the 'pescaÃ­to' which is eaten every day in Andalucia?
Does it have proof of the level of commitment to the environment and preservation of stocks displayed by the third countries which are now catching our 'pescaÃ­to'?
Is the Commission aware of the fact that the fleets which caught 'pescaÃ­to frito' until a few years ago were the only fleets which respected the biological rest periods, and are now the only fleets lying in the breakers' yards?
If so, why this insistence on turning the same screw ever tighter with its Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which by means of commercial agreements of whatever kind, favours and encourages these third states which do not respect biological rest periods nor stocks, and which moreover allow enormous commercial industrial fleets, some of them belonging to European shipowners, to catch the 'pescaÃ­to frito' which we eat?
Does the Commission not believe that in reality, its CFP proposals, hiding behind a false sustainability criterion, are actually seeking to wipe out the in-shore fishing fleet, the only one which generates employment and respects the environment and replace it with an industrial fleet with a far greater fishing potential, which does not respect stocks?
Mr President, honourable Members, in reply to the honourable Member's question, may I assure you that I not only know what 'pescaÃ­to frito' is, I have also eaten this dish in Spain on several occasions, and I also know that 'pescaÃ­to frito' is often prepared using fish which are below the minimum size prescribed in Community law.
The fish used for this dish are caught both in third countries and by the European fleet.
However, the same minimum sizes apply both to fish landed from the Community and to imported fish and it the responsibility of the Member State's authorities to monitor this in both cases.
I should like to point out here that we concluded, following numerous inspections in Spain, that Spanish monitoring leaves a great deal to be desired because large quantities of undersized fish are reaching the markets.
We therefore drew the logical conclusions and instituted infringement proceedings against Spain.
The Commission is also aware that this fish used to be fished by the Spanish fleet under the Morocco agreement.
As you know, we have been unable to renew this agreement, but the Community has recognised its responsibility and has agreed on measures for the benefit of the ships and crews affected.
Finally, may I point out that we also make a clear commitment to responsible, sustainable fisheries in non-Community waters in our proposed reform of the common fisheries policy.
We want to use our fisheries agreements to help third countries manage stocks in a sustainable manner.
And that of course precludes catching and selling juvenile fish.
In reply to your final question, I must reply quite categorically that our reform proposals do not seek in any way whatsoever to wipe out part of the Community fleet.
There is nothing in our proposals which gives cause to believe that industrial fleets are being given preference over small in-shore fisheries.
We recommend reducing fishing efforts, by which I mean the number of days at sea, wherever necessary, i.e. where stocks are endangered.
Each Member State can then decide how these days at sea are to be divided between ships, and hence between larger and smaller ships, on the basis of social and economic considerations.
Commissioner, with all due respect, the phrase I used, "pescaÃ­to frito", is a colloquial phrase that we use in Andalusia to describe fresh fish that is caught and eaten daily, fried in top-quality oil, as you know.
The truth is that the combination of the failed negotiations with Morocco and the CFP proposals with a view to sustainability, which also concerns us, is going to mean that small-scale fishing will almost entirely disappear.
My question, Commissioner, would be, given this concern for sustainability, would you accept my invitation and that of my Group to visit Andalusian fishing ports, to come fishing with us for a couple of days, to see the problems of sustainability, the social and economic problems and the alternatives?
I think this is very important if your position is to be credible and it would be fundamental with regard to the citizens and all the criteria that we, who defend fishing, also want to incorporate.
We are worried about the fishing-grounds - we know they are depleted - but, as you are well aware, we are leaving the sea in the hands of industrial fleets, who are the ones that do not respect biological rest periods, and whose nets we cannot monitor, as we do with small-scale fishermen.
I respectfully repeat our invitation, Mr Fischler.
Mr President, my dear sir, thank you very much for your invitation to visit you in Andalusia.
I love that part of Spain, as you know.
We must make the necessary arrangements, although basically I am, of course, prepared to visit Andalusia in the same way as I travel to numerous other coastal regions in the Community.
But back to the subject in hand. I understand your concern about small-scale fisheries and it is true that these smaller ships tend to be at a competitive disadvantage compared with large ships.
When we decided on the fisheries reform proposals in the Commission, we also said that we were prepared to discuss continuing help for these small in-shore fishing fleets in particular with the Member States, and of course with Parliament, during Council negotiations.
We take exactly the same view here.
I too feel that we must do everything we can to sustain these small in-shore fishing fleets.
Mr President, I too should like to voice my concern and ask the Commissioner a question.
I am an amateur fisherman and I have noticed, as I think most people have that, in the Mediterranean in particular, there are no controls on fisheries by large trawlers whose nets literally fleece the seabed, destroying flora as well as fish spawn and eggs and wiping out all forms of life.
What I want to know is if anyone is actually taking an interest in whether the fish they catch are large or small.
Mind you, the size of the fish is no longer an issue; all the fauna on the seabed are being wiped out.
And I should like to know, because I often see these vessels literally laying waste to the seabed, in Greece at least, if they are allowed to do so and if there are any plans to take measures to halt this wastage.
Mr President, honourable Members, my dear sir, the question of how to guarantee sustainable fisheries in the Mediterranean is, without doubt, a very important one.
May I reiterate that you will see in the proposals which we have submitted that we plan to table a separate communication to Parliament and the Council dealing solely with an action plan especially for the Mediterranean.
It deals with far more than the question of the industry or the large ships which also fish in parts of the Mediterranean.
The problem here, unfortunately, is that we have far fewer scientific data on the Mediterranean than we do in comparison, for example, with the north-east Atlantic and there is no institution which compares with the ICES for the north-east Atlantic.
So the first problem is how or where we can obtain the data needed to make reasonable management decisions.
The second problem in the Mediterranean, as you quite rightly said, is that the Mediterranean is fished both by Community ships and by those of other countries bordering it.
In the Aegean, as we all know, there are repeated problems with one of Greece's neighbours.
We also need to see if we can introduce and involve third countries in regional management in this area.
And finally, we then need to look into the specific social and socio-economic aspects of Mediterranean fisheries.
But one thing is clear: compared with the Atlantic, the proportion of small ships is several times bigger in the Mediterranean and most fishing is done by these small ships, not big ones.
Question No 63 by John Joseph McCartin (H-0474/02):
Subject: Introduction of new fishing capacity through Irish fleet
Can the Commission comment on the accuracy of newspaper reports that a new fishing vessel, the 'Atlantic Dawn' (144 metres long and with the greatest fishing capacity in the world), has been incorporated into the Irish fishing fleet register and is being permitted to fish for Irish quota?
Can the Commission explain whether existing tonnage to match the capacity of this newly-introduced vessel is being taken out or has been decommissioned, and has the European Commission discontinued its legal proceedings against the Irish Government on the grounds that the introduction of this much fishing capacity was in violation of the Common Fisheries Policy?
Mr President, honourable Members, the Atlantic Dawn is duly entered on the official Irish fishing fleet register and has therefore also been entered on the Community fleet register.
However, the activities of this fishing vessel are a matter for the Irish Government, not the Commission.
The Member States are required to comply with the targets for fishing capacity and fishing effort set for them in the multiannual guidance programme.
As long as these values are not exceeded, the Member States can deploy their registered ships as and how they choose.
The Atlantic Dawn is entitled to fish in European waters under the Irish quotas.
As far as MGP targets are concerned, Ireland has already exceeded capacity targets in its pelagical segment, which is why the Commission instituted infringement proceedings against it.
Ireland then reduced its capacities in this segment and notified the Commission that it would withdraw further fishing capacity by the end of this month in order to attain the target.
We shall see if it in fact does so during the course of this month and shall monitor these developments very closely.
While in many ways we welcome the progress that the introduction of this particular vessel brings and we welcome modern technology, in a situation where fishermen cannot find sufficient stocks in order to justify the capacity that was already there, it seems strange to introduce a new vessel which may be licensed and accepted and which could catch half or perhaps two-thirds of the entire Irish quota.
My understanding is that the European Commission initiated proceedings against the Irish Government with respect to this vessel and that these proceedings have now been withdrawn.
Could the Commission explain what has changed and why it does not see any illegality at the moment, whereas a year ago it seemed that the Irish Government was in breach of the common fisheries policy regulations by allowing this vessel to fish in Community waters?
Mr President, may I briefly reiterate exactly what is at issue here.
The fact is that the Irish Government applied for this ship, which is a very big ship, one of the biggest ships there is, to be included in the fleet register, but it took some time at the beginning for Ireland to comply with the terms of registration.
According to the notifications received by the Commission, these terms were met or the Irish Government stated that it would meet them.
It then turned out that MGP targets were being exceeded in the pelagical segment.
At which point we instituted proceedings.
The Irish Government then notified us during the course of these proceedings that it was making further capacity reductions so as to ensure that it did not exceed overall capacity in this segment in the future.
If it does so, we no longer have any grounds on which to institute proceedings.
But, at the end of the day, this is a decision for the Irish Government.
If the Irish Government feels that it is better from its point of view to allocate the corresponding quotas to this huge ship, and hence smaller quotas to smaller ships, there is nothing we can do about it.
We have no legal authority to do so.
On a point of order, Mrs Jackson's question No 67 should have been taken with this.
Perhaps if Mrs Jackson comes in there will be time for her to ask a supplementary because the two are on the same issue.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether Mr McHugh, the owner of the Atlantic Dawn, has applied to use the EU-Mauritanian fisheries agreement?
The Atlantic Dawn and the Veronica are landing in Las Palmas.
Since the Veronica is now a flag-of-convenience vessel, what is the Commission doing to stop the Veronica from offloading in Las Palmas?
When you mention the reduction of capacity in the Irish fleet, you are overlooking the fact that the Veronica is the reduction and that it has now gone to a flag-of-convenience country where it can fish without any controls whatsoever.
I thought the Commission was going to come down hard on this whole issue.
Quite frankly, you have not answered the question by Mr McCartin in relation to the fact that you have taken legal action against Ireland on two counts, one of which concerned the registration of this vessel.
It was registered as a merchant marine vessel and then given a fishing licence.
The Irish Government was wrong and now Mr McHugh has found ways to get around the Commission to basically facilitate himself.
As far as I can see, the registration problem still stands because it is now in the fleet but it was irregular to begin with.
Mrs McKenna, I am indeed aware that Question No 67 is similar to Question No 63, but the Commission communicated it to us as a separate question and it has been accepted.
In any event, Mrs Jackson is also going to ask a supplementary question and I think that will be the last answer to this question.
Question No 67 by Caroline F. Jackson (H-0505/02):
Subject: The 'Atlantic Dawn' and the Mauritanian fishery
Can the Commission confirm that the Irish vessel 'Atlantic Dawn', based in Las Palmas, is currently fishing in Mauritanian waters under the EU fishing agreement, or private agreement, with that country, having got round the rules for the size of trawlers by registering not as a trawler but as a merchant ship?
If so, what is the Commission doing about it, since it cannot pass all the responsibility for this to the Mauritanian authorities?
Mr President, as you quite rightly said, the question which the honourable Member just asked is in fact identical to the question raised by Mrs Jackson.
I am quite prepared to answer these questions jointly now.
Perhaps I should do so straight away.
The fact is that a size restriction of 9 500 GRT was introduced for the pelagical segment in the agreement with Mauritania, thereby preventing the Atlantic Dawn from fishing under the Mauritania agreement.
However, that has nothing to do with flags of convenience. The Atlantic Dawn then made private arrangements and is fishing in Mauritanian waters under a private licence.
The owner of the Atlantic Dawn obtained this licence directly from the Mauritanian Government and it is therefore beyond our control.
We can only monitor the part covered by the agreement.
Any agreements over and above that which the Mauritanian Government concludes with other countries or private individuals are beyond our control.
In order to clear up any misunderstanding on the question of infringement proceedings, I said that Ireland is outside the MGP targets for the pelagical segment.
Which is why these proceedings have not been withdrawn.
But the Atlantic Dawn has been properly registered, which is why proceedings against the Atlantic Dawn have been suspended.
The Atlantic Dawn seems to be something of a mystery ship, operating off the coast of Ireland, Mauritania or wherever.
I have a very simple question for the Commission.
Was the Atlantic Dawn built with the aid of money which originated in the European Union budget, going to Ireland to help with this, or not?
If so, how much money?
Commissioner, you may reply now or after the next question, if you need further inspiration.
Mr President, I do not need five minutes for such straightforward questions.
The fact is that the Atlantic Dawn was not subsidised by the Community and no Community money is therefore involved.
However, I should point out that this is not something which only applies to an Irish ship.
Dutch ships, for example, are fishing in Moroccan waters under private licences and here again we have no authority to intervene.
We have to abide by national laws here.
We cannot go marching into Mauritania or Morocco because they have granted a private ship a licence.
Question No 64 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0476/02):
Subject: Fishery resources in Community waters and the Danish fleet's catches for fish meal
Denmark enjoys a privileged position as far as its fishing rights in Community waters are concerned, with a maximum allowable catch equal to that of France and Spain together.
A large part of Denmark's fishing rights concern catches used for fish meal.
Commissioner Franz Fischler says that this meal is used for aquaculture, and has no influence on resources and species caught for direct human consumption.
What quantitative data exist on the total or partial use of this fish meal in aquaculture?
What objective data is there to prove that these catches for industrial use do not affect the state of fishery resources for human consumption?
Mr President, the use of fish meal and fish oil in aquaculture has increased considerably over recent years, mainly because aquaculture per se has increased considerably.
According to figures from the international association of fish meal and fish oil manufacturers, 10% of fish meal and 16% of fish oil were used in aquaculture in 1990.
By 2000, these figures had risen to 35% for fish meal and 60% for fish oil and we may safely assume that this growth will continue.
Danish landings processed into fish meal and fish oil total between 1 and 1.5 million tonnes of fish a year.
The main species are sandeel at 60%, sprats at around 20%, Norway pout at around 6% and blue whiting, again at around 6%.
All these stocks are managed with TACs and quotas based on scientific reports from the ICES.
The ICES evaluates the state of the most important commercially exploited fish stocks every year. These evaluations show that by-catches of table fish by industrial fisheries are now very small and that, as a result, there is little effect on the development of stocks of table fish.
Before 1996, industrial fisheries in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat were still taking by-catches of herring, whiting and haddock.
In 1996, the Community introduced by-catch rules and a comprehensive monitoring and control system and, since then, by-catches really have fallen massively and no longer present any risk to table fish.
The working party within the ICES on the repercussions of fishing on ecosystems has also evaluated the indirect impact of the large quantities caught by industrial fisheries on the marine food chain and has found no evidence that catches of species used industrially limit the productivity of table fish stocks.
As far as fisheries of blue whiting are concerned, the ICES has warned that there may be fairly large by-catches of juveniles of the same species.
We have therefore already written to the ICES asking for scientific advice on how these by-catches can be avoided in future.
Mr President, Commissioner, I really must confess, before asking my question, that the figures I gave for Denmark's catches in comparison with those of Spain and France were wrong: I did not mean to say Spain and France together, but six times more than Spain and six times more than France.
Denmark has, according to what is known as the principle of relative stability, 44% of the fishing rights in Community waters, whereas the sum of France and Spain's fishing rights add up to only 13%.
I find the figures supplied by Commissioner Franz Fischler extremely confusing and I hope that the working group studying the impact on resources for human consumption finishes its work before the reform of the common fisheries policy is implemented.
In any event, my question is the following: some countries in the European Union are clearly given preferential treatment at the moment when it comes to catches and I ask you whether any reform of the CFP is possible without implementing the principle of relative stability, which is so anti-European?
What political reasons exist for maintaining it, as stated in the Green Paper and as stated now in the reform of the common fisheries policy?
Mr President, my dear sir, the assertion that Denmark fishes six times as much as Spain and France together sounds more like rumour-mongering to me, but there is little point, I think, in our hurling figures at each other.
I suggest we proceed as follows: we shall send you data on the extent and specific quantities of industrial fisheries in writing.
Then you will have it all down in black and white.
I think that is the easiest thing to do.
The question you touched on in connection with relative stability is an altogether different matter.
There are basically two issues here: first the continuation of the twelve- or six-mile zone and, secondly, relative stability in relation to the allocation of TACs and quotas.
As you well know, until now there has been a special provision, which is a throwback to the accession treaties of Spain and Portugal and which expires at the end of this year, and please believe me when I say that, once this provision expires, everyone - including Spain and Portugal - will be subject to the same laws and therefore the same principles when it comes to setting TACs and quotas and the same principles will apply to access to fishing-grounds.
We shall be making the arrangements, we shall be taking care of this and the first time it will affect you will be when the TACs and quotas are set at the end of this year for the coming year.
I would like to ask the Commissioner something very simple, which might have more to do with the questions asked earlier. I am rather late in asking my supplementary question.
Commissioner, do you consider to be fair the situation that you and other Members have just described - in which huge ships from the Member States are fishing in the very fishing-grounds in which the Community fleet is trying to conserve stocks - or do you believe that this is a situation we should be able to avoid, for example through a series of measures that we are now going to implement over the remaining months of debates to reform the common fisheries policy?
Do you consider it acceptable that, in the fishing-grounds abandoned by the Community fleet, or in those with very high Community requirements to conserve stocks, large ships should be putting such great pressure on stocks even if they are not receiving any Community funds?
That is my question.
Mr President, my dear Madam, I would be delighted to discuss this issue because the Commission takes the overall view that there is no sense in using large sums of Community money to buy new ships and that it would be better to use the money so that poor, small fishermen facing serious economic difficulties have more of a chance in the future.
This is one of the basic concepts of our proposed reform and I am sure we shall have plenty of opportunity to discuss it.
Question No 65 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0497/02):
Subject: Tobacco cultivation
How many women workers are employed in tobacco cultivation in the EU?
How many young farmers are engaged in this activity?
Mr President, my answer to this is as follows: of course the Commission knows how many farms grow tobacco in the European Union.
There are around 100 000 tobacco farms.
As for the distribution of workers in the tobacco sector according to the criteria mentioned by the honourable Member, in other words, how many of these are young farmers and how many are women, unfortunately we have no statistics on this and there are no figures I can quote in answer to your question.
Mr President, with regard to the continued production of tobacco in Granada, I would like to know if the accession of Poland, a producer country, or trade with Zimbabwe, could lead to a reduction in the quantity of tobacco grown in the province of Granada.
The first part of the Commissioner's response, with regard to women, is highly unsatisfactory.
I can provide you with the number of women working in the tobacco sector in Granada, but it is surprising that, when the level of cultivation in Europe is so high, you, as European Commissioner for this sector, do not know the number of women - which is what I was asking you - or the number of young farmers.
In any case, I would ask you to answer my supplementary question, as it comes from the tobacco growers of Granada themselves, who are concerned because it is rumoured there that the accession of Poland and trade with Zimbabwe will be detrimental to them.
It remains to be seen whether you can allay their fears.
Mr President, my dear Madam, I too am sorry that I am unable to give you any information on the number of women working in tobacco cultivation, believe me.
But, unfortunately, the Statistics Office does not have the figures needed to differentiate between male and female workers.
Perhaps we could take the initiative of approaching the Statistics Office and suggesting that these data be broken down by gender in future.
On your other question: I fail to see why the accession of Poland to the European Union should cause any particular problems for tobacco cultivation per se in the European Union.
The problem we shall face within the European Union in the future will basically be determined by the fact that there is a Parliament initiative to stop subsidising tobacco cultivation.
I can see that this may be a problem, because it will obviously have social consequences on the farmers in question.
But the accession of Poland to the Community will have little effect on cultivation.
There is one other important point you should bear in mind here and that is that different types of tobacco are cultivated which do not compete directly with each other.
Given that we are currently reforming the CFP, given that farmers are being encouraged to commit themselves to multifunctionality, that the rural economy is to be protected through diversification, and given that the important role played by women in this diversification was recognised, for example, at the meeting of the Agriculture Council of 27 May 2002, I would like to ask the Commissioner if he believes that perhaps the Commission should hold a similar discussion with regard to the reform of the common fisheries policy, because - as I have said many times - the number of women active in this sector is tremendous.
Furthermore, those who are not directly involved play a secondary role at their husbands' side - which is even more serious, as their work is invisible and they do not receive any social or economic recognition.
I should like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission has prepared any documents or actions in this regard.
Mr President, my dear Madam, I quite agree that jobs done by women are very important in the fisheries sector, and not just in processing.
A great many women work in the processing industry and in the canning industry, but they are also playing an increasing part in fishing itself.
It is well worth considering special measures for women here, especially in connection with fisheries structural policy and the future of fisheries structural policy, which is all about setting subsidies, just as we have done in rural development policy.
I would rather not promise any separate document here and now, but I shall consider the matter, give it due attention and notify you of whatever action we propose.
As the time allocated to Question Time to the Commission has elapsed, and given that Question No 67 was answered together with Question No 63, Question No 66 and Questions Nos 68 to 86 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele have submitted a detailed report which should clearly help to improve information and transparency and freedom of choice for European consumers.
Priority is given to human and animal health.
But the most important criterion must be that this framework legislation is practicable.
More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe with excessive red tape.
We need, first and foremost, a practicable regulation on the accidental and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in products which are not genetically modified.
The threshold value of 1% in the Commission proposal is reasonable and realistic and a useful guide for manufacturers and consumers.
The threshold value is important if various forms of cultivation are to exist side by side because cross-pollination, for example, is technically impossible to preclude in nature.
The second important point is that only products which are scientifically proven to contain GMOs should be labelled; it makes no sense to label ingredients extracted from genetically modified plants, such as oil, sugar or flavour enhancers, when there are no GMOs in the final product.
Nor should we label meat, eggs or milk from animals fed with GM feed at any point, because this is misleading for consumers.
I am in favour of product-based labelling and expressly opposed to process-based labelling because it is technically impossible to control.
We should only label where we have proof and can therefore control labelling requirements.
Madam President, I am slightly confused; I had five minutes' speaking time at the beginning and obviously said a great deal.
Now I would just be repeating myself. The position on my side is clear and, as it is already late, I shall forego the two minutes' speaking time.
Madam President, Commissioners, the reports by Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele belong together and a great deal has already been said about that in today's debate.
Most people in Europe are against the use of modern biotechnology outside the laboratory, but there are varying shades of opinion.
Surveys have shown that most people feel they have too little information to make a clear judgment.
Around 86% of those surveyed in the European Union said that they would like to know more before eating genetically modified food.
Researchers concluded from their results that there is a market for genetically modified food in Europe, provided it offers clear advantages.
However, consumer freedom of choice is paramount.
Consumers want to be able to decide freely between GM products and conventional products.
We have debated the new labelling directives most intensively today.
As far as I can see, we should only label products where we have proof and can control labelling requirements.
If the presence of genetically engineered changes in the product itself cannot be proven, as in the case of meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on genetically modified feed, then I think there should be no labelling requirement.
And another very important point for me: I do not like the idea of incalculable liability risks for companies, which is why practicable limit values are essential.
I would therefore advocate a single limit value of 1%.
The Commission points out in its working paper that zero tolerance is impossible in practice; several of my fellow Members have repeatedly addressed the imponderables of nature and I have nothing new to add to what they have already said.
Madam President, of course, we are absolutely in favour of the adoption of rules guaranteeing a high level of consumer and environmental protection and safety, but we are also in favour of measures being implemented with certainty and transparency, and one of these measures is clearly labelling, which we feel must be accompanied by a control system based on scientific verification.

I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for the enormous amount of work they have done on an extremely difficult, complex subject, but I have to say that there are elements of the two reports which give some cause for concern, such as, for example, the arbitrary lowering of the tolerance threshold for the adventitious presence of genetically modified materials, previously set at 1%, to 0.5%. We feel that this complicates the authorisation procedure unnecessarily without providing greater security or other benefits for the consumer.
Then another point which gives cause for concern is the lack of adequate measures in respect of the accidental presence of traces of genetically modified products.
I would like to say something about the concept of 'adventitious presence', a concept which is used to indicate the unintended presence of small quantities of a specific atypical material in another material.
Well then, in the field of agriculture - and here, as always, agriculture is a sector requiring special consideration - the adventitious presence of traces of other varieties in crops, plants or propagation materials can occur at any stage of sowing, harvesting, transport or distribution.
In some cases, this adventitious presence could even be the result of an exchange of pollen between crop varieties in adjoining fields.
Amendment No 9 in the proposal places farmers operating according to normal farming practice in real difficulties.
It is important to avoid thresholds which do not take the concrete facts into account.
Madam President, Commissioners, congratulations, first, to both members of the Commission.
I think you have delivered a very ambitious paper and a good basis for discussion with Parliament.
But just think: if all your proposals are accepted, 70-80% of all foods already on the market would have to be labelled. So we could say, in the words of our great pioneering Socialist thinker Mr Bowe, alright, perhaps it would have been a brighter idea to turn the whole thing on its head and only label positively?
My congratulations to Mr Bowe on his superb and frank speech.
What we are giving consumers to believe, of course, is that, when they finally find something among the rows and rows of labelled products which does not have a GMO label, these remaining products are completely clean.
But consumers do not know that and perhaps they should not know that.
They will have a hard time of it in any case, because things are about to get worse.
One per cent? It might still have something in it.
We are already in a Dutch auction: 0.5%, 0.1% for Mrs Gebhardt.
Why not 0.01%?
Our resident scientist Mr Trakatellis says that, in a few years' time, we shall have proof for everything.
In the end we shall reach a point where 99% of all food is labelled.
And what is the poor consumer supposed to do?
What is the consumer supposed to make of all this?
It is a pretty poor show on our part to say to the consumer that this 1% does not need to be labelled, unless the company has acted maliciously and did not label intentionally or cannot submit the evidence.
What does the consumer care about that?
Does it make it healthier or less healthy for the consumer if the company can or cannot submit the evidence?
The whole thing is a farce!
It is such a comedy that I really do understand when consumers - and I too am a consumer - wonder what the politicians will dream up next.
My dear Commissioners, my confidence in you knows no bounds.
The Commission proposed in the White Paper on food safety on 12 January 2000 that it would submit a regulation on labelling GM-free food and that would be a wonderful, rounded addition to your proposal.
Luckily the Liberals have included it in a proposed amendment.
We in Austria have taken this wonderful Austrian way forward.
I am not suggesting that you proceed Ã  l'autrichienne, Commissioner, although you are always more than welcome to come walking in the Austrian mountains with us.
But there is still time between now and the second reading to take the proper way forward and include positive labelling.
Then, my dear Commissioners, we will be very definitely satisfied with your proposal.
I have every confidence in you.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if genetically modified organisms were dangerous, they would have to be banned straight away.
We are all agreed on that and we would do so at once.
Today's debate is about labelling, about traceability; consumer information is the ultimate objective, together with freedom of choice, and we are all in favour of that.
Consumers must be able to decide what they put on the table for themselves and for that we need labelling.
A whole series of genetically modified organisms has already been evaluated by scientific committees in the European Union. They found that these substances pose no threat to health or the environment.
Nonetheless, information is important in the food sector and will, we think, help make the use of genetic engineering more widely accepted.
Under the Commission proposal, GMOs will be labelled above a limit value of 1%.
Following an amendment adopted in committee, which the European People's Party and the European Democrats voted against, this threshold will now be reduced to 0.5%.
All our demands must be made with one eye on the practicability and implementation of the regulations.
This also raises the question of whether accidental contamination can be avoided completely.
Experience has shown that zero tolerance can almost never be guaranteed.
And there is a real problem, to repeat what the honourable Member just said, with the requirement to label all meat products, eggs and milk from animals fed on GMOs or feed containing GMOs.
If the end product contains no DNA or genetically modified protein, there is no point in attaching a GMO label to it.
At the end of the day, we can only label what is actually there.
Is there a farmer who puts his animals out to pasture who can guarantee that they have not ingested wind-borne GMOs?
This, together with the minuscule amounts in feed, would mean that, in the end, all meat would have to carry a GMO label.
And that would be an untenable situation both for Europe's farmers and for consumers.
For consumers because they would have to process meaningless information and for farmers because, technically, it is a non-starter.
It is also unacceptable because, at the end of the day, we cannot hold farmers responsible for introducing and spreading GMOs.
Madam President, honourable Members, I would first like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele, but I would also like to extend my thanks for a lively and interesting debate.
The proposals we are discussing today are linked to many important and general issues.
The public is very concerned over the handling of genetically modified organisms.
It is our responsibility as legislators to ensure that consumers' health and safety are guaranteed and that the environment and biodiversity are protected.
In addition, we must ensure that our citizens have the opportunity to choose for themselves what they want to consume on the basis of reliable information.
Therefore, the marketing of genetically modified products must be regulated in a way which allows us to achieve a high level of safety, control and reliability.
Directive 2001/18/EC, the EU Novel Food Regulation and the proposal on genetically modified food and feed have all been developed on the basis of these requirements.
Authorisation to place genetically modified products on the market must therefore, in accordance with this legislation and in accordance with the precautionary principle, provide a high level of protection for public health and the environment.
The EU system includes the requirement for a comprehensive risk assessment before placing on the market.
Traceability makes it easier to implement measures after a product has been placed on the market, for example in terms of monitoring the product or recalling it.
It also makes it easier to supply correct information to all the players in the whole production and distribution chain.
This proposal states that genetically modified products are to be monitored at all the stages of placing on the market.
It also dictates that products containing genetically modified organisms must be labelled at all the stages of placing on the market.
The ultimate aim is for such information to provide consumers and the general public with the opportunity to make their own choices.
We believe these measures are an important step on the road to re-establishing consumer and public confidence.
The proposal lays down a number of unequivocal responsibilities for operators, without this leading to unnecessary or unreasonable burdens being placed on operators or supervisory authorities.
A number of important issues have been addressed in the amendments put forward by the European Parliament, including the scope of the proposal.
The issue of whether products manufactured from animals fed on genetically modified feed are to be covered by the proposal will be addressed in more detail by my colleague, Mr Byrne.
However, I would like to state that the Commission considered this issue very carefully in conjunction with drawing up the proposal.
After many discussions and consultations, we decided that it would be impossible to implement and would not be in keeping with current Community law.
Therefore, the Commission cannot support amendments of this nature.
There are also a number of amendments aimed at restricting the Commission's proposal.
These amendments restrict the traceability requirements to products demonstrably containing DNA and proteins.
This would allow relevant labelling of products which have been produced from genetically modified organisms but which no longer contain modified DNA or protein.
However, this approach involves a number of restrictions highlighted in the course of our preparatory work.
The most important objection is that it would not ensure consumers' ability to make an informed choice.
As such, the Commission cannot accept these amendments.
With regard to the purpose, it is important to remember that although traceability makes it easier to implement any necessary safety measures, it cannot be considered a safety measure in itself.
Therefore, the precautionary principle may be applied to legislation concerning authorisation based on risk assessment, but not to the implementation of a traceability system within the framework of this proposal.
The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 2 and 6 which link the precautionary principle to the proposal.
I would also like to point out that traceability is not a tool for dealing with the issue of co-existence.
In the communication on a European strategy for life sciences and biotechnology adopted in January of this year, the Commission undertook to address the issue of co-existence between organic, conventional and genetically modified crops.
This proposal only deals with the issue of traceability and labelling for genetically modified organisms.
Such traceability and labelling cannot function as an instrument for dealing with co-existence, as this issue requires decisions regarding agricultural production systems.
Therefore, the Commission cannot accept the amendments concerning this issue - Amendment No 27 in its entirety and Amendment No 3 in part.
There are further amendments regarding the traceability requirements.
With regard to the information to be forwarded to guarantee traceability, it is important to remember that the purpose of traceability for genetically modified organisms is different to that for products manufactured from genetically modified organisms.
It is important to be able to identify genetically modified organisms which are to be deliberately planted out in the environment for cultivation, as such products contain viable genetically modified organisms which may multiply and spread.
The proposal therefore requires operators to be able to state exactly which genetically modified organisms are present in the products, as well as to forward this information to the operator receiving the products.
The potential risks to the environment from products containing genetically modified organisms intended for direct use in food, feed or processing are, however, limited, as these organisms will not be cultivated.
Therefore, the Commission believes it to be both appropriate and sufficient that products containing genetically modified organisms for food, feed or processing, including in bulk shipments, should be accompanied by documentation stating the fact, along with a list of the unique codes for the genetically modified organisms which may conceivably be included in the product or the shipment.
These provisions on the supply of information agree with the provisions on transboundary movement in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.
The Commission believes that we should not go further than the provisions in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in order to be able to guarantee harmonised and cohesive procedures in trade with third countries.
The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 16 and 41 which require operators to state exactly which genetically modified organisms are contained in a shipment by stating their unique codes.
The Commission also believes that the period for which there should be a requirement to keep information and documentation for the purposes of traceability should be limited to five years.
There are no practical reasons for extending this period from five to ten years.
This would lead to unnecessary extra burdens on operators.
The Commission cannot therefore accept the changes aimed at extending this time period to ten years, i.e. Amendments Nos 17 and 22.
The Commission agrees with the European Parliament that the provisions in this proposal are in line with those in Directive 2001/18/EC and do not limit them in any way.
In this context, it is necessary to repeal Article 4.6 of the directive stating that the Member States shall take measures to ensure traceability at all stages of the placing on the market of GMOs.
If Article 4.6 is not repealed, it is clear that national measures could run in parallel to the measures covered by the proposal, which would disturb the internal market and lead to legal uncertainty.
Therefore, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 28 and 33, as they retain the traceability requirements in the directive.
In the same way, the Commission rejects Amendment No 32, which entails new authorisations being forbidden until unique codes are allocated to genetically modified organisms in line with this proposal.
The current Community framework for authorisation already includes a number of conditions for authorising genetically modified organisms and genetically modified food, such as the condition that they must not have damaging effects on public health or the environment.
If the existing authorisation criteria are expanded to include the unique codes, as proposed, an element of uncertainty would arise regarding how Community law should be implemented, something which the Commission cannot accept.
Finally, I would like to say a few words on unintentional occurrence and threshold values.
One important issue is the unintentional but technically unavoidable occurrence of genetically modified material in conventional products.
Genetically modified crops are currently being grown on over 50 million hectares of land around the world.
This means that genetically modified material unintentionally and unavoidably occurs in imported products, particularly bulk shipments of grain for food, feed and processing.
This is now a practically unavoidable fact.
A continued freeze on authorisation in the EU would simply exacerbate the situation, as we would see traces of an increased number of non-EU authorised genetically modified organisms.
Community law already contains regulations concerning the labelling of threshold values for unintentional occurrence.
Consequently, it is logical for unintentional occurrence, under specific circumstances, to be exempt from the regulations on labelling and tracing in this proposal too.
Setting threshold values is a multifaceted task, and the Commission believes that the most effective solution is to be achieved with a sector-based initiative.
Therefore, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 45 and 56, which propose that the competence for establishing threshold values for food, feed or processing be transferred from the proposal concerning food and feed products.
I repeat that the Commission fully supports the principle of establishing threshold values for unintentional occurrence, as proposed in a number of amendments.
However, the proposal to include an article establishing such threshold values is, however, more relevant to the proposal concerning genetically modified food and feed.
Madam President, in order to make matters easier, I have collated the Commission's detailed positions concerning all amendments.
This summary will accompany the Verbatim Report of Proceedings.
May I first express my thanks for all the work that has taken place in the different committees in relation to this proposal for a regulation on GM food and feed and also to thank the rapporteurs for their hard work - also the Commission staff in both DGs, who have worked hard over the last couple of years to bring forward this proposal.
The issues raised under this banner are complex and sensitive, and often give rise to strong emotional reactions and divided opinions.
The vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy frequently resulted in amendments being rejected or adopted by a very low margin.
This highlights the difficulty of the subject - but also, in my opinion, serves to show that the Commission proposal strikes a good, sensible and balanced compromise between the differing views.
I do not intend to address each and every amendment, but instead would like to focus on four major issues.
The first is the scope of the proposal.
Amendments propose to extend the scope of the proposal to processing aids and animal products from animals fed on GM feed and also to restrict the scope of the proposal to products derived from GMOs which contain detectable modified DNA or protein.
In drawing up the proposal, the Commission carefully considered which products should be included within its scope.
We decided only to include products that are produced from a GMO.
Processing aids are not covered by the Novel Food Regulation, as these are not considered to be food ingredients.
That is also the reason why, in respect of Community law, processing aids do not have to be labelled on the final product.
For consistency reasons the Commission believes it would be inappropriate to require authorisation and labelling of GM processing aids, without having the same requirements for conventional processing aids.
For the first time the Commission proposal specifically covers GM feed.
However, to extend its scope to products such as milk, eggs and meat from animals fed on GM feed would radically depart from existing food legislation concerning animal products.
The Commission does not believe that including products from animals fed on GM feed in the scope of the regulation is either feasible or practicable.
The Commission therefore firmly rejects amendments to that effect.
Allow me now to address the amendments, tabled last week, that aim to restrict the scope of the proposal, both in respect of authorisation and in respect of labelling.
The Commission proposes to expand the current labelling requirements, and to require the mandatory labelling of food, food ingredients and feed produced from a GMO, even when modified DNA or protein is not present - that is, not detectable in the food, feed, or in the ingredient.
The classic example is table oil directly derived from GM maize, GM soya beans, or GM rapeseed.
Through the refinement process, all transgenic material has been removed.
The question therefore arises - should it be labelled as GM or not?
Safety is not the issue here. This is dealt with in the authorisation process.
Labelling serves the purpose of informing consumers and users and allowing them to exercise choice.
What is abundantly clear to me is that the GM origin of products is something that really matters to a large number of consumers.
We also know that many of the Member States want the mandatory labelling of GM derivatives.
A number of them have clearly indicated that they would not support the authorisation of new GMOs if labelling and traceability of GM derivatives was not required.
Those who argue against mandatory labelling of all GM derivatives, irrespective of the presence of modified DNA or protein, take the view that control of this obligation is unworkable and that it would lead to massive fraud.
Let me state very clearly that I cannot accept this argument.
I cannot accept that legal requirements are not enforceable if compliance cannot be checked through analytical methods.
The reality is that a great number of regulatory requirements and legal rights, from mandatory labelling of the geographic origin of products to intellectual property rights, are enforced without any recourse to physical checks.
None of the practical difficulties predicted in connection with GM labelling has proven insurmountable in these contexts.
Indeed, the very requirement that we are discussing today is already in effect in many parts of the Community, albeit imposed by companies within the food chain rather than through Community legislation.
I have yet to meet a business operator who would admit that he or she does not know the origin of the ingredients he or she is using.
There is a good reason for this. Admitting that you do not know whether your input is GM or not is also admitting, by the same token, that you do not know whether or not you are perhaps using a non-authorised GM.
It is probably for this very reason that those who oppose the mandatory labelling of products not containing modified DNA or protein also propose to exempt these products from authorisation.
This, I am afraid, would be totally unacceptable to the Commission.
It would turn the clock back more than five years, before the adoption of the Novel Foods Regulation, at the very time that international consensus is emerging, particularly in Codex Alimentarius, that all foods produced from GMOs should be subject to a pre-marketing approval process.
The message to our consumers would be unacceptable.
Currently, the message is: 'Sorry, we cannot tell you whether this table oil is GM or not?.
If these amendments were adopted, we would have to add: '...and, sorry again, if it is GM, we cannot tell you whether the GM from which it is originating was authorised or not?.
Finally, I would like to address the issue of GMO-free labelling.
You have already understood that the Commission cannot accept GMO-free or non-GM as an alternative to the mandatory labelling of GM-derivatives.
However, I do not believe that the amendment that has been tabled to the proposed regulation in relation to a voluntary GM regime is appropriate.
But let us look at this again at second reading.
I also take up the point that the public will be misled by the proposal that we are putting forward in suggesting that there should be a GMO-free regime.
There is an overwhelming risk that the public would be misled by a GMO-free labelling regime because of the fact that such guarantees cannot be given to the public and to try to do so by a mandatory labelling regime, supported by the law of the Community, would, in my view, run the risk of bringing the law into disrepute.
Therefore, having put this objective into the White Paper on food safety two years ago, we thought long and hard about this.
I have to say to you, Mrs Flemming, that having considered this, we came to the conclusion that this was not the way forward, for the reasons I have identified.
That is why we have come forward with this particular proposal.
Concerning environmental risk assessment, a series of amendments challenge the suggestion that the European Food Safety Authority should carry out the environmental risk assessment as part of the overall assessment of a GM food or feed.
In fact, these amendments would effectively deny the proposed regulation the status of sectoral legislation within the meaning of Directive 2001/18.
Mrs Doyle asked earlier why we bring forward two pieces of legislation and add to the confusion.
The piece of legislation that Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m is in charge of is a horizontal piece of legislation as is Directive 2001/18.
In Directive 2001/18 it was envisaged that there would be sectoral legislation, brought forward in due course.
That is the piece of legislation that I am promoting - the food and feed legislation.
It was a requirement that this House voted on in 2001/18, calling for sectoral legislation. That is what the Commission is doing.
That has been the objective from the beginning.
That is what Parliament has already voted for.
The Commission considers that these requirements are fully provided for by the proposed GM food and feed regulation.
Equally, it would also deny the application of the 'one door, one key? principle.
This would result in the need for companies to file more than one application for the same GMO even though the applications would contain much of the same information.
In my view, the "one door, one key" proposal is fundamental and a huge advantage not only to the applicants but also to consumers.
The Commission cannot therefore accept the amendments requiring the environmental risk assessment for GMOs covered by the food and feed proposal to be carried out only under Directive 2001/18.
A number of amendments have been put forward with the intention of strengthening the information requirements of the proposal.
The Commission would be prepared to accept some of the amendments to increase further the level of public availability of information, but I do not consider it appropriate or reasonable to try to amend general comitology rules through this instrument.
It is also important that we do not forget the intellectual property rights of companies.
In this regard I would draw attention to Article 31 of the proposal which, in my opinion, provides the right balance between protecting such legitimate rights and the interests of transparency.
A number of amendments suggest that very small trace amounts of unauthorised GMOs and GM material should not be accepted in food or feed.
It would simply not be feasible or practicable if the proposals did not provide for any tolerance - under certain conditions - for small traces of food and feed of GMOs or GM material.
Indeed, even when an operator makes an effort to avoid using GMOs or GM material, traces may be technically unavoidable during cultivation, harvest, transport and processing.
I have said it before and I will say it again. Whether we like it or not, this has become a reality.
We have to live in the real world.
This is not just a problem that is exclusive to GMOs.
In the production of food, feed and seed, it is practically impossible to achieve end products that are 100% pure and totally free from foreign substances.
In the EU, the Scientific Committees have already assessed a number of GMOs and concluded that they do not pose a risk to the environment or to human health.
However, some of these GMOs have been awaiting final approval for some time.
I therefore consider it sensible that the proposal allows for these GMOs and GM material, which have been found safe in terms of a complete positive risk assessment from the EU Scientific Committee, to be present in food or feed up to a maximum of 1%.
This is provided that the GM presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable.
It was suggested earlier by Mr Lannoye that we were allowing for the presence of up to 1% of unauthorised GM material.
That is not correct.
We must make a clear distinction between unauthorised GM material for which an application has never been made and GM material for which an application has been made, a scientific assessment has been made by the Scientific Committee, a risk assessment has been positive in favour of that application, but no authorisation has yet been granted because of the existence of the moratorium.
They are two different situations.
It is the latter type, for which we are allowing the presence of up to 1%, not the former.
It is an important distinction that I would like Parliament to take note of.
Other amendments suggest that a maximum labelling threshold for adventitious presence of authorised GM material should be established at one half of one percent (0.5%).
I believe that we should follow the principle established in Directive 2001/18, which provides for thresholds to be fixed in comitology procedure in order to take into account technological and scientific progress.
I believe that is the right way to go about this because the response can be made more quickly in the comitology or secondary legislation procedure, rather than putting this into a piece of legislation as has been suggested in the amendment.
If we ever need to amend, we will have to do so by the normal procedures that we are used to, which may very well take more than a year or two to do.
I repeat that the Commission considers that the two proposals together strike a good and balanced compromise between the differing views.
Furthermore, I firmly believe that they also provide the right approach to foster public confidence and social acceptance of the application of biotechnology in agri-food production.
I hope that Parliament understands the reasoning behind the decision to reject or to accept in part only some of the amendments put forward.
A full list of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament.
I do not propose to read them out one by one, but I trust that this will be included in the Minutes of this sitting
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0234/2002) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a programme of Community action in the field of public health (2003-2008) [PE-CONS 3627/2002 - 5-0204/2002 - 2000/0119(COD)].
Madam President, today's debate is on the joint draft decision adopting the programme of Community action in the field of public health from 2003 to 2008, as unanimously approved on 8 May by the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee with the Council.
This draft is the happy outcome of long-term efforts which started two years ago and I must say that it was most constructive, both from the point of view of cooperation between the three institutions and as regards the final format of the programme itself.
The adoption of the programme of Community action in the field of public health is the first integrated endeavour by the European Union in the field of public health protection.
Public health protection is currently one of the main concerns of the citizens of the Union.
Health has to take priority over political or economic compromises. ?he programme to replace sectoral and fragmentary Community action on health with an integrated programme on 1 January 2003 is based mainly on preventing disease and helping to establish quality standards in the public health sector.
This programme builds on the existing eight programmes and on the work of the network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community and seeks to pursue a more integrated and global health strategy.
The three general objectives are: first, improving information and knowledge for the development of public health, secondly, reacting rapidly and in a coordinated manner to health threats and, thirdly, health promotion and disease prevention by tackling health determinants in all political activities.
These determinants, which are lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol, nutrition and major socio-economic and environmental factors are, together with genetic factors, the main causes of disease. ?he programme, which will complement national policies, aims to achieve a high level of physical and mental health and well-being, as well as greater equality on health issues throughout the Community.
I should like at this point to summarise briefly the work done in the Conciliation Committee, which basically improves on the text and the Council's common position.
The budget of EUR 312 million is substantially higher than the 280 million proposed by the Council and even the EUR 300 million proposed by the European Commission.
This increase will cover the ambitious objectives of the programme and the requirements of a number of additional projects.
This is a remarkable achievement because, according to Parliament's records, it is only the second time since codecision began that the engagement finally agreed has been higher than that proposed by the European Commission.
In addition, a Commission declaration on article 7 - related to the funding - foresees that the financial framework will be reviewed in the context both of the accession of new Member States and preparations for the revision of the financial perspective.
In order to ensure the effective implementation and coordination of the programme, a second Commission declaration was made on the structural arrangements, to ensure the programme will function better.
Finally, most of the European Parliament's amendments, 37 of the 50 proposed at second reading, were accepted by the Council, either in full or in a reworked form, and are included in the joint draft.
They relate to dealing with health threats from natural, chemical and biological sources, emergency situations, vaccination and immunisation strategies, mental health and resistance to antibiotics, all of which are very real public health problems.
I believe that reinforcing the foundations of the European structure requires convergence not just at economic policy level but in individual sectors such as health.
It is possible to achieve new convergences which widen European integration while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity and I think that the new programme marks the start of this sort of process in the vitally important health sector.
I should like to close by thanking all the members of the delegation who helped bring about a satisfactory outcome at conciliation, the Commission and Commissioner Byrne personally and the Spanish Presidency for working constructively with the European Parliament delegation in a bid to reach an agreement which will allow this programme to be put into practice quickly.
I therefore recommend that the European Parliament approve the text of the programme so that this very important and pioneering programme can get started.
Mr President, first of all let me congratulate my friend, the rapporteur Professor Trakatellis, on his excellent work.
Remarkably he actually succeeded at conciliation in increasing the funding allowed beyond the initial proposals of the Commission to EUR 380 million over five years, which contrasts with the initial Council proposal of only EUR 280 million.
EU action in public health is still in the minds of some controversial, as not only is there a risk of duplication with the World Health Organisation's European activities, but also potentially a conflict with the fact that delivery and funding of health provision is exclusively the competence of the Member States.
If EU initiatives highlight best practice or stimulate demand for expensive treatments or disease prevention measures, then this may cause budgetary problems for Member States.
Nevertheless, the focus on lifestyle changes as health determinants, with a focus particularly on information dissemination on smoking, excess alcohol consumption, nutrition and exercise, go a long way to reducing this risk.
The hypocrisy of the EU, which still subsidises the tobacco growers to the tune of about EUR 1 billion per year, needs urgent reform.
Some claim that the amounts involved at EU level, compared to national health expenditures, are so tiny that it is arguable whether we can achieve anything meaningful at EU level.
Nevertheless, in spite of what I have said, I engaged constructively at the first reading, along with a number of my colleagues in the Conservative Party, in highlighting the issue of mental health as a priority need and the need to set up formal structures which will coordinate the disparate funded activities and bring together the whole programme at the centre with direction and leadership.
The need to develop consensus statements on best practice is important and it is vital to engage the candidate countries who are often so far behind in this area.
Lastly, a rapid reaction system to respond to impending health threats, as we have seen with the dioxin scandal in Belgium or the BSE crisis, is highly appropriate.
It is the sort of thing which will bring the EU closer to the peoples of Europe who probably care much more about health policy than almost anything else on the political agenda.
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are in the final stage of approving an ambitious public health programme.
This programme has three objectives: improving information and knowledge, reacting rapidly to health threats and tackling health determinants through health promotion and disease prevention.
Obviously, if these objectives are to be achieved, we need to create a mechanism which guarantees permanent surveillance and coordination, which enhances efficiency and which provides information to the Member States on best practices and the overall evaluation of the programme.
I think that, on this point, we have achieved a compromise which guarantees that the programme will be implemented properly, in line with the approach taken by Parliament in its amendments.
Another important point concerns the European Parliament's proposals on tackling emergency situations, including acts of terrorism, and a satisfactory compromise has been reached with the Council on this point.
However, I should like to comment on the budget for the programme.
I think that, if we want to respond to the needs and objectives of this particular programme, we need to ensure that it has the necessary resources.
The European Parliament proposed the sum of EUR 380 million and I think the Council should have accepted this, given that much of this money has already been spent on programmes already running until the end of 2002.
Similarly, the new programme will apply not just to the fifteen Member States, but to the ten new Member States as well.
Finally, biological terrorism was added to the original objectives after the events of 11 September.
The final sum of EUR 312 may be more than the sum proposed by the Commission or the Council, but it does not satisfy me.
However, I do welcome the fact that the Commissioner responsible, Mr Byrne, has promised to review the financial framework once the new Member States have acceded.
This had a catalytic effect on the final vote during the conciliation procedure.
And finally, may I thank the rapporteur for his overall cooperation and his efforts in helping to bring about a good compromise.
On behalf of the Liberal Group, I should also like to express our satisfaction.
The result obtained at the conciliation stage, and I must emphasise this, would not have been possible without the perseverance of Professor Trakatellis, or without the constructive cooperation between the delegation of our Parliament, the Spanish Presidency and the staff of Commissioner Byrne.
Despite the bitter negotiations concerned, essentially, with budgetary aspects, the three institutions wanted, above all, to send a joint message to the citizens of Europe.
Health is now one of our main priorities, and we should be proud of this, because it was essential that Europe should, as it were 'look after its health' and should at last put in place a comprehensive and integrated strategy on this subject.
The lack of food safety, and the increase in the consumption of alcohol and tobacco, particularly among young people, mean that we need, more than ever before, this type of coordinated action at Community level in order to prevent diseases.
As for the resurgence of scourges such as Aids or tuberculosis, or the emergence - as has been mentioned - of acts of bio-terrorism, they have made it necessary for the Union to have this rapid reaction capacity.
So many reasons and concerns justify an appropriate budget for the next six years. The verdict has been given: EUR 312 million will be paid out, in addition to a Commission declaration making provision for a review of the financial framework in the light of enlargement and the new financial perspective.
Admittedly this is less than the EUR 380 million that we were hoping for, but nevertheless it is much more than the EUR 280 million initially granted by the Council.
We can therefore say that this compromise is a victory for our Parliament and that, in this House, political will, rather than budgetary dogmatism, has won the day.
Madam President, I, like other Members, would like to thank Mr Trakatellis for his perseverance.
As pointed out in the final document, the World Health Organisation states that the five main causes of illness are neuro-psychiatric disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, accidental injuries and respiratory diseases, which eventually become more and more serious because of resistance to antibiotics.
We believed that the eight previous programmes endeavoured to prevent some of these diseases - and contributed to doing so - but we think that the aim of this action programme - which will begin immediately - is not only to supplement national policies, but also to approach the three objectives laid down in the document itself from a global perspective. These objectives are improving information and knowledge, reacting rapidly to health threats and health promotion and disease prevention.
We believe that this will contribute to reducing inequality and assessing the impact of social, environmental and economic factors on health.
We think that society, non-governmental organisations and trade unions, as the document clearly states, need to be involved if this plan is to be successful.
Madam President, I am very grateful to Parliament for its efforts in developing with us and with the Council this ambitious new programme.
Throughout the course of the codecision process, you have put in an enormous amount of work - by analysing the various issues and by putting forward new ideas and approaches.
There is no doubt that as a result the programme has been significantly strengthened and that it will provide a firm basis for the development of the Community's health strategy, including new areas of work, such as developing a vaccination strategy and responding to the threat of bio-terrorism.
Your efforts have further reinforced the three objectives that the Commission set out from the very beginning in its proposal.
These are: improving health information; responding rapidly to health threats; and tackling the determinants of health.
These three areas of action respond to the priorities and concerns of European citizens, and will enable the programme to be of direct relevance to them.
Thanks to your perseverance, and not least to the personal contributions of Professor Trakatellis and of Vice-President Imbeni, a realistic agreement was reached in the conciliation procedure.
From my standpoint, the outcome strikes a fair and workable balance between the extent of the activities to be undertaken, the measures to be taken to implement the programme - the so-called structural arrangements - and the overall budget for the programme.
I would like to draw attention to the two declarations made by the Commission to help reach an agreement on these issues.
The first one concerns the budget.
It was made to take account of concerns expressed by your delegation about whether the budget of EUR 312 million was adequate for the programme, particularly in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union.
The Commission declared that: 'The financial framework of the programme shall be reviewed in the context both of accession of new Member States and the preparation for the revision of the financial perspective, taking account of the establishment of the structural arrangements, and of developments concerning key priorities - financial proposals will be made, if appropriate?.
We also made a declaration on the implementation of the programme.
This underlines our full agreement with Parliament about the need to ensure that this important programme operates as effectively as possible.
In the declaration, we clarified a series of steps we intend to take.
These will involve the early setting up of the programme committee; the appropriate organisation of the Commission's own departments; making use of scientific and technical experts to reinforce our capacity; and pursuing the possibilities of externalisation - notably that of creating an executive agency.
It is now for the Commission to ensure that the programme starts in earnest at the beginning of next year.
We will of course keep you informed of progress in conformity with the applicable rules.
To conclude, let me again thank the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, the Environment Committee, and indeed the whole Parliament for their excellent work on this programme.
I am confident that the final version that has emerged will enable us to make a real contribution to improving the health of European citizens.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0243/2002) by Mr Lisi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances [COM(2001) 624 - C5-0668/2001 - 2001/0257(COD)].
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic accidents which have recently affected the chemical industry and, above all, the people living in the vicinity of the sites and the environment, could not escape the European Union's notice.
Baia Mare, AznalcÃ³llar and, in particular, Toulouse and Enschede, have become synonymous with human and environmental tragedies to which we have a responsibility to provide a clear response.
It is against this sensitive backdrop that the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal for a directive amending Directive 96/82 of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, better known as the Seveso II Directive.
This proposal is the product of in-depth scientific analysis.
We must therefore acknowledge the Commission's intention to tackle the shortcomings of Directive 96/82 in a constructive spirit, which means that we can now send a clear message to both the chemical industry and the people.
We will do everything possible to ensure that adequate control measures are adopted and observed.
As rapporteur, I have tried to favour a methodological approach based both on the scientific basis of the proposed amendments and an evaluation of the impact that they will have on the European economic system.
It is certainly not an easy matter to introduce or strengthen precautionary rules so it is absolutely essential that we find a fair balance between the need to lay down changes that are sustainable for the chemical industry and the need to send the public a clear message of safety.
The method for identifying the necessary changes is clear: taking the conclusions of the two accidents as a basis to ensure that such accidents are not repeated.
In practice, the proposal modifies two fundamental criteria: the minimum thresholds for the presence of substances in sites and the inclusion or reclassification of new activities or dangerous substances, in order to strengthen controls and reinforce accident prevention.
All this will, of course, increase the number of sites affected by the new directive considerably, but we must not forget that what is at stake here are public safety and environmental protection against substances which could cause irreparable damage.
I will therefore avail myself of this methodology to give you a brief account of the substantial changes proposed by the Commission and the amendments tabled by this House.
The accidents that occurred at Baia Mare in Romania and AznalcÃ³llar in Spain have led the Commission to bring mining operations and landfill sites within the scope of the directive too.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has, at the proposal of the rapporteur, specified the conditions for inclusion of sites and mining operations, specifying that all sites in which preparation or processing of hazardous substances takes place, irrespective of the type of processing, fall within the scope of the Seveso II directive.
Moreover, we have stipulated that this applies solely to plant, mines and quarries which are in operation and not to mere storage areas.
Secondly, the disaster in Enschede has led the Commission to draw up new provisions on explosives.
Despite the various proposals made by Members, the Commission's proposal has been deemed the most suitable for the intended purpose.
Lastly, the accident in Toulouse, which occurred at a time of growing insecurity, has left a lasting impression in the minds of us all.
For technical reasons and because of lack of time, the issue of ammonium nitrate, the substance responsible for the explosion, has not been addressed by the Commission.
With the full support of the Commission, Parliament and the Council are currently endeavouring to fill this gap.
The issue of ammonium nitrate is extremely complex and it has required a great deal of debate to establish the appropriate subdivision and thresholds for the different types of ammonium nitrate to limit the risks of accident to a minimum.
What we have to work out is whether we should adopt the more rigid position at European level as regards thresholds or whether, on the basis of Article 176 of the Treaty, we should allow any States which consider it necessary to adopt additional, more restrictive measures, as, moreover, they are already able to do.
For my part, I am again tabling in plenary an amendment which provides for a higher threshold for the fourth category of ammonium nitrate products, to ensure without a shadow of doubt that agricultural holdings are excluded from the directive's scope.
Then there is one last thing we must do, which I will mention briefly and which we included in our report: we must call upon the Commission to send us a proposal within a reasonable timeframe defining criteria and methodologies to be used for land use planning - another serious problem which has emerged - in other words, deciding where plant should be located.
Lastly, and this is my very last point, I would remind you that the Commission has endeavoured to strengthen provision for public information, which is something I feel will be especially beneficial and, above all, which we have a duty to our fellow citizens to provide.
I would like to end by thanking all my colleagues who have taken part in and contributed to this process and the committee's secretariat.
There is no point in locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.
Unfortunately this is all too true, but we must guard this stable door effectively now.
Seveso and Bhopal are places where serious accidents have taken place.
These accidents have led to measures which have, however, proved insufficient each time.
And each time an enormous tragedy has ensued.
In Enschede, it transpired that current Seveso legislation is inadequate.
A fireworks factory that did not fall within the scope of the directive destroyed an entire housing estate.
The human suffering was enormous, and the grief for the victims remains.
Residents of this estate were unaware of the presence of the fireworks factory.
Authorities were only aware to a very limited extent.
It is therefore obvious that rules need to be tightened up.
On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to call for four amendments.
First of all, the threshold values must be lowered. This applies particularly to ammonium nitrate and pyrotechnic substances.
Secondly, the duty to inform must be improved.
Information should not be kept back on account of industrial secrets or the threat of terrorism.
This is all too ridiculous.
Thirdly, cooperation and coordination in Brussels must be improved, because we need to draw as many lessons as possible from near disasters.
This is possible if we organise this through the European Commission and through Community institutions.
Finally, and this is an important point which Mr Lisi broached as well, we need to be given an accurate definition of a safe distance.
It is evident that dangerous undertakings do not belong in housing estates.
A pro-active policy must be adopted in order to remove such enterprises from these estates, if possible with the help of European funds.
And clarity should finally be reached about what exactly constitutes a safe distance.
The European Commission is to lay down guidelines in this respect.
To tighten up the rules is one thing, but to comply with them quite another.
We could draft as many as rules we like, but if they are not implemented in common practice, then they will ultimately have little effect.
The duty to communicate applies just as much to ourselves, the Commission and national authorities.
Safety is not only a question of rules but indeed also of culture.
It is a public task to promote this safety culture actively.
Where safety is concerned, we should never take the soft option.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Lisi, we are all mindful of the recent industrial disasters which have cast a shadow over Europe.
These accidents have taken place in spite of the legislation currently in force.
We must, therefore, have even stronger requirements and do as much as possible to prevent accidents by concentrating our action on three areas as a matter of priority.
First of all there are the products themselves, then there are the sites, their structure and their geographical location, and finally there are the people, and that means all the employees themselves and also the people living or working close to industrial sites.
As far as the products are concerned - and this has already been mentioned - the Commission has revised the list and the thresholds in order to take into account not only the various accidents which have happened but also developments in scientific data.
However, we believed that it was also necessary to amend the thresholds for ammonium nitrate so as to take into account the accident in Toulouse.
As for the sites, legislation already makes provision for hazard studies.
However, the competent authorities must also be able to request that these studies, which are carried out by the undertaking, be verified by a third party in cases where any doubt exists.
As for the employees, efforts to improve training are needed, because training is the best method of preventing accidents.
Such training must also be targeted at the employees of subcontractors working on site, since the number of subcontractors is increasing.
It is essential to mobilise not only the employees within undertakings but also the people outside, because when there is an accident the people living close to industrial sites are also affected.
It is therefore necessary to involve them in implementing external emergency plans, by allowing representatives of the local population to take part in consultative committees and also to inform the population as a whole about the risks and about what they should do if there is a problem.
One of our objectives is to get citizens to become fully involved in ensuring their own safety.
That does not mean simply making documents available.
That is why information campaigns targeted at the people concerned must be carried out regularly.
Measures to protect neighbouring populations must take into account the difficult coexistence between dangerous installations and residential areas.
Amendments along these lines were adopted by the Committee on the Environment.
The Group of the Greens and my group proposed two amendments requiring the executive committee to develop a methodology for defining safe distances with regard to future businesses and residential areas, but also to take into account other criteria in current evaluations.
We believe that these proposals are essential, but if they are to be given their full potential they must also be accompanied by legal responsibility on the part of the authorities which are responsible for urban affairs.
That is why our group tabled an amendment along these lines.
Too many major accidents have continued to occur since the adoption of the first directive in 1976.
It is now high time that this legislation was applied.
We owe that to all the victims of accidents of this kind.
Like previous speakers, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Lisi, for the quality of his work on a highly technical and particularly sensitive subject for our citizens.
Originally, Seveso III was supposed to be no more than what I would call an improved version of Seveso II.
Following the tragedies of Baia Mare and Enschede, the revision of this directive was chiefly intended to broaden its scope to cover mining activities, and to reduce the thresholds for pyrotechnical substances.
On 21 September last year, the position changed following the catastrophe at the AZF factory in Toulouse, a very cruel reminder of the reality of the situation.
In order to be effective, a law must, above all, be correctly applied. That was obviously not the case in Toulouse.
No hazard study had been carried out in the building in which the explosion occurred. Nor had any reassessment been made - since 1995 - of the ammonium nitrates produced and stored, which is why, without calling into question the excellent provisions regarding risk assessment already laid down in Seveso II, I am in favour of making the obligations to be met by the operator more stringent.
Article 9 is the backbone of this directive.
We therefore need to take action, as it were, 'upstream', so that the safety report is drawn up with the greatest transparency and is updated as soon as any significant change occurs on the industrial site.
On this subject, the Liberal Group welcomes the adoption, at the committee stage, of Amendments Nos 17 to 19.
Turning to the safety report, and, more broadly, to another crucial aspect of this revision, the control of urban sprawl around industrial sites, I see that Member States have methods of calculating hazard limits which are very different, and in some cases contradictory, and that is why we welcome the vote in committee to adopt Amendment No 20, which seeks to implement, eventually, a single European method of calculation.
As a Commission representative said to members of the French Parliament after the Toulouse disaster, a process which seeks to harmonise approaches without harmonising basic philosophies will never succeed.
That is why, and also for the sake of consistency, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is also in favour of Amendment No 55 on this subject.
Also for safety reasons, we believe it is essential, as stipulated in Amendment No 39, to lower the thresholds for the fourth category of ammonium nitrates, those consisting of rejects, similar to the substances that exploded in the warehouse at the AZF factory.
Finally, Madam President, the competent national authorities must ensure compliance with the on-site obligations, which are to be reinforced here, by means of Seveso III.
We must never relax our campaign against the trivialisation of risks in certain industries. That must be our priority, in memory of the 52 victims of Toulouse and Enschede, as well as all the other victims.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as it has been nine months since the disaster at the AZF factory in Toulouse, we could have come to a decision on a new directive which we could have called 'Toulouse I', as was suggested in October 2001.
Since we do not have a Toulouse I, we shall have to make do with Seveso II and its revised version.
However, we do not want to throw out the baby with the bath water either.
According to the results of the inquiry, the AZF factory did not comply with the regulations required under Seveso II.
It is therefore difficult to come to any decision as to its effectiveness, and it is because the Greens are willing to ensure maximum safety on high-risk sites that we support Mr Lisi's report and congratulate him on it.
It actually improves upon the revision proposed by the Commission, and amongst other things it will give us a better grasp of the issue of ammonium nitrates.
One very positive point is that the new classification will increase the number of sites falling within the scope of the Seveso Directive.
We are also seeking support for Amendments Nos 49 to 55, and particularly the last two.
Amendment No 54 will make it possible to extend the safety margins around new high-risk installations, to include, amongst other things, apartment blocks, transport routes, industrial buildings and recreation areas.
Thus amended, the revised Seveso II Directive could be a valuable tool in the management of the territory of the European Union.
The second amendment which I should like to defend concerns the calculation of appropriate minimum safety distances between future buildings covered by the Directive and the sensitive areas listed in Paragraph 1.
We believe, in fact, that it is essential that the Commission should, within three years, submit a methodology designed in conjunction with the Member States, in order to establish this minimum safety distance.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to remind you that the French Government decided, yesterday, to re-open part of the AZF factory in Toulouse, despite the fact that the public is campaigning to have it moved away from residential areas.
When the amended Seveso II Directive becomes applicable, AZF would be closed on the grounds that it had not applied European legislation.
The European Union would then be in line with the public and its safety demands.
Thank you, Madam President. An important aspect that has exacerbated the subsequent accident in Enschede, and also in Toulouse, is the location of the enterprises in question in the immediate vicinity of residential areas.
This illustrates that physical planning is of crucial importance to avoid future accidents or to minimise the effects of an accident.
We are therefore agreed in principle on the proposed amendments in this directive with regard to the physical planning aspect.
It is of great importance that dangerous operations, should, in due course, be separated from residential areas or other areas frequently visited by the public.
I should, however, like to emphasise that, in my view, the individual Member States have an important role to play here.
Physical planning is an issue in respect of which each country can, and should, take up its own responsibility, certainly where the protection of its own people is concerned.
We are therefore also pleased with the pledge by the European Commission, with regard to the further detailing of the physical planning article, to step up cooperation with the Member States.
I should also like to thank Mrs WallstrÃ¶m for the fact that she has honoured the pledge which she had made at the time to a delegation from the Netherlands with such promptness.
Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Lisi and also Mrs Corbey, for their hard work.
