I must be absolutely clear with the House on this: I do not believe that we can give up on our insistence on a multi-ethnic Kosovo in which all ethnic groups can live freely and without fear.
Nor do I believe that we should abandon the idea of standards before status.
On the other hand, we should not send a signal that final status discussions will be delayed indefinitely.
That would risk a grave worsening of tension.
Nothing that happened earlier this month can change the geography of Kosovo.
We all have a shared interest in making sure that Kosovo does not become a black hole in the middle of south-east Europe, where organised crime flourishes and ethnic division is entrenched.
We have to go on working patiently for the long-term future.
Whatever Kosovoâs final status, its future lies in Europe.
However, the standards we insist that Kosovo should implement and live up to do not include the speed at which you can burn down your neighbours' home, or how quickly you can trash the school or the hospital that your neighbours go to.
We have to make it absolutely clear that violence is not a shortcut to anything, and that if people follow leaders who espouse violence they are following those leaders into a future of poverty and criminality â not a future with the rest of Europe.
I hope that point will be understood and that the community will turn its back on violence and move towards stability, prosperity, multi-ethnicity, pluralism and democracy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, if I am honest, the situation in Kosovo makes me feel both sad and helpless.
In 1999, we went to war to stop the expulsion and repression of the Albanians in Kosovo.
I was in favour of that; after all, I had visited the country and its people since 1990 and had experienced terrible things, including torture, experienced the apartheid regime for myself.
I naively believed that everything would then improve.
I could not imagine that the same Albanians who had suffered all that would now do the same wrongs to their fellow human beings of other nationalities â Serbs, Roma, Ashkali.
They did, in the end with obviously planned and criminal acts of violence.
Many people died or became refugees and cultural heritage was desecrated.
What is more, they then attacked hospitals and schools, which we had probably helped to pay for, KFOR and UNMIK.
It is clear who was behind it.
I believe the ordinary Albanian people know, too.
The Albanian leadershipâs protest and distancing of itself was not loud enough or convincing enough for me.
This terrible act of violence has set Kosovo back a long way.
Is that how it wants to join the EU, as Mr Patten said?
The criminals there do not want to join the EU; they do not want to live together in a civilised manner.
They want strife because strife gives them scope for corruption and crime.
Everything is now in ruins.
I do not believe that the international community has pressed hard enough for those Serbs who want to return to do so; it has not provided all the necessary accompanying measures.
I would not want to return to an enclave either, neither would I want always to have to be protected by KFOR.
That is why not enough has been done here.
We need to think about that.
The government in Belgrade has deliberately prevented the local Serbs from being actively involved in shaping Kosovo.
It has established parallel structures, fearing that Serb involvement in Kosovo would be the seal of Kosovoâs independence.
I do not believe that âStandards before Statusâ is the only way; so far, it has led us astray.
It should be âStandards and Statusâ.
We must now set about solving the questions of status.
The powder keg of Kosovo will not be kept under control without a trustworthy vision for the future.
Sixty per cent of the population are young people and 50% of them have no work.
How are we to deal with that when leaders come along who are always stirring things up because Kosovoâs future is not clear?
We should give some thought to whether we should not press on more with privatisation and support for businesses, offering financial assistance for jobs that are open to both Albanians and Serbs like in Serbia under Milosevic â similar to the âoil for democracyâ plan.
So let there be financial assistance for that; I believe this is where the EU could prove useful.
The UN must relinquish more of its responsibility to the government in Kosovo and Belgrade must put an end to its parallel structures.
Then Albanians and Serbs will at last have to see that they can only govern the country together and that they will only be able to join Europe together, in a country where they have made peace and live together peacefully.
Otherwise, any aid from us will really be pointless.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, three things struck me after our last visit to Pristina.
Firstly, quite considerable progress has been made in the material situation.
Not least, I am pleased to say, because of the good work done by the Reconstruction Agency.
Secondly, the United Nations is doing a good job there, albeit hampered not least by excessive bureaucracy.
Hardly anything has changed, however, in the heads of the political representatives of the various ethnic groups in Kosovo.
That is true of the Serbs, as becomes clear when you look at how little real cooperation there is between the ministers in the Rexhepi government and when you consider that there is still a parallel structure for the Serbs.
It is true above all, however, of the representatives of the Albanian majority in Kosovo.
With perhaps a few exceptions, which the Commissioner has mentioned, they are unfortunately not yet prepared to agree to a multi-ethnic state, and not only to agree to it verbally but also to make it reality.
If you are saying, Commissioner, that we must start negotiating soon, and if Mrs Pack is saying that we must actually negotiate about status and standards simultaneously, then I have to ask you, what are we in the European Union doing to persuade the Albanian leadership in Kosovo that they really must accept a multi-ethnic state?
The President-in-Office of the Council has said that we are the biggest donor, we have the largest military presence.
Why should I have to persuade a European taxpayer to continue providing money for a state whose only aim, or whose political leadershipâs only aim is to create an ethnically pure state in Europe?
Why should we, equally, subsidise and support Belgrade if Belgrade is not prepared to accept a joint multi-ethnic entity (let us say) or a multi-ethnic state?
I have always advocated moving towards independence for Kosovo, but is the Albanian leadership in Kosovo doing its part for that independence, namely creating the conditions for it?
After all the things you have rightly said, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, we must draw the obvious conclusion.
If the worst comes to the worst, we must withdraw our support if we find things are going the wrong way.
We will not help things here with fine words.
They may be hearing the fine words, but the leadership is not taking any notice.
That is why, however much I agree with what you said, Commissioner, and you were perfectly right, I believe we must now look to the Council and the Commission â but in the end chiefly to the Council â not simply for words, but for action if the Albanian leadership in Kosovo and also the Serbs are not prepared to work on a joint project for Kosovo.
I still do not see that happening.
I am really looking to the Council and Commission to act accordingly.
Â Â  â Mr President, the latest events in Kosovo show once again how fragile the peace in the Balkans is, and we must ask ourselves what the reasons are for that.
Let us remind ourselves.
Almost exactly five years ago, NATO began bombing Yugoslavia without declaring war.
Although all the parties to the Helsinki Final Act had committed themselves to recognising the territorial status quo in Europe, the country was systematically dismembered by internal and external forces along ethnic lines; the Federal Republic of Germany led the way with its early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia.
The rapid disintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia did not bring an end to the conflicts, but gave rise to new tensions, which are now again exploding in bloody clashes in Kosovo.
What was proclaimed five years ago as the remedy for ethnic cleansing has proved to be the opposite.
Thousands of Serbian families have been driven out of a province that is still legally part of Serbia, mainly by paramilitary forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK), once classed by the US as a terrorist organisation.
It also sounds very strange when Mr Solana, our High Representative, tells the remaining Serbs that they should be brave and have the courage to overcome these difficulties.
Crimes are being committed, and they must be treated as such.
The EU must have the courage to speak out more resolutely for a long-term, complex political solution for Kosovo and for the whole of the Balkans.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not beat about the bush.
The possibility of this happening was known to anyone who has followed the situation in Kosovo over the past year.
From the huge mountain of reports and media reports, the same old image emerges: no real prospects, increasing hopelessness, growing social-economic problems and the UNMIK, which is considered increasingly less as a liberator and more as an occupier, being part of the problem and not part of the solution.
I too find it far too easy only to point at the extremists.
Of course, they are behind the attacks â which are also in my opinion sickening â on Serbs, their villages and their churches, but feelings of disappointment and distrust, but also aggression, are widely spread among the population.
That is why I would like to repeat here the appeal Parliament made in its last report on this region, and addressed to the Commission and Council: give an outline of what the options for the future are and make it clear what, according to the European Union, the different scenarios are, but do not take too long about it.
I have to admit that I myself am in favour of the proposals of the so-called independent Kosovo Committee of more than two years ago, in which a case was made for conditional independence.
In that respect, the Kosovars who are behind those attacks have done their people a huge disservice.
If the Kosovars themselves are unable to keep their own extremists under control, there is no hope of fulfilling the most important condition for independence, which is respect for minorities.
I am sorry to have to say this, Mr Roche, but what you are saying is more of the same and the policy you advocate has led to these problems.
As I see it, the status quo â doing what we are doing now â is no longer an option at present.
However, the message of this Parliament to the Kosovars and the Kosovan authorities should also be clear: let your people not be taken hostage by a few criminal troublemakers.
Be brave in your rejection; say much more clearly than you have done to date that this is unacceptable, but also take this one brave message to your people: Kosovo must be tolerant, or else Kosovo will cease to be.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as we have maintained and pointed out to this Parliament and the Council on many occasions, the latest tragedies that have taken place in Kosovo show that peace and democracy are not things that are obtained for ever, not even in Europe, but objectives that must be reconfirmed every day.
Not only peace and democracy are being challenged but also the dignity of the person and respect for a common cultural heritage.
The destruction of monasteries in Kosovo, carried out with the sole aim of destroying the symbols of a culture that has the same roots as the European Union, shows how there is a set political agenda at the basis of international terrorism and the resulting guerrilla warfare in some countries, against which our inertia is not just a sign of dangerous weakness but also a harbinger of further tragedies.
The Union must step up its presence in Kosovo and call on the Albanian, Serbian and Montenegrin authorities to defend the rights of the minorities and protect Serbian Orthodox cultural sites.
It does not make sense to have quite rightly protested against the Buddha being destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan if then the politicians and intellectuals remain shamefully silent about the destruction of so many Orthodox churches and monuments, which belong to a culture that embodies the values that we are endeavouring to protect.
The valuable frescoes that have for centuries adorned the Orthodox temples and monasteries in the Balkan region are the heritage of humankind as a whole and must be safeguarded and protected from any risk of destructive folly, as we have stressed in our resolution.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs did well to make more men available to NATO to strengthen the contingent charged with keeping the peace and guaranteeing safety.
For its part, the United Nations should provide for a programme to reconstruct the destroyed resources and to outline Kosovoâs final statute.
What we also want, however, is a stronger presence for Europe, and this is why we would point out that a European army, as called for by the Convention, is an objective that cannot be put off any longer.
Â Â  Mr President, in 1999, Serbia, crushed by NATO bombing, had to give up exercising sovereignty over part of its territory, Kosovo.
At the time, our governments justified this violation of international law by invoking the need to avoid ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population and the plan to turn Kosovo into a peaceful, multicultural society.
This was, in particular, Dr Kouchner's ambition.
Five years later, reality has brutally shattered this Utopian dream.
The billions spent by our countries, as Mr Patten mentioned just now, and the thousands of soldiers we are deploying there are not preventing the Muslims from ethnically cleansing the 200Â 000 Serbs still living in Kosovo.
Rather than issuing soothing statements dismissing both the victims and the culprits without pronouncing in favour of either, our leaders should think about their responsibility.
Above all, they should put an end to this violation of international law, which Serbia has a right to see respected, as do the other states in the region. This is all the more true because our people are not safe from the tragedy now afflicting the Kosovar Serbs.
Sixty years ago, Albanian Muslims were still in the minority in this province, which is the historic heart of Serbia.
A few decades of socialism, Albanian immigration and a falling birth rate among the Serbs reversed the proportions: the Serbs became a minority in their own land and are finally being driven out of their homes, their fields and their churches.
Many regions in our countries are undergoing the start of this process.
Some districts, like here in Strasbourg, or even whole towns now have a Muslim majority and are gradually escaping from our laws and being taken over by gangs that will be succeeded by Sharia law.
The tragedy in Kosovo is sounding a warning.
We must change policy.
European comrades, do not ask for whom the bell tolls: it tolls for thee.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that everyone was pretty shocked at the images we saw of the recent violence in Kosovo, which aroused memories of the situation we experienced in the 1990s.
What was actually positive was the speed of the response from the international community, and the European Union in particular, but also from various EU Member States who quickly reinforced the military forces on the ground there and managed to stop the violence from escalating any further.
Many people here have already said that we must continue to encourage those responsible in Kosovo itself, but also the people in Serbia and possibly in Albania as well, to participate in finding an achievable solution.
I subscribe to the comments made by fellow MEPs pointing out the stalemate that has arisen in Kosovo.
As a result, many people can no longer see a way out; this situation also gives those who want to cause trouble and who have created the recent problems the opportunity to do so.
I think that we need to pay particular attention to the socio-economic situation.
The high levels of unemployment in the country are severely hampering the chance of finding a solution to the problems.
I remain, however, convinced that we must continue to work towards a society in which the two ethnic groups can cooperate and live together, and I am also of the opinion that the ethnic groups can be called to account about their responsibilities.
An answer to the question as to what the definitive status of Kosovo should be, can, however, only be given once we have achieved a kind of internal stability that engenders trust and once there is a conviction that the two ethnic groups can live together peacefully.
Until such time as this happens, I fear that the international community, we ourselves in other words, will have to stay on there and that we will regularly have to take action in the way we have done over the past few weeks.
I fully agree with Mr Patten that this is a European risk which requires a European answer.
We cannot allow a black hole to develop in that part of Europe, and that is why it is also so important for us to have responded the way we did.
We should also, however, think about what might have to be a harder line in the future in order to ensure that we achieve a breakthrough in the stalemate I was talking about earlier.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I first state clearly that I condemn all forms of violence.
May I also state clearly that I am absolutely in favour of a multiethnic Kosovo.
I would prefer to call it Kosova, which is the Albanian term for Kosovo.
I agree with MrÂ Joost Lagendijk when he said that it was inevitable that violence would break out sooner or later in Kosova.
Anyone who has ever visited the divided city of Mitrovica knew that it would take little to trigger an uprising.
The riots and lynch mobs were easy to anticipate.
It is therefore necessary to take the wind out of the sails of the hard-liners among the Kosovar Albanians.
To do this, we must eliminate the traumas.
Traumas from the past, traumas from the exodus of 1999, the traumas that still haunt the Albanian Kosovars concerning their almost 4 000 missing friends, acquaintances, brothers, sisters, fathers and mothers.
Four thousand people are still missing.
They have either disappeared or they are still locked up in Serbian prisons on very vague charges.
Traumas from the present as well.
Is it not true that in the north the international community is in fact applying the secret pact between Milosevic and the Russian generals in which the north of Kosova actually becomes Serbian territory?
Whichever way you look at it, the Albanian Kosovars in Mitrovica, 85% of the population, are still being held hostage by the Serbs.
Unemployment in the Albanian part is two-and-a-half times higher than in the Serbian part.
The Albanian Kosovars in Mitrovica in the southern part earn two-and-a-half times less than the Serbs in the northern part.
The international communityâs official standpoint is still before status.
I would therefore like to call for a âboth-andâ approach.
We must aim for both and status.
Only an independent Kosova will bring true peace to the region.
At least, as long as multi-ethnicity is also respected by the Albanian Kosovars.
Â Â  I have received five motions for resolution to wind up this debate in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  . â Recent events in Kosovo have completed the ethnic cleansing, with the expulsion of the remaining Serbs and gypsies and the seizure of their property.
Kosovo's separation from Serbia and the creation of an independent state are being promoted, as pursued by the autonomist organisations of Albanian Kosovars from the beginning, by safeguarding the purity of the Albanian-speaking population.
The abettor of and main accessory to this crime against hundreds of thousands of Serbs and gypsies is ÎÎÎ€Î, together with the ÎU, which agreed with the intervention and the bombings.
The international NATO force set up in Kosovo in order to apply Security Council Resolution 1441, instead of disarming the criminal gangs of the KLA, as it should have done, proclaimed them the Kosovo Protection Corps.
The current situation in Kosovo and the tragedy of Yugoslavia in general highlight the extent of the crime committed during the 1990s against the Yugoslavian people and the hypocrisy of the proclamations about protecting human rights from the elected government of President Milosevic made by the invaders when they intervened, preventing it from maintaining order and protecting the inhabitants of Kosovo (of all nationalities) against the action of the KLA.
We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn those responsible for this tragedy and express our solidarity with the fight of the Yugoslav people to expel the invaders.
Â Â  The next item is the report (Î5-0133/2004) by Mrs Keppelhoff, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on requirements for feed hygiene.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very glad that the European Parliament was able to deliver an opinion on the Commission's proposal on feed hygiene for this part-session.
Despite the fact that the Commission's proposal was adopted in April 2003, I know that the work in Parliament only began last autumn and therefore I want to congratulate MrsÂ Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her hard work on this report in such a short period of time.
The absence of clear, enforceable rules for feed hygiene is one of the final major 'missing links' to complete our 'farm to fork' food safety approach.
I shall briefly refer to three main points of the proposal.
First, it provided for the compulsory registration of all feed business establishments by the competent authorities within the Member States.
Secondly, it aimed to raise hygiene standards through the introduction of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points â HACCP â principles for feed business operators at all levels other than that of primary production.
The proposal also envisaged that feed business operators would provide financial guarantees to cover business-related risks such as the costs arising from withdrawing products from the market.
I am pleased that there has been close cooperation between Parliament, Council and Commission to seek a workable compromise with a view to reaching a first reading agreement in relation to this proposal.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the subject of feedingstuffs and hygiene, I closely followed the debate in two committees, not only in the lead committee â the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but also in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is advising it, and I would like to tell the House that, as rapporteur on feed hygiene, I basically welcome the Commissionâs efforts to further improve food safety in the EU across the board.
From farm to table, the criteria for the production of our food should be very clearly defined.
Quite apart from the harm to food, the food scandals over recent years â BSE, dioxin or nitrophene, for example â cost the European taxpayer a very great deal of money in terms of products recalled.
That is why I very much welcome the fact that â as Commissioner Byrne has said â the cost of recalls will not, under the Regulation as submitted, be borne by the European Budget as a whole, but, and far more stringently, by the feed business operator, that it is to say the tax payers do not have to pay but the wrongdoers themselves.
That, I believe, is a reason why the regulation has to very precisely define what a âfeed business operatorâ is.
I do not think there is any contention about the need for the requirement to take out insurance not to be imposed on farmers who produce cereals or other primary feedingstuffs.
The recipients in the feed manufacturing industry are already able to analyse and categorise the barley, rye, maize, and so on with which they are supplied.
On the basis of what I am constantly being told, I believe that the smallest growers of feedingstuffs, whether this be for supply to others or to feed their own farm animals, should be exempted from this Regulation, which would, however, come into effect if additives were to be mixed in, be it by the farmer himself, by the feed manufacturer, or by a mobile mill that comes to farms for that purpose.
It cannot be acceptable for rules to be made, for the purpose of precautionary insurance cover, some of which it is in fact impossible to comply with.
I still believe that what we demand politically should not ignore the realities of life, and that applies in particular to threshold values for undesirable substances when compounded, or transferred, and so on, which are increasingly based on what is analytically feasible.
Let me reiterate that you have lost touch with the protection of health if you go about finding a lump of sugar in Lake Constance.
To an increasing extent, threshold values are being determined by reference to what modern analysis can do rather than to the potential risk, and we should concentrate on the actual danger posed to the consumers.
Insurance companies have made it clear to a hearing with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that, in the absence of any clear definition of what is meant by âriskâ, the costs involved in financial guarantees would become quite incalculable, and they would find it very difficult to estimate them.
My appeal to the producers is that they should start with voluntary insurance.
That is why, Commissioner, I, as rapporteur, have called in Article 8 for a feasibility study on binding and non-binding guarantees, and if we get one in 12 monthsâ time, then I am sure we will be able to look further ahead.
This feasibility study should not only examine the national regulations currently in force, and the systems and practices relating to liability in the feed sector and similar areas at the national level, but should also set out recommendations for such a feasible and practicable guarantee system at EU level.
So let me say once again, that we should demand politically only those things that are practically feasible.
Let me take this opportunity to extend warm thanks to all the Members of this House who have joined us in doing serious and constructive work on this topic, particularly, too, the representatives of the Commission, with whom we had really good discussions, and the Irish Presidency of the Council for its good cooperation and especially for its very realistic assessment of what is and is not feasible.
I am on tenterhooks to see what happens next, and whether we will indeed be able to come to an agreement following first reading.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her report and also for listening to the ideas that I put forward in the opinion from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We all recognise the need for feed to be safe.
If animal feed is safe, then consumers feel safe when eating animal products.
While we recognise the need to be able to identify and isolate all those producers and feed businesses involved in the food production chain, I believe this should be done without adding another tier of registration.
We recognise the need for a complete identification of all feed business operators, including farms, by adapting existing regulation systems in order to enable the competent authorities to inspect operators.
However, national regulation systems which are already in place and functioning for other purposes should be utilised wherever possible to avoid unnecessary duplication and regulation.
Currently, the majority of farms can be identified through their participation in these schemes.
I welcome the Commission's proposals whereby feed businesses, except those involved solely in primary production, will be required to adopt the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points principles.
HACCP is a method of identifying potential hazards and ensuring that proper control strategies are in place, and I welcome that.
As Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert mentioned, the area of most serious concern in the Commission's proposals is the use of financial guarantees.
All feed businesses, including farms, would need to fulfil a new requirement of having financial guarantees in place to cover the cost of withdrawn products in the event of a feed safety incident.
This would be restricted to the withdrawal, treatment and possible destruction of products.
Having consulted with the farming industry, feed manufacturers and the insurance sector, we find that the consequences of introducing financial guarantees have not been sufficiently analysed.
The feasibility of financial guarantees or insurance policies has not been properly developed with the industry and it is unclear whether such guarantees would be available from the insurance sector.
The cost implications for feed manufacturers and farmers from such a guarantee scheme are also unclear.
Therefore, we would like the Commission to look at this in more detail before bringing this in.
Finally, we are very concerned that feed coming in from outside the European Union also meets these very strict criteria.
Â Â  Mr President, I apologise to MrsÂ Keppelhoff-Wiechert for having missed her remarks.
A mass meeting of the railway workers who have recently been dismissed is taking place outside, and that was where I was.
I am sorry that we were unable to reach a full compromise agreement on the central issue here â the only one which I have time to address.
Like Mr Parish, I have listened to, and paid reasonable attention to, the fears that we have not really made a market or tested out a market in terms of the provision of insurance.
Nevertheless, I believe that at the last meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with reasonable compromises on both sides, we arrived at a position where a 12-month study could lead â and I believe will lead â to a proper assessment of how insurance provision is made.
I know that pushes the Commission further than in an ideal world it would like to go.
However, given that the vast majority of Member States and the Council take this view or a stronger one in terms of the proposals, if we are to achieve any kind of agreement at first reading here there has to be an indication â perhaps there already has been â that we will follow that line.
I am not personally in favour of a system that shifts to one of voluntarism on an ad hoc basis state by state, nor is my Group.
We know all our lessons from the history of food problems.
The provision of food and feed over the years since we first began to introduce a general food and feed law suggests that we need to have measures that apply right across the Community.
It is no good saying that anyone can opt out of those measures.
I hope the rapporteur will see that after a proper study and a reasonable length of time â and to me that means 12 months â we will arrive at that position.
I hope, for its part, the Commission can also accept that.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I again thank the rapporteur, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, and all of those involved in taking this important dossier forward.
Based on the excellent work done and the informal trialogue between Parliament, Council and Commission, there is, I hope, sufficient agreement between the three institutions to reach resolution in first reading.
I understand the view expressed in the House in favour of financial guarantees.
However, I have also to take into account the view of the Council, where there is a qualified majority in favour of deleting the provision on guarantees.
It is clear to me that if first reading agreement is to be reached, this House will need to support the amendment to delete the guarantees in line with the compromise proposed.
The Commission could then come forward with a report on all aspects of the situation.
This would enable full consultation of all economic actors and stakeholders.
I have to say that a very persuasive factor is the fact that the insurance industry across the Community, including the enlarged Community, is not ready for mandatory financial guarantees across the board.
There is little point in legislating if we cannot be assured of effective compliance.
So I would strongly urge the House to support the amendment in relation to guarantees; otherwise a golden opportunity for first reading agreement will be lost.
Based on the compromise reached, I understand that the rapporteur has tabled amendments which the Commission can accept and thereby facilitate closure in first reading.
Finally, I would like to state that a full listing of the Commission's position on the amendments is being provided to Parliament.
I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings of this part-session(1).
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (Î5-0147/2004) by Mrs Thors, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thors, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mrs Corbey, for their hard work on this legislative proposal, on which we are close to a first-reading agreement, following a swift and constructive interinstitutional dialogue.
Allow me to draw your attention to the principal elements of the Commission's proposal to replace the framework directive of 1989 on materials and articles in contact with food.
First, the proposal extends the scope of the regulation to include innovative types of packaging, known as 'active' and 'intelligent', and provides the general legal framework for their safe use.
It sets the general principles of safety and labelling and allows for additional rules, if necessary, to be adopted in implementing measures.
Second, the proposal will ensure better traceability and labelling of materials and articles intended to come into contact with food.
Third, it increases transparency and legal certainty for operators, by describing the procedure for the authorisation of substances used for food contact materials.
Finally, the proposal will give the possibility to adopt not only directives, but also decisions or regulations, as the latter are more appropriate for certain provisions, such as lists of authorised substances.
The proposal is in the interests of both consumers and industry.
It would enhance harmonisation of different sectors of materials in contact with food, including recycled materials and active and intelligent packaging.
I am grateful in particular to Mrs Thors for her intense efforts to adopt the proposal in first reading.
The Commission supports these efforts.
We can therefore accept all amendments that are part of the compromise package that is the result of close contact between the three institutions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, we are about to see the approval of a framework for our food packaging.
It feels almost like a symbolic act because we have almost concluded all the legislative work surrounding the Green Paper on Food Law.
After everything else we have successfully resolved, we are now to create an overall framework.
I hope we succeed.
I wish to emphasise that we are concerned here with approving the principles that are to apply to material that comes into contact with food.
We are not approving new materials as such, but saying how matters should proceed.
In my view, the fact that we are laying down guidelines and establishing limits for what is to be approved is an example of good legislation.
In the future too, packages will on many occasions have to be expressly approved in the light of the particular substances and food they are to be used for.
For example, what is the fat content of the food with which the material comes into contact?
I can guarantee consumers that we shall continue to be cautious so that, for example, phthalates are not released from soft plastic.
As the Commissioner said, there are three principal new developments: the new administration, and thus transparency, resulting from the setting up of a European Food Safety Agency; the new principles incorporated into food legislation; and, finally, the opportunity to approve active, intelligent packaging.
A majority in Parliament appears to be prepared to accept active packaging, that is to say packaging that can absorb oxygen and moisture in the environment or give off antioxidants.
Research projects carried out demonstrate, for example, that tomatoes and fruit retain their proper form for longer in the active packaging.
Correctly used, I believe that they can in actual fact lead to fewer additives.
That would be an advantage, because we are concerned about a possible link between additives and the increasing number of allergies.
I personally prefer active packaging around my bread.
I myself came across an unopened package after two years and found the bread completely unchanged.
As we said, active intelligent packaging should entail advantages for both consumers and manufacturers.
I can also envisage situations in which such packaging helps us save energy, something which would of course be of value.
One of the conditions of our approving the new types of packaging is that they should be compatible with Community legislation generally.
The substances that have been allowed into food must be approved, and active packaging must not be misleading to consumers.
A bad smell must not be covered by another smell.
Intelligent packaging can provide us with information about the way in which food has been stored and thus show whether it has been stored suitably.
We know, for example, that certain smoked food can be difficult to store in the right way.
Let us hope that, in the future, intelligent packaging will be developed that shows, for example, how smoked fish has been treated and whether it has been treated properly.
We know that, in this connection, problems have sometimes arisen involving listeria.
As the Commissioner said, we shall have discussions concerning the recycling of material, for the requirements have become stricter when it comes also to the use of plastic, metal and paper in packaging.
It is important for new regulations, backed by this regulation, to be adopted and for us to know with certainty that food packaging needs to be approved to ensure that it is safe.
More rules concerning traceability will be adopted, supported by, and in line with, the previously adopted legislation.
In its work, Parliament has tried to emphasise that the information to be preserved is that which is needed for investigating problems that may arise later.
I also believe that the rules on traceability that we are now laying down are important if all the parties are to have equal opportunities to be suppliers to large chains of food stores.
I am pleased that we have set out clear rules governing the language used and public access to records.
That aspect of the Commissionâs proposal was not entirely clear.
Had there been more rules on the subject of unambiguous, binding regulations to promote sound administration, we should probably have avoided a number of amendments.
That was not, however, the case.
We therefore need to clarify matters here and now.
For my part, I regret the fact that the Council and the Commission did not wish to approve the independence of the Food Agency.
I hope that we can adopt this report at a single reading.
That would be the case if we were to vote in favour of blocks one and two.
That would be in keeping with the position at which we had arrived in our negotiations with the Council and with what COREPER approved last week.
I see no reason, however, for approving Amendment NoÂ 17.
I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation.
Above all, I wish, however, to say a big thank you to the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as to our helpful official, MrsÂ KÃ¶ykkÃ€, for her excellent work.
It has been a pleasure to collaborate with her.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Thors, many thanks for your work.
I think it would be a very good idea to round this off in a first-reading agreement.
It is a fairly technical dossier, but I think that we will get a fair distance with it.
The internal market makes it necessary to harmonise regulations for the food industry and for packaging.
New developments require new standards.
Active and intelligent materials and objects are just such new developments.
Active materials interact with food in order to maintain or improve the condition of the food during its storage and to extend its shelf life.
Intelligent materials are being designed to provide information on the condition of food.
A possible development is a packaging material that changes colour when the milk in it turns sour or the food in it begins to perish.
These are all interesting developments and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy wholeheartedly supports the Commissionâs proposals, although it does have a few comments on these developments.
Firstly, active and intelligent materials must not be used to mislead the consumer.
The opportunities to do this exist, but we would like to state very emphatically that this is not the intention.
Secondly, traceability is necessary, but our committee believes that this need not go all the way back to the tree from which a paper bag is made.
A good system is sufficient.
Thirdly, the consequences for trading partners must not be inequitable, and no unnecessary trade barriers should be erected, particularly for developing countries.
I understand that some solutions have been put forward in this regard.
Finally, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is calling for the barriers to the use of recycled materials to be eliminated.
We cannot have a situation in which recycling is encouraged on the one hand and recycled materials are not permitted onto the market on the other.
Food safety is of course the yardstick in this area.
In short, our committee wants to see modern technologies being used for the benefit of the consumer and the environment.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Thors for this report and all her work on it.
It confirms my already high opinion of her parliamentary talents.
She will be a sad loss to this Parliament when she goes back go Finland.
Here we have an active and intelligent packaging of a Commission proposal.
It has received broad support in our committees and in the responses from the Council and the Commission, which I found to be entirely constructive.
If we could do this more often, everybody's life would be simpler.
However, there were certain questions that we had to raise.
One was the extent to which traceability would be possible.
I am glad that MrsÂ Thors took on board my own amendments.
I accept her advice that we should not vote for Amendment No 17.
Had she told me to go the other way, I would have done.
I believe that the issue of public openness on this matter is one we should take into account.
Another point that some of us are slightly concerned about â and it comes up time after time in these debates â is the precise role of the European Food Safety Authority.
Time after time the mantra comes up that there will be a reference to EFSA, that it will do this or that.
We were due to have heard from the chief executive of EFSA this week.
That has been postponed.
Where we are moving towards greater food safety, safer food packaging, better labelling and so on, we should not require EFSA to do all the work.
Where there is a measure of derogation built into this, all of the Member States seem to be reasonably happy with it.
Where the Commission has done a good job, we should move ahead and see how far the existing institutions can do it for themselves.
I wish this report well and equally Mrs Thors.
I congratulate her on this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must first say how sorry I am to have arrived late for the debate, meaning that I did not hear the rapporteurâs introduction.
Please do excuse me, but the debate began a little earlier than scheduled.
We have chosen to accept the compromise agreed upon.
We believe it to be reasonable, even if we should like to have gone further in certain areas, for example when it came to the content of ArticleÂ 17.
We have nonetheless chosen to approve the compromise.
We are fairly sceptical about the active and intelligent materials.
We nevertheless believe that the compromise is sound overall because it constitutes a clear improvement upon the original proposal.
That is a constructive step along the road.
Finally, I wish to emphasise that, in our opinion, traceability is very important.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commission's proposal emphasises the introduction of two new types of packaging in contact with food: what is known as 'active' packaging, which releases preservatives into the food, and what is known as 'intelligent' packaging, which warns consumers when the food has gone off or has some undesirable characteristic.
Even though the rapporteur has attempted to improve the labelling rules, the decision-making procedures, including the procedure for authorisation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and access to public documents, the report, as it stands, is still unacceptable to the Greens.
Whereas Community legislation on food additives is regulated in great detail, the Commission's proposal simply introduces a general procedural framework, putting great emphasis on comitology.
The door is left wide open for the introduction of active packaging, without providing a strict framework for specific substances.
We have been fighting for a very long time against the ever-increasing exposure of consumers to a whole host of additives and we refuse to let these become more widespread, which would be damaging to health.
The Greens therefore request that authorisation should be withheld from active packaging whose effects are not known, that it should be ensured that there are no toxic products in active packaging, and that Community legislation on food additives should be applied strictly if new food packaging is authorised.
If our proposals are rejected, we will be obliged to vote against this report, which does not adequately consider the possible consequences for consumer health.
How long will it be before we see urgent recalls of certain future types of packaging?
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me once again to underline my appreciation of Mrs Thors' excellent work, and to welcome the progress that has been made.
After only three months of fruitful collaboration between the three institutions, we are very close today to a first reading agreement.
If this is achieved, it will certainly be a record in terms of time.
Mrs Thors in her earlier contribution made reference to the near completion of the work that we have been undertaking â the necessity to put in place the legislation referred to in the White Paper on food safety.
I am happy to say that we have nearly completed that work.
Perhaps we can reflect and congratulate ourselves on our hard work over the last four and a half years when we have worked well together to achieve these results.
I understand Parliamentâs wish to accelerate the Commissionâs proposal on recycled plastics.
I also appreciate the clarifications provided on certain aspects, notably on traceability, the authorisation procedure and the provisions on active and intelligent packaging.
To conclude, I am pleased to accept the entire compromise package.
I think I am correct in saying that this is Mrs Thors' last report, so let me congratulate her on it and on her work in Parliament and wish her well in her future career.
â Thank you very much, Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  . â Although we are without doubt enriched by the food from the widest possible range of countries that is to be found on the shelves of our supermarkets, consumers want to have confidence that products are safe and of high quality, and we have to create the conditions under which they can.
As rapporteur of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome the revision of Framework Directive 89/109/EEC, and thank Mrs Thors for her good cooperation.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party has called for a number of crucial amendments in order to make packaging, and thus also food, safer in future.
Much as the proposal for a labelling system using the legend âsuitable for food contactâ or the symbol of a stylised glass and fork is to be welcomed, we demand that an exception be made for items that it cannot be doubted are intended for contact with food (for example, cups, glasses, etc), thereby avoiding excessive bureaucracy.
We also welcome the extension of the traceability principle to the materials used, although this must not result in over-regulation; it would, for example, be nonsensical for every item of paper packaging to have to indicate the origin of every tree.
As these are always mixtures, this is not technically feasible.
Provided that the plenary agrees to these demands, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party endorses the compromise negotiated with the Council.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0172/2004) by Mr Goodwill, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (COM(2003) 492 â C5-0397/2003 â 2003/0189(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Goodwill, for the work done on this report on the Commission's proposal for a regulation on certain fluorinated gases.
I am grateful for the constructive approach shown by Parliament and the rapporteur to a number of elements in this highly technical legislative proposal.
They know that this proposal can help the European Union to meet its Kyoto commitments.
Fluorinated gases, as defined in the Kyoto Protocol, accounted for 65 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, that is, 2% of the total EU greenhouse gas emissions in 1995, but are forecast to increase to 98Â million tonnes of CO2 equivalent â from 2% to 4% â in 2010 under business as usual.
For example, in the refrigeration and air conditioning sectors there is a strong upward trend in the use of fluorinated gases due to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances.
Our proposal addresses these rising trends.
This proposed regulation, by introducing cost-effective mitigation measures, could reduce projected emissions by around 23 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2010 and obtain even greater reductions later.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are all familiar with the principle of substitution, the substitution of a more environmentally friendly or more healthy product for another one which is environmentally damaging or damaging to health.
In many ways the use of fluorinated gases has already exhibited the principle of substitution, given that many applications that were previously used with CFCs have been substituted with HFCs.
As we know, CFCs are much more environmentally damaging than HFCs, being ozone-depleting gases which we have very successfully grappled with under the auspices of the Montreal Protocol.
HFCs are greenhouse gases like CO2 and, as the Commissioner said, whatever action we take on control of fluorinated gases, it cannot be at the expense of the action we need to take to control CO2.
HFCs are a drop in the ocean in relation to CO2.
First of all I would like to make a point about the legal base.
There has been much discussion about this, but I am firmly of the opinion that Article 95, the single market, is the correct legal base.
If we were to use Article 175 it would make marketing of products containing these gases almost impossible across the whole of the European Union.
Whilst I understand the situation, for example, in Austria, where they have gone further, in the interests of the single market we should maintain the legal base.
There are a number of applications of HFCs, from air conditioning to air-sole trainers and to aerosol fake snow, for example, which we had a little bit of fun about in the press at Christmas.
But this proposal is primarily about containment, not banning.
In fact there are a number of applications where no alternative is possible, for example fire protection and the use of sulphur hexafluoride in switch gear.
If we were to go along with one of the proposals that the Verts/ALE Group made, the lights would go out all over Europe!
With regard to vehicle air conditioning â and it is one side-effect of global warming that more people have air conditioning in their cars â the proposal was to replace HFC134a, with a global warming potential of 1300, with the more environmentally benign HFC152a, with a global warming potential of 140.
I can see people in the gallery already nodding off, and that is why Parliament decided that we should take a bold step to actually phase out the use of HFCs in air conditioning and substitute them with the new developing technology involving CO2.
Under the Commission's proposal there was a very complex quota system which looked as if it should start in 2009.
In practice, however, as 20% of the vehicle fleets of most manufacturers are not fitted with air conditioning, these manufacturers would have met the first step of the quota system without doing anything.
So actually the Commission's proposal would have started in 2010.
The quota system is complex and would only have worked very well with a company that had a range of products which fitted conveniently into these 20% steps.
Most manufacturers do not have a product line-up that fits in quite that way.
And of course there was a massive loophole in the whole system, a loophole big enough to drive a Rolls Royce through, in that manufacturers could as an alternative pay a 200 euro fine for not complying with the directive.
I suspect the manufacturers of some large expensive cars would do that rather than spend money on re-engineering.
We also have the fact that HFC152a is flammable, which may cause some problems with regard to safety.
That was not the final solution, and we think that using CO2, maybe a little bit later, would be a much more effective compromise.
That is why I am very pleased that the PSE Group has prevailed on me and made me see sense and that we have Compromise Amendment No 112, which says that, based on type-approval, we should phase out the use of HFCs and substitute with CO2 from 2012, with a two-year exemption, or two-year delay at least, for some of the smaller manufacturers â what we call the Porsche exemption â, moving towards CO2, which is a much better goal, not only environmentally, but politically too.
We also need some changes to the first line of Annex 2, which I am sure the sessional services will take care of if the compromise amendment goes through, substituting '50' for the global warming potential and putting type-approval in.
Not all air conditioning systems are mobile: some of them are in stationary applications such as buildings like this one.
This monstrous waste of taxpayers' money is cooled using HFCs!
In the case of buildings, it is important that we control leakage, and inspection and control of leakages are included in the Commission's proposal, which we support.
But we should also reward good practice by reducing the number of inspections where leakage is not occurring, as well as stepping up the number of inspections where we have leaks.
Finally, I would like to thank Mr Lange and Mrs Corbey for making me see sense, and Mr Davies for finally coming round to our way of thinking.
It has been a very interesting journey and I just hope that the people in the gallery do not think we spend all our time talking about these boring technical subjects.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I apologise for being breathless.
The brevity of colleagues today has brought this debate forward slightly to the point where I was not quite expecting to be called to speak so early.
Nevertheless, perhaps we can finish before the dinner break.
I congratulate Mr Goodwill, who has written a good report and taken on board many of the comments and remarks made by colleagues.
We are moving towards a document which will carry to the Council many of the points that we have raised and will be a sound basis for further work in the next Parliament.
As a Geordie to a Yorkshire man, I have to say, 'Th'as done good, lad'.
That being said, there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved.
I hope we can get unity in this House for the change of legal base to a double legal base.
It makes sense.
In many respects this directive has two purposes, both to regulate the industrial market and also to protect the environment.
We are trying to protect the environment, to remove from use, gradually and steadily, fluorinated gases, or Fgases as they are called.
Useful though they have been to replace CFCs, HFCs themselves present problems, particularly with their global warming potential, and we have a responsibility to gradually reduce their use, but in a way that is logical, not too expensive, and where there are proven and viable alternatives.
Our biggest step forward and our biggest technological push is unquestionably the replacement of HFCs in car air conditioning systems.
These systems are produced in their millions, their leakability is notorious â I know of colleagues at home who have had to have their air conditioning systems refilled two, three or four times.
I do not accept that the solution is simply to reduce the number of leaks.
The solution is to move to a different kind of gas that does not present the problems that HFCs clearly do in that sector.
As regards uses in other areas, there are some key and essential uses and we want to examine them carefully before we move forward with an amendment that originated with me â Amendment NoÂ 89 â which asks for an orderly phase-out over a period of time after this directive is brought into force.
I hope the Commission can agree to that amendment.
It gives it flexibility and a task to perform, but in a steady, logical way for which it will no doubt come back to this House for approval.
We will not immediately be looking to remove HFCs from fire-fighting uses, where they are clearly very useful and the alternatives are, in my opinion, not yet proven.
We will not want to remove the ban from refrigerators, where there are certain medical uses which are essential.
The motto with this proposal is 'forward, but with a degree of prudence'.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the use of chloroflourocarbons has decreased significantly, as the switch has been made to the use of hydroflourocarbons in refrigeration systems, aerosols and other applications.
The Montreal Protocol was an attempt to eliminate CFCs, as these gases are harmful to stratoshperic ozone.
The report before us is necessary because HFCs are not entirely harmless either: they are powerful greenhouse gases.
Their global warming potential is a hundred or even a thousand times greater than that of carbon dioxide.
Furthermore, it can take a very long time for these gases to disperse in the atmosphere.
Accordingly, the danger of climate change means there is also an obligation to restrict the use of HFCs.
I myself was active and put forward the amendments on air conditioning systems in vehicles in particular.
My own view is that the best solution with regard to overall emissions is to switch to systems that use carbon dioxide.
According to a recent news item, a certain Japanese car manufacturer has already switched over to the use of this technology on the production line, and European manufacturers ought to follow suit.
Carbon dioxide is, moreover, user-friendly, because it reacts faster than HFCs to the desired temperature and is also cheaper in terms of fuel costs than the alternative gases available.
The slightly higher price at present of carbon dioxide systems is marginal from the point of view of the consumer price of air conditioning equipment, and when mass production starts, the economies of scale will ensure that its relative cost may start to change.
The compromises proposed by our rapporteur and agreed by the committee are not entirely in harmony with my own amendments, but I can accept them as an improvement on the original proposals.
I think the timetable that will now be adopted is too slow from the point of view of climate change, especially as there has been a dramatic increase in the use of air conditioning in vehicles in recent years.
All in all, then, the role of private transport in combating climate change is more important than ever.
With stationary systems it is essential to ensure that those who fit the equipment are properly trained and that such professional people produce reports on leakage.
In this way it will be possible on the one hand to minimise emissions and, on the other, to make certain that reports are in fact produced, which is vitally important from the point of view of monitoring.
In this respect imposing restrictions will hopefully swiftly make an impact.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Goodwill, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has been intensively dealing with the problem of climate change for the past five years.
Fortunately, our work is becoming increasingly more specific; we are now also taking real measures.
On behalf of my group, I would like to state that we are generally satisfied with the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
I would therefore like to thank Mr Goodwill very much for his work.
What we have before us is a balanced result.
In the battle against climate change, emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases must be reduced as much as possible.
We therefore wholeheartedly support the committee in its attempts to tackle the biggest sources of emissions.
These are refrigeration and air-conditioning installations, mobile air-conditioning installations and foam products.
Two things still require some attention.
After much discussion, my group would like to be a little more flexible with regard to the gases in fire protection systems.
The emissions from these are extremely low and are only released in the event of a fire.
In our opinion, consumer safety is a very high priority.
We would like to ban fluorinated greenhouse gases, but only in cases where this is actually possible and where there are alternatives.
A large proportion of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases stems from the use of air-conditioning in cars.
We have paid a great deal of attention to this, and rightly so, and in this regard I would like to thank Mr Goodwill again for his willingness to compromise.
Many people are not aware of the negative impact air-conditioning can have on the environment and our climate.
The fact that the use of air-conditioning increases fuel consumption in the car is far more widely known.
In many countries, including my country, the Netherlands, it is actually unnecessary to have or to use air-conditioning.
It is different in southern countries.
In view of the negative effects of the fluorinated greenhouse gases in air-conditioning, I would like to call for them to be phased out as soon as possible.
I personally would rather see this by 2009 than by 2011.
What is certainly important is that we choose Article 175 as the legal basis.
Member States must have the opportunity to take further-reaching measures, particularly in view of the geographical differences and the fact that air-conditioning is superfluous in northern countries.
Member States must therefore have the opportunity to discourage air-conditioning in cars.
Perhaps we should go even further in order to limit the installation of air-conditioning in cars.
For example, the Commission could take a look at energy efficiency requirements for cars with all the on-board equipment switched on full, as these luxury accessories in particular cancel out any improvement in the energy efficiency of engines.
That is definitely not a good example of sustainable development.
In short, we would like the result achieved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to be accepted by the plenary session, with some amendments.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a good practical proposal from the Commission for doing something about global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, because, although the total quantity of greenhouse gases being produced from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment is not vast, the amount is growing very substantially year by year â it is expected to increase 15 times between 1995 and 2010.
The committee has rejected some of the key proposals from the Commission on mobile air conditioning.
I hope it has made the position for the car industry clearer.
However, I am not sure that the way in which we have thrown out some of the opportunities for flexibility is really the most appropriate course of action, so we shall wait to see what the Council of Ministers has to say about that and, no doubt, return to this debate.
Most of all, I regret that the Socialist Group and the European People's Party have done this deal on pushing the date for the introduction of vehicles using carbon dioxide back to 2011 from the original proposal of the committee for 2009.
That is not ambitious enough, certainly not for a first reading, when we have so many negotiations yet to come.
I know it takes manufacturers many years to design a vehicle to put on the market.
A few years ago no one used air conditioning â I have never bought a car with air conditioning.
What do we say to future generations?
We did not take action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and global warming as fast as we could, because we all wanted to drive around in cooler cars in the summer.
However convincing the industry's arguments may be now, they will look pretty weak in years to come.
Â Â  Mr President, I am also very disappointed with this report.
It has not done nearly enough.
It could and should have done a lot more to replace enormously powerful greenhouse gases with environmentally less harmful alternatives.
I disagree with Mr Goodwill on the legal base.
I still believe that Article 175 is the necessary and logical legal base.
As far as mobile air conditioning is concerned, it is disappointing that the committee has failed to take note of those parts of European industry that are already committed to delivering CO2 mobile air conditioning as soon as possible.
The technology is there and it works well, so there is no reason why a phase-out of F-gases cannot begin in 2007.
Beginning this phase-out two years later, as the current draft report provides for, would mean pumping the equivalent of an additional 80Â million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.
Whilst the proposed phase-out for mobile air conditioning is at present unacceptable, there is no phase-out provided for at all for the use of F-gases in many other applications where alternatives are available.
I believe that should be remedied.
That is a serious omission.
Domestic refrigerators using HFCs are left untouched by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy's report, despite EU markets already being dominated by hydrocarbon, greenfreeze technology.
I hope that Parliament will vote to support alternative, climate-friendly technologies and take the big opportunity that stands in front of us to do something serious about the environment, rather than letting the single market ride roughshod over these very important concerns.
It is a pity that Mr Goodwill did not read our amendments more carefully.
Far from leading to the lights going out, the Green amendments specifically called for the phase-out of SF-6 with the exception of switch gear.
So let us have a debate based on the facts, not on the myths.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation, as well, of course, as the other Members of this House who are present here today.
I think we have ended up looking in the right direction, especially as regards the issue of air-conditioning in cars, about which something has to be done, and, for the benefit of, among others, our visitors, let me say that what was agreed in Kyoto is binding in law within the European Union.
What the decisions of 2002 and of 10 March this year mean is that this is binding in the European Union whether Russia ratifies or not, so we too have to do something about this.
I think the facts are there for all to see.
The first fact is that more and more cars have air-conditioning; it is fitted in 80% of all new vehicles, and every year these units discharge between about 8% and 10% of the gases that damage the climate.
The second fact is that alternatives of various kinds are in the process of development.
I think it is perfectly clear that we have to go down the road of seeking out the safest alternatives possible with the absolute minimum of global warming potential.
Thirdly, that alternative is in fact a CO2-based air conditioning unit with a global warming potential 1Â 300 times less than at present.
Fourthly, I believe that we have to adopt the same approach to the type approval of new cars as we do to everything else, as construction, involving the energies of engineers, plays a part in that, and we have to demand, as soon as possible, new air conditioning systems.
Fifthly, CO2-based air conditioning systems are European technologies and European products, which, I think, also makes it apparent that, if we move on down this road, from f-gases to CO2-based air conditioning systems, the air-conditioning system of the future will indeed no longer be a climate-killer; on the contrary, the air conditioning unit of the future can also be a hit where European jobs are concerned.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me comment on the amendments and come back to the purpose and scope of the proposal, because a significant number of the amendments proposed by Parliament, such as better or new definitions of terms, reinforce and clarify the Commission's proposal, and the Commission can accept many of them to a greater or lesser degree.
The Commission also welcomes a number of amendments that strengthen the provisions on containment and inspections and the training and certification of personnel involved in containment.
It is important to say that this proposal is only a first step.
The Commission has indicated that it will look at a number of other issues, such as foams.
Consequently, it cannot accept the amendments on recovery, in particular in relation to foams.
Further action needs to be based on the careful assessment of the benefits and the costs.
Neither can the Commission accept amendments that would either weaken the proposed inspection system of air conditioning and stationary refrigeration or put in place additional requirements as regards training and certification of personnel, both for the Commission and the Member States that have not been evaluated.
An important part of this proposal is the reporting system, which will enable the Commission to check the accuracy of emissions reported to the UN Convention on Climate Change and to support possible further action.
The Commission proposal tries to ensure that the necessary information can be collected without imposing too onerous a reporting system on industry, especially SMEs.
In this context, the Commission cannot accept a number of amendments.
The Commission believes that its proposal on use bans and the phase-out of some products and equipment containing fluorinated gases is based on a careful evaluation of all sectors and is balanced and cost-effective.
Consequently, it cannot support the amendment that would remove the derogation for small magnesium dye-casters using less than 500 kg per annum.
The cost for this limited number of small and medium-sized enterprises to convert to an alternative would be high, hence the exemption.
There are two other bans that deserve comment.
The deletion of the ban on perfluorinated carbons in fire fighting cannot be justified since, apart from some minor uses, the market has already moved to other alternatives.
As regards aerosols containing fluorinated gases, the new definition would exclude a number of novelty aerosols, while the inclusion of pharmaceutical aerosols in the exemption category could be a big loophole.
On the sensitive issue of the phase-out of the fluorinated gases in mobile air conditioning in vehicles, the Commission notes with interest the amendments to ban fluorinated gases, essentially HFC134a in mobile air conditioning in new vehicle models from 1 January 2009, and that a ban should apply to all new vehicles from 1 January 2014.
The Commission prefers to remain with its overall position on mobile air conditioning, given other amendments that reject the quota system and ban all fluorinated gases used in mobile air conditioning with a global warming potential over 50, rather than 150, as proposed by the Commission.
The latter would effectively exclude the use of fluorinated gas mixtures or HFC152a and favour CO2 mobile air conditioning systems.
Finally, as regards the legal basis, the Commission is proposing that the regulation be based on Article 95 â the internal market â and cannot support amendments that propose that the regulation be based on a dual legal basis.
The Commission believes that while the environmental objective of reducing emissions of fluorinated gases is paramount, the main thrust of the proposal is more relevant to the functioning of the internal market and Article 95.
In conclusion, I should like to underline that the Commission supports many of the amendments proposed for the first reading, and Parliament, by acting so quickly, sends an important message to the Council that there is now a need for increased focus on this proposal with the aim of reaching a final conclusion as quickly as possible. I will hand over to the secretariat a list summarising the Commission's position on each individual amendment(1).
Thank you for this debate.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0193/2004) by Mrs Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on a European environment and health strategy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I have a certain ability to come across as being particularly motherly but, being very often out and about among people, I am able to confirm that there is genuine anxiety and fear among our electorate, that is to say the people we represent.
People are in actual fact afraid.
They have, for example, been afraid of what is contained in food, of mad cow disease, of additives and of pesticide residues.
Parliament, the Commission and the Council have in actual fact tackled the issue as a whole, and we are now perhaps putting the last pieces of the puzzle in place when it comes to thinking about food safety.
We now have sound, comprehensive legislation.
There is also a fear of chemicals of all types.
I wish to commend the Commissioner for her work on forming a comprehensive view â which may perhaps constitute a model for the rest of the world â of the use of chemicals in Europe.
It is these matters that have begun to be tackled.
Air pollution and climate change have also been addressed.
Right now, the European tabloids and popular press all too often discuss the fear of radiation â most recently from mobile phones and attendant transmitter masts.
There is so much that is unknown and to be afraid of.
I have inherited this report and did not write it myself.
I rather think that it is a little too far-reaching and perhaps not sufficiently structured.
It is important to take an overall view, so that everything is not divided up into small pieces.
It is crucial that we obtain some sort of overall picture of the anxiety and of the problems, of what we can, and cannot, prove and of what we need to know more about.
Subsequently, we can determine how best to draw up a strategic battle plan for coping successfully with the problems that undoubtedly exist.
I have tried to include an aspect that is rather controversial, namely the fact that individuals have to have access to enough information to be able, as far as possible, to make choices concerning lifestyle, food, exercise and detergents â in fact, everything to which we are giving thought and attention â and to take responsibility for their own, and their familiesâ, health.
The health problems are now such that it is not only political decisions that apply.
Instead, people must have the greatest possible knowledge.
In order to be able to make active, informed choices, people must have access to information that is clear and comprehensible and that conveys a message that is relatively simple to understand.
I have removed any suggestion that allergies are definitely bound up with traffic problems.
I believe that this is an inference without proper scientific backing.
Someone with respiratory problems or allergies is obviously hit very hard by poor air quality or air pollution.
Since there is lung disease in my family, I can point out that, for example, the use of perfume constitutes at least as serious a problem for someone with an allergy.
The cause of the spread of childhood allergies in modern times is perhaps also to be sought elsewhere than purely in external environmental factors.
There may perhaps be biological factors involved.
MrÂ President, that was my last speech here in the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, coupling the environment with health was demanded by Parliament on the basis of the orders set out in Articles 152 and 174 of the Treaty.
May I remind you that in 1996, the formulation of public health protection as a separate aspect of the fifth programme on the environment and sustainable development being formulated at the time was my proposal and was accepted by all the institutions.
Thus, for the first time, the European Union attempted to collect and disseminate widely information and knowledge on the repercussions of the state of the environment on human health.
Today, the sixth environmental action programme includes this specific aspect, in other words environment, health and quality of life, while the first Community action programme in the public health sector, which we adopted in 2002 and for which I had the honour of acting as rapporteur, includes promoting the recording, analysis and evaluation of the determining factors of health which are linked to the environment.
This knowledge will obviously result in the adoption and promotion of suitable strategies and measures to protect human health from the adverse effects of a deteriorating and dangerous environment.
However, we must note that the penetration of the environmental aspect into health has been hesitant so far on the part of the Union and, consequently, the current proposal for an environment and health strategy cannot but be welcomed as a positive step, which expresses the will of the European Union to develop action in this sector, because the environmental dangers to health today are immense and require a modern, integrated approach.
Emphasis must be placed on reducing the environmental dangers which have repercussions on human health or cause diseases, at huge economic and social cost.
Of course, particular attention must also be paid to the most vulnerable groups of the population: children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with a serious medical history.
The action programme proposes measures to improve the air quality in residential and work places, it proposes that studies be carried out in order to detect the hot spots of emissions and exposure to them, it calls for particular attention to be devoted to people living close to sources of pollution and for the stepping up of the policy of prevention, which focuses on stepping up monitoring of the environment for carcinogens and substances which damage the reproductive and nervous systems.
Finally, it stresses the importance of education about environmental issues so that initiatives can be taken for raising public awareness and information.
It is certain that, together with diet, the environment is a significant, determining health factor and, consequently, the Union strategy in this sector must include the constant collection and systematic monitoring of data which link environmental parameters with various diseases.
Only by constantly developing scientific knowledge and research into the aspects of certain diseases with environmental parameters shall we be able to develop efficiently the Union strategy and action to protect human health.
This strategy will allow the life expectancy of European citizens to be prolonged further.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission communication on the European Environment and Health Strategy is an ambitious step which aims to improve the quality of life of European citizens.
There are now clear indications that 20% of the total number of diseases in industrialised countries are related to environmental factors.
Most of these diseases affect children, women of reproductive age and poor and vulnerable groups.
In the fifteen Member States, 60 000 deaths a year are due to long-term exposure to suspended particles.
10% of children in western Europe have asthma, ten times more than in eastern Europe, due to the different environment.
The 10% reduction in ozone is expected to cause 300 000 cases of skin cancer and 4 500 cases of melanoma every year at international level.
The relevant Communication action plans so far have concentrated on specific environmental factors which are harmful to health without, however, ever having evaluated the risks from the links and interactions between the various pollutants to the human body overall.
I believe that the proposed strategy helps to achieve an overall understanding of the threats, of how they affect human health and of what action is required.
The Scale initiative, with incremental application in cycles, is based on scientific research to obtain the necessary information, focuses on children as the most vulnerable group, helps to raise awareness of the fact that the deterioration in the environment is harmful to everyone's health, especially children's, uses the legal instruments provided by the Treaty to take the relevant action and, finally, makes provision for permanent and constant evaluation to ensure that action is efficient.
On behalf of my group, I should like to say that we support the Commission communication, as it is presented, but we shall not support those amendments which depart from the overall spirit and focus on individual sectors, thereby precluding other, equally important sectors.
Â Â  Mr President, doctors since the time of Hippocrates have known that our health is dependent on our environment.
Media coverage in recent years has only confirmed people's concerns.
Today's epidemiological landscape has changed dramatically.
It is dominated by cardiovascular diseases, cancers, allergic conditions and respiratory diseases.
These diseases have many causes, which are often complex and interact with one another.
These causes are often uncertain and some are not yet known.
It is recognised, however, that the environment, in the widest sense of the term, plays a leading role.
Our physical environment is thus one of the major risk factors for the health of our citizens.
I will not dwell now on the dangers presented by polluted industrial sites or nuclear power plants.
Above all, we must from now on take more account of the immediate environment that causes thousands of cases of cancer.
Chemicals, electromagnetic waves or urban and atmospheric traffic pollution: these are the major challenges for public health in Europe.
Our behaviour and our way of life encourage an excessively rich diet, and stress and the intensification of work give rise to many health problems.
For example, we must take a strong stand against smoking, in particular passive smoking and smoking around children.
We must now put in place strong regulations allowing smoking to be banned in the workplace and in public places.
In the face of these challenges, we are concerned by the weakness of the Commission's proposals.
The Greens call for a still more specific and more ambitious strategy, which will be able to rise to the health challenges of the twenty-first century.
This, may I add, is the direction taken by the amendments we have tabled.
We must tackle the problems at their source by putting forward specific actions right now, while accepting the inherent uncertainties of scientific knowledge.
The strategy must therefore be firmly based on the precautionary principle and the principle of prevention.
In this context, we are calling for a significant strengthening of the strategy of reducing exposure to risks.
The Greens ask for these various major lines of thinking and action to be taken into account, so that the European Union is able to deal with the fears and expectations of our fellow citizens and, above all, with the revolution in public health that we must carry out.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the European Environment and Health Strategy will have an important role to play when the EUâs Sixth Environmental Action Programme is implemented in practice.
It was the third priority of this environmental programme and at the time it was said that it was a very important component in the new challenges that lay ahead of us.
In many countries the work done in environmental healthcare and environmental protection has already had a significant impact on achieving high standards of environmental health.
We still nevertheless have work to do.
It must also be one of the major goals in a Union of 25 countries to achieve and maintain standards of healthcare that are as high as possible.
The prevention of disease and the general assurance of good health everywhere must play a key role when the strategy starts to be implemented in practice.
For some reason this principle was not given due consideration by the committee when the matter was being discussed, but I hope that this issue of prevention will be given top priority in future debates.
The first phase of the strategy will focus on factors that aim to have a beneficial effect on childhood diseases.
This is a good basis and starting point for the aim of offering our citizens an environment in which levels of pollution are not enough to produce harmful effects on peopleâs health and the environment.
To achieve this we naturally need investment in research, but also in training and education, and tangible levels of investment to ensure a better environment in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur.
I welcome this proposed strategy looking at the connection and links between environment and health and I welcome the Commission's proposal.
I would like to focus on the issue of indoor pollution and in particular passive smoking â I know Mr Rod has just touched upon that.
It is apt that we discuss this report in the week that the Irish Government introduced a ban on smoking in public places, especially since the Irish Government currently holds the presidency of the EU.
The Irish Government should be congratulated on its initiative to protect the health of all its citizens, including those who work in smoky pubs, clubs or restaurants.
Breathing other people's smoke is dangerous for your health.
Tobacco smoke contains over 4000 different chemicals.
In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency has classified environmental tobacco smoke as a class A carcinogen along with asbestos, arsenic, benzene and radon gas.
Passive smoking is a risk factor in childbirth and infancy, connected to low birth weight and cot death; in children it is a risk factor in asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia; in adults it is a risk factor in heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and nasal cancer.
Estimates suggest that in the UK alone 8000 deaths through heart disease are caused by passive smoking each year.
This is a serious issue and there is no way to escape the fact that passive smoking is bad for your health.
I hope more Member States will copy Ireland's excellent example.
I thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for their hard work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on three reports, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy:
- A5-0173/2004, by Mrs Korhola, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision making and access to justice regarding environmental matters;
- A5-0190/2004, by Mrs Korhola, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the application of the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to EC institutions and bodies;
- A5-0189/2004, by Mrs SchÃ¶rling, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on access to justice in environmental matters.
Â Â  . I should like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteurs Ms Korhola and Ms SchÃ¶rling, for making speedy progress with the proposals before us today.
Adoption of this package of proposals will mean that we have passed a milestone in strengthening environmental democracy: the Ãrhus Conventionâs requirements on access to environmental information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters will be set to apply throughout the whole of the European Union.
We already have in place legislation concerning the Ãrhus Conventionâs first and second pillars â access to environmental information and public participation in environmental decision-making.
The proposal for a directive on access to justice in environmental matters and for a regulation to apply the Ãrhus Convention to the Community institutions and bodies will allow the Community to complete the package of legislative instruments aimed at effective implementation of the Ãrhus Convention.
You will remember that the proposal on access to justice also fulfils a commitment from the Commission to the European Parliament when negotiating the Public Participation Directive.
In addition, the Commissionâs proposal for a decision on the conclusion of the Ãrhus Convention by the European Community provides the means to live up to our political commitment by becoming a party to the Convention, further to its signature in 1998.
The proposal for a directive on access to justice aims to implement the third pillar of the Ãrhus Convention by establishing minimum requirements for access to administrative or judicial proceedings in environmental matters.
With its signature of the Ãrhus Convention, the Community undertook to ensure that its requirements would be applied throughout EU territory.
This can only be guaranteed by means of an EU-wide instrument with respect to access to justice in environmental matters setting the minimum conditions all Member States have to comply with.
Furthermore, such an instrument will help to improve the implementation of Community law, and hence further the effectiveness of Community environmental policy.
Of course, it is important not only for the European Community to sign up to the Ãrhus Convention, but also to cover its own institutions, alongside national authorities, so that they are also bound by its requirements.
This is a point that we made clear, even at the negotiation stage.
This commitment will fully materialise with the adoption of the proposal for a regulation on the application of the Ãrhus Convention to the institutions.
It is hence not only another element for the implementation of the Ãrhus Convention, but also crucial for our own credibility as regards Member States and internationally.
We are, however, not starting from scratch.
A number of instruments linked to the good governance process are already in place, and only need to be completed to fully live up to the requirements of the Ãrhus Convention.
I particularly refer to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and to the Commissionâs communication of December 2002 establishing general principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission.
I commend the proposals to the House and look forward to hearing your comments.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the package of three acts now before us forms part of the package of measures for acquiring practical rules with regard to the principles agreed by the United Nations in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
I myself was Parliamentâs rapporteur for the first two pillars of the Ãrhus Convention, and am now the rapporteur with regard to the regulation on the application of all three pillars to Community institutions and bodies.
I am also rapporteur for the Council decision on the ratification of the Ãrhus Convention.
Let me first speak about the regulation.
The European Parliament played a very active role in the first two implementing directives on the Ãrhus Convention.
The outcome as a result of conciliation represents Parliamentâs position very clearly in both cases and meets the minimum requirements in the Ãrhus Convention fully, even going beyond them.
This is now satisfactorily reflected in the Commission proposal for the regulation.
The committee, upon my suggestion, tabled amendments to the regulation concerning exceptions regarding access to information and binding rules on public participation in particular.
Furthermore, in order to harmonise the regulation with the Convention and the proposed Directive on access to justice, members of the public are given a legal standing where an issue directly concerns their interests or rights.
I am also proposing a clarification to the text concerning charging for the information supplied.
Here a distinction should be made between, firstly, the three European institutions, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and secondly, between all the other Community bodies.
The former three have already adopted a general rule for not making charges, and that must obviously not be altered where it concerns environmental information.
The other bodies may make a reasonable charge where appropriate.
Furthermore, the amendments that have now been tabled are aimed at ensuring that there is adequate harmonisation between the regulation and the proposed Directive on access to justice.
Let me then move on to the directive.
The Directive on access to justice is problematic in many ways.
First of all, the various fears associated with it in the Member States give rise to needless opposition to the whole Ãrhus Convention and the Community legislation that relates to it.
I would think that this is also precisely why Ireland, as the country holding the presidency, is unwilling to include the package under discussion in its agenda during its presidential term.
The second problem is that this directive, which specifically relates to access to justice and the legal system, restricts the powers of the Union to a greater degree than the two earlier Ãrhus directives.
All this Parliament must take into consideration when taking its decision on the directive.
The outcome arrived at by the committee was reasonably good, and the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are an attempt to ensure that the directive will actually adhere precisely to the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention: no more, but no less.
Given that the Ãrhus Convention does not provide any clear basis for the text, a degree of discretion has had to be applied.
I would like to raise the matter of the definition of âqualified entityâ.
The general criteria agreed by the committee are too narrow in the view of many environmental organisations.
I do not agree.
What is required at the end of the day is simply normal procedures that accord with good practice on the part of organisations and recommending legal procedures that are in accordance with good practice, which is probably only reasonable considering the special role these organisations will now have in monitoring societyâs conformity with the law.
Moreover, we have to consider that there are very many kinds of NGOs, and we cannot be certain about the ultimate purpose of all of them.
That is why simple criteria for defining a qualified entity will give protection to that special entitlement we are now bestowing on environmental organisations that have a serious purpose.
I hope that the environmental organisations are able to see this.
If on the other hand some organisations are too small on their own to meet even these simple criteria, that may in itself even justify, in terms of the objective, which is the protection of the environment, combining skills and resources and not working as needlessly scattered units, at least as far as using the opportunity of access to justice is concerned.
We should also bear in mind the nature of the minimum directive: Member States may if they so wish exclude some of the proposed criteria, but may not add to them.
This gives credence to the notion that the directive will function within very different legal systems.
I have furthermore made the provisions clearer, allowing foreign organisations a non-discriminatory right to access to justice when it is a genuine matter of cross-border environmental impact.
The Commission proposal was not absolutely clear on this point.
Now I will turn to the issue of ratification.
The two Ãrhus directives already adopted represent Parliamentâs position very clearly.
Parliament itself was able to make the provisions contained in them tougher compared to the Ãrhus Convention.
This is partly due to the at times intentionally vague and obscure wording of the Convention, which was simply meant to ensure the Convention would come into being in 1998.
This tradition of international diplomacy cannot, however, be tolerated within the context of the precise formulation of Community legislation.
As rapporteur, I hope Parliament will show more ambition where the Community has authority, as the incorporation of an environmental convention in Community legislation is different from drafting directives based on conventions in other areas, such as banning landmines. While the latter is a static decision, the former should be thought of as a dynamic process.
With environmental policy, the aim is to reverse, step by step, adverse global developments, and benefit from the experience gained.
Therefore, the implementation of an environmental convention should take shape in a way that can lead to improvements in a future revision of the convention.
The EU cannot confine itself to the faithful duplication of internationally agreed minimum standards, but should rather use the entire margin realistically and aspire to lead the way.
This succeeded with the two first pillars of the Convention.
The final sections of the Ãrhus package under discussion seem to be going in the right direction and showing a sense of balance.
As a result, ratification of the entire Ãrhus Convention may finally start in the Community with no needless delay, provided the necessary Community legislation is adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, we have here this evening a joint debate on all three pillars of the Ãrhus Convention.
I welcome this debate, and also the Commission proposal for a directive.
In signing the Ãrhus Convention, theCommunity demonstrated its will to improve environmental law and also involve the public in environmental decisions in an entirely different way.
The forthcoming ratification means that theCommunity is actually duty bound to ensure that citizens and NGOs are able to enjoy this right in accordance with Community law, which is a very good thing.
Although theCommunity and the Member States signed the Convention back inÂ 1998 and it entered into force in 2001, it has only been ratified by a few of the EU Member States.
It is now high time that the public and the NGOs were given access to justice in environmental matters, and also to information, of course, and participation in decision-making, which is discussed in the report by MrsÂ Korhola.
This will play an important part in rendering environmental policy much more effective in the EU.
It will improve management of, and compliance with, environmental regulations, speed up implementation, and improve environmental management.
How can we say that so confidently?
Indeed, there are actually studies showing that, in countries offering the opportunity of bringing environmental proceedings and reviewing the application of environmental law, environmental law has become much stricter: there is a direct link.
According to the intentions of Agenda 21, which are also a guiding thread for the Commission, it is individuals, not the authorities, who own their environment.
For the first time, environmental law and human rights are being linked up, and I think that this is a positive development.
It is also true that we have a responsibility towards future generations.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has voted in favour of the Directive constituting a minimum framework and Member States being free to go further and provide broader access to justice.
I think that that is an excellent proposal.
Environmental proceedings must apply to both public authority handling and the criminal dimension, since the Ãrhus Convention does not make a distinction between civil and criminal proceedings, and I do not really understand why the Commission wishes to make this distinction here.
We disagree on a number of points; this is clear from the amendments to this Directive.
For example, I do not think that EU law should introduce new, unnecessary restrictions such as those on qualified entities That would force countries that currently take a very liberal view to introduce restrictions.
I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to which MrsÂ Korhola referred.
These concern Articles 8 and 9, among others, and set out new criteria and procedures that are not at all present in the Ãrhus Convention.
In my opinion, this would create new obstacles, and I do not understand the need for this.
Nor do I understand why we should adopt geographical and time limitations or restrictions, which are also specified in Articles 8 and 5, regarding legal standing.
For example, both the Commission proposal and Amendment NoÂ 32 by the PPE-DE Group require an entity to be active in an area in order to have access to documents or the judicial authorities there.
I think that this is absolutely wrong, as the nature of environmental proceedings is completely different today.
For example, a small, local environmental organisation might need expert help from an international organisation so, in my opinion, that entails restrictions.
In my view, being an independent and non-profit-making legal person should be sufficient to qualify for permission to bring legal proceedings for the protection of the environment and health.
It is also very important that the definition of âenvironmental lawâ apply to all policy areas and not just ArticleÂ 175, to which this proposal refers.
All environmental law based on ArticleÂ 95 would also be covered, of course.
Lastly, I should just like to say something about costs.
I have proposed that costs must on no account be an obstacle to theÂ ability of an entity to bring legal proceedings.
We must ensure that the public is granted the help and support it needs.
When legal proceedings are brought for reasons of public interest, the cost must not constitute an obstacle.
We must be very generous in this regard.
I hope, therefore, that my fellow Members vote in favour of the proposals that I have outlined, so that we can establish effective legislation that does not create new obstacles, but instead fulfils our aim of improving environmental law in the EU.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m is wrong to say that she is implementing the Ãrhus Convention; the reality of it is that her draft directive on access to courts goes much further than does Ãrhus.
Ãrhus merely requires open access to administrative or, alternatively, judicial review proceedings; Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m seeks to lay down binding provisions on access to the courts in all the Member States, with all environmental organisations to be empowered to object to administrative decisions and to appeal against them, with provision also for interim legal protection.
This is to apply to the whole body of environmental law, in other words, to the whole defined in the Community as having to do with the protection or improvement of the environment, including human health and the protection or rational use of natural resources.
The examples listed are, among others, water protection, noise protection, soil protection, atmospheric pollution, town and country planning, and biotechnologies.
Environmental organisations are thus given a general right to contest and monitor the application of the law. That amounts to nothing more and nothing less than a system change in the implementation and control of the law as it stands in most of Europeâs Member States, with private bodies, in their guise as representatives of the public, being given the right to supervise the authorities.
Our legal system knows nothing of the monitoring of law by any such body separate from the courts and from the competent authorities, and with good reason.
Environmental associations are, at the end of the day, interest groups like any others, lacking democratic legitimacy and not bound by law and statute.
Introducing and making binding such a dramatic extension of class action will have a massive effect on the economy and cannot under any circumstances be reconciled with the Lisbon objectives.
It is for that reason that the Committee on Citizensâ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has limited itself to saying that Ãrhus must be implemented, but to a minimum standard, and if Member States want to go beyond that, then that is their decision.
That is where the matter should rest, and so I can only hope, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, that the Council will firmly put a stop to your initiative.
Â Â  . Mr President, I speak on behalf of the author of the committee's opinion, Michael Cashman, who cannot be here today.
MrÂ Cashman welcomed, in his opinion, the proposal for a regulation on the application of the ÃrhusÂ Convention to EC bodies and institutions as a concrete step to align the EC legislation with the requirements of the Convention.
Although the committee's opinion approves most parts of the Commission text, there was some need to improve it.
As the rapporteur on the proposal for a regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, Mr Cashman insisted that this regulation must be in line with the letter and spirit of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1049/2001 on public access to documents, where, after negotiations, a sensible balance was agreed between, on the one hand, the citizen's right to openness and transparency and, on the other, the need to protect certain interests and to preserve the effectiveness of the institutions' working methods.
The opinion suggests, for example, a deletion â in accordance with Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1049/2001 â on exceptions where public authorities would not be covered when acting in a legislative capacity.
The opinion suggests that the operative text of the Commission proposal should clarify that all exceptions under Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1049/2001 shall apply to requests for information.
Finally, a general concern of the committee's opinion is about the deadlines proposed by the Commission.
Particularly when it comes to access to justice, Community institutions and bodies should be obliged to act within reasonable deadlines and to increase the duty of public awareness-raising in order to achieve meaningful consultation.
Clearly, Mr Cashman would have wanted to add his own opinion but could not be here today.
I hope I have set out the main points that he would have proposed in the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, the subject of today's debate is not whether or not we should sign up to the Ãrhus Convention.
As the Community signed this text in 1998, it is now our responsibility to act so that each of our governments can implement this agreement.
By signing the Ãrhus Convention, the Community has committed itself to adopting legally binding instruments, namely a directive and a regulation, in order to bring Community legislation in line with the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention.
It was with this requirement to comply with the Convention in mind that the committee carried out its work.
It is also along these lines that the amendments tabled in plenary, which are widely supported, were drawn up.
Our work initially consisted in uniting the various concepts taken up in the texts and in adapting them to the definitions in the Convention.
On the other hand, we have respected the Commission's decision to give non-governmental organisations working in the environmental sector access to justice, while further opening up this route to qualified entities with legal personality.
In the same vein, we have turned the objective of promoting sustainable development into an essential condition, included in their statues, of exercising the right of access to justice.
Furthermore, only the provisions contained in the Ãrhus Convention and in the directive granted access to justice to members of the public who bring to light an infringement of a right or who have an interest in acting.
As we were anxious that the Community institutions should be bound by the same rules as the Member States, we chose to incorporate this provision into the present regulation.
Finally, we constantly ensured that we respected the need to apply the principle of subsidiarity to the Member States with regard to legal procedures.
Indeed, insofar as these matters relate to procedural law in the Member States, they are based on the Member States' procedural autonomy and must not result in a restrictive legal instrument from the Union.
It is also inconceivable that we could establish a specific provision, a sort of privileged right to easier and cheaper access to justice on environmental matters: it is essential for questions of access to justice to be dealt with consistently and on an overall basis in all sectors, not just specifically in the environmental sector.
Finally, some of the proposals in the working document go beyond the obligations arising from the Ãrhus Convention.
We must retain the room for manoeuvre that the Convention gives the Member States in the implementation of these obligations.
To conclude, I think we have reached a fair compromise which aims to promote, in accordance with the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention, effective implementation of Community legislation on the environment.
I could, perhaps, summarise it by saying âthe whole Ãrhus Convention, and nothing but the Ãrhus Conventionâ.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with two related proposals which must both fit in with the philosophy of the Ãrhus Convention and only with that philosophy.
The question of whether or not to comply with the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention is not on the agenda.
What we have to look at is how to act so that our governments and the Community institutions can implement this agreement.
The Ãrhus Convention is undoubtedly a real advance, as it plays a part in establishing what has become essential transparency, and we are called upon here to present methods of providing the public with access to justice.
If this Convention is to be effective, however, it must bear the stamp of modernity and set in motion greater participation among all those who contribute to improving the environment in Europe.
That is why we should include a precise reference to the concept of sustainable development.
It would be inconsistent to try to make do with an overly restrictive definition of environmental law, and thus to exclude whole sectors of activity that, nevertheless, play an active part in achieving our environmental objectives.
I am thinking in particular here of professional groups.
With regard, more particularly, to the proposal for a directive, insofar as the Ãrhus Convention will be implemented, the first question is whether the directive is really necessary.
This is a valid question and, if there is a directive, it must correspond to the spirit of the Convention.
In this case, it must also respect the principle of subsidiarity: this, I may add, is also the basis of our amendments.
This is because it is the Member States which will have to implement the requirements of the Ãrhus Convention, and this must occur in accordance with the law in force in each of our countries and with the legal traditions applicable there.
I would under no circumstances support amendments aiming to impose one Member State's legal practices on all the others.
On the other hand, we must anticipate possible cross-border cases, and we must specify the conceivable procedures for appeals.
If these points are not taken on board, then, for reasons of legal consistency, we will probably choose to do without this directive.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I want you to know that we support the Commissionâs proposal and recognise its efforts to adapt this Convention to the current mechanisms of the Member States and the Community institutions for guaranteeing the legitimate right to information and environmental justice.
As Socialists, we believe that access to justice must be as universal as possible, but must always take an organised form.
So, on the most controversial issue, which is the way in which this access to justice is made as universal as possible, the Commission proposes that it be done by means of qualified entities, something which is still a restriction of the universality laid down in the Convention.
Certain amendments presented to plenary replace âqualified entitiesâ with âNGOsâ, but I do not believe that this resolves the issue; I therefore propose that we follow the line approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and which I proposed myself, on a broader notion of qualified entity, according to which any person or collective affected by an environmental issue could have the right to justice.
This, together with the modification of the definition of âpublicâ, which we have also approved in the Committee on the Environment, would allow us to guarantee the universality of the right recognised in Aarhus and at the same time organise the system of access to justice in an appropriate manner.
Commissioner, our institutions must set an example in the application of these rights.
I therefore believe that we have the moral obligation to ensure that the regulation is more ambitious than the directive intended for the Member States, and I would call on the Commission to accept the modification of the definitions which this Parliament proposes and which I hope we will approve tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, on my own behalf and that of many of my group colleagues, I should first like to focus on the Directive on access to justice.
As has been said quite rightly today, the Directive impinges deeply on the administrative and legal systems of many countries.
There is also reason to wonder whether the legal basis is correct.
It has been interesting to note that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy approved this Directive, and suppressed a proposal to reject it, by only 17 votes to 16.
For many of us, it is an ideological question why environmental organisations should enjoy a privileged position compared to other organisations.
Through our request for a split vote on Amendment NoÂ 40, you can correct that.
Only last week, Commissioner, events in the North Sea showed that fishermenâs organisations have the same need for, and should have at least the same right to, access to justice as BirdLife or other powerful international organisations.
Many of us share the deep ideological conviction that other environmental organisations, too, should have this right.
We must not have some organisations that are more equal than others.
In my opinion, this whole debate has raised the following question.
What is the added value of the Directive other than to give us a deadline for the implementation of the Ãrhus Convention?
This deadline could be obtained by means of a considerably simpler regulatory framework than the rather complicated situation we have at present.
As regards the application of the Ãrhus Convention to the Community and also the correction that we want to make to the Directive, we have every opportunity of achieving these objectives by means of good governance.
Â Â  Mr President, the Ãrhus Convention is very important.
In practice, it reinforces the transparency of decisions in environmental matters directly affecting citizens and the latterâs chances of actually even influencing these decisions.
I shall begin by commenting on the aspect of its implementation that concerns MrsÂ SchÃ¶rlingâs report on justice in environmental matters.
A proposal to reject the report in its present form has been presented; MrsÂ Thors, among others, spoke of this just now.
I myself have some difficulty in understanding the reason for rejecting this report.
The fact is that the European Union has signed this Convention.
It is reasonable, therefore, for it to have a duty to use its regulatory framework to ensure that this Convention is also implemented.
Surely this is a reasonable consequence of signing it.
I believe that this will gain particular importance when the Union is enlarged by ten new members.
The aim is to involve the new Member States so that, together with us, they meet the stipulations of this Convention.
Reading the report, it is also perfectly clear that it does not prevent any country from having more progressive legislation.
Each country is free to go further, to increase the rights in other areas.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy makes this clear in Amendments NosÂ 4 and 5.
There is a reason for the report applying in the field of the environment, in particular.
This is the part of EU law with perhaps the poorest levels of compliance, judging by the number of Court cases.
In my opinion, the draft adopted by the Committee on the Environment could be improved in a couple of respects.
Firstly, it should be extended to cover all decisions with an environmental impact, not just those decisions that are taken on the basis of ArticleÂ 175 of the Treaty.
Secondly, it is important not to stipulate a detailed definition of the term âenvironmental organisationâ.
It can hardly be the EUâs job to do this.
It is also important not to prescribe a restriction on who is granted the opportunity of bringing legal proceedings.
I shall devote the last seconds of my speaking time to MrsÂ Korholaâs report.
It is important that this report cover as large a part of the legislation as possible.
It is important that its scope also cover institutions such as the European Investment Bank, a major financial player, so that they have to comply with the obligations laid down in the report.
I also think that it is very important that the public be given a partisan interest, so that it is covered by this regulatory framework.
Â Â  Mr President, why do we need specific legislation to implement the Ãrhus Convention?
In our view, it is sufficient on its own, which is why we have tabled a motion to reject the directive on access to justice.
More seriously, this draft introduces some unacceptable measures.
First of all, there is the internal review procedure for acts adopted by the European institutions.
What is the point of having Members of the European Parliament if their decisions are constantly challenged by NGOs selected by the European Commission, which is also the guardian of the EU Treaties?
Then there is the Commission's attempt to interfere in the organisation of national legal systems; this provision is illegal, as it is contrary to ArticleÂ 175 of the Treaty.
Finally, there are the dispensations from both civil and criminal procedure, allowing NGOs to receive aid to take legal action and to avoid the costs, damages and interest payable if they fail: this measure is morally unjust and legally shocking.
In order to maintain sustainable development, I also suggest not restricting the ability to take action just to NGOs, but including those who manage rural areasÂ âÂ landowners, farmers, foresters, enterprises etc. According to Article 9 of the Ãrhus Convention, it is up to the Member States to organise access to justice.
If this draft is adopted, it will inevitably cause implementation difficulties and legal uncertainty, which seems to me to go against the desired aim.
To successfully implement this Convention, we must respect the principle of subsidiarity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, I believe that the speeches by my fellow Members, especially those from my group but also from others, have pinpointed the fundamental problem that we have in this report.
We are not discussing the extension of rights to information, which we all, clearly, support.
We are not discussing the Convention because, as has been said, this is not what it is about as it has been signed.
What we are discussing is a rather more general issue, which we have interpreted, Commissioner, as the Commission trying to impose its will in order to make the Convention workable.
This has also been well documented in the speeches by various Members and in the tabled amendments: that is to say what some Members have portrayed as an attempt to fast-track environmental legislation.
From a legal point of view and given the legal background of the Union and the Member States, the reason for this is not understood.
Now, I am convinced that this reason originates in a healthy concern, in good intentions on the part of the Commissioner and Members, but we must be very vigilant about this aspect, because there is the risk that we will be starting a process that will delegitimise our democratic institutions, made up of elected members, governing bodies, assemblies at municipal and local level; in short, the system of democratic guarantees that are the only supreme guarantees able to fully represent citizensâ interests.
Now, it is only right and proper to want to pay particular attention to the environment, and it is altogether desirable to want to involve all citizens.
We must be careful, however, not to go beyond the limit of the so-called special legislation.
When I hear MrsÂ SchÃ¶rling talk about no limitations, neither time limits nor geographical ones, then the risk of creating counter powers becomes serious.
If this risk were to arise in tomorrowâs final text, then I think that we would do well, as some Members have said, to vote against it.
Â Â  Mr President, in all the years that Parliament and the Council have been adopting legislation together, it has very rarely happened that a proposal put forward by the European Commission is rejected on account of the principle of subsidiarity.
I, and with me a large number of fellow MEPs, find that the proposal now being discussed â and I am talking about access to justice, the SchÃ¶rling report â should suffer this fate.
This is because it is extremely unusual for the European Commission to submit a proposal to implement the Aarhus Convention in European Community law by way of a directive when all Member States and nine of the ten accession countries have signed this Convention, and some have even ratified it.
The instrument of a directive to force Member States to include the Aarhus Convention in their national legislation is therefore disproportionate.
Furthermore, this proposal is based on Article 175, although it is in actual fact about the harmonisation of the Member Statesâ legal systems.
This definitely cannot be done on the basis of Article 175.
The wording of the proposal is also different from the wording of the Aarhus Convention, and this will naturally cause major interpretation problems.
I am naturally in favour of the Aarhus Convention, but I cannot but conclude that the Member States should introduce it themselves.
They have undertaken to do so.
The Commissionâs present proposal is therefore both technically incorrect and superfluous.
In conclusion, I would like to say that my group has very serious objections to this proposal.
We have therefore submitted an amendment to reject the proposal, and I call on fellow MEPs to support this.
An amendment of this kind in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was rejected with a majority of one vote, and that was not surprising, since just before the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy it was still being assumed that I would not declare this amendment acceptable.
Nobody had therefore prepared for the vote properly.
I think that we should be given the opportunity to do this again tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, I cannot help thinking that this is also a matter of the status of environmental issues.
Just imagine replacing the words 'environmental legislation' with 'economic legislation' or anything else, and you would consider it absolutely natural that you have access to justice; that you allow these groups access to justice or a say on these issues.
Most of what we think would come naturally will also have to be introduced for the environmental issues.
That is just one reflection.
Let me begin by commenting firstly on the proposed directive on access to justice.
Without a common framework with harmonised requirements, there is no means of guaranteeing that the requirements of the Ãrhus Convention are met throughout the Union.
We have signed the Ãrhus Convention and that is the starting point.
The Commission proposes to give legal standing to recognised environmental organisations.
That follows from how environmental issues are defined here: what the Ãrhus Convention is all about and what access to justice is all about in this field.
It is restricted to environmental issues and it is clearly defined.
This is fully in line with a Convention that gives a prominent position to environmental NGOs as advocating the interests of the environment, because on the environment we do not have a vested interest.
We will have to heed those voices that take on the concerns of the environment.
It is also done with respect for the principle of subsidiarity, as Member States are free to provide for access to justice for a larger public.
Furthermore, it is left largely to Member States to develop the details of the framework.
Much as I respect Mrs Thors, it is not always the fishermen who represent the environmental concerns when it comes to protecting the Baltic Sea, so perhaps that is not the best of examples.
As regards the amendments put forward, the Commission can accept those that reinforce the principles of the proposal, in particular where reference is made to national legislation granting wider access to justice.
A considerable number of amendments, however, are not acceptable to the Commission.
Even though I understand and sympathise with your desire to maximise the benefits to the public of this proposal, I consider that amendments which propose expanding legal standing to organisations which are not primarily or regularly working in the field of the environment add requirements which are arbitrary or imprecise.
It is also important to provide as much legal clarity as possible.
Other amendments weaken the scope of the proposal as they modify procedural aspects, such as the request for internal review which, in the Commissionâs view, is important in order to enable the administration to reassess its action before transferring the case to the courts.
In our view, the proposal is well balanced.
It takes on board the obligations arising from the Ãrhus Convention, whilst leaving to the Member States the necessary degree of flexibility which will enable them to implement the legislation effectively.
I turn to the proposal for a regulation implementing Ãrhus within the institutions.
I would like to emphasise that our aim is the full application of the three pillars of the Ãrhus Convention at Community level.
These requirements proposed under the regulation cover not only Community institutions but all bodies that exercise public functions under the Treaties, also comprising the agencies, offices or bodies such as the European Investment Bank, to the extent that their activities are relevant to environmental matters as dealt with by the Convention.
Here again, the Commissionâs proposal has made use of the flexibility parties are allowed under the Ãrhus Convention, notably in terms of organising the public participation processes and establishing criteria for access to justice in case of impairments of environmental law.
While keeping in line with the Ãrhus Convention, it strived to interfere as little as possible with rules and procedures already established and operating.
In particular, interference with the Treaty provisions as regards access to the European Court of Justice for individuals needs to be avoided.
In this vein, the Commission considers as problematic those amendments that would aim to deviate from the regime of exceptions set up under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on access to documents.
Neither can the Commission accept amendments that result in being overly prescriptive on the arrangements for public participation and in enlarging the access to justice provisions to complaints by individual members of the public.
Those amendments risk interfering with the provisions of the EC Treaty in this respect.
I will hand over to the secretariat the Commissionâs position on specific amendments(1).
Once again, I thank you for the debate.
Â Â  Mrs Thors, did you request the floor for a clarification?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to say that we very often say in this House that consumers must have the same rights as economic operators, and that all sides must be heard.
That is what this is about.
A situation in which certain organisations are more valuable than others is alien to a large number of us.
That would be reminiscent of an Orwellian society.
Finally, I should like to point out that I do not think that we can share the Commissionâs interpretation that the requesting of internal reviews by qualified entities would not cause problems in the most successful, progressive countries.
That is incorrect.
Â Â  Please, Mrs Thors, I believe you are trying to reopen the debate.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0139/2004), by Mr Manders, on behalf of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I begin by thanking everyone who has contributed constructively to the creation of this compromise and the directive, which I hope, and I am almost sure, will be accepted.
I would in particular like to thank the Vice President, Mr Imbeni, who headed the conciliation delegation, Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and all shadow rapporteurs, who contributed constructively to the creation of the compromise, as well as Ambassador Gunning who attended the conciliation on behalf of the Council.
I would also particularly like to thank Ana Palacio, who has since left this Parliament.
At the time Mrs Palacio was chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and was responsible for a unique moment in this Parliament, namely for what I call the âManders procedureâ. The âManders procedureâ meant that the whole of this Parliament ultimately had to vote on which committee was authorised to draft and deal with this report.
I found that a particular honour, and I think that it has led to an acceptable result.
Why are we satisfied with the compromise reached?
Because, after decades of debate, we have for the first time found a legal title that will enable us to ensure that the costs of repairing environmental damage can be recovered from the polluter.
The liberal principle that the polluter pays is the main theme in this respect.
As a liberal, I am, of course, particularly happy with this.
This is new, it is the cornerstone, a bridge that connects economic and environmental legislation.
I am, however, not entirely satisfied, although as I said at my press conference after the compromise with the Council had been reached, we will have to regard this as a seed that has now been sown, and we hope that it will grow into fully fledged legislation.
What is happening?
In my view, because of the extent to which this directive 'allows', there is still a very good chance that we will create a kind of patchwork quilt in Europe and that the Member States, particularly in more economically difficult times, will find the economy more important than environmental protection.
I therefore regret that my ultimate proposal to apply Article 95, maximum harmonisation, has not been adopted and that we have taken Article 195 as the basis.
The environmental organisations, the environmental NGOs, played a particular role in this.
They are not complaining that there will be too little harmonisation, and during the procedure they did not support maximum harmonisation, something which I deeply regret.
On the other hand, Europe was obviously not ready for that.
This is also evident from the conciliation procedure, because only four amendments to the Community point of view were adopted in Parliament.
Only four!
For this we had to convene three more conciliation meetings.
Ultimately, I believe that the compromise can be described as successful.
This was also evident in the outcome of the vote in the conciliation delegation from Parliament, because 12 to 1 in favour of the result achieved is of course fantastic.
I hope that this is the beginning.
I also hope that the Member States will not abuse their licence policy and the state of science in order to upset the level playing field for economic activities, which we are after all so keen to create in the internal market, by some Member States allowing more than others and doing nothing to benefit the environment.
On the other hand, certain benefits have already been achieved.
For example, the maximum liability amount in the IMO Convention has been increased from 50 million to 1 billion.
The preventative effect of the directive has thus already proven its worth.
I hope that Euratom will follow very soon, and I think that this will ultimately result in excellent legislation.
Once again, we have made a start, and I hope that this will result in something good.
I would like to wholeheartedly thank the Commissioner.
It was of course one of her top priorities, and she can now conclude this theme as part of this mandate.
I would therefore like to wholeheartedly thank her, her staff and, in particular, Charles Pirotti, who is also present today, for their constructive contribution to this matter.
I would like to invite the Commissioner to lunch or dinner, as her busy schedule has prevented us from giving a joint press conference.
Perhaps this is a good idea, because by way of this invitation I would very much like to explain my thoughts on how I would like to see this directive grow into fully fledged legislation in the future, and in particular my thoughts on my EMAS (Environmental Management Assessment).
I would very much like to speak to her about this and I therefore hope that she will take me up on my invitation.
Perhaps there will be time for a quick beer after this debate.
Thanks again to everyone, and I hope that a full majority will accept this proposal tomorrow.
Thank you most kindly, Mr President, and thanks to everyone concerned for their constructive contribution.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Manders.
This is the first time I have had an offer of a date through the European Parliament plenary, or at least an invitation to a drink.
Thank you for that, Mr Manders, and thank you for your good work on the environmental liability file!
You are absolutely right that we have been waiting a long time for this to come true.
I also want to thank Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee under the chairmanship of Vice-President Imbeni, because the positive spirit which animated Parliament's delegation throughout this conciliation enabled us to find a satisfactory overall compromise: the joint text before you today, which has been approved by the Conciliation Committee.
Thanks to this new directive, a comprehensive framework whereby environmental damage would be prevented or remedied through a system of environmental liability will be put in place for the first time.
This new system will be a valuable benefit for the citizens and the environment of an enlarged Union.
I am very pleased with the result that has been achieved by the co-legislators.
We all wanted this directive to be an ambitious and workable piece of legislation, and finding a balanced compromise in such a technically complex and politically sensitive subject was certainly not easy.
I think that the text before you will constitute a significant step forward towards better environmental protection in Europe.
The contribution of this new directive to the conservation of biological diversity in Europe, through its application to protected species and natural habitats, is just one example of the many gains made possible by this directive.
Thank you again, Mr Manders.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my special thanks to our rapporteur, MrÂ Manders, who, as we have seen him do so often in the past, has done an outstanding job of defending the environmental liability directive in the conciliation procedure, and so, this evening, let me thank him for that and also for the good personal cooperation.
This House has been working on the environmental liability directive for a long time, and it has been the subject of major and lively debate.
Many of its critics were already sceptical that the directive could be adopted before the elections or enlargement.
I am all the more glad, as rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that tomorrowâs vote will make it possible for the directive to become a reality â and I hope that we will, tomorrow, adopt what the conciliation procedure has produced.
This is a great day for environmental protection in the European Union.
This directive will, for the first time, introduce compensation for damage to protected species and habitats â what is termed purely environmental damage.
Moreover, there will, for the first time, be one system of liability for the whole Community, doing away with liability loopholes whose closure was long overdue and thereby benefiting the environment, so my group very definitely welcomes the outcome of the conciliation procedure.
My group does, though, also see it as important that the conciliation procedure has produced a proportionate result, for the fact is â to use an adage quoted in the first-reading debate by Lord Inglewood, who will speak later â that the better is the enemy of the good.
Let me pick out one point that was at the heart of the debate until very recently, and which can be taken as representative of the directiveâs many crucial issues: is there, or is there not, a mandatory financial security regime?
My group has always rejected compulsory insurance of this kind.
There are still simply insufficient reference data for a system of this sort.
The purely environmental damage to which I referred at the outset cannot at present be calculated.
Together with the Council and the Commission, the Conciliation Committee addressed these misgivings, with the result that insurance will not, at first, be mandatory.
Instead, the Commission is urged to submit an evaluation report six years after the directiveâs entry into force, and then decide on any new approaches that are appropriate.
I see this as the right way ahead.
Perhaps I may conclude by saying this on behalf of my group: let us join together in adopting what has come out of the conciliation procedure and thereby improve the protection of the environment in the European Union in the long term.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to extend the warmest of thanks to Mr Manders for the circumspect and collegial manner in which this conciliation procedure was conducted.
I see that as the reason why we achieved such a very good outcome.
I have to say, though, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we Social Democrats are less than enraptured by the outcome; we would have liked the âpolluter paysâ principle to have been enforced with much greater rigour, along with a mandatory and immediate financial security regime, but it was not possible to get that through the conciliation procedure, quite simply because the majorities in this House are not what they need to be if that is to be done â with consequent effects on the lawmaking process.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists will nonetheless be voting for the compromise, for some of the things we have managed to achieve can be described as first steps in the right direction.
We have, for a start, managed to require the Commission, within six years, to submit a report on the availability of financial security provision, and what is very much of the essence is that it has undertaken to respond to the Houseâs concerns by presenting proposals for a system of harmonised mandatory financial security instruments.
I do not think we would be able vote in favour had it not done so, and another reason why I see this as important is that it would not merely leave it to the market to develop a single European system of provision for financial liability; instead, from the very outset, one would be given shape and guided in a proper direction.
The second reason why we will be voting in favour is that this House will be able to get the Commission to examine to what extent limited liability, as provided for in international conventions, is at present possible when goods are transported by sea.
This report is also to examine the relation between the liability of shipowners and the contributions of those who buy crude oil, for calamities such as the wreck of the make it necessary that we again rethink the arrangements for liability at sea.
Let me sum up by saying that we are not entirely satisfied with what has been achieved, and we would have liked much more.
I can see Mr Manders nodding; he too, I know, would have liked more, but that was not possible.
This, then, is a first step, and we will, in future, be persistent in seeing to it that it is followed by more as we move towards the right solution.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my thanks for, and congratulations on, the result that has been achieved after all.
I know that it has been very difficult to bring this very important Directive to fruition.
At all events, we now have a draft on which to vote tomorrow, and I and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance shall be supporting it.
This does not mean that we are completely satisfied with the result.
The âpolluter paysâ principle is excellent.
It is also excellent that we now have a harmonised system of liability to prevent environmental damage and ensure that the damage already done is remedied.
As MrÂ Manders said, Europe had not been properly ready for it; at least, parts of Europe may not have been ready for it.
There was a good number of us that wanted a more harmonised system, and we could have gone a little further than this.
After first reading we were very content, but after second reading we were no longer so content.
Now we have a compromise that we can live with, and it is a good thing that something has been achieved, after all.
The proposal that the Commission should present a report after six years on the mandatory financial security instruments, in particular, is incredibly important if these are to function at all.
One way of reaching a compromise at the final stage is through a declaration by the Commission, in which it makes clear that it intends to fulfil the obligations imposed on it by the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council.
I am not sure whether such a declaration would be binding, but I hope so, so that we do not drag our heels for these six years.
I hope that this does effectively apply.
Perhaps MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m could tell us something about the legal status of this type of declaration?
Â Â  Mr President, like all the other speakers so far, I must join the chorus and say that I believe this is a reasonable compromise.
To use an English cricketing metaphor, it is important to deal with these kinds of issues in a pragmatic way and to 'take it in singles', to move one step at a time in order to try to ensure that the way in which we deal with the kind of pollution problems that this directive is supposed to deal with actually works.
