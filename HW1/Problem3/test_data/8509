I think that that is a slight reversal of the procedure.
We hope therefore that you will ask our opinion on this as well and indeed also give an opinion on the budget that you would like to have seen, but we shall have to approve that first.
So in fact we are asking to be fully involved in determining the policy regarding fusion research, as well as in determining the direction that it should take.
Mr President, as Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel has said, research has consistently been identified as the key to improving economic growth, creating new jobs, a cleaner environment and better health.
How utterly astonishing, then, that every country in the world and every Member State of the European Union wastes half of its most valuable resource, that is, the brain power of its citizens.
It wastes that brain power because it fails to engage women in the task of science adequately.
Women are not encouraged at school level, they face discrimination in their careers, and this is something which we have to tackle in the European Research Area.
I congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, the rapporteur, and Commissioner Busquin, both of whom have realised the importance of this gap.
I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Busquin has upgraded the work of his directorate-general in this matter to the status of a unit, that he is ensuring that statistics are being kept, and that networks which help and encourage women scientists are being supported by the European Union.
This must be a key part of the European Research Area.
We need, as the phrase goes, research by women, for women - so that the gender implications of the research we undertake are examined - and about women.
It is important that the socio-economic aspects of the research programme concentrate on gender matters.
Why is it that almost every country in the world wastes the brains of half its population by not encouraging them?
I thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her support of the Committee on Women's Rights' opinion and look forward to the gender perspective being an important aspect of the European Research Area.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to be speaking after Mrs McNally, for I myself am a research scientist and I am carrying out research into women (it is not just a question of research carried out by and for women, but also of research about them).
I am glad that the report takes these questions on board.
I am speaking today on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which unanimously adopted a report, part of which has been incorporated into the report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy; I want to emphasise the word "part".
First of all, I am very glad that the human and social sciences will henceforth be regarded not just as a means of research but also as an end.
The issue of women is part of the question, but, of course, today we are discussing something much wider.
The fact that human and social sciences are now becoming a field of research in their own right means that we have reached a turning point in research in Europe.
I think that needs pointing out. Perhaps it will help us think about how to achieve the political and cultural integration of Europe, given that research is an element of this integration.
I was also struck by the emphasis placed on the extent to which the new technologies, which are so important today - we discussed that yesterday, in relation to copyright - promote cultural diversity through the question of languages.
That is another point we in the Committee on Culture consider extremely important.
As for the Sixth Framework Programme, I am pleased to see that the research on cultural identity that we proposed has been incorporated into the report that the Committee on Industry adopted.
I hope the Commission will also take this into account.
I think it is important to have the possibility of carrying out research on cultural identity, as it is to renew some of the key actions of the Fifth Framework Programme, such as 'multimedia content and tools' and 'city of tomorrow and cultural heritage'.
I somewhat regret, however, that the Committee on Industry has not incorporated our opinion on Internet costs.
Research on Internet costs could have made it possible to reduce them and finally make the Internet more democratic.
As for networks of excellence, that is all very well, but we can also, within the European Research Area, create networks that are not just networks of excellence. That is something we also need for the sake of mobility but also for the sake of research itself.
Lastly, of course, there is the question of intellectual property.
It could be a great help to Europe in safeguarding its cultural identity and democracy if research were carried out on the technical aspects of intellectual property rights.
Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for being so very open and receptive to contributions from my group.
I must reiterate what a pleasure it has been to work with her on these matters. Likewise, I should like to express our sincere appreciation to Commissioner Busquin for his constant readiness to take our contributions on board.
His door is always open, he is increasing his contacts with the groups and we are grateful to him for that. I do not believe it is an exaggeration to venture to say that as regards working with Parliament his conduct has been exemplary This bodes very well for the Sixth Framework Programme.
Mr President, the European Union is not the product of constructivist rationalism, of enlightened tyrannical elites who impose themselves on the people. Rather, it arises from the very promising idea of working together.
If there is one area where the European Union was in need of stimulus to integrate policies, broaden the area of cooperation, coordination and synergies, it is the area of research, development and technological innovation. Consequently, the European Research Area is one of the key concerns of the present College of Commissioners.
Commissioner Busquin is to be credited with launching and developing such an ambitious idea.
The European Research Area does in fact introduce new and potentially very beneficial instruments. Examples of these are cooperation and coordination regarding the research policies of Member States, concentrating on a small number of promising priorities, exploiting to the full the concept of added European value, the notion of large scale projects and of networks of excellence.
There is no doubt that if proper use were made of these instruments they would all play their part in improving the quality and competitiveness of our system of research, development and innovation.
Mr President, our amendments arose out of a number of concerns. To give you some examples: to facilitate the movement of researchers, which we consider essential, to ensure openness and cross-fertilisation amongst the research systems of the Member States, to improve basic research and to establish clearly the criteria which will allow us to set priorities.
The European Research Area creates new expectations and is a source of great hope for us all.
We wish you success, Commissioner, because your success in this field will be Parliament' s success and the European Union' s success too.
Rest assured: as you move forward along the route you have presented so enthusiastically, you will find us marching shoulder to shoulder with you.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the European Commission presented its first communication on the European Research Area, through the intermediary of Commissioner Busquin, we wondered whether this was just another gadget, the kind of publicity stunt the Commission has sometimes favoured, or whether it really did represent a new direction, a turning point in the development of European research. In other words, we wondered whether the Commission was taking on board the fact that strictly Community related research makes up only a small percentage of global research activity in the European Union.
Today, after the first communication and, in particular, after this one, which defines the instruments more clearly, we know that we are definitely on the eve of a major change of course in research - although I would not go quite so far as to describe it as a Copernican revolution.
Until now, the purpose of research and of its main instrument, the Framework Programme, has been to keep European industry competitive.
Today, obviously without neglecting that fundamental objective, we feel that there is a higher ambition, a new dimension.
It is clear that if we want to achieve this European Research Area, which corresponds to a genuine Community policy, cooperation with the Member States is absolutely essential.
In that respect, I do not agree with Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, even though I find her report quite excellent.
I think we must not be overcautious.
The Heads of State knew what they were doing when they incorporated that form of cooperation into the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.
We must make that cooperation strong and vigorous. I believe it is an essential element and one that must form the basis of the ideas and proposals in the Sixth Framework Programme.
So we must embark resolutely on this cooperation, but without forgetting that, in itself, that will not be enough to create a European Research Area.
We will have to invigorate the European Research Area by making new efforts to promote the mobility of the researchers, as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca so rightly said.
We must also invigorate it through joint efforts in the field of major infrastructure.
We must also, of course, invigorate it by setting up networks of research centres, whether or not they are networks of excellence, but it is true that we have centres of excellence and they will have to get used to working together.
Here you face a formidable choice, Commissioner, in regard to charting these centres of excellence.
These days, one could no doubt call it a benchmarking exercise.
To call it so is one thing, to make it so is, of course, another, more difficult thing.
However, when all is said and done, we have confidence that you will succeed.
Let me conclude by saying that over and above the European Research Area, which I believe will be a structural component of the next Framework Programme, we will also have to create links between the research areas and the whole field of university education.
That is another dimension, but it is a crucial one.
Madam President, the establishment of a European Research Area is a truly innovative idea, which Commissioner Busquin proposes to make a reality over the next few years.
We are grateful to him for that and I want to congratulate him personally, just as I want to congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel on the excellent report she has drawn up on the subject.
Of course, we are in favour of this idea, and we would like to point out the aspects that the Group of the Verts/ALE considers most important.
First, we must move towards closer European integration in research.
We want national programmes to be more accessible at European level.
Point two, this European Research Area must focus on sound basic research carried out by public establishments and it must be accompanied by a European innovation area that is geared to enterprises, be they large, small or medium-sized.
At each step, we must try to create a real European added value.
Three, we must also consider introducing new tools.
It is clear that the Sixth Framework Programme we are beginning to work on is the most important one.
We must renew it and make it more accessible, more flexible and more legible.
We must look into the idea of integrated programmes, of networks of excellence, but, at the same time, we must not forget the smaller entities, which can act as sources of discovery and innovation.
Four, we are aware of the need to develop means of promoting exchanges, such as grants, to invest in young people and to create a balance, giving more time to research.
Five, we must continue to promote pure science.
We would like to see more attention paid to the subject of sciences and society and more support given to the human and social sciences.
Six, the European Research Area must place more emphasis on sustainable development, by drawing up very concrete research projects, such as projects relating to the environment or to renewable energies.
But we are not in favour of the inclusion of military research or research in the defence area.
Finally, my seventh point, we are paying close attention to the international aspect, which is not just a question of competition with the United States or Japan and which must take account of the candidate countries and the cooperation programmes with the developing countries and the Euro-Mediterranean countries.
Mr President, Commissioner, the EU is to have a single currency and will therefore have a common currency zone.
There is also a desire to make the EU a common scientific area, eventually to become a scientific superpower.
In many fields the EU is already a scientific superpower.
Not all the results and methods applied become common practice, however, as many large countries appear to have their eye purely on their own national, commercial and military interests.
They should be opening up their projects to others more.
If that does not happen, the EU will not be a genuine European Research Area, and EU money will be used to finance just the scraps and leftovers, for which there are insufficient national funds owing to the fact that the work is deemed to generally lack importance.
In Finland we use the expression 'meaningless research' . That means research that produces results that no one needs, uses, criticises or adds to.
The European Research Area must not become an area of meaningless research and EU money must not be spent on financing meaningless research.
We have to solve the problem that there is no qualitative monitoring of the use of EU funds in which radically scientific achievements might be appraised.
It is to be feared that the use of funds is inefficient in scientific terms.
It is possible that a common research centre will mean more bureaucracy than science.
For that reason, we must demand that any common research area must be developed according to scientific criteria.
I would like to thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her thorough work in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
The report' s only flaw is its call for an alliance between science and the armaments industry.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the coordination and pooling of European research efforts must not lead to the demise of competition between research establishments.
Coordination and cooperative arrangements are good, but there should be no anti-competitive assimilation.
Subsidiarity defines the limits of the Community' s powers, and those limits must always be borne in mind.
Whether the Commission' s ambitious projects are realised will depend on the breadth of vision demonstrated by national decision makers, who must rid themselves of the notion that the awarding of research contracts is a means of subsidising their own national economies.
The foremost priority must be to achieve each research aim as quickly as possible for the benefit of the entire European Economic Area.
We in the Union probably have the best training courses for scientists, but sadly they often emigrate to more attractive countries like the United States after obtaining their qualifications.
Every effort must be made to keep them in Europe, which is why it is up to us to create the best possible conditions for research activity and thus to make Europe a more appealing option for top researchers.
My heartiest congratulations to Commissioner Busquin on his excellent relationship with Parliament and on the effectiveness and intelligence with which he is preparing to establish the European Research Area and the Sixth Framework Programme.
He is working resolutely towards high quality research, towards greater recognition of the value of the research profession and towards freedom of research.
The creation of networks of excellence, increasing the mobility of researchers and setting priorities in the neuroscience sector - witness the tragic situation of BSE and Alzheimer's Disease and gene therapy to control as yet incurable diseases - are key parts of the project.
I hope that the rapporteur - who has done an excellent job, although the time frames and the deadline for tabling amendments were a question of "blink and you've missed it" - will, together with Commissioner Busquin, accept one of my requests, which is aimed specifically at avoiding the brain drain from Europe to the United States of America and other competitive countries.
I am convinced that it is only by means of economic and social incentives, making the research profession more competitive with that of the United States and combining it, as is the case in Italy, with senior management posts, as we do for judges, that we will, at last, be able to attract young people and to offer them a position with a future and profound respect for their dignity and the role of research scientists in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying that I very much endorse the Commission's communication and Commissioner Busquin's statements about the European Research Area.
Let me also say to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel that I congratulate her on her work, even though, as she knows, I regret the fact that, for reasons which I believe were often ideological, she rejected out of hand all the amendments I had tabled with the aim of improving the report.
I want to tell her that I personally will be more generous than she was when we collectively draft the Sixth Framework Research Programme.
With this document, the European Commission is, in effect, proposing guidelines for future measures to support research prior to the discussion on the Framework Programme for 2002Â­2006.
Among these very interesting ideas, I want to take up one, which is and will be one of the leitmotifs of our debates.
It is about the need to concentrate European research activity more closely on a limited series of priorities.
The key concept here is that of European added value.
I know it will not be easy to define these priorities, but I think European research will have everything to gain if we do so.
In the same context, the innovations that will mark the Sixth Framework Research Programme are the networks of excellence and the integrated projects, concepts that are also bound to give rise to wide debate.
The Commission document also addresses the question of the mobility of students, researchers and scientists.
That will be one of the central themes of the Sixth Framework Programme and I know that the Belgian Presidency intends to organise a conference on the subject.
I welcome that.
I am glad that the role of the SMEs has been acknowledged.
I approve the call for the inclusion of the human and social sciences under the Sixth Framework Research Programme.
It is vital to hold a debate on science and society now that we are at the beginning of the third millennium.
All in all, ladies and gentlemen, the communication from the Commission and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report establish sound foundations for the major task on which we will be embarking together, on the basis of transparency, which also covers the field of controlled thermonuclear fusion.
As rapporteur, I am now available to any colleagues who wish to join me as from this moment on in working on the Sixth Framework Research Programme.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the contradictions and repetitions contained in the final version of the report produced by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, it is still possible to discern the guideline which it wishes to lay down for research for the benefit of the monopolies.
The clear references to strengthening competitiveness, the proposal to compile a list of priorities, the recommendation on reducing the number of priorities in order to focus efforts on smaller research projects, the suffocating controls on every research activity will, if adopted by the Council and the Commission, result in a nightmarish structure which will smother research and researchers, wipe out any freedom in the search for new knowledge and radically change the nature of research as a process of producing new knowledge and as a productive force, especially in countries such as Greece, where nearly all research activity revolves around European funding.
Furthermore, linking the European Research Area with security and defence policy, paragraph 28, will encourage the militarisation of research, a highly dangerous move.
In addition, the reference to new Member States, paragraph 35, is clearly disparaging, given that most of them have a long history of research.
I want to believe that Commissioner Busquin will have the sense to ignore most of the European Parliament's recommendation.
Otherwise, as I said earlier, we shall have a nightmarish structure in the research area rather than a European Research Area.
Needless to say, the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.
(Applause from the gallery)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Commissioner Busquin for presenting this opinion.
I believe that Commissioner Busquin bears a heavier burden of responsibility than anyone else in Europe at the present time.
The main objective in the context of the BSE crisis is to restore consumer confidence, which we can only achieve by means of objective research, by means of evidence from scientists that the foodstuffs we consume are absolutely safe.
For that reason, I believe that the whole question of BSE, which covers biotechnological and genetic research, is an important and central issue.
As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I am even in favour of our making a special allocation without delay for BSE-related research, because I believe that research is the only truly important contribution that we can make to the clarification and solution of this problem.
Secondly, small and medium-sized businesses are one of my main areas of concern, and I can only endorse the rapporteur' s view that we should move from 10% to 15% and that funds should be earmarked for companies with fewer than 250 employees. I would also add, however, that provision should perhaps be made for a second threshold for cooperation between large and small companies, research establishments and university institutes.
We should insist that the knowledge of large companies and the research findings of scientific foundations and institutions be passed on to the universities and recycled from there into the business world through incubators in order to create new jobs and new businesses.
We know that the market is particularly keen on small and medium-sized businesses that are innovative and produce highly marketable products.
We should, however, work hard to shift responsibility for the achievement of the aforementioned aims to the national level, because another aspect of the research guidelines is, of course, the idea of dividing up large projects and making them accessible to small businesses too.
Mr President, when the House discusses research issues, almost everything that previous speakers have said can be unanimously endorsed.
The unanimity of our general aims, however, does not make them any easier to achieve in practice.
The foundations of future research policy are, in our view, concentration of effort, in other words prioritisation, as well as flexibility and coordination.
These must necessarily be accompanied by democratic decisions taken by a heterogeneous Parliament and an equally heterogeneous Council.
I must be honest with you, Commissioner: if this initiative succeeds, you will deserve our warmest congratulations.
We shall try to assist you in your efforts.
The European Research Area is certainly a first step in the right direction and will be a component of the Sixth Framework Programme.
However, as soon as it comes to putting the theory into practice, questions inevitably start to arise.
The devil is not only in the detail.
To put it another way, you want a concentrated effort, and indeed we all want to have priorities.
So what clearly defined criteria will you be using to set these priorities, Commissioner?
All I can say is 'Have fun!'
The criteria have never been defined in the proper degree of detail, and both of us, Mr Caudron, have been using the term 'European added value' for the past ten years.
Is that not so? Neither of us has ever defined what it means, nor have we ever been able to.
Enough has already been said about flexibility, but then comes the third point, namely coordination.
A European Research Area necessarily involves coordination between the Union level and national research, and here I see party-political differences rearing their heads.
How much do we want to coordinate centrally, how much do we want to plan and specify centrally, and how much should be done from below in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity?
It will be an absorbing debate, and the political parties are already fuelling it, but we are ready and willing to engage in that debate.
Congratulations to the rapporteur - we shall continue our cooperation.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, for her excellent work.
Similarly I would like to thank the Commissioner for a very thorough presentation.
These days information is the most important factor in production and what we are calling for is an improvement to the content of processed information.
It is in this way different, therefore, from plain information.
Technical innovation and technical lead are slowly receding into the background as the importance of content and the content industry is being stressed more and more.
We are moving away from a sort of information society hopefully to one of education, culture and values, and these guidelines really do speak of a European Research Area.
That, in my opinion, is only right, and they say it will be a way of revising the basic social structures.
The situation being as it is, I will make two proposals.
As a result of the change already under way, we should create a cluster of projects within the framework of the European Research Area, which would help develop content and the production of content.
Europe would have much to do in such a project.
Another cluster would be one that revised basic social structures; namely, the globalisation of commerce and communication.
This is a major factor in the changes taking place today and an enormous challenge in terms of research.
For that we would need a study undertaken, as it affects us all.
We need information because commerce and communication have taken the place of politics, measured globally.
For that reason, Commissioner, I would hope that the proportion of social research can be increased.
Finally, I would like to ask what you intend to do to allow research into globalisation to strengthen and grow and give us politicians more weapons to use in debating this issue.
Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report that provides a framework for the framework.
I would like to fill in an important piece of detail within the framework.
The oft-recited Lisbon Summit sets the overall objective of "making the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world".
The biotechnology industry can make a major contribution to achieving this ambition.
It is therefore vital that research in the life sciences is given the highest priority in the European Research Area.
At present there is much despondency, even despair in certain areas of research.
We are seeing moratoria on crop trials and new product approvals; deliberate damage to trial crops; delays in transposing essential legislation; verbal and even physical attacks on healthcare researchers; environmental scare-stories that are unfounded and unsubstantiated; harassment of researchers - even threats to life by animal liberation extremists; and the use of emotive and inaccurate terms such as "Frankenstein foods" by antagonistic spokesmen and in the media.
All these pressures, often exacerbated by weak responses by governments and public bodies, are threatening our ability in Europe to realise the great potential which biotechnology offers us.
Certainly, a reasonable level of regulation is necessary but this must be directed towards encouraging rather than discouraging advances.
Only within such a positive environment will it be possible to realise this potential and be competitive in the industries of the future, in the agriculture of the future, in the highest standards of healthcare, in our contribution to third world development and the elimination of starvation and disease.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too want to join in the thanks to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her excellent report.
Let me also say how encouraging I find my relationship with all the Members who are deeply concerned with this issue. They have offered me their contributions, their experience and their advice on how to construct this European Research Area, which, I believe, is widely recognised as an essential political objective for Europe.
I would also like to thank Mrs Fraisse and Mrs McNally, representing the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities respectively, for their contributions.
Clearly, Parliament's support for this European Research Area is essential if we are to make headway with this process.
The principle of establishing a European Research Area was accepted at the Lisbon Summit.
It has become a political fact.
But it is true that much remains to be done to make it a reality, as you have made abundantly clear; in that regard Parliament's proposals are an essential component for creating a dynamic at European level.
Let me add that, at the forthcoming Stockholm Summit, we will have a progress report on this concept of a European Research Area.
The issue is also on the agenda of the Heads of State and Government who are meeting in Stockholm, where it is one of the aspects to be considered precisely in relation to the objective of creating a dynamic European economy.
I would like to make a few comments on the various points raised in Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report and Members' statements. Of course, I broadly agree with what was said, but perhaps I can be a little more specific on some aspects.
It is quite clear that the European Research Area will be created thanks, on the one hand, to the Framework Programme, which is designed to facilitate it, but thanks mainly to open coordination between the Member States and those involved in research.
So, if the Framework Programme is an instrument, it will have to be adjusted so that it can help structure the European Research Area.
That is what you will find in the new Framework Programme: elements contributing greatly to structuring a European Research Area.
Indeed, the five-year evaluation report highlighted the need for this measure and made it very clear that the Framework Programme needed to be modified.
On the question of open coordination, I agree that our role still needs to be defined and the criteria need to be more clearly adjusted. But our role is to facilitate and promote open coordination between the Member States.
We must consider how we propose to achieve this.
Clearly, therefore, this will be a long-term job, a job that will require partnership between the Commission and the Member States, with support from the European Parliament and support, Mr Alyssandrakis, from the entire scientific community.
It is indeed a project that concerns all European scientists.
There is no distinction. There are, of course, elements of subsidiarity; there is research that is carried out in the Member States and there is added value research.
So we are still far away, light years away, in fact, from the kind of monopoly to which you referred and which is certainly not what any of the Members of this Parliament have in mind.
To that end, we will have to adapt new intervention formulae and, in this context, some speakers, including Mrs Fraisse and Mr Desama, referred to the question of the link with education.
This science-education link is very relevant and it will, in fact, be on the agenda of the meeting of Ministers for Education and Science in Upsala.
We will be holding a joint meeting between Ministers for Education and Science, an informal Council, in Sweden on 2 and 3 March, on the subject of science, society and education in the sciences; we will also be holding an initial discussion between Ministers for Research on the future Framework Programme.
On the question of the new instruments I welcome your support, and Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca highlighted the importance of these new instruments very clearly.
It is in fact thanks to them that we will be able to act more effectively while also, as Mr Linkohr said, simplifying the management procedures, and therefore avoid duplication.
So that is the spirit in which the instruments proposed by the Commission were defined.
But I also understand your concern about the need to ensure that these instruments offer equal opportunities for all.
They must not look as though they were reserved for one category or another, for one group or another or tailored to any particular group or category. So it is in that spirit that we will need to define the new instruments more precisely.
On the networks of excellence, I think it is quite clear that this is a crucial point, but I am also aware that we have to agree on the definition of networks with a capacity for excellence.
In fact, we should use that term rather than referring to 'giant' centres.
These are not 'giant' centres of excellence.
They are networks with a capacity for excellence, depending on the subject and field of research.
So the objective is to establish virtual centres of excellence that incorporate the capacity for excellence in the priority areas.
It follows that this is certainly not intended to be a tool, amongst other things, for the small and medium-sized enterprises and the countries that are least developed in terms of research.
There are centres of excellence in all the European countries, based on the criteria, which we will be discussing, of the European added value of the programme.
That is obviously one of the questions on which the discussions will focus.
Let me say in passing that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel was quite right in what she said about infrastructure.
As you know, we have already tried to establish an infrastructure with the GEANT programme and to reconcile the infrastructures of all the European countries, with the aim of attaining a capacity of 10 gigabits.
But, as she pointed out, we will have to achieve 100 gigabits, so the infrastructure programme will give priority to encouraging coordination between the Member States, since they have to make the effort on their own territory. We will be discussing that priority when we come to the new Framework Programme.
Variable geometry, or what has been called improved cooperation, is evidently one of the issues that raises questions, since Article 169 of the Treaty provides for it but it has never been implemented until now.
That is why a very major debate is being held on this issue, which concerns efficiency but is also an institutional matter.
We therefore believe that it is up to the Member States to take the initiative.
We can only make proposals on the participation of the Union if we have real participation by the Member States.
But I agree that we must ensure that this instrument does not discriminate against certain Member States and that Parliament is fully involved in the major decision making in this field.
We will have an opportunity to discuss this in greater detail when we come to consider the proposal for the Framework Programme.
It will be a major theme of that discussion.
Lastly, on priorities and criteria, I believe we have outlined the general criteria to illustrate the priorities set out on an indicative basis.
These criteria draw on the replies we received in a wide-ranging opinion poll of all those involved in research, which we ran on the Internet throughout the year 2000.
We consulted a wide range of scientific and industrial groups on these questions via the Internet.
This showed that there are clearly three major subjects that are guaranteed to produce added value.
They are: everything concerned with post-genome research; the information society, together with the cost of the Internet, which is an essential factor of democratisation; and the question of the nano-technologies and advanced materials and processes.
These are three important subjects, without forgetting questions of food safety, which is, of course, very much on our minds in Europe today, the quality of life and sustainable development.
These will indeed be discussed in the communication the Commission intends to draft in preparation for the Gothenburg Summit.
It will discuss sustainable development as one of the key lines of research in the field of the environment, energy and transport.
On SMEs, Members are clearly right to emphasise their importance.
Initially, it was said that at least 10% of the appropriations under the Fifth Framework Programme should be allocated to the SMEs.
It seems we are now moving towards a more ambitious target and we might be able to argue for 15% in the next Framework Programme.
Let me now tell Mr Caudron that European added value is clearly the key component.
How should we define it?
I think it should be defined according to the research projects in question.
The concept of European added value is not a global one.
It is defined according to the subject of the research, which must be carried out at least at European level if it is to match up to world competition.
On the subject of nuclear research, I have no objection, quite the contrary in fact, to Parliament being widely involved in the discussion.
You referred to the meeting on nuclear fusion.
Let me point out that it was in no way a formal meeting but simply a question and answer session on a document, which is, in fact, accessible and which sets out the four possible options in regard to fusion.
I think we cannot avoid a debate on this question.
Indeed, it has already been discussed in earlier debates on the previous Framework Programmes.
I, personally, am in favour of an open debate on this subject, because it is a fundamental social issue, an entirely legitimate question.
Women and society, young people and society: that is clearly the subject of the follow-up activities of the Helsinki Group we set up to look at the position of women in the sciences, both in the public and private sectors.
Clearly there is also the question of international cooperation.
There is that international dimension: the role that Europe plays in the world in relation to research and to serious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and so forth.
We have drafted a communication on development with my colleague Mr Nielson, which will be on the Commission's agenda next week.
The international dimension must always form part of the debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I have spoken at great length, but this was an opportunity for me to spark off some debate on the forthcoming Framework Programme, which will probably be adopted in the next few weeks, or even next week. That would allow me to come and present the broad outlines of the new Framework Programme in about a fortnight's time, as a follow-up to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report.
Let me close by once again thanking her and all the Members for their contributions.
Thank you very much for your address, Commissioner. We certainly did not find it too long.
It was very relevant and much appreciated.
Mr President, I had forgotten to thank all my colleagues for an enjoyable collaboration, but Commissioner Busquin has also forgotten something.
Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl asked very clearly what the criteria are for prioritisation.
This is not the first time we have asked this; we put the same question at the two previous meetings of the Industry Committee.
We do not want to be told that they are general criteria.
We asked for a clear description of the criteria for research priorities.
We as a committee would very much like an answer.
Mr President, I think you are going to be gratified in the very near future with the advent of the Sixth Framework Programme of projects.
Then matters will be even more clearly defined.
We shall, of course, have scope to discuss this when we come to prepare the new programme.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Aid system for cotton
The next item is the debate on report (A5-0022/2001) by Mr Korakas, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on
I. the proposal for a Council Regulation adjusting for the sixth time, the system of aid for cotton introduced by Protocol 4 annexed to the Act of Accession of Greece [COM(1999) 492 - C5-0049/2000 - 1999/0202(CNS)];
II. the proposal for a Council Regulation on production aid for cotton [COM(1999) 492 - C5-0049/2000 - 1999/0202(CNS)].
Mr President, the cotton sector is of great social and economic importance, as you know, to Spain and, even more so, to Greece.
In Greece, cotton is becoming a national product, employing over 300 000 families and producing about 1 350 000 tonnes of cotton in Objective 1 areas, which have a far higher unemployment rate than the Community average and where the average size of holdings is much smaller than the Community average.
The Community needs 4.5 million tonnes of unginned cotton.
In other words, this product is in particularly short supply in the European Union, with Community production covering a mere 35% of demand.
Guaranteed national quantities are always irritatingly lower than actual production, which has resulted in producers' incomes being eroded by high coresponsibility levies while, paradoxically, the bigger the quota overshoot, the lower the cost to the Community budget.
This unacceptable situation has justifiably exasperated our producers, who are turning out in force, just as they did years ago and again yesterday throughout the countryside in Greece.
However, instead of strengthening the current regulation, as rightly demanded by our cotton growers, by bringing quotas into line with current production levels and adjusting at least some of the institutional prices, which have been frozen since 1992, along comes the European Commission and not only does it propose to keep support at its current low levels, it increases the coresponsibility levy by 20%.
The Commission's objective of drastically reducing cotton production is unjustified because this is a product in which the European Union is only 30-35% self-sufficient.
It is wrong because it penalises cotton producers for the fall in international cotton prices over the last three years - despite the fact that they are not to blame and the Commission did nothing to rectify the situation.
I should point out here that the European Commission tried to back up its unacceptable proposal by presenting it when international prices were at their lowest for a decade, in December 1999.
Since then, international prices have doubled.
Similarly, the European Union is proposing to limit aid for cotton production when it is most needed, with the United States of America channelling more and more money to its cotton producers, enabling them to increase their output and depressing international prices.
The environmental alibi does not stand up because cotton production - and this has been scientifically proven - is much less harmful to the environment than similar types of subsidised production which producers abandoned in order to grow cotton.
The Commission has not taken any account whatsoever of Protocol 4 to the Act of Accession of Greece, which sets out the scheme for cotton with a view to aiding cotton production in the regions of the Community in which it is important to the agricultural economy.
Cotton producers are calling for the Community preference to be extended to cotton, especially given the shortfall in the Community in cotton.
Cotton is the chief plant-based textile fibre which is a natural and healthier product than the synthetic fibres with which it competes, it provides jobs for hundreds of thousands of farmers and it may even attract young farmers to remain in the countryside, which is being depopulated.
What do we propose?
We propose to lift all restrictions on cotton growing, quotas, coresponsibility levies, environmental consequences, so that the minimum price is paid in full to producers. Despite this, since for a variety of financial reasons some ceiling has to be set, this ceiling should cover present actual production by our cotton growers, the system of aid should be maintained, institutional prices of cotton should be adjusted in the light of official data concerning average Community inflation between 1995 and 2000, aid should be paid directly to cotton producers through their cooperative associations, without the intervention of private ginning undertakings, after studying the most suitable procedure, and Annex B of the regulation, which determines increases and reductions in the minimum producer price on the basis of quality characteristics, should be included in the new regulation.
We therefore feel that it is essential for the European Parliament to support the producers' call for aid.
It is in precisely this spirit that we proposed a quota of 1.5 million tonnes for Greece and 450 000 tonnes for Spain.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided on 1 200 000 for Greece and 350 000 for Spain.
We want to call on Parliament to stand by the side of farmers so that people stay in the countryside and so that, at the end of the day, our farmers can survive.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the first place, it should be made clear that we are dealing with a shortage product within the European Union. Indeed, only 42% of demand was met between 1995 and 1999.
Moreover it is also the case that, as Mr Korakas, whom I would like to congratulate on his report, has rightly stated, this is a crop grown in the most disadvantaged regions of Spain and Greece. The production of cotton is very labour-intensive.
This means that it is essential to maintain cotton production in order to preserve the social and economic fabric of these areas. It is also the reason for the two most important requests made by Parliament: that the overshoot penalty percentage should not be increased from 50% to 60%, and that the maximum guaranteed quantities be brought into line with actual production levels.
I am only advocating an approximation, not an equalisation.
When the Commission drew up its proposal, it was alarmed by unduly low world prices, which had reached a ten-year low. As a result the cost of aid had risen, due to the system of aid for cotton.
Circumstances have now changed, Commissioner: prices have risen to almost record levels, the money allocated to paying farmers has been reduced and the proposal for a regulation can no longer be justified. However, the amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development certainly are justified.
An increase in penalties would put many of the smallest holdings out of business, with all the social problems that this would entail.
The current imbalance between actual production levels and the maximum guaranteed quantities is the reason for the huge penalties borne by farmers.
As Mr Korakas has rightly said, we could also invoke Protocol 4 of the Act of Accession of Greece, which calls for cotton production to be maintained in those areas where it is considered important to the agricultural economy. It also states that farmers are entitled to a fair income.
This would improve the agricultural infrastructure and so stabilise the market.
The Committee on Agriculture trusts that the amendments it has put forward will stimulate the implementation of collective environmental measures, through the sector' s producers' associations, which we aim to promote and support.
We hope that the Commission will take account of these arguments and amendments, and agree to amend the proposal.
Mr President, Mr Korakas, the rapporteur, has completed a very important piece of work over the last few months. I would like to thank him very much for being open to dialogue and to all manner of proposals, right from the start.
He has been very willing to listen. Together with the work carried out by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development this has resulted in a splendid European Parliament report.
If the Commission adopts the amendments put forward in Mr Korakas' report, the result will be a much improved cotton system. The improvements will include adjustment of the guaranteed national quantities, the aid system, and the establishment of a new permanent framework recognising producers' associations.
Moreover, the amendments tabled by Parliament encourage the implementation of more environmentally-friendly measures which will save water, reduce the use of pesticides, and provide for appropriate management of plastic waste materials.
However, in my opinion the Commission' s proposal is too minimalist.
It is concerned solely with saving money and is incompatible with what is supposed to be the European Union' s top priority: protecting jobs.
This is because insufficient account is taken of job preservation or creation when choosing between the options available.
Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore urge you to vote for and support Amendment No 20, tabled by Mr Garot and myself on behalf of the Socialist Group. This amendment makes a significant proposal.
We ask Member States to take employment into account when adopting measures to change the criteria for land eligible for aid.
In making such decisions, account should be taken of the number of jobs dependent on these areas.
We also propose that alternative crops and the existence of other options be investigated.
In short, Mr President, this is all about social and economic sensitivity.
I trust that our amendment will be supported, and would like to congratulate the speaker once again on his magnificent report.
- Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur on the report presented and the work undertaken. It reveals the anxiety affecting this important sector of European agriculture and, more particularly, significant areas of Greece and Andalusia, the main producer regions.
Cotton is a traditional crop which provides a livelihood for thousands of European families for whom there is hardly any alternative source of income.
There is a significant cotton shortfall in the European Union; we can only meet 40% of demand, and it remains the best natural fibre for fabric production, when compared to synthetic fibres.
Furthermore, cotton has replaced other intensive crops which generate more pollution and greater surpluses.
However, despite the improvements, it is true that there are still environmental problems we need to solve.
Commissioner, we support the Commission' s proposal of maintaining the present system of production aid, based on the compensation payments system. However, we do not believe that imposing stiffer penalties is the right way to restrict expenditure on this sector.
It is simplistic to talk of containing spending and only to present budgetary considerations for reforming the aid system, when what is really happening is that farmers' incomes are falling whilst we are witnessing an increase in imports from outside the European Union.
This constitutes a structural change, since expenditure has been determined principally by changes to international prices, not by an actual increase in the area of land under cultivation.
Stiffer penalties will doubtless lead to greater concentration of the sector. It will pass into the hands of a few individuals and the viability of family farms will be seriously threatened.
However, cotton growing will not cease, which is the intention.
We believe that the producers' organisations are the best means of improving the effectiveness of the necessary self-regulation measures concerning production and environmental protection.
In conclusion I should like to stress that the Commission must gradually recognise the actual production in these areas. It should adjust guaranteed national quantities, bringing them into line with actual production of cotton, a product we do not produce enough of in the Union.
) Mr President, our starting point is a Commission proposal that took advantage of a temporary situation, an all-time low, to justify an untenable restrictive proposal.
One year on, world market prices have risen by 90%. The risk of excessive costs no longer exists.
In fact, costs are now minimal. We therefore have to ask ourselves why the Commission has not withdrawn this proposal which no longer has a raison d' Ãªtre.
It is two years since China decided to export its stockpiled cotton causing a record drop in world prices.
I hope that the Commission does not attempt to maintain a proposal on the cotton system exploiting a decision by the Chinese Government, a decision which had no lasting effects.
If the Commission simply wishes to cut production aid crucial for the most disadvantaged regions of the European Union, it would be better if it said so clearly.
As part of an increasingly unbalanced common agricultural policy, the effects of these proposals, including the social effects, are wholly negative as earlier speakers explained.
In my opinion, the merit of Mr Korakas' report is that it corrects the Commission' s proposal. It also makes other very useful suggestions on effecting adjustment whilst taking account of some of the peculiarities of cotton.
Firstly, it proposes adjusting the national guaranteed quantities in line with actual production.
This will put and end to the anomalies of the aid system, in which costs increase as production decreases.
Secondly - I must not be side-tracked by other matters - Mr Korakas' report outlines a scheme for supporting producers' organisations, and most importantly, a system to implement measures reducing the impact of cotton cultivation on the environment.
The Commission dwells on the possible environmental problems of growing cotton, but fails to suggest solutions.
I hope, Commissioner, that when finalising the legislative procedure, the Commission and the Council will include the amendments unanimously approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as previous speakers have requested.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cotton, which is the subject of today's debate, is basically grown in two Member States of the European Union, Greece and Spain, but it concerns the whole Union because there may be cotton processing and cotton fibre and textile producing factories in any Member State of the Union.
So when we examine cotton growing, we must bear these two factors in mind.
Another point worth noting in the case of the subject at issue is the fact that Community cotton production falls far below its actual requirements, barely covering around 35% of demand.
Plus, European cotton growers are small and medium-sized farmers with an average of 4.2 hectares each, at least they are in Greece.
Production, therefore, is determined by the small size of the holdings and the soil conditions which meet the specifications for this crop.
These objective conditions have brought about a situation over the years which, at production level, is as follows: average annual volume of cotton produced: 1 200 000 tonnes in Greece and 350 000 tonnes in Spain.
The report finds a way round this in a compromise proposal - a judicious, moderate, perfectly realistic proposal - calling on the Commission to recognise this state of affairs by introducing national guaranteed quantities of unginned cotton of 1 200 000 tonnes for Greece, 350 000 tonnes for Spain and 1 500 tonnes for each of the other Member States.
I think that this responsible and realistic approach in the report should be accepted by the Commission as it stands and strengthened in the forthcoming negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Korakas, and to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the report and for their thorough examination of the Commission' s proposal.
Aid per hectare for cotton is three to four times higher than for other crops; that certainly has to be considered whenever this whole issue is discussed.
In the view of the Commission, this special effort by the Community, in particular the extra financial input, is only warranted by the economic and, more importantly, the social significance attached to cotton in some regions of the Community.
In the last few years, however, the area of land that is planted with cotton has increased considerably, and yields per hectare have also risen sharply.
This poses new risks, both to the budget and to the environment, for we must not forget that cotton planting is a very intensive form of crop farming and involves the highly concentrated use of fertilisers and pesticides.
The main aim of the Commission' s proposal, therefore, is to ensure that an excessive increase in production levels is accompanied by an accelerated reduction of the minimum price levels we set.
Adoption of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, however, would lead to a substantial increase in the size of the budget for cotton production.
This, in turn, would mean an increase rather than a decrease in production incentives, which would also tend to undermine the environmental safeguards.
To make it clear what is at stake here, let me tell you that, even if we assume stable yields and an average market price, the additional cost of the committee' s amendments would be in the order of EUR 650 million a year. This corresponds to an 85% increase in the budget.
In view of the current budgetary situation, I certainly could not comply with such a request.
As for the individual amendments, Nos 1, 3, 4 and 9 to 13 seek to increase prices by 10% and the national guaranteed quantities by 50%.
Apart from sending costs soaring, these measures could lead to a 60% increase in production, amounting to an additional output of 900 000 tonnes, with the consequences I have just described.
Amendments Nos 5 and 14 propose that the minimum price be indexed on the basis of the quality of unginned cotton; the price scale would be adopted by the Member States if the relevant professional organisations could not reach agreement on a price scale.
We have had some apposite experience of such ideas in the past.
It emerged very clearly that it is simply impossible to establish and administer such a system centrally, because there are quite simply far too many factors that influence the quality of raw cotton.
For that reason, we must stand by our view that this question should continue to be decided by the interested parties, in other words, between the purchasers and suppliers of raw cotton.
We do, however, propose the introduction of a criterion, namely conformity with the weighted average of world market prices for cotton fibres.
This will give us a framework that will make it easier to negotiate future agreements.
Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 16 to 19 relate to rules governing the formulation of official statutes by cotton producers' organisations and specifying the activities of such organisations for which Community aid is payable.
This is intended to apply to environmental measures in particular.
I must draw your attention to the fact that such a regime already exists and is set forth in Regulation (EEC) No 389/1982.
Moreover, the creation of producers' organisations has been financed by the Community for the past ten years.
As is customary in other sectors, these bodies are expected to meet their running costs from the funds allocated to the common organisation of the market and from environmental aid.
We cannot accept these amendments, because they would mean the existence of two different sets of rules for producers' organisations as well as two different funding systems.
If we also take account of the increased production that would result from the requested rise in the national guaranteed quantities, this alone could entail annual costs in the region of EUR 80 million.
As far as the environment is concerned, Amendments Nos 6, 15 and 20 seek wide scope for the Member States to amend the common organisation of the market, not only on the basis of environmental considerations but also, and above all, for economic and social reasons.
This is really unacceptable because it puts the very existence of the environmental safeguards in jeopardy.
So there remains Amendment No 2, which is essentially intended to correct a mistake in the Spanish text.
But, in point of fact, neither a translation problem nor an error has occurred here, because the expression precio de objetivo is meant to refer to the target price, not to the actual market price.
I very much regret that, on this occasion, the Commission cannot accept the committee' s amendments, but I trust I have fully explained the reasons for this.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
I cannot escape the conclusion that we have not yet succeeded in solving all the problems in the cotton sector.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Financing of quality and marketing improvement plans
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0035/2001) by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation extending for a period of up to one year the financing of certain quality and marketing improvement plans approved under Title IIa of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72.
Mr President, this proposal concerns fruits in shells or pods: that is, nuts and locust beans. We are therefore dealing with walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios and chestnuts.
These products are generally found alongside other fruits on the table and in supermarkets. However, when it comes to decision making, they are not treated fairly and reasonably in relation to other fruits and vegetables.
Through this proposal, the European Parliament is being consistent with itself. On two previous occasions, 16 June 2000 and 26 October 2000, Parliament already came out in favour of maintaining support and proposing an extension until the introduction of a new aid system.
On both these occasions the vote was carried by unanimity. Furthermore, in my view, Mr President, this aid is justified because it benefits the agricultural workers who need it as it helps to compensate for a reduction in their income.
I do believe that granting over-generous aid in favourable market situations should be avoided.
Cereals are a case in point. Both the Commission and the Court of Auditors have stressed that undue compensation was awarded.
In fact, in the period between 1993 and 1997, the Commission estimates that excess compensation worth EUR 8 500 million was granted to the cereal sector. The Court of Auditors puts the figure for excess compensation awarded at EUR 13 100 million.
I am not in favour of granting aid as if it were a lottery.
The aid we are proposing now really is necessary.
In addition, this proposal is in line with the provisions in Agenda 2000. When the latter was adopted Commissioner Fischler himself stated repeatedly that the intention was to maintain all aid.
The Council agreed with the European Parliament' s position. Hence, on 17 July 2000, it invited the Commission to extend the aid.
The Commission' s proposal is on the right lines, because it redresses the earlier error of attempting to cut off aid.
It is right to do so. However, that alone is not enough to ensure a future for the sector.
It does not even cover the cost of projects under way this year. The budget has to be ready in June, and programmes relating to plantations in the first part of this year would not be included.
There is an obvious shortage of these products within the European Union. Walnuts are imported from the United States.
I have to tell you, Commissioner, that last Christmas, El Corte InglÃ©s, a major department store in my country, strongly promoted Californian walnuts, but walnuts from Extremadura and other European walnuts were sidelined.
We import products of this nature to the detriment of the agricultural workers I am speaking for.
Commissioner, you ought to be taking note of what I am saying because this constitutes a precedent.
We are in favour of opening up markets and coming to multilateral agreements and to bilateral agreements, with Turkey for instance.
We are happy to show solidarity.
Nevertheless, the Commission cannot condone European agriculture abandoning these crops as a result of commercial agreements which have caused the collapse of such an important sector.
Will the Commission allow European aid to the agricultural sector to be cut off?
And does this mean that European agriculture will no longer receive preferential treatment?
Mr President, I speak for a sector which diversifies agriculture and which truly has great potential for economic development. Mr Fischler is not well acquainted with the Mediterranean area.
He ought however to make it his business to become acquainted with the benefits of this sector. It is important for the processing industry, has a most favourable impact on the environment and arrests desertification.
Commissioner, I call on you to amend your position and come into line with the spirit of the Council' s agreement.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, you too have gone one minute over your time.
We do have a little time to spare, which is why I am not being quite so strict as I might be.
Nevertheless, we ought to keep to our speaking times.
Once civil servants reach the rank of Commissioner, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, they acquire the ability to do two things at once!
Mr President, Commissioner, I shall try to compensate for the fact that the previous speaker overran her time by not using all the time allocated to me.
Our group' s position is that we support Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s report whilst also congratulating the Commission insofar as it is simplifying the procedure.
It is important to note that simplification. Simplification is often heralded but rarely achieved.
I think something will be achieved this time, because a need which has been mentioned in Parliament on numerous occasions, adopted almost unanimously and accepted by the Council has been recognised.
For example, the resolutions dated 16 June and 26 October are in that spirit.
We are now proposing that the improvement plans be extended.
We do not merely wish them to be extended for one year only.
Instead, we would like the amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development requesting a two-year extension taken into account.
We trust the Commission and the Commissioner will be sensitive to these proposals.
They are necessary and the Commissioner is perfectly well aware that a year is not long enough to assess the report on the future evolution of the COM in fruit he is due to submit. Nor is it long enough to find a permanent solution for the shell and pod fruit sector, which will have to become part of the fruit and vegetable sector under special conditions.
I am aware that all this will prove costly, and that current funding for this major problem is inadequate.
However, we cannot allow sectors which are so important to their regions to be written off as a result of agreements signed earlier. Community preference arrangements in those agreements made it hard for the sector to survive, not to mention a whole range of points already made concerning its environmental and social significance.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the unanimity evident at the vote and throughout the drafting of this report identifying the main concerns felt by the sector.
The European Parliament' s resolution of 16 June contains an ongoing appeal for the search for a solution which will provide for direct support for farmers' income to be awarded, enabling production to continue and preventing the depopulation of very underprivileged areas.
I should like to highlight how these crops contribute to environmental conservation in the most desertified areas of the Union. This is true of almonds and hazelnuts, for example.
As for chestnuts, they are produced in indigenous Community forests, which are preserved for that purpose.
The Commission is therefore called upon to put forward proposals offering clear support to the sector. A flat rate of aid per hectare to be administered by producers' organisations should be introduced and the structural crisis in the sector should be addressed.
In conclusion, the present arrangements should be extended until the introduction of permanent support measures for these products. They are of regional importance, offer a high level of food safety, are a source of energy in the Mediterranean diet and make a valuable contribution to safeguarding the environment.
Mr President, Commissioner, nuts, to which we should also add the locust bean, are one of southern Europe' s most common crops.
The only specific aid from which they have benefited in the past and from which they benefit today is limited to cofinancing under plans to improve quality and marketing which expired at the end of last year and which the Commission is now proposing to extend by another year.
This Commission proposal has come about as a result of the acknowledgement, as made by the Commission itself in the preamble to its proposal, that other measures, for which the sector is also eligible, have not been sufficient or directly applicable to nuts.
The Commission therefore promised to present new proposals in a report that it would publish by the end of 2000, which it has still not done.
It makes no sense to extend the already scarce measures in place by another year and to say nothing else about the future of this sector, still less so in that the sector is undergoing a particular crisis due to the extremely strong competition from third countries.
What would make sense is for nuts to be treated as a separate sector within the Common Organisation of the Markets in fruits and vegetables.
This was why, as a matter of fact, at the time of the proposal on the new COM in fruits and vegetables, the European Parliament adopted an amendment requesting the Commission to present proposals that would provide the nut sector with permanent measures and aid of the kind that exist for other agricultural sectors.
This is what the rapporteur is proposing and this is what we hope the Commission will put right.
In the short term, until these future measures materialise, the most prudent course of action to adopt would be to extend existing aid not by one year but by two, as the European Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has suggested.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, for your report and to express my thanks to everyone else for the time and effort they have put into the 22 amendments.
Before I deal with these, allow me to say a few brief words on the basic principles that underlie our proposal.
The present regime for nuts and locust beans has been in place for ten years, and the first quality-improvement plans expired in the year 2000.
During this ten-year period, 92 producers' organisations have been awarded a total of EUR 750 million in Community funding to improve the production and marketing of nuts and locust beans.
Successful restructuring has indeed been effected in some cases, and producers have become more competitive.
As a result, they are generally in a stronger position than they used to be when it comes to securing markets for their goods and competing successfully with suppliers from countries outside the EU.
An amount of EUR 250 million is earmarked once again for the agreements and measures that are still in force.
The Commission believes that the ten-year plan has, in principle, adequately achieved the goal that was set ten years ago, namely the creation of a stable basis for economically viable producer organisations.
The Council, however, asked the Commission to propose the continuation of the payments to nut and locust bean producers in the 2001 financial year.
This was the basis on which the Commission drew up its proposal.
Your amendments show that this proposal does not go far enough for your liking.
The amendments, some of which refer to resolutions adopted by the European Parliament in June and October of last year, chiefly relate to three areas.
One group of amendments, comprising Nos 14, 15, 17 and 20, seeks to maintain the aid for quality and marketing-improvement plans beyond the year 2001 and to treat as eligible expenditure all money spent on work that is carried out by the end of 2002.
Amendments Nos 10 and 11 refer to the modest level of funds required for this purpose.
The purpose of the second group of amendments, comprising Nos 8 and 18, is to maintain the special aid for hazelnuts through to the end of 2002.
Both groups of amendments are at least partly motivated by a perceived need to protect EU producers from imports.
As far as these amendments are concerned, let me make the following points: firstly, the framework of this proposal is confined to the funding of programmes under the budget for 2001.
It was never meant to be extended to the 2002 financial year, because that would entail additional costs amounting to EUR 82 million.
Secondly, specific aid for hazelnuts is not covered by the proposal.
Its inclusion would generate a further EUR 110 million in additional budgetary expenditure over and above the cost of the present proposal, which is assessed at EUR 24 million.
Amendment No 16, which deals with chestnuts, does not fall within the scope of the regime we are debating here.
The third group of amendments, comprising Nos 6, 7, 12, 13, 21 and 22, are designed to secure the long-term future of nut and locust bean production by means of other support measures.
In addition, Amendments Nos 9 and 19 propose the continuation of support within the framework of the Common Organisation of the Market and of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.
With regard to this third group, allow me to tell you how the Commission sees the future of this area of economic activity and the support it should receive.
If we consider the present situation with regard to the production of nuts and locust beans, we see, on the one hand, economically viable and very definitely competitive producer organisations, which are, in a manner of speaking, the Union' s flagship producers. It is they who grow new varieties and who use modern production and marketing methods.
These producers have made good use of the money we have provided over the past ten years and a number of them will surely also be able to benefit from the extension that is under discussion today.
On the other hand, unfortunately, there are also producers and producer organisations that have to operate in extremely difficult conditions - in disadvantaged areas, for instance, many of which are in remote mountainous regions - with no irrigation facilities.
In these areas there are literally thousands of families who remain partly or totally dependent on nut and/or locust bean production for their livelihood.
On account of the natural disadvantages that their geographical location imposes on all of these producers, they will always find it difficult to compete with importers from countries outside the EU.
For this reason, we believe it makes far more sense - and this, indeed, is one of the aims we set ourselves in 1999 - to support this latter group of producers, whose problems are primarily of a social nature, in the framework of rural development.
That is why we built this second pillar of the common agricultural policy, and so it is right to make use of it in this context.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, responsibility for rural development has also been shifted to the Member States, which must include measures of this type in their programmes and accord them due priority.
Having done so, the Member States are then free to decide on the precise nature of their rural development projects.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.47 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.)
VOTE
. Mr President, we have a situation here where under Rule 67 and Rule 68 we can choose what to do now with this initiative.
Under Rule 68, we would normally ask the Council to withdraw the proposal.
However, I have conferred with the rapporteur and others. The committee does not particularly wish to see this proposal come back.
We would prefer to use the precedent which we established in the case of dual-use goods of a vote now to reject the Council's proposal.
Members may be interested to know that in order to reject the proposal, we have to vote in favour of the draft legislative resolution.
This is because, having rejected the modified proposal, the services automatically now change the text so that the text reads "Council rejects".
We are asking Parliament to now vote in favour of the legislative resolution which rejects the Council's text.
I hope I have made myself clear!
Mr Watson, you put that very neatly.
We can do that and there is a precedent.
I can confirm that, as is being communicated to me on my headphones by the services.
We can do it in accordance with the procedure that you propose.
Mr Poettering has the floor.
Mr President, a moment ago you quite rightly asked where the Council was.
The Council ought to be delivering an opinion.
I find it unacceptable that the Council is not represented here, and we should voice our protest to the Council.
Mr Poettering, in my opinion you are completely correct.
I shall ensure that the President, Mrs Fontaine, communicates our displeasure to the Council.
I concur with the warm applause for Mr Poettering on that point.
We shall now proceed to vote on the legislative resolution amended in accordance with Mr Watson' s communication in which Article 1 rejects the accordingly modified initiative of the French Republic.
Mr President, I should just like Parliament to be clear about what it is voting on here.
I am asking Parliament to do as we did before - to vote in favour of this in order to reject the Council's proposal.
Mr Watson, you, and some others with you, were momentarily confused.
The vote is completely clear.
If you want it rejected you must vote in favour.
I give the floor to the rapporteur.
Mr President, I believe it is important that the rapporteur says a brief word on this.
I regret that we have not managed to exercise our parliamentary responsibility.
But Mr Watson is right, and we should support him.
I appeal for the support of every Member, otherwise we shall make our Parliament look ridiculous.
Mr President, I was the shadow rapporteur for my group, and there is no doubt that we engaged in very fruitful cooperation.
However, one of our key points in Article 4 has been rejected, and so I must recommend that my group vote against this report, contrary to our previous agreement.
Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to lodge a complaint concerning the unacceptable behaviour of the Vice-President, Mr Friedrich. He should be setting an example as regards compliance with the Rules of Procedure and he has done exactly the opposite in this case.
(Applause and protests)
Mr President, I do not wish to speak on the subject of the debate.
I merely wish to say that no Member of this House has the right to single out any fellow Member with that sort of remark.
Mr President, it is certainly true that the House agreed very amicably on a common starting point and a common line in the debate on the preparation for Stockholm.
The PPE-DE proposal that was rejected is a mere nuance.
By no stretch of the imagination is it one of the cornerstones of the resolution.
I am very disappointed that this House, which is unanimous in its desire to demand more rights for the European Parliament, has neither the competence nor the guts to make a joint contribution to the Stockholm Summit.
(Loud sustained applause)
Mr President, I have to say that I prepared some of my explanations of vote yesterday, which was Valentine's Day, and so they may reflect some of the spirit of the day.
With regard to this document, drawn up by Mrs Peijs, which concerns a directive on the reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings, I have to say that Mrs Peijs is certainly - as always - attentive to financial issues.
I hope that, whenever this issue - which I voted for - is debated in future, my request to help pensioners throughout Europe by prioritising the liquidation of pension policies in the winding up-of insurance companies which have gone bankrupt will be remembered.
Lambert Report (A5-0026/2001)
Mr President, I voted against the Lambert report because the Council of the European Union does not actually intend to regulate the important matter of the movement of workers who need to make sure that they do not lose any of their pensions.
For example, Italy refuses to pay old-age and invalidity pensions to European Union citizens who move to other States of the Union.
However, it allows the citizens of non-Community countries who come to Italy to cash their pension contributions when they leave, after which they can come back and claim the same old-age and invalidity pensions and helplessness allowances which are denied to Italian citizens who move to other States of the European Union.
It is high time that the issue of European Union citizens' pensions was dealt with properly.
The European institutions themselves are starting to be ashamed of the minimum standards enshrined in Community legislation on social matters, drawn up any old how, yet while taking good care not to touch employers' prerogatives in any country whatsoever.
The very fact that, with every passing year, additional steps to harmonise the rights of employees moving within the European Union are not taken indicates that, thirty years after the initial directives, there is no more harmonisation than there are Community rights to bring employers to book.
Harmonising the situation of EU workers ought to mean that employers and Member States are obliged to bring wages throughout the European Union in line with those of countries where they are highest and to stipulate the same social rights for the whole of the Union in line with the social provision for illness, unemployment and retirement that is most advantageous to the workers.
The only form of harmonisation which the European Union is interested in, however, is harmonisation of the rules governing competition between industrial and financial groups.
The movement of workers is considered only insofar as it affects the movement of goods and of capital.
The reason that we did not vote against this report is only because we did not wish to stand in the way of a few scant benefits that specific categories of workers may gain from it.
Since, however, we are completely opposed to the motivation of this approach, we did not vote in favour of it either.
UK Conservatives are broadly happy with the original Lambert Report, which in its initial form usefully cleaned up some technical matters.
Specifically however, we have voted against Amendments Nos 8 onwards.
These amendments would significantly have extended the material scope of the Regulation: this should not be the role of miscellaneous amendments.
It should be specifically noted that supplementary pensions are NOT State-provided social security payments, and cannot therefore come within the scope of Regulation 1408/71.
Similarly, one amendment attempts to extend the scope of the regulation to taxation: this is simply not acceptable.
UK Conservative MEPs will continue to resist any amendments to any report at any time which attempt to make similar encroachments into Member State competences.
Free movement of persons
We have voted in favour of the motion for resolution because we think that the Council needs to push ahead with the work on simplifying Regulation 1408/71 and extending it so that citizens of third countries who are engaged in active employment and have legal residence may also be covered.
We have voted against paragraph 1 of the motion for resolution which states that Article 42 of the Treaty of Amsterdam is to be the legal basis for securing social security rights for third-country citizens.
We do not agree with that.
The Council must find another legal basis, for example Article 63 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that the objective may be achieved.
We voted in favour of this resolution only because it proposes thoroughgoing reform of the Community regulations on the free movement of workers within the European Union and proposes that their rights be maintained from one country to the next.
The new regulations when they finally emerge must, however, be in line with the regulations in those countries where the terms are the most advantageous to the workers in all areas.
If this is not the case, we shall vote against.
I think that this discussion should never have taken place in the European Parliament.
So I voted against the whole resolution.
The Danish Social Democrats have today abstained from voting in the final vote on this motion for resolution, tabled against the background of an oral question concerning the free movement of persons in connection with Regulation 1408.
We do not agree that Articles 42 and 308 constitute the legal basis for allowing third-country citizens to be covered under Regulation 1408, but think that Article 63, subsection 4 should do so.
We cannot support the attempt to bend the Treaty in this way when there is an adequate legal basis elsewhere in the Treaty, just because a few other procedural regulations concerning the involvement of the European Parliament are at issue.
If another legal basis is required, the Treaty must, in our view, be altered.
We should like to emphasise that we support a general reform of Regulation 1408. However, we believe that a reform of this kind would be made more difficult if its scope were to be extended to include more people.
We would also emphasise our concern that those from third countries who are seeking work and who are legally resident in the EU must have the opportunity to obtain employment in the EU.
The EPLP has voted for the motion for resolution on the free movement of persons, but with an important reservation.
The EPLP supports the Tampere conclusions that the EU must ensure fair treatment of third-country nationals who legally reside in its territory and recognise that there needs to be a resolution to the situation of Regulation 1408/71/EEC not covering third-country nationals.
However, the EPLP does not support the view that the legal base should be Article 42 and 308.
The EPLP supports the Council and a number of Member States who wish the legal base to remain Article 63.
Lucas Report (A5-0036/2001)
Mr President, the Pensioners' Party, which I am pleased to represent in this House, supports all documents, all initiatives and all actions by means of which the European Union acts to help states all over the world which need to increase cooperation with the States of the European Union.
In my opinion, Europe truly exists - has the right to exist - above all when it combines the strengths of its 15 component States in order to be stronger, more effective and, in this case, more generous in its cooperation with states who find themselves in a state of want.
And this is the spirit of the Lucas report, which provides for assistance, cooperation and an economic partnership with Mexico, a state with a great cultural tradition which has always taken care to maintain economic cooperation with the States of the European Union, cooperation which, I hope, will also serve to improve the social situation of the pensioners and elderly people of that country.
This report speaks of economic partnership, but it is nothing more than an attempt to promote the major European firms on the Mexican market against American competition.
Past experience shows that this type of partnership is very profitable to the industrial groups but does nothing more than drive the people of the country concerned into even greater poverty.
Over half of the 95 million inhabitants of Mexico already live in poverty, without counting those that are driven to emigrate precisely because of this type of partnership which is based on exploitation.
We therefore voted against this report.
Ceyhun Report (A5-0315/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the motion because I was against it, as did the majority of the other Members of the European Parliament.
"Wolf!
Wolf!" cried a shepherd boy who wanted to play a trick on his friends.
In fact, his cry "Wolf!
Wolf!" summoned all the villagers, who asked, "Where is the wolf?"
To which the shepherd boy replied "Ha ha!
It's a joke.
There isn't a wolf!"
Three days later, he shouted again: "Wolf!
Wolf!"
All the villagers arrived asking: "Where is the wolf?"
"Ha ha ha!
It's a joke.
There isn't a wolf!"
A week later, a wolf really came and started to tear the sheep to pieces.
"Wolf!
Wolf!", cried the shepherd boy, but nobody came from the village to help.
And the wolf ate all the sheep.
I have told you this story because we have to realise that we must do something practical in our immigration policy, not just talk and cry "Wolf!".

Mr President, following that completely incomprehensible diatribe from our colleague over there, I want to make a serious contribution, although the situation with the recommendation being rejected is somewhat different.
Along with my British Labour colleagues of the PSE, I voted in favour of the underlying principles and sentiments of the Ceyhun report.
In doing so, we recognised that the proposals were far from perfect but they did at least attempt to address the present situation.
The European Union and individual countries must do more to address the problems and circumstances in the countries of origin that cause people to seek refuge in the European Union.
Progress in this area cannot be made overnight and, in the meantime, the interests of desperate people, understandably fleeing from conflict, persecution or other hardship, are not well served by pushing them into the hands of the unscrupulous and those seeking to make money out of trafficking people.
The situation of organisations who assist asylum-seekers and refugees has been raised as a contentious issue, but the report recognises that these are legally recognised organisations, responsible and established NGOs, many of whom have a strong and proud record of supporting the very people that this report seeks to assist.
In voting for the Ceyhun report we recognise the complexities of this issue and will continue to work for a full and common asylum system for the European Union that has humanity and the interests of the most vulnerable at its core.
The two French initiatives intended to better combat illegal immigration have, in the first instance, been changed beyond all recognition by the European Parliament amendments designed to limit their scope.
Furthermore, in the second instance, they have been rejected by Parliament, thanks, in part, to my vote, and that of the MPF Members, against.
Our vote against should be taken to mean, of course, that we reject the amendments, but we do actually endorse the original French initiative and would like to see it acted upon.
The vote of the European Parliament on this matter was, in fact, merely consultative, pursuant to Article 67(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
I find the amendments initially adopted by the European Parliament particularly regrettable.
A good number of them, as I explained in the course of last night' s debate, would have the effect of putting the definition of measures against illegal immigration off until the Greek Calends on the grounds that a whole host of other policies in all sorts of areas would have to be implemented first.
This was a completely erroneous position, but I shall not harp on the subject.
There was a second category of amendments which tried to reduce the force of the text by exempting various categories of offender from punishment, for example, the illegal immigrants themselves or the persons assisting them on putatively humanitarian grounds.
Such exceptions were completely inappropriate.
In particular, these "humanitarian" smugglers must not be exempted from prosecution.
Firstly, because all the mafia groups smuggling people into countries illegally in return for payment would then claim humanitarian reasons.
Secondly, because even the illegal immigrants that have been assisted by charitably minded people almost inevitably wind up in exploitative situations, as often as not, purely by dint of their illegal status.
And finally because the possibly genuinely disinterested persons who assist illegal immigrants are probably doing the immigrants themselves no good but are certainly doing their fellow citizens no good by presenting them with a problem which will be practically impossible to resolve for generations to come.
We wish to denounce the French Presidency initiative which is focussed in its entirety on the criminalisation of what it terms 'illegal immigration' .
For the perpetrators of this infamy, it is not just a matter of terminology, as the police force of the Socialist Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, has just forcibly expelled illegal immigrants that had take refuge in the Parisian church of Saint Bernard in precisely the same way that his right-wing predecessor, JuppÃ©, had people deported from the same place four years previously.
Regarding the causes driving hundreds of thousands of poor people out of their country of origin in order to attempt to survive elsewhere, the European Union has nothing but fine words.
In order to put an end to poverty in these countries, the European institutions would have to take on the plunderers and exploiters of these countries.
Since they are unable to cure the illness, they opt to penalise the victims.
While the French Presidency announces a Europe-wide witch-hunt against these "victims of oppression" , it points the finger at the squalid modern day slave traders, but only does so in order to cast a veil over the parties for whom the smugglers are recruiting, i.e. big business, construction giants and any number of smaller scale employers who thereby benefit from an immigrant workforce provided, at the discretion of employers and the police, by laws which do not grant them even minimal protection.
This report confines itself to smoothing out some of what it considers to be the more repulsive aspects of the French initiatives.
We have voted against the report as a whole, while voting in favour of the amendments which might temper or eliminate the despicably repressive nature of the French proposals.
. (NL) I should like to take this opportunity to explain in more detail, also on behalf of my colleagues, Mr Belder and Mr van Dam, my voting behaviour in respect of the Ceyhun report.
I have voted against the report and against many of the amendments submitted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.
In view of the sensitivity of the subject, assistance with illegal immigration, a subject that always triggers intense emotions, I wish to explain my motives.
Let me say at the outset that I fully support the reception of recognised refugees as defined in the meeting in Geneva.
The latter should be received in all Member States and granted asylum.
Unfortunately, the general use of the word refugee for all those who seek sanctuary in the Union creates confusion in this report.
What is an illegal refugee?
If that person applies for asylum on entry he is not illegal.
The terms foreigners, refugees, illegal immigrants, asylum seekers and suchlike are used in an inconsistent way.
Such a careless use of terms does not belong in a legal text, in which, moreover, definitions have to be laid down and the framework of criminal law agreed.
I recognise that deported asylum seekers often find themselves in a distressing position.
Humanitarian aid from churches and organisations jumps into the breach created by the inability of Member States and the international community to find a satisfactory solution.
For this reason I have some sympathy for the appeal not to punish these organisations for giving assistance to illegal immigrants.
But a more nuanced definition is required.
A problem arises where the judgment of the independent judiciary based on legislation is constantly undermined by the subjective judgment of aid providers.
Apart from that, how do you define 'humanitarian aid' ?
Does it also apply to a charity that, for example, has the aim of helping as many poor Russians as possible to enter a Member State illegally?
The dramatic circumstances of illegal immigration are a humanitarian disgrace.
Stringent, harmonised criminal legislation on traffickers in human beings is necessary. To complement this a strict but fair asylum policy is needed, which must send a clear signal of discouragement to illegal immigrants.
Accordingly, I support the proposals of the French Government.
The French initiative, through the proposed directive and the proposed framework decision, offers only the solution of criminalisation to the problem of illegal immigration.
Proposing to step up the penal framework for prosecution for assisting the illegal entry and residence of immigrants is tantamount to making solidarity a crime.
The proposed amendments are right to distinguish the assistance provided in return for payment from the assistance provided out of solidarity, on humanitarian grounds.
Criminalising the people and organisations fighting against Fortress Europe is not, however, an effective tactic against the underground networks and smugglers.
What should be combated, rather, is this ever more restrictive visa and asylum policy which forces people to enter European Union territory illegally.
What should be combated are the structural adjustment policies and policies imposing the Community acquis which exacerbate unemployment in candidate countries, and the logic of development aid packages for countries in the South which are completely inadequate and unfairly distributed.
A policy of cancelling debt and of ensuring equitable development aid would be a first essential step towards a different kind of European policy on immigration.
We are resolutely opposed to the logic behind criminalising immigration and that is why i voted against the draft French initiative, even in its amended form.
We might have thought that at long last we had a text which would lay down some outline for the fight against illegal immigration in Europe, even if it was only a sketchy draft, but that was not to be!
This report, on the contrary, in response to an initiative from the French Republic which was, I must stress, relatively acceptable, is nothing but a trap and, worse than that, an incitement to crime, illegal immigration, lawlessness and violence.
The rapporteur seeks to punish only the smugglers and organisation involved in illegal immigration networks.
Are the foreigners that have entered a Member State' s territory illegally not to be seen as having committed any offence (Article 2, Amendment No 9)?
How can we fail to be outraged at this?
Are we to think that illegal immigrants should be seen as the victims of a system in which they are actually the players?
If criminalisation must seek primarily to penalise the organisers of illegal immigration, it must also firmly penalise the immigrants themselves, specifically by deporting them back to their country of origin in order to make them accept their responsibilities and deter them from offending again.
Similarly, the report aims to exempt the humanitarian organisations assisting illegal immigrants from any form of penalty (Article 4, Amendment No 11).
Illegal immigration should not be encouraged in any way whatsoever.
Our leaders must adopt a hard line in combating illegal because in so doing they are also combating security problems, organised crime (drugs trafficking, money laundering, etc.), and even the forced prostitution of young women from Eastern Europe or Latin America, most of whom have illegally entered one of the countries of the European Union, which is unfortunately only a mythical El Dorado.
Our national governments must beware, for there is no room for lenience and fine feelings here: they can only lead to a lax and irresponsible attitude.
By leading policies with an inordinate emphasis on human rights, by practising a policy of systematically regularising the status of illegal immigrants and immigrants in irregular situation and by foisting the integration and assimilation of these people from outside Europe on our societies, we are endangering the whole social and demographic balance and the very identity of the European nations affected.
The Council' s proposal for a directive concerning unauthorised entry, movement and residence is another in a series of proposals for repressive measures, tabled in the legal sphere.
In spite of the fact that the Member States have agreed to establish a common immigration and asylum policy, all energy is being focused upon producing proposals aimed only at making it more difficult for people to enter the EU, whether they be refugees or people looking for work.
A large number of Europeans choose to hide often unknown people who have been smuggled in or have managed by their own efforts to get themselves over the border and into the EU countries.
Those people who, with no thought at all of profit, make an effort on behalf of people in fear of their lives, must not be punished.
This type of humanitarian aid is now entirely lawful in, for example, Sweden and ought not to be criminalised.
Europe needs a common immigration and asylum policy characterised by humanitarianism.
We have an obligation to help people who find their way here in order to obtain sanctuary, irrespective of whether they are refugees from war-torn areas or asylum seekers fleeing political oppression.
Europe must also change its attitude to legal immigration and open its borders to citizens of third countries who wish to look for work in the European Union.
The basis must be that people should be allowed to travel freely into the European Union and not be prevented from doing so by a restrictive policy on visas and work permits.
By means of a policy which affirms both asylum seekers and immigrants, we can get on top of organised crime and the human tragedies for which traffickers in human beings are responsible.
. (NL) For as long as there have been huge differences in income in the world, people have migrated from poor to rich countries.
In the past that migration was actually encouraged by governments, since businesses suffered from a shortage of labour, and it looks as if this is about to be repeated.
The fundamental problem, the unequal distribution of wealth among humankind, is not solved in this way.
There are also people who are not asked to come, but who are forced to leave their country of origin.
Once they have left they can no longer return in safety, since the prevailing regime threatens them with imprisonment or even the death penalty.
Unfortunately it is still common for such people to be turned away or sent back at the border.
The tough outer borders of 'Fortress Europe' are driving more and more people into the hands of unscrupulous human smugglers, who are greedy for fat profits and abandon people to their lot before the port or border river is reached.
It is right that this mafia should be tackled.
On the other hand it is madness to start punishing the solidarity of pressure groups and churches with political refugees and workers employed for a long period of time in a Member State of the EU without the correct papers.
The Ceyhun report moves in the right direction, but is still inadequate.
There are various causes of illegal immigration, but I believe that the main causes are, on the one hand, the desire to escape from the difficult situations many countries are now experiencing and to find a better standard of living, and, on the other, the construction of a Fortress Europe, which is making access to Member States' territory increasingly difficult for citizens of third countries.
At the same time, like the rapporteur, I believe that the greatest offenders in illegal immigration are those who make financial profit from this process.
As this is the case, we can only endorse the establishment of a punitive framework that will act as a sufficient deterrent, penalising not only the smugglers and traffickers of human beings, but also the employers who take advantage of this situation.
Nevertheless, in addition to adopting these measures, we will have to carry out an effective assessment of the situation and implement measures designed to ensure the effective integration of these workers, guaranteeing them rights and social status rather than, as has increasingly been the case, the sudden expulsion of citizens who are discovered to be in an illegal situation.
Since we are in favour of a common asylum policy at EU level, we support the idea of introducing common regulations to combat trafficking in human beings, provided that this does not in any way punish humanitarian initiatives.
We nonetheless believe that the framework decision in favour of common penalties needs to be improved.
Korakas Report (A5-0022/2001)
Mr President, last night I had a dream, probably induced by the fact that it was Valentine's Day yesterday.
I dreamed that I was in Greece, in Crete, in the town of Agios Nikolaos, where it is said that Venus rose out of the lake.
I dreamed of Venus herself rising out of the beautiful water of Crete. Turning towards me, she said, "Mr Fatuzzo, Mr Fatuzzo!"
"What's the matter?" I replied.
She said to me: "I know that tomorrow, at the European Parliament, you are going to vote on a document on cotton grown in Greece.
I am tired of rising from the lake naked.
I am cold, absolutely freezing.
I would like a cotton dress and so, tomorrow, please would you vote for the Korakas report so that there will be more cotton in Greece!"
The dream vanished, but I did what I had been told to by the apparition and voted for the Korakas report.
The Commission's proposals for cotton are unacceptable because:
the European Union produces too little cotton
the principle of Community preference is being blatantly violated
hundreds of thousands of family holdings depend on cotton production
despite the problems, cotton growing may cause less pollution than other industrial crops
the minimum guaranteed quantities do not match actual production.
We therefore need to:
increase the guaranteed quantity, so that it matches actual production. The proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament are a step - albeit hesitant - in the right direction
cost inflation over recent years into the price of cotton
exempt small growers from coresponsibility levies
give professional organisations a proper say in the qualitative assessment of the product
take special steps to support small growers.
We Swedish Social Democrats believe that the EU' s agricultural aid ought to be considerably reduced and are therefore opposed to certain of the demands presented in Mr Korakas' s report.
We welcome the Commission' s proposal to increase fines in the case of over-production, but do not back the demands by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to maintain the percentage of damages as it stands (Amendment No 12).
We also oppose the demand to establish new Community financial aid to producers' organisations, as tabled in Amendments 18 and 19.
We have voted against the Korakas report, on aid for cotton production.
The report calls for an increase in quotas and fixed prices on cotton and also seeks to regulate the role of cotton producers' associations.
We have also rejected the Izquierdo Rojo report, calling for increased aid for the production of nuts and locust beans.
Both reports call for the protectionist measures, such as preservation of the system for community preference.
It is not reasonable that half of the Union's budget is devoted to subsidising production and exports of agricultural products.
We believe that EU funds should instead be spent on purposes where cross-border cooperation is needed.
Environmental protection, aid for reconstruction and development assistance are fields where increased funding is essential, not least in light of the upcoming enlargement of the Union.
The common agricultural policy is not only very costly for the European citizens, but also contributes to higher consumer prices and lower quality.
Consumers express concern about European food production and have rightly begun to question the present the agricultural policies.
Export subsidies, leading to the dumping of EU food surpluses on the world market, is the reason behind the serious difficulties for food production in many developing countries.
The CAP was established in order to secure the provision of food after the second world war, not to subsidise unprofitable cultivation of crops used for textile production.
The common agricultural policy of today has lost its political legitimacy and must be completely reformed.
All aid to exports and production should be abolished.
Agriculture needs to adapt to market rules in order to be exposed to competition.
This will increase efficiency and quality, to the benefit of both production and consumers.
The European Union cotton consumption stands at more than 4 million tonnes while its production capacity is only approximately 1.5 million tonnes.
We therefore have to import the balance.
Apparently there is nothing too shocking about this, given that, after all, we already import cars, fruit, vegetables, etc., and so why not cotton too?
It would be unbelievable if, given the shortfall in cotton production, the European Commission actually banned further cotton production, but that is in fact the case!
There are quotas and penalties in place to limit European cotton production to approximately 1 million tonnes, instead of the 1.5 million tonnes that we are capable of producing.
There is a ban on cotton production in Spain and Greece, with hundreds of small farms in Andalusia, Thrace and Valencia.
To make matters worse, there are plans to increase the so-called "coresponsibility" levy to more than the current penalty of 50% of the overshoot of the quota.
And all this benefits the United States and Australia.
In this instance, unlike the case for sugar and rice, it is no longer a matter of sacrificing our own farmers in order to assist the poor in - for instance -the Sudan, a country responsible for exterminating the Christian population of the south.
Oh no, there is no such excuse in the case of cotton.
It is not like the milk sector, where quotas can be justified due to overproduction.
Our sacrifices are not justified in terms of assisting the 48 least developed countries.
Europe is blocking production and the only beneficiaries are the United States and Australia.
We saw this in the case of oil- and protein-rich crops which we nonetheless need as substitutes for meat meal.
We saw this in the case of Californian almonds, and in the case of bananas.
Now we have cotton too.
What good, then, are the European defence system, the euro, the European Constitution and all the other folderols about the Europe we must have, if Europe is the specific entity which is stopping us producing, however modestly, the cotton we need, so as not to ruffle the feathers of the United States, a country we are also freely allowing to spy on us day and night through the Echelon system.
The Greek economy is more dependent than that of the other Member States on small businesses in the agricultural sector.
That applies particularly to crops that can only be grown on the southern edge of Europe, such as cotton and tobacco.
Both crops have their disadvantages.
Tobacco is bad for public health.
Cotton is a useful product, but its cultivation involves the use of large amounts of toxins. Those toxins find their way into the scarce water sources or pollutes arid land.
In Egypt and Uzbekistan, countries that are far more dependent than Greece on cotton production, this has caused major environmental problems.
That consideration might be a reason for me not to agree with the report of my fellow group Member, Mr Korakas.
From a Greek perspective and particularly from that of the small farmers in that country, the report is of course quite justified.
Its starting premise is the protection and expansion of production and the creation of the financial preconditions for that.
In the longer term, however, those considerations of incomes policy must be weighed against environmental interests, the conditions under which imported cotton is produced and the burden of the common agricultural policy on the financial resources of the EU.
Until those matters are tackled in a fundamental way I am able to support the Korakas proposals.
British Conservative Members of the PPE-DE Group voted against this report because we feel that it moves too far away from the Commission's original intention of tightening up budgetary control mechanisms.
Further, while being sensitive to the socio-economic function of cotton-growing in certain regions, we strongly dispute the rapporteur's assessment that cotton is less environmentally hazardous than other crops.
It is well known that a vast array of chemicals are used in cotton-production and we therefore support the Commission's aim for Member States to determine and adopt the appropriate environmental measures to regulate the use of agricultural land used to produce cotton.
The insistence that Member States remind producers of the need to comply with environmental legislation is particularly welcomed by British Conservatives.
Izquierdo Rojo Report (A5-0035/2001)
Mr President, I did not dream about the Izquierdo Rojo document, which provides for aid to the producers of certain agricultural products, including hazelnuts.
I have to tell you, Mr President, that my daughter Elisabetta has a tiny pet, a guinea pig, therefore a rodent, called Schumi.
Being a rodent, it eats hazelnuts, and so I decided to ask it, as an expert, what it thought of the report.
"In Europe, not enough hazelnuts are grown. We must increase hazelnut production," it said.
I feel that advice from such an interested user, a connoisseur consumer of these nuts, cannot be ignored, and so I voted for the development of hazelnut production in Europe.
The production of nuts - hazelnuts, walnuts, peanuts and almonds - and locust beans may provide jobs for thousands of producers and help to stop many areas from being depopulated, especially in the Mediterranean.
The Commission has a serious responsibility here, because the 1989 restrictive support measures started in essence in 1996, with certain exceptions for programmes which had already begun.
The Commission's new proposal extends the programmes which were maintained for a further year.
I agree with the rapporteur that these programmes should be maintained for at least two years and, more importantly, that the Commission should present an overall proposal for liberalising and broadening the support mechanisms for the production of nuts and locust beans.
Otherwise, the whole sector will be brought to its knees by imports from the USA and Asia.
We Swedish Social Democrats believe that the EU' s agricultural aid ought to be substantially reduced and are therefore opposed to certain of the demands presented in Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s report.
We do not back the demands by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for continued financing of quality and marketing improvement plans for a further period of two years (Amendments 14, 15 and 17).
We also oppose the demand, made in Amendment 22, to secure permanent support for the nut sector by means of new flat-rate aid per hectare aimed at preserving existing income levels for producers.
I voted for this report because the rapporteur advocates extending aid for an important sector that is currently in crisis. As a matter of fact, I voted the same way previously, by approving a proposal included in the JovÃ© report on the COM in fruits and vegetables.
I also agree with the rapporteur' s stance, advocating increasing the extension to two years, in order to give the Commission time to prepare a new system of aid for nuts, including locust beans, and the introduction of aid for hazelnuts.
In any event, this extension must be maintained until the new system comes into force, and this should be included in the COM in fruits and vegetables.
It is crucial that in this new system the Commission takes account of the enormous socio-economic importance of these nuts for the countries of southern Europe as well as their environmental role in combating desertification.
Unless aid is increased, the sector will be in serious danger, given the competition it faces, which is largely due to the increase in cheap imports from third countries.
Restructuring operations and mergers in industry
This resolution takes it for granted not only that industrial restructuring is necessary but that such restructuring necessarily entails layoffs, and that we must mitigate the effects of these.
Since we are not in favour of the market economy, competition and competitiveness, we shall not enter into a discussion of whether competitiveness does or does not necessitate restructuring.
The question we ask is why should it be the workers that have to pay the price of competitiveness?
Instead of cutting costs by reducing the wage bill, why not deduct a similar amount from the revenue due to company owners and shareholders?
The resolution takes it for granted that shareholder revenue should be protected rather than safeguarding workers' wages.
Therefore, despite a few token expressions intended to convince us of the author' s good intentions on social matters, we voted against the resolution.
(PPE-DE), in writing.
The level of ongoing unemployment in continental Europe is far too high.
It is a direct reflection of entrenched labour market rigidities plus the administrative burdens on business of high costs and excessive regulation.
Continual industrial restructuring is vital for a healthy economy, for the replacement of yesterday's unwanted jobs with the fresh jobs needed for the future.
More regulation is the problem, not the solution.
Because of our desire to see more jobs not less, UK Conservatives have voted against this resolution.
In Portugal, as in a number of countries in the European Union, industrial restructuring has often brought large-scale redundancies, greater job instability and huge economic and social costs, particularly for the countries and regions that are directly involved, thereby endangering their economic and social cohesion.
In Portugal, just in the last few months, thousands of workers in various companies in the metallurgy, shipbuilding, electronics, footwear, textile and clothing industries have been threatened with redundancy and early retirement, or have been pressured into accepting voluntary redundancy. The specific companies involved are the Siderurgia Nacional group, the ABB group, Renault, Setenave and Lisnave, Indelma/Siemens, J.C.Clark and Vesticom.
This extremely serious situation requires particular attention both on the part of Member State governments and of Community bodies, in order to amend their policies so that they give priority to, in particular, respect for workers' rights, to high-quality employment and to the economic and social cohesion of the areas in which the companies wishing to close and/or relocate their production plants are based.
Urgent progress also needs to be made in amending the existing directives in this field to make the position of workers' representatives mandatory and binding with regard to collective redundancies in order to protect workers' rights. This applies particularly to all processes of restructuring, mergers and relocations by companies and to the need to make Community and national aid dependent on long term commitments for employment and local and national development.
Like Danone, major European companies are currently making colossal profits.
In their competition with major firms in America or Japan, they seek to achieve profitability equivalent to that of the stock exchange.
The sectors making a mere seven to eight per cent profits per annum are implacably restructured by means of reducing wages and, more especially, massive layoffs.
There is no justification for still making employees work 35, 40, 45 hours a week at oppressive rates while their fellow workers are shown the door even though profit margins are increasing.
These tens of thousands of redundancies for the benefit of a few dozen shareholders should be prohibited.
Democracy dictates that the lives of millions of people should not be subjected to the dictates of a handful of industrial magnates. These layoffs must therefore be banned.
When as much, and even more, can be produced while reducing the required work and time input necessary, there is no reason for the gains of such modernisation to be appropriated by employers and for millions of people to lose their jobs.
We should look at the system the other way round, the millions of hours which have been gained should be redistributed, by cutting working hours drastically, to 32 hours in the first instance, without a concomitant drop in wages and without introducing flexibility, and by recruiting personnel as appropriate, financed through the profits made.
The EPLP has voted for the motion for resolution on the social consequences of restructuring because we believe in partnership in the workplace.
However, we have reservations on the resolution itself.
The EPLP recognises that attention needs to be given to the social consequences of restructuring and has voted for this resolution as it is non-legislative.
However there are aspects which are not supported.
Paragraph 6 is not supported by the EPLP.
The EPLP continues to have strong reservations as was expressed at first reading of the framework directive on informing and consulting employees.
In January, Stephen Byers, UK Minister for Trade and Industry announced that business and Unions would be brought together in the UK to examine and review current UK legislation for consultation.
However, the Minister stated that the UK Government continues to oppose the European legislation on information and consultation.
Mr Byers stated that for the UK, "our whole system of corporate structures is quite different from that on the continent.
However, in many respects, the directive reflects the continental system of corporate governance, not that in the United Kingdom.
The directive is not appropriate for several reasons, but the issue is important and we should deal with it in our domestic setting." (Commons Hansard Debates 18th January 2001)
The EPLP supports the view of the Minister that it is inappropriate to have European wide legislation in the area of information and consultation.
Lipietz Report (A5-0023/2001)
Mr President, the Pensioners' Party, which I represent, and the pensioners of Europe expect a great deal of the European Investment Bank.
In my opinion, the EIB should not stop at its already excellent work of lending money to the industries who need it, but it should make greater endeavours to bring about the creation of a European pension fund to pay pensions in Europe.
I feel that we will genuinely succeed in improving the lot of the elderly of all the 15 Member States when we have a single European pension fund which, as such, will be stronger and better able to resist the fluctuations of the market, thus resulting in larger pensions and more comfortable lives for the elderly.
The EIB lags far behind better-known institutions such as the World Bank in terms of transparency, accountability and the ways it addresses environmental and social issues in its work.
Founded in 1958 under the Treaty of Rome, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is the official financing institution of the European Union.
However, there seems to be little public knowledge of the Bank's existence and operations, although it is a public institution that lends more money every year than, for example, the better-known World Bank.
With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, sustainable development has become a central objective of EU cooperation.
According to the new Article 6 in the EC Treaty, environmental protection requirements must be integrated into other EU policies.
Bullmann Report (A5-0034/2001)
Mr President, I voted against the Bullmann report because I do not feel that the initiatives laid down therein will succeed in performing that function that we of the Pensioners' Party and I, in particular, would like Europe to perform.
The Europe of the European citizens, all of them without exception but, in particular, the pensioners who imagine it to be so, should be a Europe which brings ready money into all our pockets, which improves our financial situation considerably, but really considerably, so that the euro is something that the citizens see as progress.
But for this to happen we need less words and more action.
Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group, I wish to give an explanation of vote in view of the fact that, in the final vote, we voted against the Bullmann report.
I should like to say that Mr Bullmann and I cooperated well in the course of the work done on the report.
There were nonetheless a number of wordings which were of central importance to ourselves in the ELDR Group and which made it all the clearer that the Stockholm Summit will also have to debate important reforms in favour of a competitive Europe.
It is a question of further liberalisation, a more favourable business climate and better education and further education.
The aspect of the report relating to these issues fell through and was voted down, and so the whole of recital E also came to nothing.
The ELDR Group therefore chose to vote against the proposal as a whole.
I would add that, as a new Member, I have possibly not become familiar with all the parliamentary conventions in the course of a year and a half.
Perhaps I made a mistake in not fully informing the PSE Group about what, in the very end, we were to do.
I apologise, and I shall convey my apology directly to Mr Bullmann.

The Bullmann report on preparations for the forthcoming European Council meeting in Stockholm has just been rejected in Parliament, and quite rightly too, for I feel the European Commission' s proposals, and the preparatory work within the parliamentary Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, are characterised by a authoritarian and plan-based mentality that runs counter to the spirit of Lisbon.
Immediately following the Lisbon Council, in March 2000, I endorsed the new working method, the new "open" method of coordination suggested by the Council, thinking that it might help to reduce the number of European regulations, which are, by definition, centralised and authoritarian, and to favour arrangements "between equals" that were less restrictive and more likely to adapt flexibly to suit the needs of each party while respecting their freedom to make their own decisions.
Yet the Commission is now proposing to introduce an arsenal of 28 structural indicators, plus seven general economic indicators, to measure the relative economic performance of the Member States.
The Bullmann report lost no time before hurling itself into the breach and proposing to add a whole host of indicators in the fields of allocating public expenditure, the nature of this expenditure, the environment, productivity, employment, youth unemployment, social exclusion, poverty including a breakdown by age and sex, and Lord knows what else.
This might possibly be a valid approach if the aim was to collect data on our various situations.
According to the Bullmann report, however, these indicators were clearly intended to provide the basis for new European regulations which would have fleshed out "the Union' s social legislative framework" .
The report goes on to specify that this regulatory strategy was to be crowned by an "interinstitutional agreement" enabling the European Parliament to be fully involved.
Even at the time of the Lisbon Council, I was already voicing my opposition to the authoritarian tone of some of the conclusions, such as those, for example, which took on society' s role in deciding that it was necessary to increase the rate of participation of women in the labour market.
Yet the proposals of the Bullmann report could well have vastly accentuated this sideways shift.
After rejecting this report, we now hope that the Stockholm Council, in March, will bring the Commission back into line.
We must not slide down the slippery slope from open coordination to closed planning.
I voted against Mr Bullmann' s report, mainly because clarity is required if Parliament' s views are to be accorded any value.
It is not acceptable to be in favour of a whole lot of new indicators and further statistics and, at the same time, warn that statistics do not solve problems but, rather, create new ones.
The parallels with a planned economy become all too clear when it is believed that the Commission must control economic development with the help of a whole lot of economic and social indicators.
Instead, I want the Stockholm Summit to focus upon liberalisation and dynamic deregulation.
It is important to emphasise that politicians do not create jobs.
Politicians can, at best, help create a more favourable business climate.
With the "Lisbon Process" , the EU has decided once and for all to engage upon the road to all-out liberalism.
In imitation of the Davos Forum, bringing together the elite of the ruling classes, at the Lisbon Summit the EU set itself the goal of becoming "the most competitive and dynamic... economy in the world" .
After the launch of the single market in 1985, and of the euro in 1997, this is just one more step in building a Europe which responds only to the interests of capital.
The smokescreen of rhetoric on "full employment" , vocational training or promoting the spread of new technologies is not enough to conceal the actual attacks on the world of work set forth in the resolution.
The widespread privatisation and liberalisation of further public services, the commercialisation of information technology in the educational system and in administration, the opening up of pension funds, the dismantling of the current pension system, flexibility in employment - all these are measures that speak volumes as to the antisocial nature of the Lisbon policy.
This is heightened by the recent Treaty of Nice and will be exacerbated by closer cooperation between governments centred on the new convergence criteria.
In opposition to the "Lisbon Process" we would advocate Europe-wide harmonisation of social rights, pensions, public services, wages and employment in line with the most favourable conditions.
GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm Report (A5-0020/2001)
Mr President, Page 6, point 6 of this report on the impact of liberalisation and the economic reform process on the economic growth of the European Union reads: "(The rapporteur) considers that the ageing of the population will necessitate new ways of increasing participation in the labour market, especially among women and older workers".
I do not agree, Mr President - and nor does the Pensioners' Party - that we can resolve the problem of elderly people and pensions by making the elderly work longer.
I feel that the problem of pensions and elderly people must be resolved by better, more prudent management of the pension funds of our States than I regret to say has been the case thus far.
With shocking cynicism, the rapporteur proposes full liberalisation of the market and deregulation.
He also proposes speeding up privatisation, reducing public expenditure, increasing labour market flexibility, liberalising the financial markets and lifting the regulatory and administrative framework, allegedly in order to improve the competitiveness of the European economy.
The ÃU continues to exert pressure on Member States to sell off the family silver by handing all transport, postal and telecommunications services over to the private sector.
Labour relations are being dismantled, the social security system is under threat and the working classes are being condemned yet again to poverty and social exclusion, allegedly in order to increase employment.
Even the rapporteur admits that the current adverse situation and the high rate of unemployment have been brought about by intensifying and strengthening neo-liberal, monetarist policies.
These economic reforms will result in a guaranteed level of poverty, not a minimum level of prosperity for workers, while the view is being promoted that a modern social state need only provide certain minimum services to its people, in the form of charity.
Prosperity is, of course, being promoted for big business, which is becoming more and more unaccountable.
It is contradictory, ironic, hypocritical and provocative to workers to propose that the way to combat unemployment is to strengthen the competitiveness of companies through reduced labour costs, full liberalisation and flexibility of the labour market and atypical forms of work.
Support for the public sector, stable, permanent and full employment and a better and protected social security system and social protection system in general should form the backbone of economic policy.
We want to achieve stable economic development based on healthy internal demand by improving the workers' purchasing power, concentrating on crucial sectors such as creating and maintaining infrastructures, education, health, research and applying economic development policies which help to increase employment by creating permanent jobs.
This is the way to achieve the objectives of full and stable employment, stronger workers' rights, high-quality employment, training and job skills and shorter working times without any cut in wages.
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
The GasÃ³liba i BÃ¶hm report on the impact of liberalisation and the economic reform process on economic growth could, at first sight, merit my support: greater liberalisation, upon the condition that public services remain operational, must indeed encourage more efficient production processes, better resource allocation and hence more active growth.
Yet, when reading the explanatory statement, we find some perfectly inadmissible statements such as this, "the economic situation no longer allows the same level of social protection for European workers: there is unfortunately a direct link between social protection and what separates us from full employment."
Is this a stylistic infelicity or a Freudian slip betraying an inner conviction?
At any event, we see this as an opportunity to restate our view that liberalisation must be carried out while maintaining the level of social protection.
The critical issue is to frame new procedures that are based on both private management and public-minded regulations, which will make it possible to offer the same services at a reduced cost, and even better service, for users are more likely to be satisfied if the service on offer is more adaptable.
These are the principles which must, in France, underlie the reform of the social welfare system and the educational system.
In both instances, the public and the private sector must be allowed to compete fairly, within the terms of public-minded regulations and a minimum service provision defined by law.
In this way, competition will have the effect of driving administration costs down and pushing the quality of the service up.
And the countries of Europe will be able to define a form of liberalisation which is compatible with their own cultural models and desire for social solidarity.
This report restates the credo of the advocates of a Europe of capitalists and bankers according to which it would be sufficient to make life easier for employers by making it less costly to launch businesses, expedite the privatisation of public services and step up the flexibility of the labour market in order to see economic growth take off, thereby putting an end to unemployment.
The fact that the privatisation of the post office or the railways in those countries of Europe where this has already taken place has demonstrated that the first to suffer from this are the public sector workers and service users, since private operators are ready to sacrifice absolutely everything except their profits, does not prevent the rapporteur' s making so bold as to guarantee that "current safety levels" for rail will be maintained, despite the evidence to the contrary.
The rapporteur passes over the fact that most of the jobs generated are insecure and underpaid and announces that "the ageing of the population will necessitate... increasing participation in labour market, especially among... older workers" .
Where is the much-promised social progress in all that?
The massive increase in productivity would make it perfectly possible to guarantee a better standard of living for all the working and the retired population if a small minority of property owners were not determined to seize all profits for themselves.
Consequently, the stated objective of making "the European economy the most competitive and dynamic... in the world" cannot be achieved except on the backs of the workers, who would bear the entire burden of boosting the profits of the major capitalist groups in the form of deterioration in their working and living conditions.
We voted against this report.
This resolution is a sort of liberal social charter maintaining a basic illusion as to the extent to which liberalisation and regulation can be combined.
In actual fact, the hardline neoliberal programme is being affirmed once again in two major areas.
The first area of focus is the continued privatisation, deemed to be "essential" starting with postal services, savings banks and financial services in general, as well as the railways.
The second is the continued reform of the labour market, and there are even plans to extend this further.
Such guidelines represent a step backwards for civilisation, seeking nothing more and nothing less than to convert the provision of all social needs into saleable commodities, subject to the rationale of profitability.
This is, apparently, a "careful liberalisation process" . That is something that the victims of the Paddington rail disaster will appreciate.
Reform of the labour market tends to always go the same way, elevating flexibility and social insecurity to consider them the economic ideal.
This report, in thrall to liberal orthodoxy, illustrates the cynicism of property owners and the miserable submission of reform policies to their lead.
I had no hesitation in voting against this resolution.
Soares Report (A5-0017/2001)
Mr President, page 7, point 17 of Mr Soares' report on the state of relations between the EU and Macau reads "Calls on the European companies which are developing operations in Macau, and via Macau in China, to observe the basic ILO labour standards in their operations".
This is a good thing and it is part of the reason why I voted for the report, but I would greatly appreciate it if, in future, respect for the pension rights of workers were to be promoted as well, for the elderly workers in Macau need protection too.
I support the proposals and initiatives intended to improve friendly relations between the European Union and Macau following that territory' s integration into the People' s Republic of China, of which it has become a Special Administrative Region following a handover that I consider to be successful.
All the conditions are now in place for closer economic and cultural relations, on the basis of cooperation and mutual benefit between the People' s Republic of China, specifically through the Special Administrative Region of Macao and the European Union and its Member States.
Nevertheless, with regard to the report, for which I voted, I still take a critical view of certain aspects that appear to reveal a degree of suspicion, specifically concerning compliance with agreements, since I consider that the reality of the situation shows that there is no reason for such suspicion.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Soares on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament 'The European Union and Macau after 2000' because it fully addresses the issue of what the European Union' s concerns and initiatives for Macau should be.
The concerns arise basically from the need to preserve the freedoms and rights that already existed in this Special Administrative Region before the transfer of sovereignty, including religious freedom, which stem from the principle, so arduously negotiated by the Portuguese and Chinese authorities, of 'one country, two systems' .
The initiatives are the specific actions that the European Union can stimulate and promote for Macau with the aim of ensuring that the region maintains a democratic collective life, in which the human rights and individual freedoms of the Macanese are respected and in which prosperity and peace are valued.
I wish to highlight three of these initiatives that are intended to preserve the autonomy and specific nature of Macau in relation to China.
The first is the permanent monitoring of the implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle. The second is the boosting of European investment in the SAR, as a corollary of active cooperation at all levels, and the third initiative concerns the call for the urgent appointment of a European Union representative in Macau, in order to stimulate relations between the two regions.
Portugal governed Macau for four hundred years.
We are not ashamed of our past in that region, in fact, quite the opposite.
On the one hand, our presence fostered peaceful coexistence between the European and Chinese civilisations and, on the other, we left the Macanese a region with outstanding prospects for growth, with legislative, customs and judicial autonomy and where the rights and freedoms of every citizen are part of a legacy of civilisation that we have the duty to preserve.
Plooij-van Gorsel Report (A5-0052/2001)
Mr President, yesterday evening - the evening of Valentine's Day - some friends and I were looking for a restaurant, but we could not find a free table anywhere. Doubtless, they were all occupied by lovers celebrating Valentine's Day.
I still had to prepare my explanation of vote on the Plooij-van Gorsel report.
I closed my eyes for a second and saw a vision: I saw the Commissioner for Research, Mr Busquin, and the rapporteur, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, having dinner together and talking animatedly about research in Europe.
It being Valentine's Day, I said to myself: "I wonder whether European research will even make it possible to find one's soul mate, which is what is generally hoped for on Saint Valentine's Day".
Therefore, with this in mind, I voted for the report.
Once again we have been served a balanced menu which is nothing of the sort.
A pinch of good intentions regarding the position of women in research, a nod of acknowledgement towards the social sciences, a handful of allusions to the role of cooperation in scientific matters between the Member States, or the role of research in the development of culture and even of employment for all, before coming to the main course, the only real meat of the matter: a substantial package of subsidies for businesses.
For that is the main if not the only motivation of the European Commission, the Council and the author of this report.
What we are being asked to support is a move to strengthen the private sector' s grip on public sector research, facilitating the exploitation of the results of public sector research by private capital, and the "dramatic reduction" , written in black and white, "in the red tape that obstructs" it.
The rapporteur claims that, "It would be an advantage for companies to have better access to research results."
An advantage only for the business owners and shareholders who have been promised further subsidies disguised as aid to research.
No one is fooled by the fact that the report only makes reference to SMEs.
All major corporations have small and medium-sized enterprises as subsidiaries, particularly in the field of research.
Public monies should remain in the public sector and should be used for research that is of benefit to the population.
We voted against this report.
Even though the draft resolution adopts a number of interesting positions, particularly regarding equal access to research for women, I must reject the guidelines for framework projects favouring finished research, characterised by big industry alongside small and medium-sized businesses in the high tech sector.
I cannot accept a situation whereby research is used as a tool in the "economic warfare" conducted by firms for the control of pharmaceutical or agro-industrial markets, or must take account of developments in security and defence policy.
Priorities cannot be limited to biotechnology, genome research, new information and communication technology and nuclear technology, and Parliament instead should take action to ensure that knowledge is part of our shared heritage, quite apart from any criterion of profitability.
I am therefore opposed to patenting the living organism. Developing medicinal products that are useful to the health of society must be an imperative.
In this age of GMOs and mad cow disease, we can but deplore the failure to mention the subject of democratic scrutiny regarding the goals of research.
I also reject a situation whereby establishing a "European Research Area" implies jeopardising the position of state research bodies, as evidenced by the fall in public resources set aside for long-term research or, in France, the "innovation" law which legalises the use of public resources to private ends.
For all the above reasons, I voted against.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.41p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Situation in Kosovo
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0102/01 by Mr Dupuis, Mr Pannella, Mrs Bonino, Mr Turco, Mr Dell'Alba, Mr Della Vedova and Mr Cappato, on behalf of the TDI Group, on Kosovo;
B5-0104/01 by Mr Sakellariou, Mr Souladakis, Mr Swoboda and Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Kosovo;
B5-0114/01 by Mr Lagendijk and Mr Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Kosovo and southern Serbia;
B5-0122/01 by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the PPEÂ­DE Group, on the situation in Kosovo and southern Serbia;
B5-0134/01 by Mr Brie, Mr Alavanos and Mr Manisco, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Kosovo;
B5-0143/01 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Kosovo.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us note the absence of the Commission and of the Council.
I regret to have to say that this motion for a resolution on Kosovo is quite unbelievable. Once again we are suffering from total amnesia.
We are acting as if everything that has taken place in Yugoslavia over the last ten to twelve years did not take place.
We are allowing Mr KostunÃ­ca to let the Serbian people remain in ignorance of everything that Milosevic kept from them for the previous ten years, namely the events in Vukovar, in Sarajevo, in Kosovo, even quite recently, just eighteen months ago.
I find this perfectly unacceptable.
All eyes are on Belgrade.
I understand, Mr President, Mrs Pack, the need to assist the new Serbian authorities in tackling the problems which exist, but this cannot be done at the expense of justice - or a modicum of justice - i.e. by failing to challenge and condemn the actions of Mr Milosevic and the main Serbian leaders.
Nor can this be achieved while closing our eyes to a situation which is perfectly intolerable in terms of international law.
The 700 Kosovars still detained in Serbia were sentenced in absolute contravention of the laws of the international community.
Only UNMIK and the international tribunal in The Hague would be authorised to sentence these people.
An amnesty would therefore not be valid, and I would urge the responsible parties within the Commission to refer the matter, with all due discipline, to the competent Commissioners.
There is no need to pressure Mr KostunÃ­ca to grant an amnesty, all he has to do is to hand over the parties concerned to the head of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, Mr HÃŠkkerup.
Mr President, I should just like to ask who is down to represent the Commission this afternoon and when he is expected to arrive in the Chamber.
As soon as he gets here, I will be able to tell you, Mr Posselt.
Mr President, last week we saw television pictures of the presence of the European Parliament, the Commission, Mr Solana and Mr Patten in Belgrade.
We hope that these pictures represent the beginning of the end of the Balkan tragedy. I appreciate the fact that, for the first time, Mr Solana appeared not as the evil oracle from Euripides' ancient Greek tragedy Iphigenia, but as the good oracle.
A starting point for a policy in the area to dull the feelings of those responsible in connection with any man-made disasters in the area should, I think, be decisively supported by the European Parliament.
This House needs to send a message of support for stability, peace and the development of cooperation in the area.
The people in the area must understand that there is no question of their becoming big or small, because poverty never makes people big and as long as clashes continue, the only outcome will be poverty and unhappiness and that is all they will share.
In this sense, because stability, development and cooperation must be our prime considerations, this is the basic thrust of this motion.
The people in the area must understand, as must we, that occupied protectorates in any shape or form never allow economic development, they never allow peace and they never allow countries or people in the area to be strengthened.
Thus, the interplay of circumstances surrounding the visit, the interplay of circumstances surrounding the exchanges in Belgrade and the interplay of circumstances for us is an exceptional, useful and crucial interplay and we must help it.
We need to understand that, if democracy, peace and cooperation are to succeed, we have to surpass ourselves.
This motion, which defines a wide framework which can be used as a political framework for the next round of developments in the area, gives us the prospect of doing so and we should all support it.
Mr President, the international community, and certainly the European Union, is involved in a complicated balancing act.
On one side are the Kosovars, waiting impatiently for a decision on the final status of their country, also waiting impatiently for elections and still - and let us be clear, understandably - full of hatred for the Serbs.
In that climate the extremists have a free hand, for example in the Presevo area, where they are actually attacking KFOR troops, a situation that, in my eyes, and also for Mr Dupuis, is totally unacceptable.
On the other side there is the Serbian Government which, with new faces in charge and fine plans, can be sure of a great deal of sympathy from the international community.
It has, for example, come up with proposals for the same area, around Presevo, which I definitely think offer a good basis for negotiations and which I also think the Albanians should respond to.
What one can now see happening is a shift in international sympathy from the awkward Kosovars to the cooperative Serbs.
That is the moment - and the moment is now - that the balancing act is most difficult.
What is the task of the EU?
We must hold the Serbs to their promises which, however splendid they may be, as yet exist only on paper.
We must isolate the extremist Kosovars and impress upon the moderate Kosovars, using force or persuasion as necessary, that they must cooperate with the Serbs, and that they cannot go on fighting them and pressing their demands.
Once again, President, I can imagine easier tasks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my good friend Olivier Dupuis spoke on quite the wrong subject.
We are speaking today about southern Serbia and Kosovo.
We are not discussing Serbia and current policy in Serbia proper.
I agree with much of what you said, Olivier.
Believe me, those Members who were in Belgrade have taken a clear line on the conditions. For us, there can be no money unless the conditions are fulfilled.
No one has ever disputed that, apart from Commission President Prodi, whom I hereby urge to desist from such comments.
