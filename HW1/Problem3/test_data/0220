That is why I voted in favour.
Mr President, I voted against this report.
And why did the Pensioners' Party vote against Mrs de Veyrac's report?
Because, before I left for Strasbourg, I met a former Member of the European Parliament, Mrs Monica Baldi, who is very au fait with cultural issues. While we were discussing this report over a good coffee in a bar, she said to me: "Why is it that this report hopes to reduce the number of cultural sites listed in Italy?
It' s not the quantity but the quality of sites that counts.
It is hardly our fault that Italy has so many ancient monuments to preserve".
Mrs de Veyrac's report shows willing and contains certain constructive proposals, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of it.
However, we fear that these proposals will fall on deaf ears.
We all know that our cultural and natural heritage risks being wiped out by activities which damage or destroy the urban and local fabric in which priceless examples of our cultural and natural heritage are to be found.
Excessive and uncontrolled use of land, buildings springing up in historic town centres, in the countryside and in green belts and the lack of any proper measures to protect forests and the natural environment are evidence of our rape of the natural and cultural landscape.
Of course, this is not the random work of a few villains, it is the direct consequence of a policy which commercialises everything and is driven solely by the profit motive.
A typical example is the TVX Gold site in Olympiada, in Halkidiki, near Stayira, the birthplace of Aristotle, where the forest has been destroyed and monuments have been put at risk. As if that were not enough, the residents in the area have been dragged through the courts and sentenced for daring to defend their historic and natural environment.
We could cite numerous other examples in connection with the destruction inflicted or which it is planned to inflict in order to stage the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004.
Not only does the European Union do nothing to check and deal with these incidents; on the contrary, it is the main advocate of this policy.
It funds projects on archaeological sites which will bury and destroy ancient monuments - witness the case of the Acropolis Museum.
The Greek Government is repealing Article 24 of the Constitution as we speak, thereby abolishing what little legislative protection there was for forests and without the slightest objection on the part of the ÃU.
The ÃU has a penchant for waxing lyrical about culture, but while it preaches that cultural heritage is a basic factor in the individual identity and historical development of a society, it has done nothing to get the Elgin marbles returned to the natural and historic site of which they form an integral part, even as a gesture of respect for our cultural and historic heritage and for the need to protect historic monuments.
It is also indifferent to the fact that monuments in North Cyprus are being plundered and vandalised by the Turkish occupying forces.
Finally, it bears a huge responsibility for the destruction of monuments during the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
This situation cannot be rectified with half measures or wishful thinking or, of course, within the context of a market philosophy.
We need to mobilise the masses, all the cultural agencies, all the workers, and we need to impose a different policy, one which respects the working man and the fruits of his creation.
. The ELDR Group considers that the de Veyrac report is a very important contribution to better protection of world cultural and natural heritage.
We are of the opinion that the application of the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in the EU is a task for Member States rather than for the European Community.
It is difficult for us to see the added value of EU intervention in this matter.
The ELDR amendments to the de Veyrac report reflect this position.
Thus, for reasons of lack of added value and the principle of subsidiarity the ELDR Group will abstain in the final vote.
Protecting and promoting our heritage in each Member State is fundamentally important as, in so doing, we are safeguarding our identities and special characteristics whilst still respecting differences.
Our heritage, be it cultural, architectural, economic or natural, is the legacy of our past and in protecting it we are not fighting a rearguard action. On the contrary, it shows that we are preparing for our future.
The author Ernest Renan wrote that the only true men of progress are those who take a deep-seated respect for the past as their starting point.
We must, therefore, take advantage of the wealth of our past, our heritage, our roots and our traditions, even the very oldest, in order to prepare for the future. This cultural diversity and wealth will allow us to gain a better understanding of ourselves.
To achieve this, however, we must respect all the diversity of our various heritages, all our differences, and the only way to do this is to invoke the subsidiarity principle.
In line with this principle we can preserve, develop and transmit our heritage, culture and traditions.
When these disappear or fade away (in the way of hunting, rural life and gastronomic tradition) we are breaking the chain of transmission by which we hand down our wealth and our way of life and this brings about cultural impoverishment. At the end of the day, we will create a mould into which everyone has to fit in order to live in an insipid but more malleable society that can be controlled by 'rulers and governors' .
That is unacceptable.
Therefore, to protect, preserve and promote our heritage, we must save our architecture, support our arts and craft industry, preserve and enhance the value of our countryside, but I would like to stress that we must not wrap it in cotton wool or exclude the cultural traditions and customs which are practised there.
In so doing, we must also respect the right to be different and help to preserve all these values since rural life has its own rightful place in this predominantly urban society.
Therefore, to come back to the report, it is, of course, important to protect the heritage of both the European Union and third countries, but it is equally important and vital to protect the heritage of our own countries and regions.
We are therefore pleased to note the proposals to take our heritage into account in the various training programmes set up to protect and restore our heritage.
The same goes for funding and support of the arts and craft industry, a sector which creates many jobs, as long as it is not suffocated by unrealistic pernickety regulations, as has been possible for market traders.
We must however state our reservations regarding the European regulations which, on the pretext of environmental protection (a term applied too narrowly), will serve only to wipe out local traditions and customs that are a vital part of the local culture of our regions. Yet, this is the opposite of what this report sets out to achieve and so, although we support the report, we are abstaining from the vote for this reason.
Since 1972, when the UNESCO General Conference adopted the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, which has already been signed by 158 countries, including the 15 Member States of the European Union, 630 sites have been added to the world heritage list, 30% of which are in European Union countries (188), and of those 10 are in Portugal.
It is obvious, however, that classifying sites as world heritage sites is not enough.
Every measure must be taken to support their conservation, including financial measures, as we have done with the proposals that we have tabled for the Community budget.
As the rapporteur highlighted, there is an imbalance between European countries and the rest of the world with regard to recognised natural and cultural sites, and therefore third countries must be supported and encouraged, in a wide-ranging approach, to add to the list of natural and cultural heritage, so that they can be afforded protection.
It is also important for Member States to comply with existing directives, and in particular the environmental impact assessment directive on assessing the impact of specific public and private projects on cultural and natural heritage, as the report states.
My vote in support of the de Veyrac report on the application of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in the Member States of the European Union is based on the conviction that we must enhance the cultural dimension of the European Union. We must work to ensure we have a cultural policy in the Union which highlights, among the main features of its spiritual richness and that of the Old World, its cultural, linguistic, architectural and artistic diversity and all those elements that make up our common cultural heritage.
This is clear when you travel around the Union and see how the diverse spiritual trends over the centuries have been embodied in our monuments, artistic styles, value systems, religious and spiritual trends, and schools of philosophical and scientific thought. In short, and in accordance with the Treaties, we must go deeper with our European cultural policy, supporting and protecting our cultural diversity, a factor which in turn defines the European Union.
The de Veyrac report is a laudable contribution towards this.
Doorn report (A5-0351/2000)
Mr President, I am sure you will listen carefully to my explanation of vote in support of this report.
I am in favour of anything which streamlines or simplifies, provided that the process is not too tiresome for those undergoing the streamlining and is carried out rationally.
I therefore stress that, in this operation of simplifying and streamlining Community legislation on the social security coordination sector - to which this report refers - we must bear in mind that it would be appropriate for workers who work in more than one State of the European Union to receive a single pension from a single pension office rather than part of it from one State, part of it from another State and part of it from yet another.
Thank you Mr Fatuzzo.
The more I listen to you the more I realise that I will know your life history before long.
Given that we are opposed to a market economy, we shall not adopt any position on the alleged simplification of the internal market.
We are therefore abstaining from the vote on this report.
However, on the aspects that may affect the majority of the population i.e. the workers, we are in favour of:
simplifying social legislation and social security by bringing them into line with countries that have the most favourable schemes for workers;
simplifying VAT through the universal abolition of both VAT itself and all consumption taxes, which are particularly unfair as they mainly affect lower income classes, and replacing these with a sizeable increase in corporation tax and a steeply graduated tax on all forms of revenue from capital.
van der Laan report (A5-0397/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the van der Laan report.
Thank you for your kind words just now. In voting for the motion, I would like to draw your attention to the part of the document which refers to assistance to the Palestinian authorities.
I was prompted to do so by the representatives of the Pensioners' Party in Israel - for the Knesset includes representatives of the Pensioners' Party in Israel - one of whom said to me: "I am glad you are helping the Palestinians.
In fact, you should give them more and better assistance and ensure that it genuinely serves to help the Palestinian people, for they truly need it.
Indeed, I am sure that, if the Palestinian citizens were in better health and their economy were improved, there would be less war than I am sorry to say there is at the moment".
I am unable to agree with my group regarding its position on Mr van Dam' s amendment, which I, personally, chose to support.
It is one thing for the issue of the spreading of anti-Semitic propaganda by Palestinian schoolbooks not to be included in the 1997 discharge resolution.
I would say that this is a technical problem.
However, to my mind, it is a misjudged political signal for us to oppose it for this reason alone, i.e. on the grounds of form rather than content.
Since signing the Oslo Agreement, the European Union and its Member States have, to a great extent, subsidised the Palestinian education system.
Therefore, it is up to us to demand that the Commission should monitor more closely to ensure that the material in Palestinian schools does not constitute an incitement to war, violence and racial hatred.
The European Union cannot keep actively supporting reconciliation and peace while continuing to turn a blind eye to the way EU financial support is being misappropriated for ideological ends.
Indeed, I sincerely hope that this issue will very soon be the subject of a genuine debate in Parliament.
We must be firm on this issue.
Our conscience will not allow anything else, nor will our electorate.
I have voted in favour of the report and especially of Amendment No 1 from Mr van Dam.
It is important for the European Parliament to strongly criticise the anti-Semitic statements in teaching resources for Palestinian schools and for Parliament to call upon the Commission to ensure that the aid given to Palestinian education does not, either directly or indirectly, finance racial hatred.
Instead, the EU' s contribution to the Palestinian education system should instead promote peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.
EU aid must, as far as possible, be designed to bring about peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.
The EU is, among other things, providing aid to the Palestinian education system.
It is profoundly unfortunate and offensive that Palestinian school books should contain anti-Semitic statements and describe Israel - the only democracy in the Middle East - in terms as abominable as those of Nazism.
. Both the rapporteur and the ELDR Group share the sentiment expressed in Amendment No 1 regarding concern at the possible use made of EU financial support for inciting racial hatred amongst Palestinians against their Jewish neighbours.
The Budgetary Control Committee is strict in the remit of a discharge follow-up report to restrict itself to the contents of the original discharge resolution for the year in question.
This amendment raises a new issue on evidence that has recently come to light.
The rapporteur is therefore recommending that the amendment be rejected but that the matter be dealt with more fully in the context of the ongoing 1999 discharge report.
Garriga Polledo report (A5-0331/2000)
Mr President, speakers have drawn attention to a number of problems, including cigarette smuggling.
I support their concern as it is generally believed that international criminals are now more interested in cigarette smuggling than drug-trafficking as it is more profitable and less dangerous.
We in the EU must respond to this problem as a matter of urgency.
The profits from cigarette smuggling not only line the pockets of criminals but also deny revenue to the EU, which would otherwise be used in tackling cancer, poverty, the promotion of human rights, etc.
In addition, cheaper cigarettes mean greater danger to health because of heavier tobacco consumption, and we must enlist the support of ministers in national and regional governments in any campaign against this.
The Commission should contact in particular the ministers of health and education in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Ms de Brun and Mr Martin McGuinness.
I mention that because we use education and health programmes to combat cancer and the Anderstown News recently revealed the deep involvement of the IRA in illicit cigarette smuggling.
They have links to that organisation.
What better way to discharge the ministerial portfolio than to encourage their friends to stop this activity.
It also underlines a greater need for widespread policing in Northern Ireland.
Mr President, I voted for this report but with great reservations.
Before I left for Strasbourg, I met Mr Rota, a pensioner who is also from Bergamo, in a restaurant.
We talked about the Pensioners' Party and he asked me whether I was content with the European Parliament.
I said: "It is such an enjoyable job!
I am content, I feel at ease and I have some very good friends.
Even the Vice-Presidents, such as Mr Provan, for example, are very diligent and I like them very much."
He continued: "And is everything working alright in Europe?
You don't find yourselves wasting European money every now and again?"
"No", I replied, "everything is working fine."
However, I am sad to say that I then read in this report that the national States have not applied Community legislation on collecting duties owed to the Community budget.
I therefore hope that, in future, the collection of customs duties in Europe will work well too.
We have voted in favour of a report on securities and guarantees for traditional own resources. The report as a whole makes sense.
There are, however, a few points from which we would disassociate ourselves.
Paragraphs 15 and 16 pave the way for introducing a single corpus juris in the EU and for harmonising criminal law and the administration of justice in the Member States.
First of all, this is unclearly formulated.
Secondly, we are not in favour of harmonising criminal legislation and the administration of justice in the Member States.
What we do support is establishing the necessary instruments for combating fraud involving EU funds more effectively.
We are in favour of supplementing the OLAF regulation by setting up a unit under OLAF to lead investigations and make it easier to follow up criminal cases in the national courts.
The unit must only concern itself with crimes committed by EU employees.
In the longer term, consideration should be given to introducing a European public prosecutor to follow up cases of fraud involving EU funds in the Member States.
We must not, however, have harmonisation for harmonisation' s sake and, in other areas, the Member States' criminal law and administration of justice are national concerns.
McCartin report (A5-0396/2000)
Mr President, although I have mislaid my notes, I seem to remember that I voted against the McCartin report, which deals with agriculture and powdered milk.
I am happy to discuss the subject on this occasion because I want to call strongly for genuine help to be given to farmers - for this document does not provide sufficient protection for them - and, in particular, because I want to draw attention to the fact that there is currently a huge crisis in Italy over powdered and other milk.
Not only is there talk of mad cow disease, sadly, but, since yesterday, there has also been talk of "mad milk" in Italy.
People are saying that it might be possible to contract mad cow disease by drinking milk.
This is a truly unforgivable thing to say, and it would be appropriate for the European Union to intervene and make it clear that milk is not mad but quite healthy.
This report is deeply contradictory in its assessment of various aspects of the CAP.
For example, the approach adopted in its reflects exclusively budgetary concerns, for example, when the report expresses satisfaction at the reform reducing institutional prices and surplus produce, and insists on a greater reduction of compensation payments, without even mentioning the consequences this will have for farmers' incomes.
Furthermore, together with the principle of cofinancing, it advocates the renationalisation of CAP costs. This is a principle that we reject.
The report also expresses satisfaction at the Commission' s decision to carry out a thorough assessment of the COM in milk, which closely reflects a Court of Auditors' opinion questioning the system of milk quotas and increases in these laid down in Agenda 2000, forgetting that, despite some unfairness in the allocation of quotas, such as that suffered by Portugal, this system still manages to guarantee a degree of protection as regards prices and incomes.
With regard to the pig sector and animal epidemics, the report concludes by considering and supporting the proposal to establish funds with contributions from the producers themselves or other types of insurance schemes, which is a step backwards in relation to the opinion that has already been expressed in the Garot report, which argued in favour of such Community-cofinanced funds.
Nevertheless, I agree with the rapporteur when he raises a very important issue affecting the system of arable crops, which is the concentration of aid amongst major producers and in the most prosperous regions.
What is needed is an improvement in the situation of small producers, differentiating support according to the size of the farm.
It is hard to understand how the rapporteur proposes to support small farmers through the measures that he is recommending.
Staes report (A5-0389/2000)
President.
Mr Fatuzzo, if you want to remain standing we will just keep going as you are the only speaker left.
Mr President, my leg gets tired easily so I have to sit down every now and again.
With regard to my declaration of vote on the Staes document, which concerns the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in particular, the way in which the aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina has been spent, I have to say that I have had a meeting with the representatives of the pensioners of that region.
They urged me to ask the European Parliament - and I am very happy to do so on this occasion - to ensure that at least part of the aid, by some means or other, reaches the elderly people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"But we can't go checking up on what happens to our money", I replied.
"But you must, Mr Fatuzzo. You must insist that the funds are monitored when they reach their destination as well.
We pensioners need to receive some of them!"
Mr President, there is indeed a crisis of succession in farming as Mr Parish with his expertise as a farmer knows well.
If this crisis is particularly acute in Mr Parish's own Member State, it is the direct result of policies pursued by UK governments over the past twenty years, and to overcome it the United Kingdom must review the implications of the Fontainbleau Agreement for its contribution to European Union finances.
This has been disastrous for farming. Moreover, the rapporteur, a member of the Conservative Party, must work within his own party to secure support for his proposals in the House of Commons.
In countries where less than 10% of the population now lives in rural areas, it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas, and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries.
. (EL) Barbaric military intervention - ostensibly for the sake of peace -, dirty 'peace-making' agreements signed manu militari, followed by dirty, suspicious financial 'help' for the purpose of 'restoring peace' : such are the EU's achievements in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and the Balkans in general, which have been commiserating for years now as the result of the huge military and political imperialist interests being played out in this region.
This parliamentary report reveals exactly how the above funding is managed and shows how the EU taxpayers' money is being squandered, with no controls or transparency, in order to consolidate the expansion of the huge interests of the EU in the NATO protectorate of Bosnia, declarations of 'humanitarian and peace-making' motives notwithstanding.
References to mismanagement, delays, late payment, millions of ÃCU being granted for non-subsidisable equipment, waste and irregularities abound both in the Staes report and the opinions.
They describe the prevailing situation in the strongest of terms and reveal the tremendous hypocrisy about support for the civil society and the restoration of democracy.
What could be more damning than the reference in the report to "conflicts of interest" in the office of the High Representative himself?
We are not surprised that those who 'promote' peace with depleted uranium bombs, spreading death and destruction, cannot and will not play the role of peacemaker.
We are not surprised that the golden goose is being squeezed dry by the major economic interests which created, cultivated and fomented the hatred between the peoples of this region and by the employees and servants of those interests, such as the famous Mr Kounser.
But we are surprised by the cynicism and hypocrisy of leaders who continue to talk of efforts to 'clean up' and improve the uptake of funds and restore the rule of law.
The gloomy facts speak for themselves and leave no room for doubt, let alone complacency.
People are not accounts; their consciences cannot be bought off and however much you try to embellish the facts, you still have to contend with the people.
We shall not be voting in favour of the Staes report, despite the fact that it contains numerous accurate findings and proposals, because its general perception is bereft of any notion of resistance to the presence of imperialist forces and its only concern is how to embellish that presence so that it is easier for the people to swallow.
Dell'Alba report (A5-0359/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the Dell'Alba report, but I want to stress that underlying this vote for the motion is my position as representative of the Pensioners' Party. I wish to make clear my total opposition to the now established practice of insisting that the Structural Funds and European aid are added to national aid.
So the Structural Funds should be additional aid? I disagree.
I feel that European funds should have nothing whatsoever to do with national financing or national policies.
European funds must not be tied to national funds.
Europe is a separate entity from its constituent nations.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Neil Parish on the fact that he has produced a report which is based on the farmers' reality, the reality in rural areas, and not on the view from Brussels.
This in itself constitutes a valuable contribution to agricultural policy.
But if we now examine the situation, we could ask ourselves whether there are any young people left out there who are mad enough to become farmers in the European Union.
What we need is people who want to take up the challenge of producing an outstanding achievement, five-legged sheep as it were, but not obtained through genetic modification.
They seem to be fighting a losing battle, if we consider the adversities which young farmers face, as well as the achievements they are expected to deliver.
To quote just one example - and I am just considering my own country for a moment - dairy farming is a sector where absolutely everything is being scrutinised, from the blade of grass right up to the moment that the milk hits the supermarkets.
I cannot help drawing a comparison with arable farmers and horticulturalists who have been required to keep tabs on the implications of their actions on the environment and consumer front for a long time, and do so with great enthusiasm.
At the same time, we have to say that in many European countries the requirements for animal welfare are among the world' s most stringent.
So whoever wants to become a farmer in Europe must outstrip their counterparts elsewhere in the world. They need to give the landscape and cultural conditions due consideration.
They must apply the strictest consumer conditions, supply a wide range of products, both regionally and in terms of quality, make animal welfare a top priority and be responsible for the product, even once it has left the farm.
This is what we call social enterprising as a top-level sport.
It requires entrepreneurship, a love of nature and the environment, social orientation and perseverance.
For this reason alone, it would be desirable if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is focused on the future.
Some of the focal points could include a premium scheme linked to quality, landscape and environmental protection, but also the introduction of an eco-tax in other economic sectors, not payable by the farmers but by the consumers, to finance those extra requirements which farmers need to fulfil, and to reinforce the market position of farmers and consumers.
What strikes me in the European Union' s competition policy as a whole, is that although it is enjoying a great deal of attention, in the food sector, for example, the consumers, the supermarkets that is, are gradually gaining a monopoly position, and that at the same time sales from farms, the small-scale dimension, are still fragmented.
In that sense, it would be desirable if both Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein were more critical in their assessment of this area in terms of competition.
Mr President, nobody can survive for one day without food; it is life requirement number one.
This requires motivated producers.
This means that food does not just stand for market forces, but also for public health, landscape and nature.
In short, if we realise this, then we will know that, in future, young farmers will need to be five-legged sheep, and in that sense, deserve more support, more political support than they are receiving at the moment.
Heaton Harris report (A5-0395/2000)
Mr President, the Heaton-Harris report, which I voted in favour of, is a report on the efficiency of the European Monetary Institute and therefore on the situation of the euro.
I have already had occasion to congratulate the European single currency, in other words, the euro, on its gain in strength in recent weeks, but today I would like to call for the establishment of a European bank.
The EIB - European Investment Bank - should be closer to the European citizens as an actual bank, a credit institute as well.
I therefore trust that my recommendation will be acted upon.
The report by Mr Heaton-Harris confuses two issues.
In the name of wage moderation, it condemns granting extraordinary bonuses to some ECB employees, which is unacceptable.
On the other hand, the rapporteur criticises the ECB for preventing OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, from carrying out its work.
We learn therefore that "the European Central Bank has stated that it will not allow the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, to conduct internal investigations" and that "in its first report to Parliament, Council and Commission, the supervisory committee of OLAF called for legal proceedings to be brought against Community bodies that have not implemented Regulation 1073/99, before the end of 1999" and that "the Commission initiated legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice against the decision of 7 October 1999 of the European Central Bank regarding the non-application of Parliament and Council Regulation 1073/99" .
We believe that this whole issue is extremely important and we support the paragraph of the report which "regrets clear incompatibility between the public commitment assumed by the ECB in its 1999 annual report to establish close cooperation with OLAF and the decision by the ECB itself to prevent OLAF from carrying over internal investigations, pending the ruling by the European Court of Justice" .
We will vote in support of the report by Mr Heaton-Harris for this reason.
Bushill-Matthews report (A5-0335/2000)
Mr President, I could not fail to give an explanation of vote on my friend, Mr Bushill-Matthews' report, upon which I have already spoken during the debate.
This time, however, I would like to state that my vote for the motion is also a call for Mr Bushill-Matthews to accept, at a later date, an amendment which I tabled and which, I regret to say, has been rejected this time. I am calling, that is, for funds to be allocated to small and medium-sized businesses which follow the practice of setting up a company where a young entrepreneur who is full of enthusiasm and the will to work is aided by an older - senior - entrepreneur who knows everything there is to know about the business, is very experienced and can pass on his skills, and, even though he has no real wish to work long hours, would be happy to give the youngsters the benefit of his experience.
The Members of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the Bushill-Matthews report because the specific "Measures on financial assistance for innovative and job-creating Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)" proposed in the report form part of the more general policy exercised by the monopolies and the EU against SMEs, to which there are three strands:
Â· Selective support for a small group of what are - by Greek standards - medium-sized and large enterprises, with a view to consolidating their satellite role around the monopolies and strengthening the processes used to concentrate capital and production.
Â· Worsening competitive terms for the overwhelming majority of the remaining small and medium-sized enterprises, in a bid to strengthen the same processes by the back door.
Â· In addition to the aforementioned, it is clear from all the EU programmes on SMEs that big business is keen to 'offload' (on to SMEs) the jobs which it is forced to abolish as it increases its exploitation of the working classes, helped by technological progress.
This aim will be thwarted by the contradictions inherent in the capitalist system and therefore has little chance of success.
It is also important to note that isolated companies, not SMEs as a whole, benefit from European programmes.
Big business knows only too well that a policy which benefits SMEs as a whole would create an adversary to be reckoned with.
Hence, even if grants under European programmes manage to reach small enterprises, they cannot be used to advantage, because each of these enterprises is in an extremely weak position on the capitalist market.
A number of observations on the substance of the specific programmes bears out the general comments made above:
1.
The limits on the enterprises targeted by these measures (250 employees and up to GDR 14 billion in annual turnover) clearly allow what are large companies by Greek standards to benefit.
In fact, 91% of companies in Greece employ up to 4 persons and achieve turnover of up to GDR 60 million.
From this point of view, the concern about small enterprises expressed in the parliamentary report is well-founded.
2.
The total number of SMEs targeted by these measures is negligible compared with the total number of SMEs in the ÃU: 7 387 out of a total of some 15 million SMEs in the ÃU or 0.05% of the total number over a period of two years from application.
3.
The total paid out by the European funds in grants is discouragingly low and does not amount to a real policy for the benefit of SMEs.
A total of EUR 273 million has been paid out (GDR 93.6 billion) or EUR 18 (GDR 6 170) per enterprise.
4.
The results of this policy are even worse: 2 238 new jobs were finally created, compared with several million unemployed in the ÃU, at a cost of EUR 122 000 (GDR 42 million) each.
5.
97% of SMEs which benefited from these measures come under the third strand of the programmes, i.e. the companies received guarantees for funding for which they themselves were wholly responsible.
This begs the question of how a complicated procedure which cost so much and achieved so little can be presented as a successful EU policy.
As far as Greece is concerned, it was nowhere to be found in the programmes; no funding whatsoever came our way.
We shall therefore be voting against the report in question and the relevant Commission proposal.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Frontier workers (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the situation of frontier workers.
Mr President, I want first of all to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for an excellent report.
Many previous attempts have, of course, been made to use frontier workers' problems as a way in to harmonising tax legislation as a whole.
However, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten knows that frontier workers do not even constitute half a per cent of the labour force, that their problems are different from one frontier region to another and that different regional solutions are therefore needed if frontier workers are to have a better time of it.
I can speak from personal experience, having spent 25 years commuting between Denmark and Sweden.
We have now acquired a bridge between Copenhagen and MalmÃ¶, and everyone expects a sharp increase in cross-border commuting and for the two cities to become a conurbation It was here that, in 1997 on the initiative of the Danes, the EU-supported principle was introduced of taxing people in the country in which they work.
This means that people can take up residence in MalmÃ¶ and have access to health care, child care, education and everything else, at the same time as paying all their tax to the Danish State.
That is quite intolerable if we are to have a common Ãresund region.
The alternative recommended by Swedish politicians is the OECD model for frontier taxation, which advocates that tax should be levied in the country of residence.
That principle too causes problems, however, because much more than families' social welfare is financed through tax.
For ourselves in the Ãresund region, it would in actual fact be best if we were to pay local tax where we live and State tax where we work.
I think that would put an end to tax avoidance and to cheating in frontier regions.
However, a model such as that, too, would require some form of fine tuning in order to create an entirely fair situation, for these are complicated issues.
It is therefore crucial for solutions to be worked out in the affected regions themselves, and on the basic principle that frontier workers must pay tax in the country in which they enjoy their benefits financed through tax.
Only in that way will long-lasting solutions be obtained.
It is essential to adopt a principle of this kind if Ãresund is to become a common region.
Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to the town of Piacenza, which has inserted Articles 25 and 26 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights of the elderly and persons with disabilities into its own bye-laws. I would also like to comment on Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report.
I endorse the content of the report, particularly the part which calls for an analysis of the impact of changes to the laws of the Member States on Regulation 1408, relating to people who have worked in more than one State, and especially that part of the regulation which concerns rules for the payment of the pensions of people who have worked in more than one State.
We are discussing the problems of cross-border workers: of course we refer to European Union workers but also, indirectly, to relations between the States which have associated themselves with Regulation 1408, that is with the EEA - the European Economic Area - in other words Italy and Switzerland.
I regret to say that the Italy-Switzerland Convention and the ensuing regulation have been misinterpreted by the Italian Government, which has hitherto paid the pensions of people who have worked in both Italy and Switzerland according to the scale of half of half the amount, that is a quarter of the amount owed, as laid down by Italian magistrates, judges and courts.
I call upon the European Parliament to intervene to stop workers being forced always to institute legal proceedings to obtain their rights.
Mr President, today we are discussing the situation of frontier workers, a nagging problem for the European Union, which has yet to find a satisfactory solution.
Commissioner, Mr President, this situation prevents the people living and working on the borders of the various European Union countries fully experiencing the notion of European integration we champion, even though these are the people who should be the first to benefit from it.
We have a habit in this House of lauding to the skies the issue of free movement of persons and, hence, of workers.
Yet, while there are still obstacles to this, particularly in terms of tax and social security, there are also other matters to be considered.
I believe that this issue is inconsistent with the principles of freedom and liberalism which we are considering, even though we seem able to find perfectly good solutions to problems when it relates to the free movement of capital and of goods.
This represents a major obstacle to the principle of the free movement of persons and the principal of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.
In my opinion, this report is a real booster shot in relation to previous reports.
We should at least ensure that there is no need to produce many more reports.
We must remind the Member States of their responsibilities and ask them to undertake a thorough evaluation of policies which result in upholding systems which have an adverse affect on the situation of frontier workers.
We agree with the general thrust of the report but the reincorporation of certain amendments waters down the ambitions which we should be adopting.
Bilateral agreements, which, for example, relate to tax or social security, should be perfectly consistent and it is simply not a matter of taking varying provisions into account.
Mr President, I would like to sum up by repeating that an accurate inventory should be proposed, listing situations giving rise to prejudice, or even discrimination but also one which would make it possible to clamp down on the fraud which occurs at present. We await the Council' s guidelines in this area.
Mr President, I should also like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her own-initiative report.
I think it only right that we in Parliament make efforts to reduce the problems experienced by frontier workers.
I am familiar with the problems from Southern Jutland, where it is worth noting how few people live on one side of the Danish-German border and work on the other side.
I think this illustrates how major the obstacles in practice are.
That is why I think it is a good idea to try to get the Member States to continually assess the effects upon frontier workers whenever they change tax and social security legislation. In my opinion, we cannot, however, require governments to compensate frontier workers financially for changes in legislation.
It is better to heighten awareness not only of the problems there have always been, but also of new problems that might arise.
I should also like to support the view that we should do more to simplify Regulation 1408/71.
This is a very far-reaching problem, but one of great importance to many people.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make a few observations following on from this dossier.
First of all, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the work she has done.
Secondly, my contribution should of course be considered as an appeal to the Social Council and the Commission, but mainly the Social Council, to do something about this dossier at long last, particularly in the knowledge that this is the start of the necessary deregulation of the movement of workers across Europe.
Frontier work falls under free movement, and will grow, especially once the candidate countries have joined.
Despite this, there are still major problems to contend with. Especially in my own country and a number of neighbouring countries, Belgium and Germany, I notice that different groups wish to apply different principles.
Foundations involved with frontier workers argue in favour of the principle of the country of residence, trade unions support the principle of the country of employment, the government itself believes in the principle of the country of residence, and so it goes on. It is about time we made a decision, and in that sense, we are unwilling to support a number of amendments which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten tabled, and which are partly designed to adopt a mixed approach.
We suggest using the principle of the country of employment as point of departure, and to develop this so-called European social model.
Mr President, I should like above all to thank the rapporteur for this report.
It is good that we should not forget frontier workers and their problems.
The report is further evidence that Regulation 1408/71 requires thorough revision and simplification, proposals for which have been before the Council for two years.
We can, therefore, once again regret the lack of success in obtaining more majority voting at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice.
The Danish Social Democrats broadly agree with most of what the rapporteur says, but I completely and utterly disagree with her when she sees it as a problem that ever more features of national social insurance are financed through public funds.
Regulation 1408/71 concerns the coordination, and not the harmonisation, of social security arrangements, and it is important to make this clear.
I should like to emphasise this, because it is precisely this form of argument which has given an unwarranted boost to those Danish opponents of the EU who maintain that the EU is eroding the Danish welfare system.
It is partly those who organise resistance to the EU who are purposefully working to ensure that nothing at all happens in this area.
They seem to forget that the Council' s incapacity for action does in fact have consequences - consequences for those people and their families who work across national frontiers and who are plagued by uncertainty.
However, one further consequence of the Council' s incapacity to act is, in actual fact, that it is the courts, instead of the politicians responsible, who take the decisions.
The Eurosceptics talk such a lot about democracy, but it can never be democratic to omit to take the necessary decisions and, in that way, to consign people to insecurity and to give the courts a degree of influence which politicians ought to have.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her excellent report on the situation of frontier workers and, in particular, the social and fiscal problems these workers face.
I should also like to thank Parliament for the support given to the Commission's proposal to extend the scope of Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals, the proposal to modernise and simplify that regulation, and for the encouraging support given to the Eures network.
The Commission fully supports your concerns as regards the problems encountered by frontier workers.
I therefore welcome your proposal to forward the resolution to the Council.
Allow me to now set out briefly the Commission's approach to the points raised in the resolution.
First, on social security and the labour market, the report calls on the Commission, before the end of this year, to organise an international conference for the Member States and applicant countries concerning the position of frontier workers.
This is an excellent idea and advantage can be taken of the experience accumulated under the Eures network.
Such a conference could identify best practices and initiatives that could be launched both at Community and national level, and the European Parliament will be involved in its organisation.
On the idea of coordination provisions for supplementary pensions, I would remind you that the Commission has committed itself in its social policy agenda to propose in 2002 a directive on the transferability of supplementary pensions.
This initiative will complement the already existing directive in this field, which was adopted in 1998.
As the proposal will be based on Article 42 of the EC Treaty and rely on the codecision procedure for its adoption, Parliament will be fully involved.
Furthermore I can confirm that a study covering the extent and nature of frontier work is already planned to be carried out under the Eures auspices in 2001.
On the initiatives taken by social security agencies for closer cross-border cooperation in order to facilitate access to health-care benefits, I am very much in favour of such initiatives and can confirm that it is the intention of the Commission to encourage such initiatives and to promote exchanges of experience and best practices.
In fact the Commission is already giving support to such a project involving the inhabitants of the Euregio Meuse-Rhine, which covers part of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.
With regard to the follow-up of the Decker and Kohl judgments, there are important legal questions currently being debated in new cases before the Court.
These questions concern hospital care and the Dutch health system.
The Commission will await the outcome of these judgments before taking a position.
On obstacles to the mobility of stagiaires, students, volunteers and researchers, the Commission has already taken the initiative and presented a proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and the Council on mobility within the Community for students, persons undergoing training, young volunteers, teachers and trainers.
On 9 November 2000 the Education Council adopted its common position on this proposal.
I wish to thank Parliament for its support on this matter and I hope that the final discussions will enable Parliament and the Council to adopt the recommendations shortly.
On the idea of a proposal for a directive on the introduction of frontier effect reports, whereby Member States would be required to test their legislation as to the effects for frontier workers, I should make it clear that it is already the Commission's task to ensure that all provisions of national legislation are compatible with the Treaty and the secondary legislation of Community law.
The Commission will certainly continue to use the powers laid down in Article 226 of the Treaty and to launch infringement proceedings against Member States when they violate Community law.
However, I understand that the suggested proposal for a directive aims to provide for a more general socio-economic impact assessment of the consequences of national legislation, that is in itself compatible with Community law but might cause further difficulties to frontier workers.
The Commission is not sure that it would be appropriate to propose such a legislative instrument.
It seems to the Commission more appropriate to stimulate cross-border cooperation of the partners involved in the different regions and at Community level in order to prevent any negative consequences of national legislation on frontier workers.
Finally, my comments on tax.
Unlike social security, there is no Community legislation at all on personal taxation.
Indeed Member States are extremely protective of their sovereignty in this area.
That is particularly true of their competence to enter into bilateral tax treaties.
Therefore, there is little chance of the Commission being able to secure successfully the adoption of measures by Member States, as requested in the report.
Unfortunately this will not change following the Treaty of Nice.
As you are aware, contrary to our common wishes, the requirement of unanimity in Council was retained for tax matters.
Opinions are, moreover, likely to be divided about the merits of the recommendations made in the report concerning taxation in the State of employment.
In fact, the prevailing view in tax administrations is that the State of residence rather than the State of employment is best placed to take account of the overall situation of taxpayers.
In conclusion, I wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten again for her stimulating report and to underline the Commission's determination to maintain its efforts to overcome the problems faced by frontier workers.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The debate will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Environment directives
The next item is the oral question (B5-0556/2000) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to the Commission, on the poor implementation of certain environmental directives (PCB/PCT, habitats, nitrates).
Mr President, Parliament's Committee on the Environment is increasingly concerned that we are adopting European environmental legislation and then neglecting to implement it properly.
Putting it bluntly, we believe that the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the European Parliament are complicit in a deception of the public.
Opinion polls show that the majority of people support the idea that environmental issues are important and should be dealt with at European level.
We are adopting legislation that appears to fill this need.
In fact, in all too many cases, environmental laws are ignored, targets are not met, reports are not sent in to the Commission on time and those countries which break the law go unpunished.
The purpose of this debate is to highlight what is going wrong and to try and do something about it.
The Committee on the Environment has put together three reports, we call them 'insight reports' , basing ourselves on the model of the US Congress.
We have found that the habitats directive is locked in controversy and law suits.
The PCBs directive is characterised by the failure of Member States to supply the all-important inventories of the stocks they hold.
The nitrates directive was probably flawed from the beginning and all but two countries, Denmark and Sweden of course, are now before the European Court of Justice because of their failure to implement it.
It is highly likely that these shortcomings are repeated throughout the canon of EU environmental law.
What can be done about this?
We hope firstly that in the environmental action programme, which the world is eagerly awaiting, the Commission will key in adequate resources for following up what has happened to legislation.
It would be interesting to hear from the Commissioner roughly how many people in her Directorate are responsible for this as compared to those overseeing the introduction of new legislation.
There needs to be a much more honest debate secondly - nationally and at the European level - about the real possibility of achieving the environmental objectives set out in draft legislation.
Too often, we suspect, Member States sign up to green laws because it looks good to do so, and opposing or moderating them is seen as politically insensitive.
If, in fact, they cannot comply with what they have agreed to, such countries are doing Green causes harm.
If the Germans and others, for example, now have trouble with the habitats directive, why did we not hear more about it when that directive was going through this Parliament?
And did the German Government, in fact, vote against that directive originally?
Certainly the cost of clean-up laws must be taken into account when a law is adopted.
A good example of the failure to do this is the urban waste water directive which the government of Brussels cannot afford to comply with.
We suspect that the same thing will happen with the national emissions ceiling directive.
Thirdly, we want Member States to develop the infrastructures which will allow them, all of them, to carry out the monitoring work that must accompany the proper implementation of many of the EU directives we adopt here.
My colleagues and I were desperately disappointed that the Council felt it could not agree to our proposal to transform the environmental inspections recommendation into a directive.
We were not demanding an EU inspectorate but simply that Member States should agree to bring their national inspectorates up to a common high standard.
We will continue to pursue this idea in two years time when the issue should return to us.
Fourthly, we want much quicker action by the Commission to take Member States to court when they break EU law.
Last week the Greek Government, which can ill afford to do so, paid the second instalment of a fine, now totalling over EUR 2 million for failure to comply with a judgment of the Court of Justice over the dumping of waste in Crete.
This was thirteen years after the Commission received the first complaint about the dumping of that waste and no less than nineteen years after the directive concerned came into force.
It is absurd that a poor country should get itself into a situation of paying back money to Brussels, but equally absurd that the case should have taken so long.
Finally, let me say that we in Parliament are not daunted or diverted by the idea that the European Parliament should only be concerned with the adoption of legislation and not with its follow-up.
Apparently the Environment Council was somewhat surprised and even disapproving that we had intruded into their territory and that our intention was to take the environmental inspections recommendation very seriously.
MEPs, as we will all know, are on the receiving end of public criticism of poor implementation.
The public tends to complain to us, not to the Environment Council.
In the interests of the people of Europe and their environment, we will pursue this issue and we will not let go.
Mr President, first of all I thank Mrs Jackson for her important question.
I would remind all the Members of the European Parliament that implementation of European Community law covers both the transposition of directives into national law and their application to individual decisions.
It also includes fulfilment of other obligations such as adopting programmes, making designations and monitoring.
The difficulties encountered by the Committee on the Environment in these three reports are indeed not limited to the three directives chosen but extend to all EC environmental directives.
The Commission, and not least the Environment DG are aware of these difficulties and have for some time devoted efforts to improve their performance in this field and I can assure you that next week when the Commission discusses the Sixth Environmental Action Programme the whole implementation issue will be a very important point in that programme.
We have a number of tools at our disposal to improve implementation.
We can, for example, disseminate information to give a more up-to-date picture of the state of play and I know that we have also forwarded some of these reports and annual surveys to Parliament and that we can do much more to ensure some media attention as well.
We can develop tools to aid in the analysis and evaluation of progress in implementation.
We can take legal measures to follow up implementation.
Since 1997 specific initiatives have been pursued on a number of fronts including environmental liability, which of course will put pressure on the Member States to follow the existing rules and regulations; complaints and investigations procedures at national level where we have been involved in playing a consultancy role; access to justice, magistrates' training courses - also very important because this is also about education - and the publication of this annual survey on the implementation of environmental law.
We have also worked to create a clear link between implementation of the directives and Community cofunding which has proven to be very effective as well as ensuring a close relationship with the LIFE financial instrument, because when they see that the money is threatened if they do not comply with the regulations this will definitely put pressure on the Member States.
In May last year we had a first name and shame exercise, as we call it, on bathing water quality.
A second exercise will take place in March this year and I will continue to follow this up so as to give us a scoreboard of how Member States are implementing Community legislation.
Just last week the European Parliament and the Council, as Mrs Jackson said, reached an agreement on a recommendation which will establish minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States.
All these initiatives are intended to increase the level of knowledge of and compliance with European Community and environmental law.
Of course, I acknowledge that there is still much to be done.
We have to look for new ways to encourage the proper transposition and application of environmental legislation.
For example, we need to work to improve the involvement of people at the local and regional level.
Greater public awareness at these levels would lead to closer scrutiny and to public demand for effective implementation of environmental legislation.
We must remain vigilant and active to ensure that the situation improves and I would like to confirm to the European Parliament my personal commitment and that of my services to ensuring the highest possible level of compliance with European Community environmental law.
To this end I will apply all means available, including the formal infringement procedures set out in Articles 226 and 228 of the European Community Treaty and 141 and 143 of the Euratom Treaty, which may lead to imposing economic penalties on non-complying Member States.
I would be more than happy to receive more resources and personnel from the European Parliament to work on this.
Today we have about 45 to 50 staff working full or part-time on implementation, and, of course, we would need more than that.
But I also think that it is for every civil servant here to actually look at the implementation part of introducing new legislation.
I have been very clear from the beginning that I will put more emphasis on implementation.
That needs the three I' s: information, integration and implementation, which should be the guidelines for the future.
I hope that you will agree with me that we are starting to make progress on improving implementation and if both the Commission and the European Parliament continue their efforts to highlight the problem and act on it, further progress will surely be made during this parliamentary term.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the field of the environment and public health, the main problem with the European legislative process is not its inability to produce appropriate legislation.
The problem lies, on the one hand, in the slowness with which directives are transposed into national law and, on the other, in shortcomings in their implementation.
The environmental directives that we are now debating, on PCBs, nitrates and habitats, are examples of this very problem.
There is little point in our having approved the directive on habitats and the creation of the "Nature 2000" network in order to protect sites of Community importance, when the Commission has been waiting since 1995 for all the Member States to present a definitive list of these sites, as well as their plans, rules and management mechanisms.
The same problem applies to the directive on PCBs.
And there is little point in our having stipulated the ban on PCBs and the decontamination of all equipment containing PCBs and PCTs with a view to protecting public health, if five years on, the overwhelming majority of Member States have not only failed to implement the directive, but have also failed to take the most simple action, which was to catalogue PCBs and to produce plans for decontamination.
We therefore have widespread non-compliance and for that reason, these directives have not produced the environmental results hoped for.
We also have a situation, however, in which a degree of impunity reigns.
The slowness of the Community's legal processes and the rare use of financial penalties against those Member States that are slow to comply have sent out two negative political messages.
Those States that do comply feel that there is no incentive to continue and those that do not comply do not feel any pressure to change their ways.
It is therefore crucial for the Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties, to monitor the whole process of transposing and implementing Community law, publicising the commitment of all the Member States and guaranteeing that those States that do not comply will be penalised as an example.
Mr President, as Mrs Jackson has so clearly illustrated, the picture which emerges from the analysis of the implementation of the three directives in question gives genuine cause for concern.
Despite the fact that the measures differ quite widely, it appears that the majority of Member States have fallen a long way behind schedule in implementing them practically.
And, quite apart from the technical considerations specific to each of the three directives, this is a serious situation which must lead us to reflect on the reasons behind it.
I would like to highlight two aspects of the issue: on the one hand, in our countries, protection of the environment is hardly ever considered at the planning stage of the various sectorial policies but continues to be viewed as a series of actions to be carried out a posteriori in order to repair damage. On the other hand, precisely because of this retrospective approach, it is often felt that the directives are too costly to implement and that it would not serve any real purpose to do so.
The error lies precisely in, when all is said and done, considering environmental investments to be an obligation which has been imposed, an additional cost which serves no purpose.
But the environment is our future and we cannot rely solely on volunteers or fear of a sentence from the Court of Justice to protect it.
I, too, am of the opinion that, since the Fifth Environmental Action Programme adopted a principally sectorial approach to environmental policy, it may be that, when discussing the sixth, we ought to place greater emphasis on the involvement of social and economic players such as local authorities in the achievement of the objectives, so that the safeguarding of our environment increasingly becomes an element to be integrated into the overall planning stage.
In this context, it will be important, as we state in our motion for a resolution, to ensure extensive circulation of the best and worst results achieved by the Member States in the implementation of the environment directives. This could even take place via the Internet and would underline the difference in the commitment of each of the States in this matter and expose their behaviour to public opinion, which is almost always more effective than judgments of the Court of Justice.
In order to facilitate the monitoring operation, but also comparison between the different situations, I feel that it is also even more important to continue to develop research on common indicators in the field of the environment.
The protection of the environment crosses national borders and is a field of Community action par excellence.
It is also for this reason, and even more so in the light of the now imminent enlargement to countries of Central and Eastern Europe, that we must not accept that the decisions adopted by ourselves and the 15 governments should then be disregarded.
The natural world is a common legacy, and our commitment to pursuing goals must serve as an example to the candidate countries, who are in the throes of remedying often extremely serious incidents of deterioration.
If this situation is to improve, each of us, as a representative of Community, national or local institutions but also simply as a citizen, must do our part.
Mr President, my assistant, Vikki Phillips, has just handed me a note which says that Denmark spends 15 times more than Greece in carrying out environmental inspections and making appropriate assessments.
Well, if that is the case, then something is clearly very wrong, and I suspect it is not wrong with Denmark.
I am very pleased to support most of what the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment has said, although I have some trepidation in doing so being conscious that the next ECJ fine may well be against the UK for its failure to comply with the bathing water directive, despite the fact that a great deal of money has been spent and effort made in recent years to reach such compliance.
I want to make it clear, though, that I do not believe that we should be using the failure of some Member States to achieve compliance with environmental legislation to justify weakening our ambitions or claiming that too much legislation is impractical.
I am all for being realistic and for making sure that new legislation makes sense but the problems we face both throughout the European Union and across the world are too great for us to lower our sights.
And I think some of the progress made by the United Kingdom in implementing the habitats directive over the past year demonstrates very clearly that it is very often not the fault of the legislation but the lack of political will which is to blame for the failure to deliver the goods we all wish to see.
I want strongly to support the idea of a scoreboard which the Commissioner mentioned and of gestures to name and shame those Member States which are failing to meet the expectations of MEPs, of the Commission and of the public.
As a politician, the Commissioner knows very well the importance of making sure that that information is presented in a way which is easily digestible and understood by every journalist across the European Union and perhaps a few politicians as well.
So, let us call it the Commission's little red book, no, let us call it the Commission's big green book, albeit one with a few black spots on its pages.
Let us name and shame at every opportunity and bring the public alongside us in ensuring that this environmental legislation is enforced and that Member States recognise their responsibilities.
Mr President, Mrs Jackson well expressed the concern of the members of the Committee on the Environment, which in my case is heightened since I belong to the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions.
Forty per cent of the petitions submitted to this committee come from citizens concerned for the preservation of the environment.
And they usually refer to the habitats directive, the environmental impact directive, the wild birds directive and the right to information directive, which together with those discussed here today on nitrates and PCBs are probably the ones most often infringed.
Mr Goodwill's report shows that there are some Member States before the courts, others with proceedings against them, and only two Member States that are above suspicion.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt too, in his report, mentions those Member States that have repeatedly infringed the habitats directive.
The Committee on Petitions and I, myself, know that what often happens is that Member States either do not respond in time or, as we say in Spain, and I do not know if there is a good translation, they "make the partridge dizzy" [try to deceive one].
In addition, with the scant human resources of the Committee members, who are always having to answer the demands not only of the petitioners but also of the governments, it is very difficult to work, Commissioner.
It is essential that we respect the legislation that we ourselves draw up, and the proof that there is a lack of political will is that some Member States obey it and others break it.
This can give companies a competitive edge.
In my opinion, there are three fundamental questions.
First, something that has already been mentioned here: the deterrent use of European Funds; European Funds must not be given to projects that break Community law.
Secondly, suitable penalties must be found; it is very hard (I am from a region that badly needs European subsidies), but even if it is very hard to freeze certain subsidies, if it is not done the Member States will not understand.
Lastly, Mr President, the process must be speeded up.
But I know that this lies in the hands of the courts, this lies in the hands of the governments, this lies in the hands of us all.
Mr President, the aim of these directives is to protect the environment.
This means that not only do the Member States transpose the directives into national legislation, they are also the ones who actually implement this national legislation.
This also means that when monitoring implementation, it should not be the means to an end, but the end itself, which should be looked at.
Unfortunately, experience has shown that Member States often fail to implement European directives correctly.
Consequently, campaigns, such as those designed to monitor compliance involving independent inspectorates, are essential.
As far as the environmental inspections are concerned, the European Parliament has gone to great lengths to ensure that this is regulated effectively.
However, negotiations have not led to the enactment of a binding directive, because the Council and Commission do not want that at this stage.
Given this attitude of the Member States, I fear that in future, problems will arise at the implementation stage of other directives too.
We need only call to mind the many warnings issued by the Commission to the Member States, which in some cases have led to infringement procedures.
This can only get worse after enlargement, because the current Member States are setting the wrong example.
Where there are differences in interpretation, the Commission should put forward amendment proposals for workable rules.
These amendments are not intended for additional or more far-reaching measures, but should help improve the workability of the current rules.
As far as the PCB [polychlorinated biphenol] directive is concerned, we should also turn our attention to the supplies.
If these are to be maintained for much longer, it will be a rather long time before this directive makes itself felt.
Mr President, allow me to start by agreeing with everything Mrs Jackson and many of my fellow Members have said and to focus on a number of points.
As everyone has pointed out, we have the legislation.
The problem lies in incorporating and applying this legislation.
Of course, the political will must be there but it depends mainly on the monitoring carried out by your office, Commissioner.
If, for example, you receive repeated complaints, instead of dealing with them through time-consuming correspondence, you should take a persistent and decisive stand and make sure the legislation really is implemented.
And if we have cause to go to the European Court, then let us do so and, if sanctions need to be imposed, then we shall do that too.
As Mrs Jackson has said, Greece is already paying EUR 20 000 a day and I trust that Greece will come to its senses and fall into line.
I should particularly like to draw your attention to Directive 92/43 on Natura 2000 areas.
We should not allow projects to go ahead in these areas with a light heart, because Article 6 of the directive says that only in the absence of alternative solutions should a project be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest in Natura 2000 areas.
And here again I would remind you that in an area of Greece, in the area of Fthiotida, where everyone is against bridging the Maliako Gulf which, it should be noted the Ministry of the Environment and Public Works itself included in the Natura 2000 areas, your office has received complaints about the Greek Government's intention to build this bridge, which will have a huge environmental impact, even though alternative solutions exist.
I shall be monitoring - and I welcome the undertaking which you took in your intervention and I hope that it is a real undertaking - what happens in all the areas in Europe which are Natura 2000 areas including, of course, the Maliako Gulf, where there are plans to build a bridge which will wipe out an important habitat.
Mr President, first of all I must thank the Commissioner and the Chairman and other colleagues for their words of wisdom.
They are very positive and clear commitments to do something about this very serious problem.
But it is not just words we need, it is actions, it is deeds, and we cannot rely on Member States to do this alone.
Even if representatives of the Council were here, which they do not appear to be, even if they were prepared to make statements, which they do not appear to be, we would not be able to leave them to do it on their own.
We need some kind of watchdog to monitor and ensure the implementation of legislation.
Sadly our own Environment Agency does not appear to be up to the job yet.
We can but hope.
So what solutions do we have?
What can Parliamentarians do?
Well, these three reports before Parliament today are a start.
They name and shame.
They call for fines.
They make proposals for further improvement.
But, they also make a point which we must take on board here in Parliament.
They say essentially that bad legislation should never have been put on the statute book.
And that is a lesson that we have to take to heart.
Perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better.
We have talked about doing it but seemingly not done so yet.
When we put better legislation on the agenda in future, it has to be respected.
Because of the failure of Member States to put into place legislation, typically the PCBs and PCTs legislation, we now have the extremely serious problem of a long-term contamination of our food chain by a persistent toxic chemical.
That toxic chemical is slowly but surely accumulating in the human food chain, reaching levels which are already beyond World Health Organisation levels in certain fatty substances, typically butter, and in some cases fatty fish, such as salmon.
They are now creeping up the food chain to the point where our children are now starting to ingest amounts of these toxins that are beyond those that are recommended by the World Health Organisation.
If we are not prepared to take serious action promptly in future we will see further problems of this kind affecting future generations.
We owe it to those future generations to pursue this issue.
Mr President, I share the opinion of Mrs Jackson and many other speakers who say that once legislation has been laid down, it should be implemented.
I also agree with Mrs Jackson and her statement regarding the nitrates directive: "that was flawed from the beginning".
It was poor legislation.
How is it possible, if you want to maintain 50 milligrams of nitrate in groundwater, to apply the same stocking density per hectare across the entire European Union, from Finland to Italy?
Needless to say, the growth season in Finland is much shorter than in Italy, and so in Italy, as a general rule, more cattle units per hectare can be kept than in Finland.
As far as I am concerned, every farmer can have as many cows as he chooses, as long as he does not exceed the 50 milligram limit.
Turning now to measurements, how it is possible that the Commission has not issued any clear guidelines on how measurements are to be taken, the depth levels of these measurements, the number of times a year they should be taken, and how seasonal influences can be taken into consideration?
All these factors are still unknown and differ considerably from country to country and season to season.
And if nitrate is measured, how is it determined that it originates from animal manure alone?
A great number of farmers use artificial fertiliser; how is that measured?
What is the impact of sewage leaks, for example?
What is the impact of major rivers discharging into other countries?
Animal manure cannot be the only cause of nitrate pollution, and it is completely unreasonable to tell farmers to restrict its use if we do not know the other causes.
I share the view of all the speakers who say that we must adopt sound environmental policy.
I do not dispute the standard of 50 milligrams of nitrate in groundwater, but I do want clear guidelines on how it should be measured and how these measurements should be carried out.
Mr President, I have written the report on the follow-up to the habitats directive and have, in the meantime, obtained the clear impression that many Member States really did not appreciate what commitments they were taking on when they adopted the directive.
They did not appreciate how far-reaching it really was.
This is one of the most important explanations for why progress has been so slow.
However, the fact that progress has been slow does not mean that nothing is happening.
In actual fact, an incredible amount is happening in this area, albeit not as much as we should like.
When the directive is called into question, it is important to remember that what is happening is important, even if progress is slow.
I also believe that this is an explanation for why insufficient resources have been invested in information and in dialogue with those directly affected by these protected areas, something which also creates partly unnecessary conflicts in many areas.
I believe there is a lot to be learned from this.
Obviously, the Member States have prime responsibility, both financially and legally, but, for the EU' s part, it is important not only to legislate and to collect funds - good though these activities obviously are - but also to publicise the many good examples there are and to use its own financial resources to encourage sound development.
The situation we have is incredibly serious, mainly because of the extremely rapid impoverishment of biodiversity.
Nor can we see a reversal of this trend.
The work must therefore continue and, in the present situation, the directive ought not to be changed or reviewed.
Mr President, I very much welcome the fact that we as Parliament also fulfil our monitoring competences and that we take a look at directives which meet with a great deal of criticism in the Member States.
Not only do they meet with a great deal of criticism in the Member States, they also cause enormous division in the European Parliament.
I would like to comment on two directives today.
These are the habitats directive and the nitrates directive.
What do these two directives have in common?
The fact that the Member States have been granted far-reaching powers to designate nature reserves, species to be protected, and certainly as far as the nitrates directive is concerned, the sensitive areas.
There are now an increasing number of complaints from members of the Dutch Lower Chamber of the States General who ask us what in God' s name we have been up to.
However, it is not Europe which prescribed that the whole of the Netherlands should be designated a nitrate-sensitive area.
It is the Netherlands itself which decided to do so.
It is then up to us, with the kind help of a number of MEPs, to see how, by means of derogation requests, we can undo the nitrate legislation, for example, in order to reach the goal, this being a reduction in nitrate levels, in a decent fashion.
The same applies to the habitats directive.
Today' s tragedy, a cross-border industrial site between Aachen and Maastricht, has been brought to a standstill for the umpteenth time because of two European hamsters.
These hamsters were spirited away by a campaign group for the protection and preservation of this species who believed that, if they abducted the hamsters, they could get them to mate.
But forced mating is something which does not work, even in the animal kingdom.
Once again, for the umpteenth time, the Council of State in the Netherlands brought a cross-border industrial site to a standstill.
However, having scrutinised the habitats directive and having correctly interpreted the regulation on areas where preservation is required, we see that this measure was unnecessary.
What should happen now, and that is why I support the report on the habitats directive, and most certainly the nitrates directive, is for the European Commission to make it quite clear - and perhaps lay down in writing in clear Dutch language - what is and is not possible.
We agree on the principles, they are sound, but the way in which the Member States deal with them is disgraceful by any standard.
Mr President, poor compliance with environmental legislation is a huge problem.
As co-legislator, it is important for us to speak our minds, but we should not pass the blame to the Member States too readily.
We must also consider the quality and nature of the legislation we produce.
The Union is growing ever bigger and more diverse.
We must therefore lay down rules which can thrive in the different national cultures.
That is why I think we should prescribe less detail.
We must be very precise in the results we want, but not in the way in which the results must be achieved.
For that reason, I believe we should stand by the result, a maximum of 50 milligrams, in the nitrates directive.
We do accept a certain degree of flexibility with regard to the method by which the result is achieved.
An example of sound legislation is the habitats directive.
The environment is a common legacy; environmental protection a common task.
It makes no sense to protect birds in one country if they are being shot down across the border in another country.
The habitats directive prescribes a clear goal.
The way in which it is to be achieved is quite flexible.
The directive is not detailed, but provides a framework which allows latitude for weighing up local or regional interests, and that is exactly how we need to move forward.
As long as the result - caring for the protected species and their habitats - remains paramount.
Needless to say, there are many conflicts in villages and provinces with regard to the directive' s application.
There are instances of incorrect application.
It would be useful and necessary to provide clear information, but I am taken aback by the large number of MEPs who have requested a review of the bird and habitats directive in order to work out in further detail certain concepts in the habitats directive.
The significant implications of this would then be compensation and major public interest.
The very strength of the habitats directive lies in its flexibility.
The directive stands for a modern way of protecting the environment.
It is not about putting up fences around the environment, but about dealing with the species and natural resources in a conscientious manner.
Accordingly, I regret that some MEPs are adding to the chaos by suggesting in an amendment that the existing infrastructure should disappear, or that major new projects are not viable.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was delighted to find this topic on the agenda today.
I would like to thank Mrs Jackson for raising the question.
Although you refer to three specific EU directives, I would point out that what we are talking about here is a widespread problem with the transposition of EU legislation in the Member States.
If you start from the principle that directives and regulations are adopted by the Council and Parliament in the EU, then it is quite reasonable to assume that the Council - which does, after all, use these directives - will transpose them in the Member States accordingly.
But what do we see happening? Two camps are forming.
On one side there is the European Union, which seeks to blame the Member States for shortcomings. On the other side, there are the Member States, which are more than willing to offload their problems onto the oh-so-distant Europe, forgetting in the process that they are part of Europe themselves, and the Commission is piggy-in-the-middle.
Commissioner, you have gone to great lengths to try and ensure that these laws are transposed in the European Union in a purposeful manner.
But it really is not that simple and, of course, we have criticised your methods sometimes.
I can understand to an extent, why you took the line you did.
There are various reasons as to why countries have trouble transposing this legislation.
In my opinion, one of the reasons in the case of the nitrates directive is the failure to observe scientific findings, because one thing is for sure, it is not possible to reduce nitrate levels as rapidly as we demand.
Nature simply will not allow it.
However, in the case of the habitats directive, Parliament highlighted the shortcomings quite clearly last year, namely that the directive was complicated and unclear in parts and so it cannot be transposed in the Member States.
When we were in Toulouse, we saw how local people are trying to transpose it.
But basically, they do not know what is going on.
They do not know where the boundaries are, or how to apply them properly.
These are shortcomings that must be reviewed as a matter of priority.
But it is also our responsibility to ensure that the directives are less utopian and far more realistic in nature.
Mrs Jackson's question actually contains all the points we need to address and there is nothing more to add to it.
Speedier sanctions and careful drafting of laws will enable us to solve this problem.
However, I would just like to point out that something needs to change in the Member States too, because the Environment Ministers are, no doubt, sometimes too cowardly to promote the initiatives they adopt here, in their own countries, if this could lead to conflict.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Jackson and the rapporteurs for the three reports we are debating today.
Effective implementation of the EU' s environment directives in the Member States is naturally of great significance in two ways: firstly, in terms of environmental protection - which is, of course, the whole purpose of the directives - but also in terms of our not causing confidence to be lost in EU legislative work through the Member States' being able for a long time to get away with not implementing the legislation which they themselves have helped bring about in the Council of Ministers.
That is why I think that the three reports concerning the Member States' failure to implement EU legislation are important.
The Council has, of course, been rather irritated about the fact that Parliament is looking over its shoulders, but I think that the work on the reports has revealed how slack the majority of the Member States are about implementing EU legislation.
They have also revealed how slow the Commission' s and the Court of Justice' s reactions are when it comes to inadequate implementation.
We often, of course, hear fine speeches about grand European visions and the Europe of the future, sometimes from Members of this Parliament.
We also hear this kind of thing from many governments, but it often, of course, disguises the fact that narrow national interests are being cultivated instead of the common interests we have worked for in the course of the legislative work.
It is also interesting to note that those countries which are often regarded as rather reluctant and critical in relation to certain aspects of EU cooperation are in reality those countries which comply best with EU decisions.
In all modesty, I am thinking, for example, of the Nordic countries.
I was pleased to hear Mrs WallstrÃ¶m' s remarks on the reports.
I am sure that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m has the will to ensure that the legislation is of a sufficiently high quality to be implemented and to ensure that it is effectively followed up.
I think, at any rate, that Parliament ought to provide as much support as possible for this work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Jackson's question illustrates the fact that the best laws in the world are no use whatsoever unless they are applied correctly and, more importantly, properly controlled.
For example, the Member States have not transposed the habitats directive into national legislation.
The same applies to a great deal of other legislation.
And this is legislation which we need for the future.
The Commission is responsible for transposition and for checking what sort of on-site controls have been carried out.
In doing so it, in turn, must rely on information supplied to it by the Member States.
I get the impression that monitoring is no easy task and if the Commission is to perform this task it needs information and data and reports to be sent in.
The complaint was often voiced in the past that the Commission did not have enough staff and resources to evaluate the data sent in for control purposes.
I should therefore like to ask the Commission if it now has sufficient resources.
Mind you, Parliament cannot talk, because we are constantly calling for reports.
I know that the Commission is very busy receiving and processing reports and that this sometimes ties up Commission capacities and resources unnecessarily.
In other words, we all have to think where we can make improvements.
I think the Commission should react more quickly, both towards the Member States and in instituting the necessary proceedings before the ECJ and setting fines.
At the same time, I call on the Member States to honour their obligations to transpose and control legislation and report to the Commission properly.
I am the person responsible in our group for the water framework directive and the rapporteur for the groundwater action programme, which is still pending, and the nitrates directive is therefore a matter of particular concern to me.
On Tuesday, i.e. tomorrow, we shall be voting on the Goodwill report, to which I have proposed a number of amendments.
I should like to ask the House to accept these proposed amendments, because what we are trying to do here is to give the Member States more responsibility.
I should therefore be grateful for your support.
Finally, I should like to mention one more point, namely the candidate countries.
We require candidate countries to adopt European legislation.
But when the Member States themselves fail to abide by it and the European Commission is unable to take decisive action, then everything starts to go pear-shaped.
For this reason alone and, most importantly, in order to protect human health and the environment, all those responsible need to radically rethink the matter post-haste and these reports make that clear.
Mr President, what a relief that no speaker so far has called for the environmental directives to be watered down.
Mr SjÃ¶stedt, it is nothing to with the poor Member States not knowing what they were letting themselves in for.
And right now they know full well that they are simply and deliberately contravening European legislation.
They are stalling for time and they know perfectly well that nothing will happen to them, because it takes so long for the Court to do anything.
What we have here is the deliberate flouting of European legislation and neither Parliament nor the Council should stand for it.
Some members are saying that we should name and shame.
I can name and shame myself because Austria is one of the countries which has failed to comply with the habitats directive, but I must also protest, Commissioner, because Austria has not been at all remiss as far as the PCB directive is concerned.
We did everything here which needed to be done even before there was a European directive.
We passed a Waste Law back in 1990 and an ordinance banning halogenated substances in 1993.
We are being accused unfairly here.
As far as the nitrates directive is concerned, Austria has now rectified its shortcomings, but we know only too well that the Member States had terrible trouble transposing the nitrates directive.
The main problem here was that, because of the extremely high density of livestock in many parts of the Union, keeping to within the limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare of farmland caused immense difficulties with the production of farm manure in several countries.
Perhaps such a high density of livestock will be less of a problem in the future, because cows, those pained and tormented creatures, are fighting back.
The form of BSE which currently confronts us may well be a sort of revenge on the part of these tormented animals.
We should take a lesson from nature and conduct ourselves properly and comply with the laws which we ourselves have passed.
Mr President, the drinking-water directive, waste-management directive, major accident hazards, sewage sludge, asbestos, wild birds, waste shipment, not to mention the habitats directive, the nitrates directive and the PCB directive.
The list is long, the list of the failure of my own country to transpose EU environmental law.
Despite warning letters, reasoned opinions, threats of legal action to the European Court of Justice, so it embarrassingly continues.
We are second worst in terms of transposition and designation of sites under the habitats directive.
Sometimes, but rarely, there can be genuine reasons for delayed transposition of a directive and the nitrates directive has come in for particular mention in this regard here today.
But to fail to provide information requested by the Commission under Article 10 of the Treaty in a timely and proper manner is inexcusable.
That is the first step: reply to the letters of the Commission.
No government should be forgiven bad manners and inappropriate behaviour.
That is one of Ireland's and, I suspect, many countries' cardinal sins in relation to the area we are discussing.
Article 10 requires Member States to actively cooperate with the Commission in dealing with complaints, to clarify facts and to state official positions.
Only last weekend I read in the Irish media that the head of the Commission's Environment DG, Mr Curry, complained to Ireland's EU Ambassador, Mr Denis O'Leary, last autumn that the Irish authorities were not cooperating adequately with Brussels on environmental issues.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m wrote last March to the Irish Minister of the Environment, Mr Dempsey, suggesting that the large number of Irish environmental complaints currently being dealt with by the EU officials be dealt with in his department or by the Irish Ombudsman.
No joy, no progress, perhaps even no response - I do not know.
With 1% of the Community's population, to our shame we in Ireland have been generating 10% of the Commission's environmental complaints.
Mr Curry had strong words for not only our Department of the Environment but also our Department of Finances policies, our Environmental Protection Agency, our Heritage Protection Agency and, indeed, our local authorities.
Sensitive and sensible implementation must be encouraged to ensure political and public cooperation and understanding of what we have to achieve.
I often give the example - as I did at a committee meeting this morning - of the survival of the only cotton-weed colony in Ireland in the south-east corner of Wexford.
This is on a local pilgrimage path.
In its over-zealousness to protect the cotton-weed, the local council decided to ban the pilgrimage from the immediate area.
It very quickly became apparent that the trampling of the pilgrims' feet and not divine intervention had, in fact, been essential to protect that particular ecosystem.
Stronger and more vigorous species, better known colloquially as 'weeds' - even though they are all wild flowers - gained a foothold in the colony and began to choke off the cotton-weed once human intervention was gone.
Changing the essential balance between human activity and our environment led to the loss of this precious ecosystem.
Finally, it must not be a case of the last person off the island turning the lights off.
We have to live and earn a living in these places.
Equally we cannot continue to mortgage our children's health and heritage.
Mr President, I should like again to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their statements.
I could not agree more with most of what you have said, except for any accusation of complacency.
May I remind you that, as of today, 45% of all the complaints are on environmental issues and cases - 700 complaints, 30% of the infringements - about 400 - are on environmental cases.
So there is a heavy burden on us and we are trying to do our best but also look to the future.
That is why I am saying that we also have to look out for new instruments and ways to do more.
Mr Sacconi's point was that we need the good examples of what economic gains can be made from complying with environmental legislation.
We could do more on that.
We could do more with the use of indicators because we have to measure.
We have to be better at assessing the results of compliance with environmental legislation.
We are most effective when we have a good and effective interplay between the institutions, while not denying the fact that Member States are responsible.
They have to give us answers and provide us with information.
We do not have the means to send people to all the Member States to check.
We cannot do that unless you give me another 500 people.
What we have to do is modernise legislation.
It has been said that we need less but better legislative proposals.
I agree with that.
The easiest way is the limit-value approach, to say 50 mgs of nitrates for example in drinking water.
But this cannot apply in other far-reaching directives of a broader scope, such as the habitats directive.
It is no coincidence that the habitats and nitrates directives are chosen as examples of bad compliance because they are very far-reaching.
They are ambitious directives and in some cases it means the Member States need to review fully their agricultural practices.
We know this from some of the Member States.
This should not be taken as an excuse, but an explanation of why these directives are cited for lack of implementation.
I totally agree with Mr SjÃ¶stedt that it is not because these directives are not good or ambitious enough.
They are far-reaching and there are consequences for the Member States which they perhaps did not realise when the decisions were taken.
We must not give in now, we have to carry on because we will finally start to see results.
What we have done, which is very effective, is to establish the link between European funding and compliance with environment legislation.
We have to draw on that.
We can do more on education and information.
We have started activities like this.
We use our experts to go to Member States or to carry out seminars to teach the Member States how to best implement it.
We try to use all these available instruments to improve implementation.
In an enlarged and more diverse Union, clear and legally binding targets, as well as education and methods for measuring, monitoring and calculating results, become more and more important.
I hope for the European Parliament's support and backing in our further attempts to improve the implementation of our European Community environmental legislation.
I have received a motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon.
Young farmers in the Union
The next item is the report (A5-0357/2000) tabled by Mr Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union [2000/2011(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to present to you today the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development' s own-initiative report on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union.
Twenty years ago, I, myself, was a member of my local young farmers' organisation in the county of Somerset in England.
Even in those days it was not easy for young farmers to carry on the family farm or get started in the industry.
Today the situation has become even more difficult, and we are witnessing a big drop in the number of young farmers coming into the industry.
We have reached a point where it has become vital to take action in order to stop this decline.
Not only for the sake of agriculture itself, but also to safeguard existing structures in our countryside.
The last thing that we want to see is a depopulated countryside where the green and pleasant landscape which we take for granted will not be looked after properly any longer.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European organisation CEJA for its help and cooperation in enabling me to produce this report.
I was given the opportunity to visit young farmers in five Member States which gave me a better and wider understanding of the practical ways in which young farmers could be helped in the industry.
I would further like to thank Commissioner Fischler for his backing and I would also welcome the draft opinion on the report produced by the Committee of the Regions because it is going to do a report on young farmers.
Last but not least, I would like to express my thanks to Ross Gordon Consultants who produced an excellent study on the situation of young farmers in the European Union last year and whose publication has been of great help in producing today's report.
The report puts forward a series of ideas and ways of assisting young farmers starting up or carrying on in their businesses.
I have, however, tried not to reinvent the wheel.
Basically I would like to see the introduction of a guaranteed standard level of assistance for young farmers throughout the European Union.
I am fully aware that it is not an easy task to come up with one solution covering all the different conditions facing young farmers in their respective countries in a Community of 15 Member States.
To name just two examples: land values can vary from EUR 12 000 per hectare to EUR 15 000 per hectare.
Levels of taxation vary greatly with some Member States imposing considerable inheritance tax which renders the survival of young farmers very difficult, especially where land values are very high.
I do not have the time to go through all the recommendations made in the report, but I will list some of the measures which should be given priority: the continuation of start-up grants of up to EUR 40 000, in combination with subsidised interest rates for start-up capital of up to EUR 120 000 for eight years.
Two of the major difficulties encountered by young farmers are the raising of start-up capital and subsequently the danger of overstretching their financial abilities by providing regular interest payments.
We are living in a computer age.
Access to education and training needs to be further encouraged in order to allow young farmers to take full advantage of the potential advantages offered by modern communication technology and business operation techniques.
The changing face of agriculture, increasingly determined by global WTO agreements, means that agriculture will continue to change.
It is in our best interests that young farmers are well prepared to anticipate and to manage these future challenges.
Food safety measures and production methods are being thoroughly analysed these days.
There is greater emphasis on organic production throughout Europe.
Here again, young farmers must be placed in a position which will allow them to embrace a new upcoming culture and to be aware of the benefits attached to maintaining consumer confidence and support for agricultural products.
There is tremendous scope for innovative and creative local high-quality production.
The European agricultural industry is going through a difficult economic period with a great deal of restructuring going on at the same time.
There is a great need to assist some of the older farmers to retire in dignity.
In this context, I would very much like see a retirement package for existing farmers linked to bringing in young farmers to carry on the industry.
I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler to recommend to Member States that they introduce such a policy throughout the EU.
We are seeing the average age of the farming Community increase with falling numbers of young farmers.
This trend must be reversed.
Young farmers need greater access to production rights.
It is not easy to balance the delivery of additional production rights to young farmers if they have to be taken away from existing farmers who themselves are already facing financial difficulties.
When, in future, production rights are changed, I would like to ask the Commission to take into greater account the need to increase the amount of extra production which is given to young farmers.
With the emphasis in the CAP on giving increasing importance to rural development schemes, it is crucial to recognise the young farmers as the key players and main executives responsible for the implementation of such new rural redevelopment policies.
With the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, I would strongly advise the applicant Member States to start creating supportive measures for their young farmers already at present, especially in view of the introduction of production controls required by the Commission.
In many parts of the world, share farming is a common practice.
I would like to ask the Commission to investigate the possibilities for developing share farming within the common agricultural policy.
As I have already mentioned, this report is an own initiative report of the Committee on Agriculture, and I hope all parties will be able to sign up for this report and make sure positive practical help is given young farmers in the future.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Fischler once more for his support and also ask him to introduce an audit to be carried out every two years on the availability and success of measures put in place to support young farmers.
It is very important that we do not just pay great lip service to helping young farmers, but actually deliver policies within the common agricultural policy that increase the number of young farmers coming into the industry.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, in particular its rapporteur, Mr Parish, on the timely initiative to bring the debate on this issue to the European institutions.
It is 32 years since Sicco Mansholt, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture from the time the Commission was formed until 1972, presented his draft reform of the common agricultural policy, the Mansholt Plan.
It is my view that the European institutions have not paid sufficient tribute to this great figure in European politics.
I still read this classic work today and I still find that it contains many of the answers we need to the problems faced by young farmers, which are accurately described in Mr Parish' s report.
We have created a major common policy based on support payments per hectare, per animal or even according to production achieved; we have limited production rights and established quotas; we have imposed complex mechanisms for standardising production and we have created intricate systems intervening in international markets.
The results have been varied, with some positive aspects but with many other negative aspects.
Amongst the latter, I would highlight the effect this policy has had in creating major problems for young people wishing to establish themselves in farming.
The bold study drawn up on this issue by Parliament confirms that land is still the major investment for European farmers. The study also shows difficulty of access to land to be the main problem facing young farmers.
According to this study, for each percentage point increase in subsidies for wheat crops, the price of land goes up by 0.4%.
This effect is significantly magnified by quota systems and by production-limiting schemes.
We cannot, therefore, contemplate the need to protect and support the modernisation and reinvigoration of agriculture unless we consider changes that could be made to the current CAP.
The alternative to this model of agricultural policy will necessarily require a policy focused on farmers and their incomes and not on the produce, the land or the livestock by means of which the income is obtained.
It will require an agricultural policy that is defined in regional rather than sectoral terms and will require priority for the environment, rural development, vocational training and early retirement.
To conclude, I should like to suggest to Mr Parish and to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that this report should not be seen as a finishing line but rather as a point of departure for a thorough study into overhauling agriculture and reforming the common agricultural policy with the specific participation of young farmers' associations.
Revisiting the Mansholt Plan would be a good place to start.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the European Liberal Democrats I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent work.
Many thanks indeed go to him, then.
In this short speech I would like to focus attention on a couple of points.
The report takes excellent account of the problems of young farmers. Social problems are dealt with particularly well.
This is to be welcomed, because it is young men who are mostly keener to continue farming than young women are.
The problem that has come about is what is referred to as the hundred-hectare solitude factor.
In agriculture we need sustainability, especially with regard to change-of-generation factors.
The average age of European farmers is worryingly high.
It must be financially feasible to sustain the change-of-generation system.
Young people must be induced to start farming.
There are not enough young starters, however.
It would be very important if we could get young people to continue in a profession that is important to us all.
Young farmers are very skilled and are not prejudiced about using modern technology in their work in the fields and in rearing cattle.
Similarly, they can make use of the latest information technology in their planning.
We are on the threshold of great change, which the rapporteur brought to our attention here, and it is the young, if anyone, who are best equipped to lead us through this revolution, which we will inevitably have to face within a few years.
The conclusions and measures proposed in the report are largely matters that have to be decided upon nationally, and this is good for flexibility.
The EU can and must promote policies that work as incentives for the young.
Bureaucracy must not become a barrier to improving the position of young farmers.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to give Mr Parish my thanks, congratulations and support for his report.
In these times when the younger generation can see that the quality of life is no longer closely linked to industrialisation and cities and large commercial centres, we have the obligation in the Union to encourage and help the younger generation to take over from the older so that the cycle of life and people in agriculture may be completed by means of new Community initiatives that have the young farmer as their priority objective.
We must put into practice the principles and actions proposed in this own-initiative report so as to make rural life more attractive to young people, thus preventing depopulation of the countryside.
This social group is the future basis of the Common Agricultural Policy; we have to increase installation aids and supplementary investment grants for this group, particularly in those structurally less-favoured areas where abandoned holdings and deserted villages are common, where young people can revive the rural economy.
All this will be thanks to the development of new products of regional interest, such as agro-tourism and rural tourism, or through repopulating these natural spaces with animal and plant species, contributing to the sustainable and lasting development of the area.
Mr President, the first part of the motion for a resolution in the report repeats the now familiar findings on the poor situation and prospects of young farmers in the European Union.
However, no mention is made of why this should be so, given that the previous two Community support schemes promoted two programmes for the benefit of young farmers, which the European Union vaunted as a panacea which would solve all the problems faced by young farmers and reverse the negative trend.
This conscious omission runs throughout the resolution, which fails to mention three basic factors which, unless they are dealt with, will render the third Community programme for young farmers equally ineffectual.
These factors are, first, that the CAP, especially in its post-1992 form and following Agenda 2000, does not safeguard a viable income for most small or medium-sized farming households, or a survival income for the heads of these households, which is why no one wants to invest anything at all in the farming sector, however many grants there may be - not that there are that many - because not only is it unprofitable, it does not even afford a basic income.
Secondly, there is usually nobody to apply the incentives to; in other words, because of the quotas, young farmers have no reason to work, given that the quotas have been used up for all the products and they must wait for a national stock to be created and distributed to young farmers or buy quotas, in which case, good luck to them.
Thirdly, however high the incentives, the terms and conditions are such that they are more suited to large farmers and exclude small and medium-sized farmers.
The requirement for very large cultivated areas, even in island regions, is a typical example.
This requirement becomes prohibitive when combined with quotas.
In other words, the Community requires young farmers to have a large farm and large-scale production, but nigh prevents them from producing anything with the quota system.
This incongruous situation is not, in my view, an inadvertent, random choice by the European Union.
It is deliberate policy, the purpose being to ruin poor, medium-sized farmers and support large farms or rather large companies in the agricultural sector.
That is why we cannot vote in favour of this report; it is because it conceals the real reasons.
Even these grants, when they are given to poor, medium-sized farmers, are meted out in drips and drabs and Greece is a typical example here.
I do not know, for example, if Mr Fischler is aware of the fact that our grants for young farmers have still not been received, despite the fact that the government used this type of argument to saturation point in order to win votes last April.
Mr President, I want to commence by complimenting the rapporteur on his very well-researched and objective report which I and my group have no difficulty in supporting.
In the context of Agenda 2000, very credible efforts were made to deal with the serious problem of succession in European agriculture.
A re-vamped farm retirement scheme, installation aid and other measures may not, however, achieve our desired objective and in my view the problem must be revisited as a matter of urgency, otherwise the continuity of family farming will be put at serious risk.
Apart from the seriously upsetting and devastating consequences of BSE, which I believe will be overcome, the real problem for young people who in normal circumstances would take up farming as a career is the availability, welcome though it is, of alternative and certainly more financially rewarding employment.
Farmers and non-farmers must face this reality and do so before it is too late.
Farming as a profession has the onerous responsibility of guaranteeing our citizens food security and quality, and we must act to safeguard the productive base of European agriculture by ensuring that young people with the ethos of farming in their blood are appropriately encouraged and compensated.
I realise that many small farms do not have the capacity to generate sufficient income for their owners because of scale and enterprise.
I believe we must do more to assist those interested in a restructuring programme - and the rapporteur made reference to it in his report - through the pooling of land and human resources, which would lead to greater efficiency and improved competitiveness.
Likewise, the opportunity of rural development and new technology in terms of creating farm and part-time employment for both women and men must, in every case, be vigorously pursued.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we realise that 55% of European farmers are over 55 years old and only 23% are less than 44 years old, we must inevitably conclude that the future of farming in the European Union is under threat.
The situation is even more serious in my own country, where these figures are 66% and 15% respectively.
In the mid-1980s, the CAP began changing in order to improve measures for direct control of production with the aim of preventing surpluses and guaranteeing the stability of prices and incomes.
However, the other side of the coin as regards opting for stability in this way has been less flexibility in access to farming, which particularly penalises young farmers, first of all because of the difficulty in gaining access to quotas, production or premium rights. Secondly, young farmers are penalised as a result of increases in land prices due to the increase in value created by the quota systems.
Furthermore, it is well known that many Member States have not implemented measures that in any way address the concerns of young farmers.
I shall give the example of my own country where, after an initial phase of enthusiasm when we joined the EU, in recent years we have become more sceptical and the activities of the organisations most representative of young farmers have even been penalised.
For this reason we must, as a matter of urgency, adopt certain fundamental measures which are, in fact, in line with the rapporteur' s proposals. These are, specifically, to create special reserves for quotas and production rights solely for young farmers, to increase support for setting up a first farm and investment in farm properties, to establish a special scheme for low-interest loans to supplement other investment aid, to establish conditions for the proper functioning of an early retirement scheme for older farmers, which will speed up the process of renewal and, of course, to adopt training and information measures.
The Commission must now urgently table proposals for measures for action and the Council must adopt them.
Unless this happens, we will be taking an irresponsible attitude that will put the continuity of farming in Europe, with all that this means for our culture, at risk.
To conclude, I wish to thank Neil Parish for his outstanding work on this report.
Mr President, the report deals with a most difficult subject: the prospects for young people in the farming industry, as the rapporteur has indicated, are probably worse than at any time since the creation of the CAP and their prospects cannot be separated from those of the industry as a whole or from the prosperity of the rural communities.
One measure of the complexity of the situation can be found in the courses which are now offered at agricultural colleges.
At the two colleges in my region the number of courses relating to farming has now fallen to 40% in one case, and the remaining 60% of the courses relate to horses and small animals.
Significantly, 70% of the students, however, come from farming families, so there is still that link.
The report spells out that there is a strong case for measures to encourage new entrants to the industry and for achieving a much greater degree of standardisation across the European Union, and the issue, as the rapporteur mentioned, was well dealt with in the excellent STOA report at the beginning of last year.
There are many good examples in that document of the valuable background material which we were able to use during discussions in committee.
Now that the rural development programme is in place it is important to examine how this programme can be used to strengthen training and re-training facilities in our agricultural colleges.
I would emphasise the need for training in farm diversification, including low-volume products for niche markets, and cooperative marketing techniques where, by coming together, individual farms can seek to match the commercial bargaining strength of the supermarket chains.
I would also wish to see such courses paying special attention to the needs of the smaller farm where new entrants are most likely to be found.
I hope that the Commission and the national governments will take note of the many excellent suggestions in this report and thus give a boost to the future prosperity of farming in the rural areas.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate my fellow MEP, Mr Parish, on an extremely good report.
I want to focus upon the small number of young people going into farming in recent years and, at the same time, the unduly large number of people who are also leaving it, because, if young people do not come into the industry, there will come a time when agriculture no longer exists.
I think that the image of farming - due to the many outbreaks of disease, dioxin scandals etc - is, at the moment, one of the really major problems.
It puts the whole industry in a negative light and seems unfair to the many farming families who would, of course, get top marks for the way they look after their farms.
It is undoubtedly very important that there should be transparency and that people should be made more aware of production methods and of the modern stalls and cowsheds that now exist, as well as being given information about the common agricultural policy and about the ways in which fields and animals are looked after.
Efforts must be concentrated on providing support - moral, educational and financial.
No one has in recent years questioned the many millions of euros we pump into training lawyers, engineers and doctors.
There is a clear parallel with young farmers who, of course, are responsible for the land and the animals we have and, especially, the food we eat.
Mr President, I also commend Mr Parish for his hard work and the excellent report.
In the brief time I have I wish to stress that one of the greatest difficulties facing young farmers entering the business today is capital and cash-flow problems in the first year of operation.
I am backing this proposal because young people must be given the opportunity to come into the industry on a sound financial footing.
After all, young farmers hold the key to the future of all our rural communities.
The lack of young people entering the agricultural industry in the UK is a very worrying problem.
Statistics show that in Ireland 14.8% of farm owners are under 35, in France the figure is 13.2%, but in the UK it is a mere 6.8%.
I stress that farms are also important employers in our rural communities.
Employment protects our countryside, it keeps our post offices, schools and services open there.
Farming and the viability of farming is the life blood of the future of our rural communities as we know them.
If all small businesses - which includes farmers - were to employ just one more person each, then the whole unemployment situation throughout the European Union would be solved overnight.
Of all the European Union countries, only the UK and the Netherlands do not operate a specific aid scheme for young farmers.
European rural development regulations allow a grant of EUR 16 500 to be made available for people under 40 years of age to establish themselves in a viable farm holding.
Yet the Labour government in the UK has not taken advantage of this excellent scheme.
I therefore fully support making installation aids mandatory across the European Union.
The farming industry needs young blood in order to inject a new vibrancy into an industry which at present is aged and disillusioned.
Young farmers are the future of the farming industry and vital components in urban communities.
I thank Mr Parish for his report and wish his report all the best to ensure that we can follow up these important decisions taken by him in a specific and constructive manner.
Mr President, there has been endless discussion of the role of young people in agriculture, but even today their situation gives little cause for optimism.
It is no coincidence that, after the launching of Agenda 2000, in the current phase of WTO renegotiations and with the now imminent prospect of enlargement, we are still here today debating the future of young farmers, of those young people who, in so many countries in Europe, are placing bets on whether they will be able to remain within the agricultural sector for good.
How can we help them?
One of the best solutions can only be to revoke the measures laid down by the CAP.
It is time to evaluate carefully how the distribution of contributions - as, by definition, income support - reaches undertakings able to compete on the global market.
This would make it possible to direct the finances towards a vision which is more targeted towards lowering general costs, encouraging the formation of consortia.
We could also work on the joint farming of lands; after all, this is the change which will mark the evolution of farming.
From this point of view, it is then essential to stipulate that incentives should be provided in the form of reductions in the relevant interest rates for investments made by young farmers.
In this way, we would be implementing the provisions of Regulation 1257 of 1999, which encourages the combining of several actions when they are aimed at bringing about greater use of the resources provided by development plans for rural areas.
I feel that, if this debate were to send out these sorts of signals, we would be able genuinely to start building the framework for a new European agriculture structure based on young people which, most importantly, would certainly not mean abandoning and forgetting those who are seeking possible alternatives in the new environmental and multifunctionality opportunities.
I would like to thank Mr Parish for his excellent work.
Mr President, the Parish report provides a rigorous analysis of an essential issue for the European Community and for those who wish to join the Union.
Young farmers do indeed need urgent attention.
First, because we must support our young people in all areas of activity, and secondly because it is in our interests to keep the rural population, most of whom are connected with agricultural activities, in the countryside.
In approaching this issue, we have to appraise elements that lie at the roots of our social structure, our territorial organisation, our economy, our culture and our civilisation itself.
Many of the problems that affect these farmers are substantially concerned with one of the bases of the dominant economic model in Europe; private land ownership and the forms of land transfer.
This report contains an appeal for institutional action benefiting a specific group and also for the implementation of concrete measures to give rural land ownership a meaningful social function.
In this context, the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport seems to me highly appropriate when it states that young farmers are not a very homogeneous group.
A distinction must be drawn between students at agricultural schools and colleges, young people who wish to set up in rural areas as an alternative to the urban environment, and the children of farmers.
Even within this last group I would distinguish between those who are the children of farmers who work on the land and those who are descendants of farmers who, from the size of their holdings, are really agricultural businessmen.
While accepting that measures should be taken to reduce charges on inheriting property, I would highlight other actions also mentioned in the Parish report to help make holdings viable, which are based on socio-economic formulas.
I should like to stress another aspect of the report: we must try to ensure that when our future co-Members of the Union incorporate the acquis communautaire they do not bring in hidden habits that hinder the development of the rural environment in their countries.
The change from collectivised farming economies to situations that can be merged with the Community situation may trigger off speculative processes that will artificially raise market prices for land and thus increase young farmers' difficulties in setting up or keeping themselves in the countryside.
This report, Mr President, will certainly be important in so far as we can also disseminate it in our own countries, in the candidate countries, and in particular in the sector it specifically addresses.
Mr President, there is indeed a crisis of succession in farming as Mr Parish with his expertise as a farmer knows well.
If this crisis is particularly acute in Mr Parish's own Member State, it is the direct result of policies pursued by UK governments over the past twenty years, and to overcome it the United Kingdom must review the implications of the Fontainbleau Agreement for its contribution to European Union finances.
This has been disastrous for farming. Moreover, the rapporteur, a member of the Conservative Party, must work within his own party to secure support for his proposals in the House of Commons.
In countries where less than 10% of the population now lives in rural areas, it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas, and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Neil Parish on the fact that he has produced a report which is based on the farmers' reality, the reality in rural areas, and not on the view from Brussels.
This in itself constitutes a valuable contribution to agricultural policy.
But if we now examine the situation, we could ask ourselves whether there are any young people left out there who are mad enough to become farmers in the European Union.
What we need is people who want to take up the challenge of producing an outstanding achievement, five-legged sheep as it were, but not obtained through genetic modification.
They seem to be fighting a losing battle, if we consider the adversities which young farmers face, as well as the achievements they are expected to deliver.
To quote just one example - and I am just considering my own country for a moment - dairy farming is a sector where absolutely everything is being scrutinised, from the blade of grass right up to the moment that the milk hits the supermarkets.
I cannot help drawing a comparison with arable farmers and horticulturalists who have been required to keep tabs on the implications of their actions on the environment and consumer front for a long time, and do so with great enthusiasm.
At the same time, we have to say that in many European countries the requirements for animal welfare are among the world' s most stringent.
So whoever wants to become a farmer in Europe must outstrip their counterparts elsewhere in the world. They need to give the landscape and cultural conditions due consideration.
They must apply the strictest consumer conditions, supply a wide range of products, both regionally and in terms of quality, make animal welfare a top priority and be responsible for the product, even once it has left the farm.
This is what we call social enterprising as a top-level sport.
It requires entrepreneurship, a love of nature and the environment, social orientation and perseverance.
For this reason alone, it would be desirable if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is focused on the future.
Some of the focal points could include a premium scheme linked to quality, landscape and environmental protection, but also the introduction of an eco-tax in other economic sectors, not payable by the farmers but by the consumers, to finance those extra requirements which farmers need to fulfil, and to reinforce the market position of farmers and consumers.
What strikes me in the European Union' s competition policy as a whole, is that although it is enjoying a great deal of attention, in the food sector, for example, the consumers, the supermarkets that is, are gradually gaining a monopoly position, and that at the same time sales from farms, the small-scale dimension, are still fragmented.
In that sense, it would be desirable if both Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein were more critical in their assessment of this area in terms of competition.
Mr President, nobody can survive for one day without food; it is life requirement number one.
This requires motivated producers.
This means that food does not just stand for market forces, but also for public health, landscape and nature.
In short, if we realise this, then we will know that, in future, young farmers will need to be five-legged sheep, and in that sense, deserve more support, more political support than they are receiving at the moment.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking Mr Parish for his serious analysis of the situation of young farmers in Europe.
I ask you, what shall we do when there is no one to take over our farms?
Structural change is important and it is right, but that should not result in a mass exodus from the farming profession.
If we want farming to have a future in Europe, then we must secure its succession.
We are in favour of a multi-functional farming model, i.e. a model whereby farmers are not just responsible for producing food and a large part of their work benefits society as a whole, a society which can take pleasure in seeing nature unspoiled and enjoy rural areas which are worth living in.
The agricultural policy and the policy for the countryside as a whole lives for and from its inhabitants.
We therefore need to create framework conditions which ensure that young people look on the countryside as somewhere worth living in and are willing to continue the farming tradition.
Setting-up aid and investment grants are essential for young farmers, but modern technology has an equally important part to play.
Young farmers need to be as familiar with computers and the Internet as they are with seed and the animals in their stalls.
This means that training and further training for young farmers are becoming more and more important and I, for one, support lifelong learning in farming and among farmers.
Allow me to say a few brief words on the social aspects. Time and again I hear farmers using various arguments to put off leaving their farms to their children or successors.
Letting go is difficult, as I know from personal experience, but it is the only way of ensuring survival.
So I call on the older generations to help the young and to give them and, hence, the whole farming industry the same chance which they had.
Of course, and I say this quite openly as a farmer myself, it is no help when all we hear about is the down side of the profession.
Let us be quite clear about one thing: there is not a single profession which is either all good or all bad.
Finally, I should like to say that it gladdens my heart when I see established and young farmers working together to develop the farm, exchanging experiences and creating and putting innovative ideas into practice.
Their dedication and commitment will be needed in the future even more than ever and we must encourage successive generations to be optimistic and take their future into their own hands.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by joining in the gratitude expressed to Mr Parish.
I think this is a very constructive own-initiative report.
There is a rather nice saying that the future belongs to the young, but we can turn this around when we talk of European farming and say that, without young farmers, there is no future.
The future of the countryside, and especially the future of young farmers in Europe, does not look good.
The numbers alone should set our alarm bells ringing.
The number of farms in the EU has fallen constantly over recent years.
Of course, we welcome the structural change but, at the same time, the extent of the change does give us cause for concern.
The biggest decrease has been in the number of farmers under the age of 35.
Thank God that young people from farms have the same career prospects as their peer groups and siblings.
The tradition of handing farms down from one generation to the next is disappearing.
The question of what becomes of the older generation left on the farm is often still unanswered.
Unfortunately, farms standing empty have become a familiar sight - even in my country, which I would never have imagined possible.
How many young people want to have to keep making excuses because they are farmers?
Young farmers want fair prices for their products.
It is not because of the subsidies that they choose to be farmers.
The Parish report may help to improve the overall image of young farmers.
The public pays scant attention to the services of farming.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank you, Commissioner Fischler, for repeatedly highlighting the multi-functional task which farming fulfils.
But apparently bad news makes better news.
At the moment, you can read about the current BSE crisis blow by blow.
But no one bothers to mention, for example, that consumer associations in my country have been wantonly campaigning for food at rock bottom prices for years now.
Of course I disapprove of the criminal machinations of the feedingstuffs industry, the lack of controls by the authorities and so forth, but it is all this together which has resulted in the chaos in which more and more members of the profession find themselves.
If you belong to this profession, if you are a farmer, then you will easily understand why young people ask, do I really need this?
With the current BSE situation, it is quite out of order to pillory our farmers and young farmers.
We have set standards.
So-called 'good professional practice' has been continually developed by our excellently trained young farmers.
Essential services in the production of foodstuffs and raw materials, the development, further development and preservation of the countryside and the protection of the natural bases for life are all areas in which Europe will need farmers and young farmers in the future.
I should like to close by saying that these young farmers do not just need reliable policies; they also need good wives and strong families.
Only this sort of environment can give them the strength they need to perform their important function in society.
Mr President, I note that the last seven speakers in this debate come from the Group of the European People' s Party, so we have seven people anxious to talk while everybody else has dried up.
It is an indication of the concern of this particular group for the problem we are discussing.
I want to thank Mr Parish for his contribution, the thorough research and the very extensive report he has produced.
I was just thinking of my youth when I was a member of the Young Farmers of Ireland; I started my political career in that organisation.
I remember a plan was produced which was based on two simple things: intensive advice and a little bit of financial incentive.
It was based on the geographic unit of organisation, which was most popular in Ireland, it was a church community called the parish.
It was the parish plan.
So I started off my political life with the parish plan in my hand and today I have another Parish plan.
It is much more comprehensive and, indeed, I have to confess that I do not see as many simple answers to the questions raised in this one as in my Young Farmers' organisation in Ireland 40 years ago.
Something that comes to mind is that we ought not to get carried away with emotion or lead people down the wrong path on this whole subject.
The 1926 census in Ireland found that more than half of the entire population of the country was engaged in agriculture and yet the country did not produce surpluses and there were people short of food.
There are still people harking back to the days when, as an Irish poet said: "every rood of ground maintained its man".
However, we should not imagine that this was an ideal world in which to live.
Over the years, as the number of farms was reduced and farmers became more efficient, food obviously became more available to the poor who could buy it at a lower cost.
The reduced farm numbers have produced a lot of well-being in Europe. We should not forget that.
Since Ireland joined the European Union - I only mention Ireland because I am very familiar with what happened obviously, but you can draw lessons for other areas - our many small farms were reduced gradually in number.
If it were not for the common agricultural policy, that would have been very painful.
It was a good thing that the number of farms was reduced and that we had the common agricultural policy to ease that.
We must be concerned about the human problems that arise out of the squeeze-out of excessive labour, but at the same time, we should remember that the cost of food has been reduced.
Emphasis, in the future, must be put on quality, while in my time limitless quantities were needed.
Today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment.
All these are things Mr Parish has underlined.
But we should not offer the prospect of young, energetic people in greater numbers producing the quantity of food that Europe needs today because they will not eat it.
Mr President, could I begin by congratulating Mr Parish on bringing forward a very excellent report.
I know very well that he put a lot of time and effort into it and I am happy it can be debated by Parliament today.
It is a very difficult subject to address and there is no easy solution to the problem of young farmers, as any of us who have any knowledge of the problem and the background would accept.
Of course, everybody likes to say we must help the young farmers.
The problem is when you ask them how to make the help really worthwhile, they are very slow to come forward with answers.
How can you encourage young people onto the land?
You have to address the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today.
Many young people from rural areas some 20, 30 or 40 years ago, at the time Mr McCartin was speaking about, would naturally have gone on to become young farmers.
Nowadays those young people have many other options open to them.
They look around and they see their friends going into jobs where they may quit working at lunchtime on Friday and not start work again until the Monday morning.
But the young farmer will work seven days a week for very little money.
You only have to look at the financial situation right throughout the European Union at the moment to see that we have a terrible problem here and one that is not going to be easy to address.
The reality is that if you do not get young people into the industry, you will not bring the new ideas in and you will not allow the industry to develop and take on the challenges that it faces in the future, relating not just to the production of food, but to how that food is produced and to ensuring that it is produced in a way the consumer finds acceptable.
It is not enough just to give financial assistance to young farmers because then all you do is put the price of lamb up out of reach.
We in the European Union have brought in milk quotas, we have brought in suckler cow quotas, we have brought in sheep quotas, all now with a financial value that the young farmer could not even begin to contemplate.
So I believe the best way is to make it easier for young farmers to inherit the family farm at an earlier stage, be it through an early retirement scheme or through a bond scheme.
I certainly feel that the European Investment Bank should be encouraged to help young farmers into the industry through the bond scheme.
But, if you are going to bring this scheme in it has to be mandatory and it has to be introduced in every Member State.
It is not enough to introduce it in one Member State alone.
Finally, we are spending a lot of money on rural development and the Commission would do well to look at other ways of spending that money, because, as I see it, we could make better use of it.
We could encourage young farmers, who face so much red tape and bureaucracy now.
Young farmers have computers.
Farmers' wives know how to use computers and could use them on the farm.
That is the way forward for the future.
Mr President, I welcome this report. It certainly highlights the bleak future facing young farmers within the European Union, despite the support provided by the Union and Member States.
The current unfavourable economic climate for farming in general and young farmers in particular, the obvious lack of prospects for young farmers, the decline in the number of full-time farmers and the consequent ageing of those who remain - these are all general trends which underline the problem.
It is clear that we will experience a drastic drop in the number of young farmers over the next couple of decades, unless appropriate and effective measures are put in place now.
Young farmers face enormous problems such as the massive financial burden when they start up and often this can be compounded by difficulties associated with inheritance.
Training is often deficient, and for young people it can be an isolated life in rural areas, with limited social activity in comparison with those of a similar age who work in more urban settings.
All of this begs the question: what can the European Union do?
A European policy aimed at supporting young farmers and linked to the CAP is essential.
Up until now there has been little evaluation of EU assistance measures either by the Member States or the EU Commission.
Greater attention must be given to interest rate subsidies and loans, installation aids and investment grants must be paid more speedily and the implications of enlargement on young farmers need to be considered and integrated into any future policy approach.
Other measures that could be considered are supplementary investment aid for farmers under 40, production rights, assistance with credit terms, better education, training and networking opportunities - one could go on. But the point I want to make is that we need to do something now.
To take up the point made by Mr Nicholson: why should young people in the Celtic Tiger economy in Ireland remain on the land?
Why should they face an anti-social life?
Why should they be in a career which has economic uncertainty when other occupations offer a much more attractive life, much more security, work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with week-ends off and with long holidays?
That is the problem we have to address and we must address it now.
Mr President, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking you, Mr Parish, for your earnest report on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union.
I should also like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its work.
We have endeavoured in Agenda 2000, especially by developing the second pillar, to take account of the concerns of young farmers.
In some organisations of the market, we have at least managed to grant special terms to newly established farmers or young farmers.
I need only mention the sheep premium or the administration of national milk quota reserves or planting rights under the programme to restructure and convert vineyards.
But, without doubt, the real issue here is the future of farming per se, because if young people are no longer prepared to take up farming, then any further debate on agriculture is superfluous.
And, without doubt, the attractiveness of farming also depends a great deal on the political framework conditions which apply to agriculture, not just agricultural policy as a whole, but also the specific terms on which a young person can enter this profession.
Measures to promote rural development are particularly important here.
Agenda 2000 increased the maximum setting-up grant by 66%, meaning that up to EUR 25 000 can now be paid in aid, and loans to finance setting-up costs qualify for interest rate subsidies.
At the same time, the terms governing investments in farming operations include the option of increasing the maximum rate of aid for investments by young farmers within the first five years of starting up.
These aid rates may be as high as 45% and, in disadvantaged areas, as much as 55%.
Apart from this specific aid for young farmers, there are, of course, all the other forms of aid which young farmers can claim just as any other farmer can.
