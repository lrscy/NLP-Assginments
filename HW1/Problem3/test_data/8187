The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the following three reports:
A5-0060/2002 by Mr Lipietz on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the supplementary supervision of credit institution, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (COM(2001) 213 - C5-0159/2001 - 2001/0095(COD));
A5-0069/2002 by Mr Goebbels on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) (COM(2001) 281 - C5-0262/2001 - 2001/0118(COD));
A5-0072/2002 by Mr Huhne on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading (COM(2001) 280 - C5-0263/2001 - 2001/0117(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nine months have now elapsed since the proposal for a European Commission directive on this ultra-technical but extremely topical subject was referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Last spring, when the bubble of the e-economy burst, we were reminded that banking is a high-risk business.
In the autumn, the attacks of 11 September, coupled with the steady increase in industrial accidents and in natural disasters linked to the greenhouse effect, reminded us that insurance is also a high-risk activity.
The risk will become higher and higher.
For years, the European Union, like the rest of the world, has been standardising both the prudential rules that are essential to these financial activities and the forms of supervision practised by the banking and insurance authorities.
We are now called upon to supplement these efforts by regulating those financial conglomerates which contain both banks and insurance companies.
This is a particularly urgent task here in Europe, the continent that has pioneered insurance banking.
It is made all the more urgent by the fact that the development of life assurance and all forms of capitalised pensions savings is compelling our society to run a great risk.
What would happen if the long-term savings of future pensioners were engulfed in a stock-market crash?
This is precisely what the present directive seeks to avoid.
Its rapid adoption would do no less than make Europe the safest financial area in the world, decisively improving its competitiveness through the geographical factor used by the rating agencies.
I will not conceal the fact that, at the start of our debates, some of my honourable colleagues were loath to impose new prudential constraints on the financial sector.
There were discussions, and some questioned whether it was expedient for Europe to set out its own rules before the completion of the Basle negotiations on the same subject in 2004.
Such misgivings, however, were to be banished by a single event, namely the collapse of the Enron conglomerate in the United States as a result of failure to comply with the prudential rules and breakdowns in the supervisory system.
If the European Union adopted this directive, Europe would become the 'Enron-proof' continent, so to speak.
And so the last misgivings have now melted away.
Yes, the directive is needed urgently.
No, it must not be watered down, either in its scope or in the rigour and transparency of the prudential rules that the authorities will have to oversee.
In the course of these nine eventful months, our committee has met with representatives of the banking and insurance professions; where the latter put forward sound arguments reflecting the public interest, the committee has managed to incorporate most of these into its position.
I refer in particular to two groups of amendments, namely those that relate to the choice of calculation method and those designed to instil a degree of flexibility into capital-adequacy requirements in terms of companies' own funds in the case of groups which are not yet conglomerates.
Lastly, your rapporteur has benefited, throughout the course of his work, from the cooperation of the Commission and of the Belgian Presidency, and latterly the Spanish Presidency, of the Council.
My warm thanks are extended to both institutions.
We have proved on this occasion that the three institutions of the Union are able to take very rapid concerted action when the interests of the public and of the European Union are at stake.
As I speak to you, at 5.15 p.m., I have just managed to finalise a handful of compromise amendments incorporating the key points from the amendments that were tabled last week. These seem to offer a good basis for a consensus among most of the groups and to anticipate the bulk of the compromises that will have to be made with the Council.
I therefore believe that the House will be able to adopt an almost unanimous resolution tomorrow and that the amended proposal will be very close to that which the Council will adopt.
In these circumstances, I believe that one reading, or one reading and a half, if you like, will suffice for us to ratify this directive, and I shall be absolutely delighted at such an outcome.
We shall avoid any new Enron-type affairs in Europe, and at the same time we shall have legislation with which we can intensify the Basle discussions by offering our new rules as a model for the rest of the world. This would yield immediate dividends by enhancing the global reputation of our financial activities.
Mr President, it has often been said that the advent of the euro would serve as the catalyst for sweeping reforms in Europe.
This is especially true with regard to the financial markets, which are still largely fragmented.
The view of the Commission is that the creation of a vast financial market should reduce the cost of finance for all economic operators.
Nevertheless, since the financial markets remain vulnerable, there is a need to create, parallel to the establishment of this large market, regulatory authorities vested with wide powers, not to intervene on a routine basis but to take action when the rules of common sense have been breached by players in the field.
These principles are applied in the draft directive on market abuse.
Let me make it quite clear that the proposal from the Commission is a sound document.
It resolutely addresses the key problems.
Europe is not currently able to penalise insider dealing and market manipulation effectively.
Such operations have long been considered with a certain degree of forbearance.
But the fact is that anyone who indulges in insider dealing or market manipulation is guilty of an offence.
He or she is stealing from the other market operators.
When insiders make a killing in the space of a few minutes, small shareholders and honest brokers are the ones who bear the brunt.
The Commission proposal has been a welcome development in the light of the attacks of 11 September.
Confronted by groups of terrorists who can use the anonymity of stock-exchange transactions to obtain funding for the vilest purposes, Europe is duty-bound to respond on the financial front too.
Allow me now, Mr President, to comment briefly on the main objectives of this directive.
Our purpose in clarifying its provisions is to avoid writing a blank cheque for secondary legislation.
We cannot confine ourselves to vague definitions, particularly as regards the definition of market manipulation.
For this reason we have developed this and other definitions, although we have left some scope for them to be supplemented in response to imaginative innovations within the markets.
We believe we have struck a fair balance between precision and flexibility.
The financial products covered by the directive have been specified in the body of the text, but there is still scope for the inclusion of subsequent financial innovations.
Market operators have expressed what are ultimately legitimate concerns about the pursuit of acceptable practices in the financial markets.
In this respect, Parliament puts its trust in what we call the Lamfalussy procedures as a means of obtaining universally acceptable secondary legislation.
Taking a constructive approach, we wished to go further along the avenues explored by the Commission.
Preventive measures must be paramount.
The risk of fraudulent use of confidential information increases if information is not properly disseminated.
This is why greater transparency is essential.
In the first place, issuers will have to post on their websites all inside information that they are required to disclose.
Secondly, persons discharging managerial responsibilities with an issuer of financial instruments must disclose their transactions.
This disclosure must be made without delay so that the market can digest the relevant information.
In accordance with this pragmatic approach, we have amended some of the provisions proposed by the Commission.
For example, the imposition of an obligation on financial intermediaries to reject suspect orders seemed to be rather unrealistic.
How can an intermediary take such a decision in a matter of seconds when the regulators' enquiries into the activities of suspected offenders may take months?
By the same token, the principle of a single authority must not rule out a certain measure of flexibility.
Similarly, the single authority should be able to delegate some of its powers to other authorities or to stock exchanges.
The single authority would, however, retain ultimate responsibility.
We also turned our attention to the conditions for the implementation of the directive.
The current procedures are glaringly inefficient.
Only thirteen criminal penalties were imposed for market manipulation in the 17 countries of the European Economic Area between 1995 and 2000.
The subsidiarity principle prevents us from harmonising criminal and administrative penalties throughout Europe.
Our preference is for administrative penalties.
We are asking for an indicative list of administrative measures and sanctions to be compiled by the Commission.
I also wished to draw attention to the financial resources to be put at the regulator's disposal.
In Europe, regulators' budgets are often derisory.
In the United States, a debate has been taking place in the wake of the Enron affair on the need to increase the resources allocated to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But are we aware that the SEC budget is already almost fifty times higher than that of the German regulator?
Lastly, I wanted to strengthen cross-border cooperation by providing for an arbitration body.
Any regulator who has a request for information rejected should be able to ask his or her peers to arbitrate.
While regulators must be vested with real powers, this does not mean that they should exercise these powers indiscriminately.
The regulator should benefit from the expertise of market participants; to this end, we propose the creation of a consultative committee within each national regulatory authority.
In conclusion, may I remind the House that modernising financial markets implies not only greater efficiency but also a more level playing field.
The financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic undoubtedly suffer from the same ills: constant conflicts of interest, calculation methods that defy scrutiny and weaknesses in the monitoring of off-balance-sheet operations and of derivative transactions.
The modernisation of financial systems requires the involvement of all players.
An active Parliament must engage in dialogue with all interested parties and listen to all the lobbies.
But the latter do not always seek to serve the general interest.
I have the feeling, Mr President, that the proposed text serves the general interest, whilst respecting the legitimate interests of the financial world.
I should like to reply to certain activists by quoting the words of Sir Howard Davies, head of the Financial Services Authority. 'Some well-paid lawyers', he said, 'are talking high-priced, high-octane nonsense'.
This remark is equally applicable to certain lawyers in the Commission who seek to make themselves indispensable by creating a steady flow of new difficulties.
Mr President, may I appeal to Commissioner Bolkestein to preserve the fragile political consensus between our institutions in this domain.
Mr President, this is an important milestone in the creation of the single market.
Today we will be debating two draft directives, including the prospectus directive, on which I have the honour to be Parliament's rapporteur that incorporate the delegated powers proposed by Baron Lamfalussy's wise men.
We all very much hope that this new way of dealing with financial regulations will prove to be a step change in creating a single market, the foundations of which have been put in place by the creation of the euro and its successful introduction.
The prospectus directive is designed to establish the ground rules under which an issuer of shares, bonds or other securities may access investors throughout the 15 Member States.
At present, a company has to seek 15 regulatory approvals for 15 different sets of disclosure documents.
This is a nonsense.
It means separate markets in new issues, higher regulatory costs, higher costs of capital for business and less choice for investors.
I have no doubt, therefore, that a single regime for prospectuses can create benefits for all, greater choice and higher returns for investors, lower costs of capital and funding opportunities for companies.
The Single Market is a win-win game, not a zero-sum game.
In drawing up requirements for an EU prospectus, it is important to strike a balance between the objective of lowering the cost of capital for businesses and that of protecting investors.
There ought to be enough potential gains to secure both, and that is the balance we have tried to strike on the committee, I am particularly grateful to my colleagues, Mrs Piia-Noora Kauppi and Mr Harald Ettl as the shadow rapporteurs, and to their respective groups, for their help and cooperation.
We tried to make a break in this proposal with in-depth hearings to understand the issues and I hope that we have a substantial measures of consensus within Parliament on many of the key problems and how to solve them.
We all agreed we wanted, for example, to exempt the professional market for Eurobonds from the requirement for a prospectus, but of course, to insist on one if the issuer wanted to attract retail investors.
The broad framework for that is agreed across this House.
We have one issue to settle: should we have a minimum unit for each exempted Eurobond of EUR 50 000 or of EUR 100 000?
I hope you will agree that EUR 50 000 is enough to exclude retail investors, as the larger amount will prove cumbersome even for professional investors who are used to dealing in units of EUR 10 000.
The second key set of amendments deals with whether companies must annually update their prospectuses or whether, if they do not issue more bonds or shares, they do not have to do so.
Overall, the committee supported the view taken by the EU's regulators - FESCO and now CESR - and that it makes sense for such annual updating to be optional if the issuer of bonds or shares wants to issue again.
In addition, this is not a directive concerned with general disclosure requirements by companies trading on the market.
We shall deal with the consultation in that area in due course.
I have also been pleased to support an amendment from the Socialist Group to allow smaller companies to update their prospectus, if they so wish, with the filing of their annual report.
We have also generally sought to have the Commission, advised by the Securities Committee, take account of different securities and issuers including small business.
Therefore, the disclosure requirements will be tailored to particular circumstances.
This leads me to a further compromise amendment, which would allow a national authority, if it wanted, to exempt companies with a market capitalisation of less than EUR 350 million from the EU requirement, so long as they are not marketing outside that Member State.
This seems likes a large amount, but I would merely point out that there are a number of quoted companies currently meeting the small and medium-sized enterprise definition that would actually be covered by this.
For example, the British Technology Group employs just 182 people and has a turnover of EUR 22 million and a balance sheet of EUR 32 million.
It is an SME, but has a market capitalisation currently of EUR 1.6 billion.
Small companies can have vast values, and it only takes one or two Nobel scientists on board to ensure that that happens.
It seems to me that, as an investor-protection measure, it is better to have these enterprises included within the scope.
Let me finally explain why I think issuer choice of regulatory authority is important.
We want regulators to cooperate and they are increasingly doing so.
We also want to give them an incentive to do so.
By allowing issuers to choose between their regulatory authorities, largely as they do now, for example, on all securities except equities in a domestic market, we can ensure that that cooperation proceeds and that we gradually put in place the foundation for a single regulatory authority across the Union.
Mr President, I represent the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as rapporteur for the Directive on market abuse.
We of course primarily tried during our discussions to make sure that what emerges here goes as far as possible to ensure that the directive is legally correct.
The main problem we faced was the issue of comitology.
The original draft directive provided a very general definition of market abuse, beyond which the bulk of the detail, the actual definitions, are relegated to the Annex and made accessible to the comitology process.
We are convinced that criminal law - and we are talking about criminal law here - can only be adopted by the actual legislature and not through the comitology process.
That is why in the first place we are very grateful that the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and also that committee as a whole adopted changes in order to move in the direction requested by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The second legal aspect which is vital here is that although we have some sympathy for the fact that the Commission attempted to adopt a result-oriented rather than a blame-oriented approach, it is a problem for us - and this is a general legal principle - that without blame, without guilt, no penal sanctions can be applied.
If that approach were to be adopted, it would fly in the face of all the fundamental rights provisions that have become part of the traditional order in our Member States, and it would also be counter to the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in Nice.
So without any guilt whatsoever it is impossible to apply such sanctions.
We also considered the degree of guilt.
It is our opinion that market abuse is an offence very similar to other offences against property, such as fraud.
However, there is no such thing as negligent fraud or negligent theft.
Such offences can only be committed intentionally.
For this reason it was one of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's wishes that intent should also be included as a matter of principle.
We are very grateful to the rapporteur for his willingness, in a spirit of compromise, to incorporate these points from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market into his draft.
It now only remains for us to make an appeal to the Council that when it makes its decision it should take account of fundamental rights.
This appeal is, for very good reasons, particularly directed to the Finance Ministers, who are responsible for this.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur and in particular the Commission.
In the von Wogau report on comitology we also introduced the area of market participants, and I believe that there was very good cooperation in the area in which I was shadow rapporteur for the financial conglomerates, between the Commission, the Council, market participants and Parliament, especially in the preparatory phase.
This is in fact an appeal to the Commission to carry forward this good cooperation between market participants, Parliament and the Commission, and to eliminate sources of irritation and possible misinterpretations in advance.
We have succeeded relatively well in doing this, and I think that we can work in this way for the future in accordance with market trends.
People keep saying that this is a technical report because it is so complicated.
It certainly does have major implications.
I will of course comply with the President's wish that I should be very brief, but I would like to touch on one or two points, especially the collapse of Enron, which has been repeatedly mentioned.
I believe that we need to take Enron's collapse seriously, and we need to think about drawing the necessary conclusions from it.
One conclusion, for example, could be about how we deal with firms of auditors and consultants in Europe in future.
Ultimately, however, in this area as well we need to take account of the changing situation - the fact that ever more financial conglomerates are coming into existence which operate internationally, in relation to the joint forum and at the same time Basel II.
It is our job as the European Parliament to make sure that the public is protected, but also that our companies remain competitive in this global competitive struggle.
We have to take appropriate corrective measures here.
I believe that we have considered these measures here in Parliament as part of a calm dialogue, and that we have been able to eliminate many problems, and I believe that could set a good precedent for how we deal with these topics.
Mr President, I would like to sincerely congratulate the three rapporteurs, and I believe that this cooperation between the Commission and the Council should set the pattern for future discussions.
I believe it is very important for the Commission and the Council to work towards strengthening the way the European Parliament functions in this area, as provided for in the Lamfalussy report, so that we can also exercise our democratic rights in the monitoring committee while preserving complete neutrality.
The three directives that we are discussing today and voting on tomorrow aim to overcome the fragmentation of Europe's financial markets, to enhance their attractiveness and competitiveness, and at the same time also to strengthen financial stability and consumer protection.
The elimination of obstacles to market access and bureaucratic regulations, the removal of antiquated and rigid supervisory structures and their replacement by flexible and market-oriented supervisory rules and instruments are indispensable requirements for the creation of an integrated financial market and for ensuring the competitiveness of Europe's financial service providers.
However, this should not be allowed to jeopardise financial stability or to lead to a deterioration in consumer rights as regards cross-border transactions.
We should make total transparency and strict regulatory and supervisory mechanisms, including appropriate sanctions, the hallmark of the quality of Europe's financial markets.
It is of course also important to regain the confidence of private investors in this sort of saving, not least in the interest of building up fully funded supplementary retirement pensions.
We do not need statements of good conduct for this, but just clear and binding regulations underpinned by appropriate sanctions.
The same applies to the Directive on financial conglomerates, which will most certainly take integration an important step further forward.
If they are to remain competitive in the face of the globalisation and internationalisation of the finance markets, Europe's financial companies need to reposition themselves in the market, and the growing number of takeovers and mergers in this context demonstrates that this process is in full swing.
This structural shakedown in order to create internationally competitive companies is certainly to be welcomed.
However, it should not lead to a situation in which financial groups and conglomerates of this kind are increasingly no longer subject to the supervision that up to now has been organised at national level and in most Member States, even at sectoral level.
Enron has generally highlighted the risks involved in multi-layered and inadequately supervised finance groups.
The directive before us will create an important harmonised European legal basis for cooperation between supervisory authorities, and it will also prevent multiple gearing of own funds instruments within a group.
In order to avoid excessive administrative burdens, we believe that we are right in calling for responsibility for the supervision of financial conglomerates and groups to be transferred to a single supervisory authority, which will be established on the basis of legally defined criteria.
It is also especially important here that we have fortunately managed to reach a compromise with regard to the scope of the directive and also as regards multiple gearing of prudential capital, a compromise that my group also fully supports.
Mr President, I want primarily to concern myself with the proposal concerning the supplementary supervision of the financial conglomerates with which I had a lot to do in my job as shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
First and foremost, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, for the huge amount of work he has done in connection with Parliament's debate of this proposal for a directive.
Next, I should like to thank Mr Radwan and Mrs Villiers, with whom I have had very close contact during our work with a view to tomorrow's vote.
Last but not least, I should also like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his work on bringing about a genuine internal market for financial services.
With the active participation of the Commission, we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have, where far and away the majority of points are concerned, found common solutions to the problems raised in different quarters.
The background to the practical proposal is that we wish to secure stable financial markets in Europe.
We want to avoid scandals along the lines of Enron.
At the same time, however, there must be no more regulation than is necessary.
What is most important, therefore, is to secure effective supervision to prevent financial conglomerates from using the same capital to consolidate their positions in several different places.
I should like to express my support for the oral amendments to be tabled by Mr Radwan to Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48 in connection with tomorrow's vote.
I appreciate the Commission's also being able to accept the amendments tabled.
For me, adoption of the proposal tomorrow will be further proof that the European Parliament accepts co-responsibility when necessary.
I am a great believer in our not dragging matters out if possible solutions emerge.
We have found those solutions here in Parliament, and so it is merely up to the Council to deliver the rest.
Thank you very much, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen.
I regret to inform the Members and Commissioner Bolkestein that this debate is suspended and will resume at 9.00 p.m.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo, you will also have to return after 9.00 p.m. I am sorry about this, but we must comply with the agenda.
Mr President, the situation in Chechnya is still very worrying for the European Union.
Recent reports by the OSCE Assistance Group in Chechnya, by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and by two NGOs (Memorial and MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres) demonstrate that the situation in this part of Russia is still dramatic.
On the basis of this and other reports, the European Union has raised the issue with the Russian authorities in all the political dialogue that has taken place recently and will continue to do so.
This is no surprise, since the European Union has repeatedly spoken out clearly against any violation of human rights and on the situation of the refugees and internally displaced people in Chechnya.
Consequently, the Union has adopted a coherent position in principle which makes it very clear to Russia that, while the upheaval in Chechnya continues, the Union will continue to apply firm pressure for a change to come about, taking every possible opportunity and also turning to the relevant international organisations.
However, I believe that it would be misleading to say that nothing has happened throughout the whole of last year.
The question refers to Resolution 1270 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe which says that, while it has been frustratingly slow, some progress has been made thanks to positive changes of attitude now visible within the Russian Federation in relation to dealing with the conflict.
As an example of this change, we have heard statements from President Putin to the effect that members of the Russian armed forces who do not respect human rights will be tried and punished.
The Union is pleased with this statement and hopes that the Russian authorities will fulfil their commitment and prevent any further violation of human rights.
It has always been understood that the fight against terrorism and extremism should take place within the framework of the Rule of Law and with full respect for human rights.
The indiscriminate use of force will only serve to fan the flames of conflict for many years to come.
At the same time, it is clearly necessary to maintain stability in the region.
The Council absolutely agrees that only a political solution can resolve the Chechen conflict.
It understands that the Russian authorities have tried to reach an agreement with representatives of Maskhadov, but that unfortunately these efforts have not been successful.
The European Union will not miss any opportunity to insist on a political solution and, for its part, the OSCE is still playing a useful role through the presence of its Assistance Group.
The security and independence of journalists are issues of great concern to the European Union, which has recently reiterated its views on the situation of the media in Russia.
The Union has also been very active in terms of achieving the presence of international humanitarian organisations in Chechnya and, by means of ECHO (the European Community Humanitarian Office), it has directly participated in humanitarian aid as one of the principal donors since the start of the Chechen conflict.
The Union has periodically dealt with the problem of security with the Russian authorities and recently a Commission official travelled to Chechnya to assess the current situation on the ground and the Union's troika is planning another visit to the region on a Head of Mission level.
Finally, in relation to the prosecution of those people who have violated human rights, the European Union would point out that the Court of Human Rights in the Hague is now involved in several cases.
The Court will set a date in the coming months to study the admissibility of some of these cases.
Naturally, the European Union intends to follow these events closely.
Mr President, I am grateful to the President of the Council for his comprehensive answer, and I am pleased that he himself states that the situation in Chechnya is still tragic.
I have taken note of the Council's statement that it will continue to discuss the situation in Chechnya during all meetings with Russian authorities.
I would also expressly like to thank the President of the Council for his condemnation of all human rights violations and for the fact that he calls for change, and continues to do so.
In addition, I thank the President of the Council for confirming once again that a political solution alone can end the Chechen conflict.
He also states that the European Union will seize every opportunity to achieve this political solution, and he rightly refers to the contacts between the Russian government and the government of the Chechen President, Mr Maskhadov.
It is clear that these talks deserve a helping hand, but Mr President of the Council, I am a little disappointed with your very diplomatic use of language.
It is evident that the contacts with the Russian government will be stepped up in the weeks to come.
The Russian Prime Minister will be visiting Brussels during the EU Summit at the end of May; I should like to ask you what concrete initiatives you will take in order to translate the fine declaration of intent, which you gave today, into action?
This is my specific, supplementary question.
Thank you for your response.
Mr President, the Council and the Commission are working actively together in preparation for the summit between the European Union and Russia, which will take place in Moscow on 28 May, and within the framework of this bilateral dialogue we intend to raise all the issues relating to the situation in Chechnya.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is now two years and six months since the second war in Chechnya began.
Commissioner Poul Nielson has not yet been to Chechnya.
My question is therefore this: in a matter of this kind - a humanitarian matter, an urgent matter - what time limit does the Council believe should be set for Commissioner Poul Nielsen to visit Chechnya?
Should he go there within three years, four years or five years?
And now for my second question: President Putin has appointed a negotiator, and President Maskhadov has appointed a negotiator.
Would the Presidency of the Council be willing to receive the two negotiators, who are recognised by both parties and who are therefore fully legitimate negotiators?
Could the Council meet with them?
Mr President, I am not in a position to answer this question.
Mr President, according to reports in the German press, Chechnya's position is becoming more critical.
Major reports have appeared in our newspapers which indicate that Russian military death squads are operating in Chechnya and that one village turned to the United Nations for help as it had been visited a total of 33 times for "cleansing operations".
I urge you to ensure that an EU delegation should inspect the position in Chechnya on the ground and check what is actually happening there, because journalists can still only visit if accompanied by officers.
As long as there has been a Council of Europe presence in Chechnya, there has not so far been an EU presence.
Which is why I am asking if you would consider sending an EU mission to Chechnya.
Mr President, the possibility of sending a delegation is a matter which would always have to be agreed with Russia, which is a sovereign country.
The Union has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country such as the Russian Federation.
If we were to reach an agreement with the Russians on the sending of a delegation, we would be very willing to cooperate there, but for the moment that is exclusively a task for multilateral bodies such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
Mr Dupuis, on a point of order.
Mr Dupuis, the President-in-Office of the Council has the right to respond to you in that way.
You are not satisfied with it, but let us not get into a debate. Tell us what your point or order is as quickly as possible.
I think that Mr De Miguel can say that he is going to refer to the Council on the matter and will give a more detailed answer later, as he is not in a position to do so at present.
However, I do not think that he is playing by the rules by simply saying that he cannot give an answer.
I think that he can put the questions that we have asked him to the Presidency and to the Council and say that he is not in a position to answer some of them at present.
But I do think that, as a general rule, the Council should answer all questions.
Yes, Mr President, I can answer.
I believe that by definition and out of the respect the Council has for the Members of this House, any question asked here, in Parliament and during Question Time, is a question to the Council, and not to the Presidency and that, therefore, the Presidency communicates it to the Council, on principle.
I have therefore told you that I cannot reply to you because I have not yet consulted the Council, but that consultation of the Council va de soi, and I hope Mr Dupuis understands that phrase in his own language.
As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 2 and 3 will be taken together.
Question No 2 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0063/02):
Subject: Spanish Presidency's measures against opponents of globalisation
The Spanish Government has reportedly formed special police rapid-response units to prevent anti-globalisation movements from demonstrating as planned in various Spanish cities during the Spanish Presidency.
At the same time, personal data are being compiled on anyone who took part in similar demonstrations in other European cities.
These data are being collected with the cooperation of several Member States' police forces, while the Spanish security forces have been monitoring the websites of anti-globalisation movements for months.
Can the Council confirm this information?
Can it guarantee that personal data concerning Union citizens will be protected and that there will be no obstruction of the freedom to express political opinions in the European Union?
Question No 3 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0108/02):
Subject: Position of the Spanish Presidency on demonstrations
A memorandum of 29.1.2002 from the Spanish Presidency to the Council's Working Party on Terrorism proposes drawing up, on the basis of a Council Decision, a standard form for the exchange of information concerning acts of terrorism committed during EU summits or other events convened by international or Community organisations.
The perpetrators of such acts are organisations which, although being legal, in the estimation of the authors of the memorandum, commit acts outside the scope of their declared activities, thus indirectly aiding terrorist organisations to achieve their objectives.
They also consider that such 'manipulation' poses a serious threat which may increase considerably in the immediate future.
According to the memorandum, the Presidency's proposal is a very useful tool for preventing and, when deemed necessary, repressing outbreaks of violent 'youth radicalism' in major cities.
Since such 'analyses' and proposals are questionable to say the least and totally contrary to the fundamental right of freedom of expression and the right to demonstrate, will the Council state its official position on this matter?
Mr President, the Council would like to draw your attention to the reply to Oral Question No 0967/01, which refers to Article 33 of the European Union Treaty which states: 'This Title (Title VI, Provisions on police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters) shall not affect the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon Member States with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security?.
In relation to data protection, the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data has been ratified by all the Member States of the Union.
The conclusions adopted by the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States of 13 July 2001, relating to security at European Councils and similar events, indicated the European Union's objective, which was to maintain and develop the Union's status as an area of freedom, security and justice.
In this field, the citizens must have the right to freely express their opinions and to meet in a peaceful way, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights, and to do so free from any threat to their security, to other citizens or to property.
The same conclusions stressed the importance of constructive dialogue between organisers of public demonstrations and the authorities of the country in question, as well as the importance of maintaining close international contacts, particularly between police and customs authorities, in order to ensure that legitimate demonstrations are not taken advantage of or abused in order to commit acts of collective or individual violence.
In relation to Mr Papayannakis, I will say that the preparatory bodies who are examining his question met in January and in February and worked as laid down in the Treaty, that is, respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms.
It falls within the competence of the Spanish Presidency to offer the reply it considers appropriate.
Thank you for your reply.
I should just like to say that Mr Papayannakis is not here because he is attending the conference of Presidents and Vice-Presidents.
It seems to me that the President-in-Office of the Council endeavoured to give a very general reply with references to a few interesting principles, such as data protection agreements.
I should like to ask if the Spanish Presidency is making practical arrangements and, rather than following the Berlusconi line, which caused a great many problems and violated the fundamental rights of the citizens of the European Union by refusing to allow peace-loving Greek and other nationals to land in Italy, is making arrangements to follow the Porto Alegre approach in an effort to create a framework within which the protestors can express their views and their claims legally and peacefully.
It is in this regard that I should like to ask what he has to say about agreements with organisers and so on.
Mr President, firstly, I reject any comparison by the Member who has just spoken between the government of Mr Berlusconi and the government of Mr Aznar.
Each government exercises its responsibility according to its competences, and I assure you that the Spanish Government is going to fulfil its responsibilities in the Presidency of the Council of the Union in a way that fully respects the area of security, freedom and justice and the obligations that come with that Presidency.
In any event, I can guarantee that we have no intention of denying one of the fundamental freedoms laid down in the Treaty (the freedom of movement of citizens), but I must warn you that the Spanish Government is prepared to take all the necessary measures to prevent people who intend to turn peaceful demonstrations into a field of battle, violence, destruction of property and aggression against people and objects, from achieving their aims in Barcelona.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that disruptions at meetings of this kind are above all the result of a failure to educate the public.
Hence the European Parliament's initiative to endow the WTO with a parliamentary assembly, so that in future discussions can be held with non-governmental organisations and interest groups, thus strengthening communication with the public at parliamentary level.
I would now like to put this question to you, Mr President-in-Office: what initiatives does the Spanish Presidency intend to take in order to implement this plan as quickly as possible?
I would like to say to the honourable Member that the problems raised are not due to a lack of dialogue.
The Council of the Union has expressed its willingness to hold dialogue on several occasions.
The Spanish Government is currently holding talks with all the groups that want to peacefully express their ideas in Barcelona and anybody who demonstrates peacefully will have the right to be heard and to demonstrate, since that is an inalienable right of any European citizen.
But, naturally, I do not think that those people who demonstrate peacefully are the ones who need fora for dialogue, because the fora already exist.
In any event, the honourable Member's initiative is always good.
If there were a parliamentary assembly, if a new possibility for dialogue were offered, that may help to create more fora, but I do not think that multiplying fora can resolve the most serious problem of this type of public demonstration being organised and used by violent groups and factions who have no intention of dialogue, since all they want is to take the opportunity to spread confusion and violence.
Question No 4 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0066/02):
Subject: Supposed position of the Spanish Presidency on the creation of a Union senate based on the Committee of the Regions
The Spanish Minister of the Office of the President of the Government, Juan JosÃ© Lucas, has said, in order to refute the positions upheld by nationalities and regions wishing to be represented in the Council of Ministers alongside their counterparts in Belgium, Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom, that they are properly represented within the Committee of the Regions.
He proposed transforming this advisory body into an EU senate.
Can the Council Presidency elucidate on this proposal by the Minister of the Office of the President, Mr Lucas?
Mr President, the Council would like to remind the honourable Member that it is not within its competence to comment on the positions expressed by one of its members.
Furthermore, it stresses that the issue raised is not within its competence, but that of the Intergovernmental Review Conference, which is currently preparing the Convention created by the Laeken European Council on 14 and 15 December 2001.
Finally, the Council wishes to refer the honourable Member to the reply it gave to Mrs Rosa MiguÃ©lez Ramos during Question Time last February, in plenary session, relating to the representation of the Member States in the Council.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Government of the Spanish State refuses, in a way which is arbitrary and quite contrary to the winds of history, to allow the Union's constituent nationalities and regions to play a role in the Union, not least in the Council of Ministers, and is trying to ignore the practices already in place in Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Austria.
He is trying to base his approach on an absolutist concept of sovereignty, contrary to that of shared sovereignty which is, in fact, a fundamental principle of the European Union.
In its folly - as illustrated by the Minister of the Presidency Mr Lucas, a minister who is very close to the President of the Spanish Government - the Spanish Government is both trying to confine the internal constitutional bodies to a consultative role in the politically useless Committee of the Regions, and also, ignoring the reality of the Union, wants to turn this body into senate, even if this means going against proposals such as the one put forward by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, who reserves this role of senate for the Council itself.
They could not be making a worse decision.
This is why I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council: why is the Government of the Spanish State insisting on maintaining such an anachronistic concept of sovereignty in the Union?
I consider that I have already answered the question, Mr President.
Secretary of State, you referred to the reply you gave in this House to Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos and I, who at that time also spoke in relation to this issue, have not received the same reply.
I would like to ask you firstly whether you can send me a copy of the reply you gave to Mr MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
Secondly, I would like you to tell me whether or not it is true that the Treaty on European Union indicates that Ministers of the regional governments can participate in European Councils of Ministers.
Mr President, with regard to the reply I gave to Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos, I would refer the honourable Member to this Parliament's verbatim report, which is public, and therefore I imagine he will have more opportunity to consult it than I.
With regard to the second question, I can say that the Treaty gives Member States the power to decide who their representatives in the Council are to be.
That is an internal issue; each country decides what it wants to do and who it wants to send.
Your are raising points of order.
I must remind you that we are not going to enter into a dialogue on the basis of the issue and that you must raise a genuine point of order.
In what order would you like to raise your points of order?
I will begin with Mr Ortuondo, on a point of order.
Mr President, I only wanted to stress that on the occasion to which reference was made in relation to Mrs Ramos, I asked a question and I have not received a reply to that question, and I therefore do not have to consult the verbatim report, because I believe I have the right to receive a reply, since it was I who asked the question.
Mr President, my question is, can I ask for an answer from the Council, as happened with an earlier question, and can I do so under the same conditions as before and receive a proper answer?
As President for the sitting, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has recalled a reply he gave on a previous occasion, some weeks or maybe a month ago, to the same questions; and the President-in-Office of the Council is the author of his reply, and you can therefore judge it as you see fit.
Mr President, the honourable Member's question relates to two realities: the Action Plan and the World Fund.
Firstly, in relation to the Action Plan, the Council would remind the honourable Member that in the Resolution which it adopted on 14 May 2001 on the programme for action and the speeding up of the fight against HIV (AIDS), malaria and tuberculosis in the context of a reduction in poverty (document 8495/01), the Council explained the actions it considers essential in the fight against these three diseases.
The actions include, firstly, access to pharmaceutical products and, in particular, the flexible application of the ADPIC (Trips) agreement in relation to intellectual property, which allows us to confront public health problems, amongst other things, through the discretionary power to grant obligatory licences in certain exceptional circumstances, including those involving the protection of public health.
Secondly, it is a question of strengthening and increasing the financial contributions in the field of research and development.
It is particularly important both to increase the capacity of the developing countries and to offer incentives for the development of specific universal public services, such as new treatments and vaccines.
Another action is the participation in world associations.
The objective consists of strengthening the cooperation agreements amongst the Member States with the WHO, the UNO (AIDS), the World Bank and other international actors in both the private and the public sectors, for example, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI).
The Council wishes to stress that that Resolution was presented at the 26th Special Sitting of the General Assembly of the United Nations which took place in New York on 25 to 27 June 2001, during which the European Union actively participated in the drawing up of the final declaration.
Secondly, with regard to the World Fund for Fighting AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Council would remind the honourable Member of the European Parliament and Council Decision adopted on 6 December 2001, on the European Community contribution to the World Fund for Fighting HIV (AIDS), Tuberculosis and Malaria.
In accordance with that decision, the Commission will contribute EUR 600 million to that world fund for 2001, which will be paid within the framework of a funding agreement to be reached between the Commission and the World Bank.
That Decision also stipulates that in 2002 the Commission must present the European Parliament and the Council with a first report on the management and working methods of the World Fund.
With regard to future contributions, the Council is waiting for the Commission to present it with proposals for modifications to the existing Regulations. In particular, the Regulation of 24 March 1997 on actions in the field of HIV (AIDS) in the developing countries, which also includes interventions in the field of genetic health, what is know as 'reproductive health', as well as that of 22 July 1997 on aid for demographic policies and programmes in the developing countries.
With regard to the activities so far carried out by the Fund, the Council wishes to tell the honourable Member that on 29 January 2002 the management board meeting in Geneva approved its first presentation of proposals for funding of associations in countries seriously affected by epidemics.
The initial series of subsidies, which will be awarded in April, will be the first granted by the Fund.
The second meeting of the Fund's board must take place in New York at the end of April.
The Council would urge the honourable Member to approach the Commission directly, since it is represented on the management board of the World Fund, in order to obtain more precise information on the Fund's activities.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the exhaustive information he has provided me with this afternoon.
In fact, the concern of this Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Development and Cooperation, is - given the current situation in Africa, essentially in its central regions (Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, etc.), in terms of AIDS - how the Council, and of course the Commission, is going to control the fund of EUR 120 million which we approved in this House.
Since you have told me that EUR 60 million has already been provided and that the first report is going to be carried out now, in April, from then on we will be very attentive to that control.
Question No 7 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0076/02):
Subject: Languages used by the Spanish Presidency
At the start of the current year, Spain took over the revolving presidency of the European Union.
During the preceding six months it had been the turn of Belgium, and both on its Presidency website and in its appearances before, and dealings with, the European Parliament, the Belgian Government frequently used all of the languages which have official status in the country's various regions.
Would the Council Presidency therefore explain why it is that, although under the relevant Statutes of Autonomy which are derived from the Spanish Constitution, the Catalan, Galician and Basque languages are co-official with Spanish, none of those languages is to be used in the Presidency's appearances before, and dealings with, the European Parliament (where, admittedly, no interpreters are available), nor are they to appear on the Spanish Presidency's website?
Mr President, the Presidency of the Council wishes to remind the honourable Member that, according to the provisions of Article 290 of the EC Treaty, the linguistic system of the Community's institutions will be set by the Council, which will decide unanimously.
The Council's position on this particular issue is laid down in its Regulation (EC) No 1 of 1958, successively amended for the purposes of the accessions of new Member States, which lays down that there are currently eleven official working languages in the European Union.
With regard to the presence on the Spanish Presidency's website of the languages declared as official under the Spanish Constitution, this is not an issue which falls to the Council of the Union.
Mr Secretary of State, I believe that this is an issue of cultural characteristics and open democratic characteristics.
In Europe, there are more than one hundred peoples and more than one hundred different languages.
2001 was declared International Year of Languages in the European Union.
And I say this is an issue of characteristics because, in the Spanish State, we tried to ensure that during 2001 there would be cultural events aimed at protecting and promoting the native languages existing within the Spanish State, which are not limited to Castilian, since there is bable (Asturian), Catalan, Galician, Basque... and many other languages which have a natural right to continue to exist.
The Government of the Spanish State did not allow any of these languages to be promoted or cared for.
I would like to ask you what the reason is for this closed and anti-democratic attitude to something which goes hand in hand with the wealth of cultural diversity in both Europe and the Spanish State?
I am afraid that the honourable Member has mistaken this forum for another.
I believe that your parliamentary group would do better to raise this question in the Spanish Parliament.
I repeat that the Council of the Union is not involved in this issue in any way whatsoever.
Therefore, since I am appearing here in the European Parliament as a representative of the Council of the Union, and not of the Spanish Government, I cannot answer your question.
We are going to move on to the next question.
You are aware that some Members, including the President, would very much like to speak in these debates; but in the case of the President of the sitting, it is impossible, although there has been mention of bable, the Asturian dialect, which is a form of expression in the region I was born.
Mr President, the European Union has systematically given priority to the issue of human rights and the protection of minorities within its relations with the candidate countries.
This issue is a key element of the pre-accession strategy for each of these countries, in accordance with the political requirements for accession established by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993.
In the case of Romania, one of the specific areas included in the pre-accession strategy is childcare.
In the Commission's periodic report for 2000 on Romania's progress towards accession, the Commission expressed its concern in relation to the adoption legislation and practices in the various countries, which allow different considerations of the greater interest of the child influence decisions on adoption.
As a result of this, and other expressions of concern, the Romanian Government decided to suspend international adoptions.
In the revised Association for the accession of Romania, adopted by the Council on 28 January 2002, amongst the intermediate priorities and objectives, it is stipulated that Romania must maintain the moratorium on international adoption until new legislation is adopted which is compatible with interests of the children and with Romania's international obligations, and the necessary administrative capacity to apply the new legislation is guaranteed.
As well as maintaining the general moratorium, the Romanian Government adopted measures in December 2001 to allow for the completion of adoption procedures in those cases which were already before the courts at the time of the suspension of international adoptions.
The Presidency of the Council believes that the adoptions of those children whose adoption procedures have already begun in the Member States, with all legal guarantees, should be completed within a reasonable time period.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will closely monitor the situation in Romania in this regard, especially within the bodies created within the framework of European agreement, such as the Association Council and the Association Committee.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, not only for the accuracy of his answer, but also for what he has been doing, both during the Belgian Presidency and during the Spanish Presidency, with a view to resolving 'within a reasonable time period' - to use his own words - these two problems: that of resolving the Romanian adoption system, in order to make it compatible with international agreements and, secondly, that of resolving the problems of those families who, since the procedures were begun under the former Romanian legislation, have seen no progress.
I am going to ask a supplementary question: is the Council prepared to continue exerting its influence - I do not want to use stronger words - on the Romanian authorities so that they may make progress more quickly than we have seen up until now, despite all the promises in these two fields of applying the new legislation and of resolving these cases?
My answer is as follows: yes, the Association Council took place yesterday with Romania and the Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister and the President-in-Office of the Council dealt with this issue directly with the Romanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Geoana, and we received assurances that they would continue to do everything possible to conclude all these adoption procedures which, as you have mentioned, began under former legislation and have become paralysed.
It is a question of moving forward with what has already been started, of satisfying the expectations created within many families which had already started the process and then, naturally, begin a new system under the new legislation.
The Romanian delegation was made aware of this yesterday and we received assurances that they would continue in their efforts to satisfy the European Union in this regard.
I must inform the Members and in particular Mr Ortuondo, who is asking for the floor, that, according to Annex II, 'Conduct of Question Time under Rule 43?, in point 4, which relates to supplementary questions, it is stipulated that 'Each Member may put a supplementary question to any question.
He may put in all only one supplementary question to the Council and two supplementary questions to the Commission?.
Since today is Questions to the Council, you have asked all the questions allowed you, Mr Ortuondo.
Now, if this is a point of order, I have absolutely no intention of preventing you from speaking.
If it is a point of order, you have the floor, but you cannot ask any more supplementary questions today.
Alright, then I will do so as a point of order, because, if I have not misunderstood you, you have just said that all Members can ask one supplementary question for each question.
No.
You have misunderstood me or I did not express myself well, but I have read you the Rules of Procedure.
Then I must have misunderstood you and I will therefore not insist.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
During Questions to the Commission, Members can ask two supplementary questions, in addition to those which correspond to them, and during Questions to the Council they can ask one supplementary question.
I realise that the Rules of Procedure are not read carefully and that does not shock me; but that is why I am reminding you of them.
Mr President, with all due respect to Mr Carnero and Mrs Cerdeira, the Council cannot answer their question for two reasons: firstly, because the Council is not in the habit of commenting on articles which have appeared in the press and, secondly, because this issue does not fall within the Council's competence.
Mr President, can I therefore deduce from Mr de Miguel's answer that the Council considers that to propose any initiative against acts of discrimination suffered by European citizens of both sexes because of their sexual orientation does not fall within its competence, and that therefore, it considers that the provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the Council Decision of 27 November 2000, which establishes a Community action programme to fight against discrimination are also not within its competence?
I would remind him that, unfortunately, there are many European citizens of both sexes that call upon this Parliament every day describing the discrimination they have suffered purely because of their sexual orientation and this is something that I, as a Member of this Parliament, am naturally concerned about, and I was under the impression that this did fall within the Council's competence, quite apart from the specific circumstances of the case that has been mentioned here today.
Thank you, Mrs Cerdeira.
What I am trying to tell you is that the specific case you are referring to has a religious dimension, which means that this matter falls within the competence of the Catholic Church and not the Council.
The individual concerned is not suffering from any kind of discrimination other than the disciplinary procedures that the Catholic Church itself wants to follow with regard to a priest who has declared his sexual orientation.
Therefore, this is an issue that strictly falls within the competence of the Catholic religion, in which the Council does not wish to intervene.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in a democratic system such as the European Union, no religious or non-religious body is above the standards and fundamental values that guarantee the peaceful coexistence of citizens on a daily basis.
For this reason, I feel that it is indeed within the Council's competence to inform us of the exact measures it is going to take, and is taking, to prevent the discrimination against hundreds of thousands of European citizens of both sexes who, in carrying out their inalienable right to choose their sexual orientation, are discriminated against or badly treated.
I think it is indeed within the Council's competence to state, through the appropriate channels, that every institution must abide by the rules that are, as my colleague Mrs Cerdeira has said, laid down in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that has very recently been drawn up and proclaimed by the Council.
Mr President, all European institutions are naturally obliged to abide by the fundamental principles of respect for the person and to be against discrimination for whatever reason.
However, I feel that the specific case you have mentioned falls within the competence of the Catholic Church's internal disciplinary procedure, in which, I repeat, the Council does not wish to intervene, as this does not fall within its competence.
Mr President, first of all, the Council seems to argue that it has no competence in the field of the individual rights.
Is the Council therefore incompetent?
I would like an answer.
Furthermore, will the Presidency accept that Member States have a duty to condemn such discrimination because they are signatories to the employment framework directive which prohibits discrimination including on the grounds of sexuality and which must be transposed by 2003?
Finally, will the Presidency act on a point of principle and condemn such discrimination generally - discrimination which blights the souls of those who practice it as well as those who condone it either by their silence or by their inaction?
Mr President, no.
The Council does not intend to take any action in this regard.
Question No 11 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0084/02):
Subject: Spanish Presidency and relations with Morocco
What action will the Spanish Presidency take with regard to relations with Morocco?
Mr President, the Spanish Presidency is delighted with the positive state of relations between the European Union and Morocco and is determined to develop these on several levels: firstly, with the implementation of the Association Agreement that entered into force on 1 March, which sets the stage for close cooperation in a number of areas; the creation of a free trade area and the establishment of political dialogue, elements which all have a particular importance for the development of global relations with this country.
Progress has been made in numerous chapters of the Agreement and working groups have been set up in specific sectors.
The second meeting of the Association Council, taking place today, 13 March 2002, in Rabat, will provide an excellent opportunity to analyse the work being carried out to implement the Agreement and to lay down the foundations for future work.
At this meeting, the Presidency will also refer to various issues of a political nature, such as the human rights situation in Morocco and the Western Sahara.
It will also provide the opportunity to analyse the ways and means of strengthening relations between the European Union and Morocco with a view to preparing for the third meeting of the European Union-Morocco Association Council, which, in principle, will take place under the Danish Presidency during the second half of this year, given that the last meeting took place in October 2001.
On the other hand, the objective of the agricultural negotiations the Commission is holding with Morocco, which started in January, is to widely liberalise agricultural trade between the European Union and Morocco.
In accordance with the Association Agreement, negotiations will resume in parallel with the Association Committee on 14 March and, in principle, will be concluded by the end of 2002 at the latest.
The Presidency, for its part, will continue to support Morocco's efforts in regional and subregional cooperation, such as the Arab Maghreb Union and the Agadir Process.
The latter paves the way for the creation of a free trade area, initially between Morocco, Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia, and, if this proves successful, other countries in the region which have an Association Agreement with the European Union will also have access to this area.
Finally, the Presidency is pursuing dialogue and cooperation with Morocco on migration policy, including illegal immigration, with the aim, amongst others, of jointly implementing the action plan for Morocco adopted by the Council in October 1999.
This plan paves the way for socio-economic development, the integration of Moroccan nationals legally residing in Member States, the management of migratory flows and respect for the right of asylum.
Several projects are being implemented, having regard, for example, to joint development in the socio-economic area, living and working conditions of Moroccan communities in the European Union, the management of border controls and also support for the fight against illegal immigration.
A meeting of the working group on social affairs and migration was held yesterday in Rabat, and there will be consultations with regard to negotiations for a readmission agreement between the European Union and Morocco during this current six-month period.
With regard more specifically to fisheries, the Council recognises the ever-important relationship between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco in this area.
The Presidency will not spare any effort to ensure that this close relationship is maintained within the framework of a mutually beneficial arrangement between both parties.
Mr President, to tell the truth, this answer simply consists of reading out the agenda of meetings, which I think has no real political value and is very misleading, given that the question that was, in fact, asked, was what exactly will be the contribution of the Spanish Presidency to our relations with Morocco.
Mr President, the President-in-Office had nothing of substance to say.
This ready-made mould for meetings could be used for our relations with any other country.
Mr President-in-Office, please do not answer me with an agenda.
Tell me the precise objectives and priorities of the Spanish Presidency with regard to Morocco.
Something that we can understand as being an objective or a priority and not simply a agenda of meetings that, I fear, will be no different from the usual blah-blah we always hear.
I am sorry the honourable Member can only remember the dates of the meetings and not their content, so I shall repeat this for her benefit.
Yesterday, 12 March, today 13 and tomorrow 14, there are three meetings scheduled by the Presidency that will deal with the three greatest priorities for Morocco with regard to her relations with the European Union.
Yesterday, the Committee for Migration met to talk about the most pressing issue, the situation of migration from Morocco to the European Union, the situation of Moroccan immigrants in Europe and aid to Morocco for this very serious emigration problem they are suffering.
Today, the Association Committee is meeting to deal with all the political issues relating to cooperation with Morocco, not only in the economic but also in the political fields, as well as all the projects existing within the association framework and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which is the fundamental instrument in the relationship between the European Union and Morocco.
And, tomorrow, the Committee which is looking at all the agricultural exports from Morocco to the European Union will be meeting in Brussels, which is Morocco's top priority: to be able to export its agricultural produce to the European Union.
If this seems too little for Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, then, Mr President, then there really is nothing more I can say.
Question No 12 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0085/02):
Subject: EU export subsidies for agricultural produce
The EU spends nearly five billion euro each year on subsidies of exports of its own agricultural produce.
These subsidies seriously damage the prospects of other countries, particularly developing ones, of maintaining a viable position on the market in agricultural produce.
The Court of Auditors has also highlighted the fact that the expenditure is not checked in a satisfactory manner.
The EU's subsidies have come in for strong criticism in the WTO and part of the conclusions of the WTO meeting in Qatar was an objective to review subsidies.
What plans does the EU have for scaling down or phasing out these subsidies in the years to come?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to commercial dealings with developing countries, the Council would like to point out that the European Union is the second largest exporter and the main importer of agricultural products in the world and, in particular, that it is more or less the main importer of agricultural products from developing countries.
The European Union imports more agricultural products from developing countries than the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand put together.
Between 1997 and 1999, the European Union imported more than EUR 35 000 million worth of agricultural products every year from developing countries, with no import duty in the majority of cases, or at a very low level in exceptional cases.
In fact, the European Union has a very active policy of supporting these countries, particularly through two main programmes aimed at encouraging exports from developing countries to the European Union.
One is the Generalised System of Preferences and the other, the well-known EBA (everything but arms) initiative.
Furthermore, the Council would like to remind you that, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation - comprising 144 member countries, the majority of which are developing countries - an agreement on agriculture was made by virtue of the 1994 Marrakech Agreements with the aim, amongst other things, of reducing the subsidies that cause distortions to competition in world markets.
Recently, in November 2001, the development cycle initiated by the Doha Declaration set the objective of reducing these trade distortions further, helping, at the same time, developing countries to take fair advantage of world exchanges.
Within the framework of these new multilateral trade negotiations, the European Union has committed itself to contributing to the conclusion, before 1 January 2005, of a balanced multilateral agreement that will be advantageous to all parties.
The Community position consists of setting up additional reductions to export subsidies, such as export credits, state trading enterprises or other kinds of export monopolies that use one market to subsidise another; or even specific practices regarding food, whose true objective is to eliminate surpluses and open markets or suppress competition in the markets.
The Council does not yet have proposals from the Commission, which, as this Parliament is aware, has exclusive control over common commercial policy, but as soon as these proposals are presented to the Council, it will study them within the framework of these guidelines which the Commission, naturally, shares.
There is no risk therefore of there being any difficulty between the Council and the Commission in terms of achieving the objective of giving more advantages to developing countries so that they can export to Union markets.
I would thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that detailed answer.
I believe that these major export subsidies are basically divisive and destroy the agricultural market in large parts of the Third World.
It will only be possible to achieve a fair trade policy once the subsidies have been abolished.
I have two follow-up questions. The first concerns the extensive fraud involving export subsidies, as pointed out by, for example, the Court of Auditors.
What measures are being taken to get to grips with this fraud?
My second question concerns whether, on the basis of the Presidency's report, I can assume that, once the Commission has presented its proposal, the Spanish Presidency will support substantial reductions in export subsidies.
With regard to the control of EU expenditure, I believe that the European Union - the Commission, OLAF (the European Anti-Fraud Office) and the European Parliament - have the necessary instruments to control fraud, and I naturally imagine that, in the future, it will be treated with the same degree of severity and rigour as it has in the past.
With regard to the elimination of export subsidies, I cannot give you an answer on behalf of the Presidency-in-Office, because this will be the response of the Council as a whole.
I can tell you that Spain is opposed to import subsidies, but the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will, naturally, have to reflect upon the position of the Council as a whole, and I cannot say any more at this time, because we have still received no proposal from the Commission and the Member States have still not given their opinion on this issue.
Of course efforts are being made to change the system of subsidies paid in the past under the GATT agreements and, if it is changed, it will be at the expense of the agricultural produce and income of the poorer farmers.
I have to say that, if you bear in mind that 80% of subsidies go to 20% of farms, according to the MacSharry report, the subsidies paid to farmers, especially in the south, should have been increased long ago in order to meet the demands of the European Union for produce in which it is not self-sufficient and of which 70% are imports, such as cotton, tobacco, oil, fruit etc. Secondly, this produce is high quality and is good for the consumers of the European Union.
My question to the Council, given that it has not given a clear answer and, we are told, has not yet formulated a position, is this: will it agree to abolish subsidies in all cases on the basis of the conclusions of the Qatar summit and, if it does, will it take account of the fact that farming will be abandoned in countries such as Greece and other countries in the south and all that that implies, with small and medium-sized farms being wiped out, increased unemployment and the adverse impact on the environment?
It is very difficult for the President-in-Office of the Council to provide any further details on the debate that is going to take place on no more and no less than the reform of the common agricultural policy - which is certainly going to be one of the hottest debates in the European Union over the next few months - because at the heart of this reform is the very issue of agricultural subsidies.
I would ask the honourable Member to be patient and wait until July when the Commission will make its proposal on the medium term revision of the common agricultural policy, in accordance with the financial perspective and what was agreed in Berlin in 2000.
The Commission will therefore put forward its proposal at this time, the debate will begin in the Council and I do not have the slightest doubt that the European Parliament will very quickly take up all the issues raised and will be closely involved with this great movement for the reform of the common agricultural policy.
In order to do this, this Presidency or the next one will have many opportunities to give their opinion on these issues.
I am sorry I cannot go into any further detail at the moment, because there is nothing on the table.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that Question Time is for specific questions and not for debates of a general nature.
These can be held at other times, in a different manner and with much more time available.
During Question Time there is just one minute to ask the question and one minute to give the answer.
I am not referring to any Member in particular, so do not take this personally, this is simply a reminder for you all.
Mr President, I shall now answer.
On 12 February 2002, the Ecofin Council studied the updated stability programmes put forward by Germany and Portugal.
In this regard, the Council also studied, in a similar fashion, the Commission's recommendations aimed at forewarning, using the famous early warning method, these Member States so that they could prevent an excessive public deficit.
With regard to the concerns expressed in the Commission's recommendations on the worsening of this deficit, both the German and the Portuguese Governments committed themselves to ensuring that the reference value of 3% of GDP for public deficit would not rise again in 2002.
They also committed themselves to the very strict control of budgetary development in 2002 and to avoid any measure that could worsen the budget deficit and, naturally, to taking all the steps necessary to return, by 2004 at the latest, to a budgetary position closer to a balance, in the case of Germany, or an actual balance, in the case of Portugal.
The Council and the Commission considered that such commitments from the German and Portuguese Governments responded to the basis of the concerns expressed in the Commission's recommendations for which they would be forewarned.
Consequently, the Council rejected the Commission's recommendations and has opted to conclude the process.
The Council's motives were given in two declarations on the budgetary situation of these two Member States, which were made public.
I thank the Spanish Presidency for its answer.
I have a number of follow-up questions.
Does the Presidency believe it is a good thing that the Commission and the Council should have arrived at different conclusions regarding Portugal's and Germany's budget deficits?
Is it laudable that different assessments have been made?
How does the Spanish Presidency view the warning issued a year or so ago to Ireland following Irish tax reductions designed to fulfil specific election pledges by the Irish government?
Was it a legitimate warning, given the way in which Portugal and Germany are being treated?
How do you view the Stability Pact's credibility in the light of the euro's having become weaker as a world currency, especially against the dollar, in relation to which it has fallen from 1.30 to 0.90?
Finally, do you believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that this decision is prejudicial?
Mr President, firstly, it goes without saying that the decision taken by the Council is not prejudicial.
The Council would never take a decision that would cause harm either consciously or voluntarily.
That is unthinkable.
The Council only takes decisions when it believes they are in the best interests of the Union and its Member States.
Additionally, with regard to the supposed discrepancy between the Commission and the Council, I can only say that the Commission fully complied with its obligations laid down in the Treaties to monitor the Stability Pact and to propose to the Council the activation of the early warning mechanism, and that the Council carried out its corresponding obligation upon this warning from the Commission, and unanimously decided that, having obtained clear guarantees and commitments from the States involved, it should take the decision it took.
You ask me to compare the decision taken for Ireland with that taken for Germany and for Portugal.
In the case of Ireland, the Council took the decision it deemed appropriate - I imagine it took specific considerations into account - and then, in the case of Portugal and Germany, it took another decision it also deemed appropriate.
That is to say, the limits of the Council's discretion to make recommendations to countries that are in danger of not complying with the Stability Pact are absolutely sovereign and the Council decides on each case according to circumstances, and it goes without saying that the Irish case was not the same as the Portuguese case or the German case.
In the Portuguese and German cases, guarantees were given that were unanimously approved by Council members and the Council therefore took it upon itself to take the decision, in line with its own competences and responsibilities.
I have to tell you that several Members have requested to ask supplementary questions, but I can only give the floor to two more Members in the order in which they asked to speak.
I will now give the floor to Mr Tannock, then to Mr Fatuzzo.
The one-size-fits-all monetary policy and single currency will inevitably lead to foreign direct investment flowing to the Member State with the lowest income and corporation tax rates.
How long will it be before there are demands for serious tax harmonisation in Euroland?
And how long before the current EU budget - which is capped at 1.27% of the Member States' GDP - is deemed to be insufficient to stabilise a single currency zone, particularly after the imminent enlargement programme, which is presumably going to start by 2004, and particularly if there is an asymmetric shock to one of the Member States, which will need bailing out by some central EU fund?
You are all aware that you have to ask questions that are as specific and supplementary as possible.
The questions you are asking are of course related, but it remains to the discretion of the President-in-Office of the Council whether to answer questions unprepared.
It is clear that tax harmonisation is one of the European Union's aspirations, not solely for the Eurozone, but for the whole of the EU - for this is an issue which is also pertinent to the honourable Member's home country.
I know, however, ladies and gentlemen, that you are aware that this is an issue that must be decided upon unanimously, and that progress is being made very slowly, but progress is being made all the same, and therefore, the Council and Ecofin intend to continue working towards tax harmonisation within the European Union.
I hope that this harmonisation is achieved for the benefit not only of the Eurozone but the whole of the EU.
Does the President-in-Office of the Council think there is any truth in the claims made by the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, and the Italian Finance Minister, Mr Tremonti, that when they came into power in 2001 after the previous centre-left governments they found a hole in the budget worth EUR 8 550 million, which had been covered up in the budget by the preceding governments and only came to light when the present government checked the figures?
Is it true?
Do you know anything about it?
Mr President, this issue does not fall within the competence of the President-in-Office of the Council and, therefore, I cannot answer.
We must now have the last question to the President-in-Office of the Council, because he must leave at 7 p.m. on the dot to catch his flight.
Question No 14 by Raimon Obiols i GermÃ  (H-0090/02):
Subject: Prospects for the Barcelona Process
On 24 January, speaking before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council expressed concern about the economic and political progress being made in the Barcelona Process.
On 31 January at the EuroMeSCo Annual Conference the French Foreign Minister, Hubert VÃ©drine, expressed the view that the Barcelona Process was facing enormous social and political obstacles and had perhaps been founded on a rather Utopian and overly global vision.
Does the Presidency believe that what should be done is to scale down the expectations for and the political commitment to the Barcelona Process or, on the contrary, to give the Euro-Mediterranean partnership top priority, particularly since the events of 11 September?
Can it give details of some of the practical proposals that it will be making at the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Valencia?
What institutional mechanisms does it believe need to be brought into being or strengthened in order to get a joint decision-making process under way between the Mediterranean partners?
What view does it take of the suggestion that the Euro-Mediterranean process should be taken forward by means of the adoption of 'enhanced cooperation' measures?
Mr President, the Presidency has supported efforts to develop the Barcelona Process from the start.
In the new international climate following the events of 11 September, the Ghent European Council of 19 and 20 October 2001 considered it fundamentally important to encourage dialogue on equal terms between our communities and those from the Arab and Muslim world, particularly within the framework of the Barcelona Process.
Special attention is therefore being devoted to this issue.
Taking this into account, the strengthening of activities within the Barcelona process is, in fact, one of the Spanish Presidency's priorities, with the intention that the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Affairs Ministers in Valencia on 22 and 23 April should be a success.
With the objective of preparing for this conference, from 18 to 22 February we led a mission to countries in the Maghreb and, as a result of this, all the necessary preparations have more or less been made to deal with issues in the three great political, economic and socio-cultural spheres, with the aim of reaching specific agreements at the Valencia Conference.
I should also like to say that, up to now, we have received more or less the same response from all countries in the Barcelona process guaranteeing their presence at the Valencia Conference.
I believe that, in view of the difficult circumstances we are facing with regard to the Middle East peace process, the fact that all delegations have announced their willingness to participate in the Valencia Conference is already proof of a spirit of cooperation and a desire to use the framework of the Barcelona Council to overcome the difficulties faced by the Arab and Israeli parties in the Middle East peace process.
Mr President, I hope that my speech will not cause the President-in-Office of the Council to miss his flight.
Therefore, in light of the response he has given me, I would like to reformulate my question and ask two that are very specific.
The first refers to the proposal from the Presidency-in-Office for a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank.
Is the Presidency-in-Office able to guarantee the success of this proposal or will we have to be content with a simple line of facilities or with the promise of the optimisation of the MEDA programmes?
My second, also very specific, question refers to the presence in Valencia, not of third Mediterranean countries, but of Ministers for Foreign Affairs from EU Member States.
Are you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, able to guarantee that there will be no repeat of the scandal of the last Euro-Mediterranean Conference, where, out of fifteen Member States, only four Ministers for Foreign Affairs bothered to turn up?
Mr President, first of all, I would like to make my excuses.
It is true that I have to catch a plane, and also that in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions to the Council end at 7 p.m. on the dot.
Therefore, while I would love to be able to stay here longer, unfortunately on this occasion I cannot.
In any event, I should like to say that the Presidency is here, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, until the last minute it is required.
However, having said this, I shall be delighted to answer Mr Obiols' questions because I believe them both to be very pertinent, especially, I am embarrassed to have to say, the second one.
With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference, we continue to insist on the participation of Ministers from associated countries in the Mediterranean, Arab countries and Israel, and you have reminded us of last year's embarrassment when only four EU Ministers out of the fifteen expected came to this meeting.
Mr Obiols is aware of the extent of Spain's current concern about this issue, given that Spain was one of the countries that was represented at ministerial level at the Conference, and the extent of their concern as Presidency-in-Office, which is why we have taken all necessary steps with all Ministers concerned, and have repeated to them on various occasions that, with regard to this meeting, which will be important with regard to the revision of the Barcelona process, the physical presence of the Ministers responsible for Foreign Affairs in the European Union is absolutely crucial.
We have received guarantees from Ministers from all EU States that they will be in Valencia on these dates.
I hope that when I myself or the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr PiquÃ©, give an explanation of the results from this meeting at the session immediately following the meeting or at the next session, we will be able to say that there was full participation, for if this is not the case, we will have to take a serious look at our own consciences.
This European Parliament should really draw the attention of the EU governments to this matter.
With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, I am not in a position to give you any definitive plans at this moment.
What I can tell you is that the Presidency of the European Union is very actively engaged in this regard at this present time, particularly the President-in-Office of the European Council, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar, by completing the visits we have made to all the EU capitals at the highest level and trying to find a satisfactory solution.
This all seems to hint that in Barcelona we could adopt an agreement on a formula that, as has been said from the start, would consist of creating a subsidiary of the European Investment Bank (EIB), which would have autonomy and furthermore would follow a process of evolution.
It would start with a structure and several competences which would be increased over time.
It would evolve into a more ambitious body than perhaps we could possibly have approved from the outset.
Frankly, I believe that it is very possible that we will find a solution to this issue in Barcelona, because we would very much like to be able to put this plan forward in the ministerial meeting that will take place in Valencia with regard to the Barcelona process.
The President-in-Office of the Council has always fulfilled his obligations, and today he warned me that he would have to end at 7 p.m. on the dot for reasons that could not be avoided.
Several Members have given up their speaking time, but there is a point of order.
Mr de Miguel, you may now go in peace. I will take charge of the point of order.
Mr MacCormick, on a point of order.
Very briefly, the question which I had on the Order Paper today has been dealt with by Mr de Miguel in an extremely courteous, helpful and kind letter to me, which I received this afternoon.
I would like to thank him very much for that and say how much my constituent will appreciate the point.
Mr President, I received a written question from Mr MacCormick, which I intended to answer, but as I also had a letter from him, I rushed to send him a detailed reply in writing, which I hoped he would receive today.
Naturally, the written reply is much more detailed than the one I would have given here.
I would like to thank Mr MacCormick for his recognition and for his thanks.
I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office and Mr MacCormick on their excellent working relationship.
I never imagined a point of order could be so constructive.
I hope you have a good trip, Mr de Miguel.
Mr Ripoll also wanted to speak on this matter, but I imagine he will give up his speaking time due to today's exceptional time restraints.
Would you like to make a statement?

Mr President, I would just like to say that I am pleased Mr MacCormick received his answer, but I feel that, before asking a question of this nature, given the harm he is causing to one of Europe's major tourist destinations, the Balearic Islands, as a result of these inappropriate comments, we would have liked to have had the chance to ask a question, because I believe that the only thing the person Mr MacCormick is representing wanted was compensation and, given that the British company in charge of the trip did not pay up, they thought that the Spanish State should do so, causing damage to its image in the process, which I believe is inappropriate.
We cannot go any further on this issue, as you will understand, given today's exceptional time restraints.
I am sure you will be able explain this to the Balearic public.
I regret we do not have more time, but we cannot run on any longer.
As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 15 to 33 will be answered in writing
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on three reports by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs:
A5-0060/2002 by Mr Lipietz on the supplementary supervision of credit institution, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate (COM(2001) 213 - C5-0159/2001 - 2001/0095(COD)).
A5-0069/2002 by Mr Goebbels on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) (COM(2001) 281 - C5-0262/2001 - 2001/0118(COD)).
A5-0072/2002 by Mr Huhne on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading (COM(2001) 280 - C5-0263/2001 - 2001/0117(COD)).
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports we are examining today show that the sacrosanct objective of ensuring transparency and a high level of disclosure in the financial markets may conflict with other equally important requirements, such as not overwhelming small enterprises with excessive administrative burdens.
I believe that the rapporteurs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have done a good job in achieving a fine balance between the various requirements at issue, and I therefore think that Parliament should approve the proposals adopted in committee by a large majority.
Two points now: the first, which is urgent, concerns the creation of the so-called single passport, designed to speed up and cut the cost of raising capital within the European Union.
I believe that Mr Huhne's framework, which the Committee has adopted, is something we can accept in its entirety.
The second point concerns the chance given to the Member States to exempt companies with capitalisation below the EUR 350 million threshold from the obligations arising from the directive, as proposed by Mr Huhne. I believe this is a way of tempering the transparency of information with safeguards for the less small companies.
In conclusion, I am also convinced by the arguments in favour of allowing the competent authority to be chosen by the issuer, as proposed by Mr Huhne.
It is a mechanism that may prompt useful comparisons between the practices of the authorities in the Member States.
In these cases, as always, the scaremongers talk of a race to the bottom or, in other words, a decline in quality.
I believe that we should instead have more confidence in the ability of the markets to select and reward best practices.
Madam President, with financial instruments becoming ever more complicated and data being transmitted over the Internet in a matter of seconds, it is no longer easy to distinguish between appropriate use of insider information and abuse.
So in Germany, for example, only ten charges have been brought, because the definition was not clear enough to justify time-consuming and costly legal proceedings.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs unanimously supports the comitology arrangements, reflecting the Lamfalussy report and its parliamentary counterpart, the von Wogau report.
We attached a great deal of importance to a new definition of insider information.
This is information that is not generally accessible and which directly or indirectly concerns issuers of financial instruments.
It is information which, if it became public knowledge via traditional or electronic media, could appreciably influence share values or prices.
Manipulation is considered to exist in cases where false or misleading information on important facts is deliberately given and third parties stand to gain directly or indirectly.
We managed to prevent special rules applying to journalists, who should not be treated any differently to anyone guilty of market manipulation.
However, freedom of the press is guaranteed in each and every case.
We have adopted guidance for Member States on the enactment of sanctions and other measures.
We have agreed on principles as proposals for the Commission, to enable it to exercise its implementation powers.
We have drawn up a list of financial instruments to ensure that new products fall within the scope of the directive.
And we have emphasised the importance of "Chinese Walls" as a preventive measure in combating market abuse, and have called for specific control of this in individual companies.
We agreed that a central authority should be set up or expanded in each EU Member State in order to exercise effective control.
This is intended to bring together the various competences of national bodies so that they can closely cooperate with similarly structured authorities in other states.
I regard the agreement between Parliament, Commission and Council on most of the proposals as a great success.
Special thanks are also due to the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels; as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I wish to congratulate him on his ability to work out good compromises which incorporated many of our amendments.
The work done on revising the directive, which is also geared to new developments, should lead to greater coherence on Europe's financial markets and above all to more trust on the part of investors: the outlook is therefore good for a particularly sensitive area of our globalised economy.
Madam President, Mr Huhne, although we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted for your report - I am speaking of the Huhne report - that certainly does not mean that we supported it wholeheartedly.
There are limits to our willingness to cooperate.
I would like to repeat once again my group's objectives, which are market-oriented and user-friendly.
The Directive on prospectuses should make the market easy to understand and make products transparent.
We are in absolute agreement on that.
Likewise, investors need serious information.
Cases like Enron or Maxwell must not be allowed to happen again.
What is clear is that this directive cannot of course prevent fraudulent descriptions of securities, but this directive and all the accompanying measures that we have already dealt with and are already available should help to make sure that in future we are dealing chiefly with serious products.
My main criticism of the report before us, Mr Huhne, is that you as rapporteur have addressed only, or chiefly, big investors.
However, the market is flourishing in the private sector, for small investors, and there are various quite different additional issues when it comes to SMEs.
For example, for SMEs we of course need an attractive capital market and cheap equity borrowing, and our prime objective must be more security and quality for investors buying securities.
Furthermore, it is absolutely vital that the scope of the obligation to publish a prospectus in Europe should be extended so as to achieve greater market transparency, and that is not yet included in the first reading.
Unfortunately, for the time being we have only been able to agree on a market capitalisation of EUR 350 million.
I hope that there will be some additional flexibility on this in the package. Otherwise, with such a high threshold SMEs will be largely if not almost totally excluded, thus severely limiting the scope of the directive.
Mr Huhne, my group wishes to continue to play a constructive part in developing this directive, and I mean that very seriously. However, that will require greater flexibility on your part.
That is ultimately what will determine how we vote on this issue and I hope I can give it my approval.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we shall vote on the draft directive on prospectuses, which should make it possible for issuers to be granted a single passport for prospectuses in the European Union.
The Commission's proposal is in many respects an invaluable step forward.
However, closer examination and contact with the market participants have clearly revealed a number of problem areas in the original proposal that need amending.
Within the limitations of my speaking time I can mention just the major necessary amendments we adopted in committee.
The issuers must be given free powers of decision-making regarding which Member State's stock exchanges or markets they wish to be listed on.
There are many different types of securities for which there are no markets in some Member States.
Certain market places have considerably more experience of these types of securities.
It would therefore be better for EU issuers if in future they could, as is the case today, have their prospectus vetted by the competent authorities of the country where they are making the public offer or are admitted to trading, rather than in the Member State where they have their registered office.
Companies that wish to remain in their home country will obviously not benefit from this sort of single market and so will have no need for a securities prospectus of this kind.
I therefore support the proposal that Member States could grant the right to make an exception in the case of those companies below a certain threshold seeking a listing in only one Member State.
This would make the work of SMEs, in particular, easier, but would of course also offer them the opportunity, if they so wished, to acquire such a single market prospectus, thereby enjoying the advantages of the single market.
Translation costs have been a considerable problem and must be reduced to make it easier for companies to be listed abroad.
Securities prospectuses are usually very long and contain a lot of detail.
It is quite enough that the registration document should be drafted in the language that is customary in that sphere of finance and that just the Summary Note should be translated into the language of the host Member State.
This is a clearer solution than the Commission's original proposal and will benefit both issuers and investors.
The Commission's proposed mandatory annual 'shelf registration' system is also problematic.
The system would enable companies which repeatedly return to the markets in several countries to raise capital without having to update the entire prospectus.
This is of course a positive move.
The approach is not appropriate, however, in the very common cases where finance is being sought just on one occasion or at intervals greater than one year.
I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, and my other colleagues on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent and constructive cooperation. We achieved broad and balanced consensus regarding the necessary amendments.
I hope that we can remain in agreement in tomorrow's vote. Any deviation from the line of compromise achieved by the Committee would considerably hamper the creation of financial markets in the European Union.
Madam President, I would first like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal on the prospectus that it initially forwarded to us.
I think we can improve the text but I am afraid that Parliament will ruin it if it supports the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I hope that the vote tomorrow will enable us to make the necessary adjustments.
We are all in favour of the unification of the financial markets.
It is essential if we wish to fulfil the objectives that we set ourselves in Lisbon.
However, let us not forget what happened across the Atlantic.
How can we fail to mention an affair that is still being talked about even now, the Enron affair, and fail to see that the lack of transparency and the lack of credibility of financial information were also among the reasons for this situation?
Neither can we fail to mention the number of start-ups that collapse day after day, even though almost as many are launched every day?
We need a financial market that is open, accessible to all, mature, transparent, safe and sound, with no distortion of competition and with protection for all, which means access to cheap financial services for companies but also protection of savers, which means all savers, including small-time savers.
In order to do that, I think that there are two fundamental principles that we need to restore in the text that we have received from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
First of all, we need a simple rule regarding the authority responsible for monitoring the prospectus, which is the rule of the country where the issuer has its headquarters.
That is the basic rule in the whole structure of the internal market. Let us maintain it, we need it.
We need a competent authority with a clearly defined role, with no possibility for delegation.
These are three key elements as far as the regulatory authority is concerned.
As far as the scope of application of the directive is concerned, there is the issue of SMEs.
We need just as much information on SMEs as we do on large companies.
It may be possible to make allowances by only requiring information from them on a yearly basis, but otherwise it is out of the question to exclude SMEs from the scope of the directive, as that would compromise the virtues of the European passport.
Madam President, regarding conglomerates I would like to support a number of the amendments adopted in committee.
The Commission proposal needs significant revision.
In particular, the provisions on material holdings are unduly harsh and would unduly restrict banks and insurance companies in investing in a range of equities.
That is particularly important in the context of insurance companies investing their pension funds money.
This House has made it very clear that it wishes that investors be given access to a wide range of different equities.
These provisions, as drafted, would make it almost impossible for an insurance company or bank to invest pension funds money in other financial institutions because of the harshness of the deductions.
I hope, therefore, that the compromises proposed in Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48 will be adopted.
I am not sure we have exactly the right answer yet, but it is clear that the material holdings provisions need to be altered.
As regards Article 14 I hope that the Council and Commission will progress the discussions.
I know they are having to streamline the administrative process related to conglomerates with third-country parents.
As regards prospectuses Parliament should follow the example set by the committee.
The Commission's proposal applies a "one size fits all" framework designed for large equity issues to the diverse range of European financial markets.
Parliament should amend the proposal in order to reflect the diversity of those markets.
Shelf registration should be optional and not compulsory.
Just because they use it in the American regulatory system, that does not mean we should adopt it here.
As recent events have shown only too clearly, the American regulatory system is not always a good one.
We should exempt smaller businesses from part of the proposals, as proposed by the committee, and it is especially important that we recognise that there are particular concerns related to smaller businesses, particularly those which are only raising capital and doing business in one part of the European Union.
We should retain the current regulatory framework for the professional bond markets.
Where there are very sophisticated markets - indeed one of the most successfully integrated markets in the European Union - it makes no sense to apply protections designed for retail investors in equities.
We need issuer choice, otherwise we will have the same problems we have had with the existing prospectus directive.
That is essential if we are truly going to integrate the market for capital raising.
On market abuse the Commission's proposal has severe problems.
I congratulate Mr Goebbels for tackling a number of them.
I still have a number of concerns about the directive.
There are significant problems with a directive that penalises wholly unintentional conduct, and I hope the Commission and Council will accept the safe harbours put forward by Mr Goebbels in the compromises, which are based on a safe harbour for acceptable market practice.
This is particularly important in the context of derivatives, where the scope of the definition of inside information would make it very difficult to hedge ordinary liabilities, relating for example to an interruption to supply or new research revealing details of potential new supplies.
If such information is instantly disclosable as "inside information" it would make hedging impossible and the derivatives markets would grind to a halt.
I would also urge the Commission, Council and Parliament to look seriously at the amendments we have proposed on that.
It is vital to recognise Chinese Walls where the proposal is being switched from a law which can be applied only to individuals to a law which can be applied to companies.
It is very important that we encourage firms to take care to restrict the flow of inside information if at all possible, and I am very grateful to the rapporteur for responding to the concerns that I have expressed on this.
Chinese Walls can be useful if they are enforced properly.
We should encourage firms to use them and enforce them properly.
Finally, it is vital that we have proper protection for freedom of speech and for journalists.
Hence there need to be some radical changes to the proposals where they relate to the reporting of financial information by journalists.
The lack of momentum at the Barcelona Summit has been very frustrating.
In my view, we are proving in the European Parliament today that we have indeed made progress, and I believe the Commissioner will be pleased about that.
I wish to focus on the report by Mr Lipietz.
I would also like to congratulate him on his report on financial conglomerates.
This is something in which we, in the Netherlands, have a great deal of experience.
But, I should like to make a few general observations in particular.
We, in the Netherlands, have been struggling for some time with the issue of supervising dynamic developments within the market at both cross-border and cross-sector level.
The problem is how to tailor this supervision to these dynamic developments.
For the time being, the Financial Services Action Plan has settled for the approach of streamlining the rules of the different supervisory authorities in the Member States as much as possible, and working towards a level playing field within the markets on that basis.
In this pragmatic approach, it is appropriate to leave it up to the Member States to decide on how they will organise their supervisory structure.
I see this very much as an interim solution which also has some drawbacks.
However, it is important in my view to focus on the future solution, future supervision, which will need to take place at European level.
This structure will need to become more efficient, more transparent and less decentralised in order to be truly effective.
It is impossible to regulate everything down to the last detail.
In the Netherlands, we have a great deal of experience with an approach whereby the supervisory authority has a reasonable amount of discretionary power. However, this approach will cause problems if it has to be approved cross-border for other Member States, to cater for the large quantity of existing authorities.
I therefore believe that we will have to hold a debate after all, about a strong, European supervisor, and we will also need to find out how we will distribute this task, and whether this will indeed be done at sector level.
In my view, this comes too late, but we may ask whether we still nevertheless need to draw a functional distinction between supervision of conduct and prudential supervision.
The role of the European Central Bank should also be considered in my view.
I understand that in these circles, more thought is now also being given to a possible role in supervision.
By way of conclusion, I should therefore like to propose that both the Commission and the European Parliament take initiatives for such a far-reaching discussion.
Madam President, the regulation of the stock market must be able to reconcile two objectives: firstly, to give European companies more opportunities to obtain money more cheaply, and secondly, to protect the investor.
I believe that this reconciliation has been achieved in the report on market abuse and also thanks to several compromise amendments in the Directive regulating the audit or control of financial conglomerates.
Unfortunately, there are three attacks on the principle of legal protection in Mr Huhne's report: firstly, an attack on the definition of the public offer; secondly, an attack on the choice of the authority designated to approve prospectuses; and thirdly, an attack on the obligation to inform small and medium-sized companies.
I will deal with each issue in turn.
With regard to the definition of the public offer, the rapporteur proposes that this information should be provided to the investor at the final stage, immediately before the contract is signed.
In my opinion, this information must be available and made public from the moment that money is requested from the investor and it is clear that my formula, which is in line with that of the Commission, does not exclude this investigation from analysing investment possibilities with professional investors.
Secondly, with regard to the proposed free election of the supervisory authority, I, who in a former reincarnation was a tax inspector, do not feel it would be a good idea for contributors to elect their tax inspector, nor does it seem a good idea for the financial institutions to elect the ultimate supervisory body.
I believe that the formula proposed by the Commission is more coherent and gives greater respect to the previous Directives, and shows a greater degree of common sense - that it is the national authority which has the best knowledge of the applicable national law, of which it should inform the investor - and that, above all, it presents the least risks, because the absolute freedom formula, in my opinion, opens up a competition, a race between the supervisory authorities to make things too easy and attract investors who would be a threat to legal certainty.
I cannot agree with the rapporteur on the last point with regard to the exclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises, even more so when we bear in mind that small and medium-sized enterprises have a capital of ESP 350 million, which would mean the exclusion of 80% of companies quoted on the stock exchange.
I am sorry that I am not able to finish; I will conclude this dialogue with Mr Huhne, now by letter and I hope, later on, orally.
Madam President, this is a joint debate on three subjects.
I should like to start with the report prepared by Mr Lipietz.
I begin by commending him on that excellent report.
He has mastered a proposal which is both technically complex and economically important.
I can therefore accept the following amendments without reservation: Amendments Nos 2, 3, 7 to 10; Amendment No 9 as corrected by Amendment No 50; Nos 18 to 30, 35, 36, 40 and 42.
These are welcome reinforcements and real clarifications of the proposal.
In the same way there are a number of amendments which I can accept in spirit.
They go a long way in the right direction but need some refinement to avoid confusion or possible contradiction.
Amendment No 6 could be improved by combining the elements in Amendment No 9 to give a good set of macro-economic criteria to determine which groups are covered by the directive.
Amendment No 17 clarifies how to cover special group structures.
That is also a welcome clarification but the wording could be tightened up.
Amendment No 31 requires the Commission to consult industry.
I agree.
But the amendment seems to us to be too limited.
It restricts consultation to a handful of Brussels federations.
The Commission is in favour of as wide and as representative a consultation as possible.
I think that Parliament would also consider that necessary.
Amendments Nos 32 to 34, 44, 46 and 48 seek to amend what should be deducted from capital to prevent the so-called double-gearing of capital and artificially inflate a company's capital base.
I agree with the spirit of those amendments.
The 20% threshold for insurance deductions appears to be a good compromise.
The proposed wording just needs some improvement to ensure the overall coherence of the text.
But Amendments Nos 43, 45 and 47, which completely contradict Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48, are then not acceptable.
There are only a few amendments which I am unfortunately unable to accept.
Firstly, amendments that significantly narrow the scope of the directive: namely Amendments Nos 4, 5, 11, 12 and 49.
They will limit the measures to groups with a parent/subsidiary relationship only.
That does not reflect reality.
There are groups that are organised on a different basis which would then escape supervision, for example, horizontal cooperatives or mutual groups such as Rabo Bank in the Netherlands or the DG Bank in Germany.
These amendments also exclude anyone with close links to a conglomerate.
After the Spanish BANESTO case we all know how important it is to include such cases in our supervision, in particular for intra-group transactions.
A second group of amendments which I unfortunately cannot support concern the calculation of capital adequacy.
They are Amendments Nos 15, 16, 37 and 39.
I can accept moving the substance from the annex to the articles of the directive but I cannot support the additional substantive changes on the definition of capital.
They would fundamentally undermine the capital standards for our industry.
Firstly, the English text of Amendment No 16 changes one word in the original proposal and consequently opens the door to acceptance of all types of capital to cover risks, irrespective of the quality of that capital.
I understand that this is a typing error - these things sometimes happen - but I should like confirmation that the French and German texts, which leave the original text unchanged, are the correct text.
Secondly, I cannot accept including minority interests in group capital - that is, the last sentence of Amendment No 15 - if all the risks in the group are not also covered.
The third group of amendments which I cannot support are those that give our financial groups the freedom to choose the way in which they calculate their capital adequacy.
This concerns Amendments Nos 1, 13, 14, 38 and 51.
That is the role and responsibility of our public authorities.
They cannot abdicate this to the industry through self-regulation, and I agree that the authorities should discuss and agree with each group how its capital adequacy should be calculated.
I am sure that we can work out an acceptable compromise, but I ask for your understanding if I say that these amendments go too far.
In conclusion on this point, this is a most welcome and supportive report.
I should like to underline that.
With a few exceptions which I have mentioned, it really contributes to a rapid agreement and I am confident that it will be possible to work out acceptable compromises on the following amendments: Nos 1, 4, 5, 11 to 16, 37 to 39, 49 and 51.
Progress is being made in the Council and agreement between the institutions appears quite close.
On the second issue, which is the report prepared by Mr Goebbels, may I begin by saying that very good progress has been made on this dossier.
First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, very much indeed for all the efforts he has made while working under heavy pressure, as we all do, incidentally.
It is a very complex and sensitive dossier and I should like to applaud the fact that the rapporteur has resolutely defended the aim of this directive, namely to enhance substantially the integrity of European financial markets.
I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Monetary Affairs for their readiness to proceed as quickly as possible.
I know we all agree that the European Union has no truck with greedy financial cheats.
We want stable, transparent, integrated and efficient European markets for all consumers and investors.
This directive must contribute to increasing investor protection and to making European financial markets surer and more attractive in future.
It must dispel the international concerns expressed over the last few years about insider dealing and manipulation on European markets.
I am certain all Members are aware that recent events have shown how important those issues are.
It is not only the attacks of 11 September that have proven the necessity of high market protection.
Scandals such as the Enron business, which has been referred to at various times tonight, clearly show the need for rules making markets safer and ensuring that they remain free of abuse and fraud.
The smooth functioning of financial markets and public confidence in them are the conditions for sustained economic growth and wealth.
Market abuse increases the costs for financing companies, harms market integrity and dissuades investors.
We must do everything to stamp it out.
With this directive, we ensure high market integrity, and establish common standards against market abuse throughout Europe, making European financial markets more attractive in future.
The Commission can agree with all the amendments that Mr Goebbels has proposed in his report, except those additionally proposed by Mrs Echerer, Amendments Nos 75 and 76, by Mr Lehne, Amendments Nos 88 and 89, and by Mr Herzog, Amendment No 87.
But the Commission still has doubts about Amendment No 2 regarding comitology.
Firstly, this amendment is not necessary, given that the Commission has already accepted Amendment No 1, which makes a clear reference to the declaration of President Prodi at the last part-session of this Parliament on 5 February and to my letter of 2 October 2001 to the chairperson of the Committee on Economic Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath.
Furthermore, during the debate on the report by Lord Inglewood concerning international accounting standards last Monday, I once again underlined our full commitment to this important declaration regarding the implementation of financial services legislation.
Secondly, the amendment does not reflect all the elements that have been agreed between our institutions, and there are some differences between the wording of the declaration of President Prodi and the wording of Amendment No 2 which might result in misinterpretations.
Furthermore - and this is an important point - I would say to Mr Goebbels that I am not certain whether the different wordings would be agreed by the Council.
I cannot speak on behalf of the Council, but it may well entail difficulties which we would be well advised to avoid.
The Commission would prefer, therefore, to stick to what has previously been agreed.
Let me state unequivocally that the Commission will fully respect - and to the letter - the commitments it has made in its declaration in plenary, as well as in my own letter to Mrs Randzio-Plath.
Should plenary adopt the amendments adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, together with some of the additional amendments proposed for today's sitting, I very much hope that the Council will be able to accept this text as well, so we would have only one reading.
That would be a major achievement for the integration of European financial markets by the year 2005 to which we all aspire, as well as a sign of confidence for the Barcelona European Council.
I hope that all Members present here and those voting tomorrow will agree and adopt that directive.
Lastly, we come to the report prepared by Mr Huhne concerning the directive on prospectuses.
May I again begin by thanking Mr Huhne for his report.
Many amendments have been proposed and they result in clarification of our proposal.
Good work has been done to improve the wording on eurobonds, which we broadly support.
We can accept 46 amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 7 to 9, 13, 18, 19, 22 to 26, 29, 30, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44 to 56, 58 to 61, 63, 64, 66 to 72 and 75, but we may have to redraft some of them to ensure the overall coherence of the text.
I am worried, however, by some points which Parliament may adopt.
Firstly, I am concerned that, in the aftermath of Enron, Parliament may even weaken the fundamentals of current EU legislation, i.e. legislation which is now in force, namely, that companies wanting to raise capital among the public have to disclose information in a prospectus approved by the competent authority.
That is what Amendment No 35 is about.
Is this Parliament really prepared to support an amendment to the effect that more than 75% of all companies listed in Europe should be able to raise capital without publishing a prospectus?
Mrs BerÃšs made that same point a little while ago.
That would mean that for some EU markets all but one or two companies would be exempted.
How do we explain that to European investors?
For the Commission, the prospectus proposal has two aims: to facilitate fundraising for European issuers, and to ensure an adequate level of investor protection.
Both these aims are equally important.
Investor protection has been neglected too often in the discussion.
The second cause for worry is that some of the amendments proposed will result in more fragmentation, not less.
We must agree what is good for the EU as a whole, and we do not want any tinkering with national systems.
Let me be clear on this point, and let me be clear to this House, that my colleagues and I will spare no effort to reach an agreement with Parliament on this crucial text for a single capital market, but we must resolve those problems.
Let me now briefly address possible solutions to some of the most important political issues.
On small and medium-sized enterprises the Commission is against their total exemption from the proposal, but it is willing to find a cost-effective solution that would ensure that SMEs should have access to capital markets at the right price and under the right levels of regulation with the necessary investor protection.
We have always advocated adapting the disclosure rules to the specific nature of SMEs and we would be ready to contemplate an exemption for SMEs from the obligation annually to update the prospectus, as proposed by Amendment No 71.
As regards eurobonds we agree with the rapporteur's idea to exempt eurobonds with a high minimum denomination but we consider that the level proposed - EUR 50,000 - is too low.
We therefore support Amendments Nos 66 and 67, as it seems to the Commission that good work has been done here.
As regards the annual updating of the prospectus, we might contemplate exempting SMEs but we shall certainly stay firm as regards big companies, not least because 300 of our largest companies listed in the United States already comply with this obligation.
Our investors should have the same disclosure as United States investors.
I am certain we all agree that our investors are not inferior to the American ones.
Lastly, regarding the competent authority, we want to retain our position of one administrative authority per Member State.
We are ready to clarify that a delegation of powers is possible provided that the ultimate responsibility remains with the single administrative competent authority.
We do not agree with the free choice of the regulator which might lead to the famous "race to the bottom", but we would be ready to consider some flexibility for issuers of debt securities and those working out of third countries.
To sum up, the Commission rejects 29 amendments.
They are Amendments Nos 2, 5, 6, 10 to 12, 14 to 17, 20, 21, 27, 28, 31 to 37, 40, 42, 57, 62, 65, 73, 74 and 76.
Regarding Amendment No 10, we accept the amendments on comitology because they reflect our agreement on that matter, but we consider that Amendment No 10 is redundant.
The situation is the same as for Amendment No 2, on the report by Mr Goebbels, so I do not have to repeat the whole argument.
We consider Amendment No 10 to be redundant given Amendment No 1, which refers to the resolution of Parliament and my letter to Mrs Randzio-Plath.
Thank you, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
The next item is a joint debate on two reports by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs:
A5-0061/2002 by Mr PÃ©rez Royo on the effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments within the Community (COM(2001) 400 - C5-0402/2001 - 2001/0164(CNS)).
A5-0048/2002 by Mr Della Vedova on tax policy in the European Union - Priorities for the years ahead (COM(2001) 260 - C5-0597/2001 - 2001/2248(COS)).
Madam President, so that we can gauge the importance of this debate, I should like to start by reminding you of the remote origins of this proposal for a directive; the Directive on the liberalisation of capital movements of 24 June 1988.
The authors of this directive were aware of the opportunities arising for the evasion of national capital gains tax as a result of this liberalisation, by investing in a country other than the investor's country of residence; to summarise this situation, we can say that the risk was, and continues to be, that each Member State, each member of the single market that was being set up at that time and is now up and running, would act as a tax haven for the other Member States.
This risk, as I said, was highlighted by the authors of the Directive on the liberalisation of capital movements, who called on the Commission and the Council to legislate on this matter, the fiscal aspect of the liberalisation of capital movements, within one year, that is to say, in 1989.
The Commission, and the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Scrivener, presented its proposal on time, but this proposal, basically consisting of the introduction of a deduction at source - withholding tax - for payments to residents in other Member States, was not accepted by the Council and was rejected, and became a sort of abortive legislation.
In 1997, the Commission made a new proposal, within the so-called Monti package, based on the coexistence model, on which Parliament was able to draw up a report, but at the end of the day this did not receive unanimous support from the Council either.
The next step in this process is the Santa MarÃ­a de Feira Agreement, in which the European Council - that is to say the Heads of State and Government - taking a proposal from the Ecofin Council, reached a political agreement in principle on the basis of the points I will now explain.
Firstly, the Member States would be committed to setting up a system for information exchange with regard to the payment of interest to a resident of another Member State, that is to say, this would involve the lifting of banking secrecy.
Secondly, and as an exceptional and transitional system, it has been stated that certain States, Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg to be precise, should apply, in place of this information exchange - in other words, instead of the lifting of banking secrecy - a system for deduction at source.
Finally, the implementation of the whole of this legal framework was dependent and still is dependent on negotiations with third countries, such as Switzerland, the United States and Andorra, for the application of equivalent measures, and the application of the same measures by the Member States in territories dependent on those Member States, such as the Channel Islands.
Our opinion on the proposal for a Directive applying these Feira guidelines is entirely positive.
We believe, in general terms, that this is in line with the approach taken by the OECD, which is, at this time, the most active forum for discussion in this field.
The main problem with this scheme, and I will conclude on this note, Madam President - and this cannot escape anyone's attention - are the negotiations with third countries.
In other words, the problem is how to get Switzerland to lift its banking secrecy.
However, at the risk of appearing to be a naive optimist, I should like to remind you that everything in life is subject to change and that not even Swiss banking secrecy is what it once was.
I should specifically like to draw your attention to the following fact; the United States has been able, by means of an internal regulation, to implement a regulation, the so-called Qualified Intermediary Agreement, by virtue of which the Swiss banks and those from other countries are obliged to communicate to the Internal Revenue Service profits made by an American client - a US person - from assets which are also American, to lift banking secrecy with regard to these payments or even to apply a deduction at source of 30%.
Nobody can escape the fact that this regulation can be avoided simply by investing in non-American assets.
Recognising that the cases are not precisely the same, with regard to the fight against terrorism, in this case we also find ourselves up against the limitations of the unilateral approach in the fight against improper practices, in this case tax evasion at international level.
For this reason, I must emphasise the positive contribution a joint action by the European Union and the United States could make in this area.
We believe that this should be the path to follow in negotiations with the United States and with other countries.
We have faith - and on this note I shall end, Madam President - in the Commission's ability, and that they will know how to provide the impetus for these negotiations, which will provide a solution to this problem of the taxation of savings, which, to tell the truth, should have been resolved some time ago.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my fellow members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who, especially during the debate and then with countless amendments, have helped to improve this report and, I believe, to finalise a text which I hope will please both the Committee and this House.
The report gives a generally favourable verdict on two Commission communications: one on fiscal policy strategies, and one on a strategy for a consolidated tax base for Europe-wide companies. The verdict is generally favourable as regards the identification of their general objectives and the instruments that can be used to achieve them.
The first part of the report stresses that the constant growth of the tax burden over the last twenty years - something that has only slowed down slightly and has not stopped completely in the last couple of years - may well be one of the reasons for the poor growth in the European Union.
By stressing that a certain level of tax competition might be inevitable and might help to reduce tax pressure, the Commission communications appropriately recognise that it has a useful role in the context of rules preventing improper conduct.
The report takes up the principle of tax competition and emphasises it, pointing out that it is compatible - as the experience of recent years has shown - with constant coordination of fiscal regulations aimed at eliminating barriers to the internal market.
Tax competition is compatible with the completion of the internal market, which does not imply the absolute levelling-out of competitive conditions, and tax competition is just one of the many variables that determine the competitive regime within each country and between different countries.
Tax competition, as has been pointed out by the Nobel prize-winner, Robert Mundell, one of the recognised fathers of the single currency, does not run counter even to the introduction of the euro.
Moreover, in connection with tax competition, it should be reiterated that in reality there is no sign of any 'race to the bottom', that fall in tax revenue that many often dread, fearing that there might be a shortfall in the resources needed by the State.
We have seen that, in a situation of tax competition, taxation has in fact continued to grow in the European Union over the last couple of decades.
We are concerned about the tax burden on work - and the report bears this out; but there is no proof and it is not rational to think that this might be a consequence of a reduction in the tax burden on capital: there is no sign of this in the data we have before us.
I shall now pass on to other points, Mr President, Commissioner.
As regards VAT, the report stresses the need to set up a system that applies in full the country-of-origin principle - prioritising the definitive system - on which the Commission documents are, in our view, still evasive.
This objective is specified but the timescales and procedures for introducing the country-of-origin regime are not given.
The report welcomes certain suggestions for improving the current system, but the introduction of a definitive system is called for.
As regards excise duties, particularly on alcohol and tobacco, the report reiterates Parliament's position as already expressed in the Katiforis report.
Then in relation to environmental protection, not only is the 'polluter pays' principle recognised, but also the fact that taxation is not the only way of implementing this principle.
As regards energy taxation, I must stress that, in actual fact, the current competitive distortions and asymmetries in the energy market make it inappropriate now, at least, to propose tax harmonisation for energy products.
On the subject of direct taxes, Commissioner, the report hopes that progress towards full implementation of the measures contained in the tax package will be completed as soon as possible and, in particular, that any rules discriminating between residents and non-residents, which leave loopholes for fraud and are incompatible with the single market, will be removed.
With regard to the strategy for introducing a consolidated tax base for the Europe-wide activities of companies, the report welcomes the Commission's decision and proposes the adoption of the Home State Taxation principle, at least temporarily, pending the introduction of the consolidated base. It confirms that determining the rates and levels of taxation should be left to the individual countries.
In conclusion, as regards the legal instruments to use, I welcome the effort to introduce soft legislation and therefore self-regulation by the Member States.
Lastly, I should like to highlight the principle of Parliamentary codecision in taxation matters and the change to qualified-majority voting for administrative aspects, but not for the definition of rates and the tax base.
As the rapporteur, I support the two amendments.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr PÃ©rez Royo is to be welcomed for the balanced approach and technical competence employed in its preparation.
A subject like the taxation of savings certainly ought to be dealt with in such a manner because the field is so sensitive.
The Commission and the Council have considered at least three hypothetical paths to take in their time, often changing their minds and their strategies.
They are: a withholding tax, the exchange of information, and both possibilities together.
In the end, they opted for the exchange of information and, after a heated debate in the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, this was limited to natural persons.
As shadow rapporteur I fought for the exclusion of legal persons from the directive, because a business, whatever form of company status it may have, is obliged to draw up a balance sheet and have it approved.
As soon as investments in savings products appear on it, the income they generate must consequently be indicated in the accounts.
Therefore, extending the communication requirement to legal persons would be not only superfluous but certainly counterproductive, since it would overburden the communication in a manner that is surely avoidable.
The problem of third countries also needs to be addressed.
Should any of them fail to accept the mechanism, it would undermine the whole directive because, if at the time of implementation the conditions in the Member States and third countries were not uniform, it would be highly feasible for substantial amounts of savings to be transferred in real time.
The conclusions of the Feira European Council unequivocally state that sufficient reassurances must be obtained from third countries regarding these or equivalent measures so that the adoption and implementation of the directive may be decided upon no later than 31 December 2002, by unanimity.
Another important aspect concerns the Member States that are not subject to the communication requirement for a period of seven years: Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg.
These States, however, as laid down in Amendment No 14 to Article 10 paragraph 1, will be required at the end of the transitional period to fully participate in the automatic exchange of information.
In the way the directive has been drawn up, all attempts to maintain anonymity have been blocked.
It will also be necessary to make it work smoothly and fluently, keeping a watchful eye open for any laundering of dirty money.
Without this opportunity to launder money, national and international terrorism will find it hard to survive.
From this perspective, my Amendment No 6 to Article 3 paragraph 2 (b) also seeks to establish the full personal identity of all contractual relations made prior to the directive as soon as they show any kind of activity.
In this regard, it would be desirable to have a European personal data centre to check all major movements of money that may have - or are just suspected of having - connections with international terrorism.
Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr PÃ©rez Royo, very warmly for his report, which makes it very clear what progress still needs to be made in this field.
I would also like to thank Mr Della Vedova very sincerely for his well-balanced proposal.
We all know what a difficult area EU tax coordination is.
Virtually no one is talking about tax harmonisation any more.
At the same time, we also know that tax competition can have very harmful effects on Europe's economies and on the choice of locations for investment in the European Union.
I would specifically like to thank Mr Della Vedova for having highlighted the issue of codecision by the European Parliament again in his role as rapporteur, since I believe that in the context of treaty reform and the discussions on a European constitution we also need to consider where the boundaries of national sovereignty lie when it comes to taxation policy.
So we also need to adopt new approaches in order to define where it is in the general interest to set cornerstones for tax policy.
I therefore believe that the Convention would be well advised to tackle this subject as well and to call for treaty reforms providing for a move away from the unanimity rule and towards the majority rule in EU tax policy.
We are of course still a very long way from that, if we look at this really excellent paper and the very pragmatic but at the same time very accurate paper by the Commission.
The Commission has quite rightly taken stock in a rather sobering way as regards coordination.
The situation on value added tax is certainly disappointing, because we are still a long way from applying the country of origin principle.
The pragmatic approach adopted by the Commission should therefore be supported, even if we should never lose sight of our ultimate goal.
However, it is hard to reconcile various other areas of tax coordination with a forward-looking approach.
I believe that in the case of company taxation we are still a long way from achieving what the Monti Package was at one point attempting to do.
In any case, we need to make sure that tax havens are finally abolished and that favourable tax treatment for non-resident legal or natural persons, which distort competition, is finally eliminated.
That should be our objective, together with the minimum requirement for uniform definitions in tax law, ranging from the basis of assessment to definitions of profit.
I would very much welcome it if we in the European Parliament could agree on a single set of definitions for these arrangements.
That would certainly encourage national governments to take a more progressive line.
In my one minute's speaking time, I shall confine myself to the PÃ©rez Royo report on the taxation of savings.
I am pleased that the rapporteur has adopted the amendment I have tabled in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which states that this directive shall be subject to agreement to be reached between the European Union and a number of third countries which have the same duty of notification.
This is indeed the thrust of the conclusions which the European Council had reached in Feira.
In fact, negotiations in this respect are already under way.
It is good therefore that this condition is expressly included in the text of the directive which, so far, strangely enough, had not been the case.
In my view, an agreement of this kind involving a number of third countries and so-called independent territories is of great importance in order to guarantee the equal treatment of savings both inside and outside the European Union, to rule out tax avoidance and to prevent considerable flight of capital.
I do regret, however, that no amendments have been taken into consideration with regard to the application of the directive to legal entities.
This would preclude the placing of significant savings of individuals into the accounts of companies, with the intention of evading this directive, an act which cannot be condoned.
Madam President, I am only going to discuss the PÃ©rez Royo report, and I wish to say that I am far from happy with the compromise reached in Feira on the taxation of savings.
The proposal for a directive that the Commission submitted to us is meant to be cast into a legislative text.
The result is a compromise.
The proposal is therefore no longer the result of the right of initiative that is reserved for the Commission.
If the Commission is happy to act as the clerk that draws up the Council's legislation, it could at least have submitted a draft to us that complied better with the legal requirements that we have the right to expect from a legislative text.
I am therefore grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary affairs for having adopted the majority of my amendments, which I tabled with the aim of ensuring a minimum level of legal security.
Our Socialist rapporteur had tried to radicalise this proposal for a directive by moving away from the Feira agreement.
In particular he wanted to extend the scope to legal persons and to propose the taxation without distinction of all investment funds.
Fortunately these ideas were not taken up.
I obviously regret the fact that in Feira, the coexistence model was abandoned.
I remain convinced that the automatic exchange of information between Member States on interest payments is a means and not an essential condition for ensuring effective taxation of cross-border interest payments.
Withholding tax is, in my opinion, just as valid a solution.
It would also be a model that could be adopted by the third countries that are our competitors and with which we need to have reached an agreement in order for them to introduce genuinely equivalent measures before the Directive is applied in the European Union.
Clearly, if Switzerland, for example, rejects the exchange of information due to its legitimate commitment to banking secrecy, there can be no question of my country, for example, which clearly declared its support at Feira for the exchange of information, implementing it.
I am convinced that the exchange of information will not be the solution that is ultimately chosen.
The most effective and least bureaucratic solution would be full withholding tax, which, with a reasonable rate, could even become an own resource of the European Union.
Madam President, unlike Mrs Lulling, I do believe this proposal to be a valid one.
Surely it is the case that whoever wants to practise good governance should not only draft appropriate laws, but should also ensure that these are complied with.
And if we notice that Member States are unable to do this, then we should help them where we can.
Incidentally, in Belgium, we are all too familiar with this.
We have had monetary union with Luxembourg for years, and it has effectively encouraged cross border payment transactions aimed at avoiding tax on moveable goods.
The citizens are all too keen to forget that they have to declare the income derived from moveables from another country to the tax administration of their own country.
It can therefore do no harm to give them a helping hand.
Ultimately, this can help prevent tax erosion and allows for a more naturally functioning internal market.
It has always appeared judicious to me to set matters straight in this area, primarily within the internal market, and without necessarily making it subject to agreements with third countries.
However, if I have understood the conclusions of Feira correctly, this is a stipulation which the Council does want to put in place.
When I read the Commission proposal, it once again fails to state this in the text which normally should reflect the agreement of Feira.
This is why I should like to ask the Commissioner once more what, in his opinion, are the advantages and disadvantages of including this stipulation, and I should also like to ask him if he could once again inform us of the current state of affairs in the negotiations involving third countries.
Parliament would be interested to know whether these are promising, when they are likely to be concluded and how we should couple the timing of the implementation of this proposal with the results of these negotiations.
Madam President, I should also like to thank Mr Della Vedova for his report on the Commission's communications, on our general tax policy and on company taxation in the internal market.
I should also like to thank Mr PÃ©rez Royo for his report on the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings.
I should like to begin with the report of Mr Della Vedova, which I very much welcome.
It may help if I recall briefly the Commission's motivation for producing these two communications.
Individual Member States retain, quite correctly, responsibility for many aspects of national tax policy.
But there is an ongoing demand for an EU tax policy in many areas.
A key question is: what degree of harmonisation is appropriate?
A high degree of harmonisation is necessary, it seems to the Commission, in the field of indirect taxes.
Such taxes can create an immediate obstacle to the free movement of goods and the free supply of services within the internal market.
Indeed a certain degree of harmonisation in that area has already taken place.
I am very conscious that this Parliament has had its differences with the Commission on the issue of rates of excise duty on tobacco and alcohol - an issue dear to the heart of Mrs Lulling.
It is clear, however, that the existing wide rate divergences between Member States constitute a strong incentive for both fraudulent transactions and legitimate cross-border shopping which lead both to distortion of competition and diversion of trade.
I am therefore of the opinion that the permanent solution for these problems requires enhanced approximation of rates to a level at which the above effects no longer occur or are brought back to a sustainable level.
On the other hand, there is no need to harmonise personal income taxes unless they entail discrimination or double taxation.
But there is an intermediate zone of direct taxation of mobile tax bases - in particular the taxation of companies and capital - where the situation is less clear-cut and which may have direct effects on the internal market.
The so-called tax package, of which the directive on savings taxation is an important element, seeks to address the potential erosion of tax revenues and eliminate harmful tax competition.
But to achieve a balance in European tax policy, attention should also be paid to the concerns of taxpayers, both individuals and companies.
That means addressing obstacles that hinder the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty.
This is where our communication devoted to company taxation comes in.
In that communication we review the tax obstacles faced by companies who operate cross-border in the European Union.
We have identified a significant number of those obstacles, which, we must all agree is astonishing, given the fact that it is nearly 10 years since the internal market was established.
We have also identified potential solutions.
We have examined a number of possible solutions to this problem in the form of both targeted and comprehensive approaches.
The latter would, in the longer term, provide companies with a consolidated, corporate tax base for their EU-wide activities.
Naturally I am extremely grateful for the support given to this principle by Mr Della Vedova in his report.
In pursuing the various objectives I have just outlined in relation to taxation at EU level, the Commission will need to employ a variety of methods, including non-legislative mechanisms.
Again, I am very grateful for the unqualified support for this policy in Mr Della Vedova's report.
I now turn to the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings.
Firstly, I am pleased to note that a substantial number of the proposed amendments correspond to changes agreed by of the ECOFIN Council in the draft directive approved on 13 December 2001, for the purpose of negotiations with third countries.
The large measure of agreement between the Council and Parliament on the text of the proposal cannot but strengthen the Community's negotiating position in the discussion with third countries.
The Commission takes the view that the amendments agreed by the Council on 13 December improve and clarify the legal texts, but that they do not substantially change the proposal for a directive.
The Commission therefore considers that these amendments do not justify presenting a revised proposal for a directive given the particular time constraints that we are operating under.
A number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs related to the negotiations with third countries and Member States' dependent and associated territories, and more particularly to Parliament's role in these discussions.
Parliament may rest assured that I intend to keep Parliament fully informed of these negotiations and that I have no intention whatsoever of undermining Parliament's prerogatives.
I fully share the view expressed by Mr PÃ©rez Royo that this proposal has an important international dimension.
This is exactly why the Commission asked for and obtained authorisation from the Council to enter into negotiations with the six third countries mentioned in the Faro European Council conclusions.
They are: the United States, Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino.
The aim of these negotiations is to secure the adoption of measures equivalent to the system applied within the Community.
At the same time, Member States are committed to promoting the adoption of the same measures by their own dependent and associated territories.
The discussions with third countries and dependent territories should hopefully be finalised before the summer.
I must emphasise that the Faro Agreement provides that these negotiations with third countries and dependent and associated territories should precede the adoption of the directive.
The Commission cannot therefore accept amendments that would make the application of the directive, once adopted, dependent on the outcome of such negotiations.
There is a risk that such amendments might undermine our negotiating position vis-Ã -vis the third countries who quite rightly want to be sure that Member States will implement the directive if they agree to apply equivalent measures.
On the particular point raised by Mrs Thyssen, the discussions with third countries should precede adoption of the directive.
Those agreements are a political condition for adoption of the directive.
Therefore we have to live with that.
In closing, I once again thank Parliament for its support for the proposed directive on taxational savings.
I assure Parliament that I shall keep it informed of developments to the best of my abilities.
Thank you, Mr Bolkestein.
Mrs Lulling has the floor on a point of order.
I think that Mrs Lulling has misunderstood me.
I only referred to the people of my own country.
I certainly did not attack or ill use anyone in Luxembourg, or at least I hope not.
And although I am, of course, no longer a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I did fulfil this role for 10 years.
Since I was shadow rapporteur for my group during a previous round - dealing with the second proposal by the Commission on this subject - I did follow this issue to some extent, Mrs Lulling.
But I certainly had no intention of offending anyone in Luxembourg or anything of the sort.
I do not think I did; but if I did, my apologies. I would advise Mrs Lulling to read my text carefully, and she will conclude that there is no problem whatsoever.
Thank you, Mrs Thyssen.
I think it would be a good idea if the honourable Members were to talk to each other afterwards.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
The next item is a report (A5-0409/2001) by Mr Carnero GonzÃ les, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the legal personality of the European Union [2001/2021(INI)].
Madam President, at this late hour, anyone can make a mistake.
If a market research institute were to ask people if they thought the European Union had its own personality, I think that the majority would say yes.
