The point of departure of every exercise should be cooperation that respects separate identities.
More equitable governance of the joint service must also be guaranteed.
In view of this, it would be advisable to set up a working committee which would address this matter and which would examine the impact of the opinions issued by these two committees and of other work carried out by them.
In 2007 we should have fewer problems with regard to assistance to Members and the Visitors Programme.
I feel we have achieved tangible progress as regards these two services and that its impact should be felt in 2007 and 2008.
It should, however, be stated that the information given to Members about the services available should be more effective.
Next year we expect an upgrade in the institutional structure in order to achieve a greater degree of streamlining, as well as a more determined implementation of the redeployment policy, which I believe will have a positive impact over the next few years.
On the other hand, multilingualism has been disappointing.
In this regard, we reiterate our support for the initiative taken by the Parliamentary Bureau to establish a good practice guide, which should include sanctions and penalties.
Good management of this useful, though expensive, service next year should be on the agenda of all the institutions.
Mr President there is not enough time to speak about other priorities that have been addressed in this budget, such as the information policy, where we expect to observe further progress in 2007, and the acquisition of property - especially property held jointly with the Commission - in relation to which we expect a great deal of improvement, as well as information science, security, training, the simplification of legislation and so many other issues.
It should be pointed out that, during the planning and development phases of this budget, we felt the need to maintain contact with all the institutions.
The last budget level obtained during the first reading was a result of this process.
In fact, during the conciliation process with the Council and the Commission, the parliamentary representatives did their utmost to find a balanced formula, and we are assuming that all parties, including the Council, will honour the agreements reached during these meetings.
The primary aim of these trialogues and reconciliation meetings would otherwise be lost.
We could not accept a situation in which procedures no longer made sense or, worse still, were counterproductive for this Parliament.
In these circumstances I feel that the Committee on Budgets should address these questions urgently over the next few months.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is a great day for this House.
For all of two years, we have been working together on the Financial Regulation, and have, most recently, been cooperating outstandingly well with the Commission in this.
This House has made it clear to all the importance that we attach to the legislative process associated with the Financial Regulation; what we were aiming for was better budgeting, the correction of the 2002 reform's excesses, and the taking on board of justified criticisms of highly bureaucratic procedures and laborious ways of getting things done, and in that we have succeeded, with the help of the Members who sit on the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, primarily my good friend Mr Pahor, the members of our working party, the secretariats and my personal assistant, to all of whom I extend the warmest of thanks.
The Budget DG, under Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ, has also played its part in a most felicitous and sympathetic way, so warm thanks go to them as well.
The Council, too, started off by playing the game, only then to suffer a failure of nerve; that was actually a shame, since that is no way to treat friends, so let us hope that they do not do the same with the implementing regulations.
The improvement of monitoring quality in the Member States is a recurrent issue in this Europe of ours, and it calls for more commitment on the part of the Council; perhaps Mrs Wideroos, the minister, will be so good as to affirm that the Council accepts the result from conciliation with this House achieved on 21 November, for if she does not, this House will not be voting on the 2007 Budget on Thursday.
Having negligently and wilfully interfered in the interinstitutional balance, the Finnish Presidency of the Council leaves a truly bitter taste in this House's collective mouth, and has denied itself the great success of its presidency that the achievement of real de-bureaucratisation in Europe - mainly on the basis of our amendments - would have represented, but we are very grateful that the Council has been supportive of this and has moved it forward, particularly in relation to the need for more customer-friendly administration, for more transparency, for improved monitoring to protect European funds and for a database listing those criminals who, having acted to the EU's detriment, are excluded from receiving EU funds for a period of ten years, all of which are milestones on the road to better management of EU funds, and in which you - like us - can in fact take pride.
We will give these things tangible form in the implementing regulations and make them usable; in doing this, we are guided by the Financial Regulation and by the need for these quite new items to be dealt with one by one.
What I need to clarify is that the enactment of the implementing regulations is a matter for the Commission alone; Parliament and the Council can do no more than be consulted.
We see it as unacceptable that the Commission should be as readily put under pressure as you have tried to do over recent days, for by doing so you will end up curtailing this House's right to be consulted, and it is only because the monitoring of EU funds, the recovery of them and the enforcement of uniform transparency requirements are a problem that we have tabled amendments in relation to them to the Financial Regulation.
I urge the representatives of the Member States to once and for all come up with some answers to these problems, instead of imitating the three monkeys in hearing nothing, saying nothing, and seeing nothing.
This House will not be denied its right to voice an opinion when what we are trying to do is to play a constructive role in the handling of the EU's money.
We have learned our lesson from the past and wish to forge an alliance with all those who want to show that they have learned it too.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be here in Parliament discussing the 2007 budget, in a situation where the template for a very lengthy drafting process is clearly apparent.
I am relieved that the budgetary authorities have reached agreement on the budget for 2007.
That is the job of the Council and Parliament.
I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their cooperation over the last six months.
There has been more open dialogue among the budgetary authorities than before, and that makes it possible for us to reconcile our varying views more easily.
My special thanks go to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lewandowski, and to the rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech.
That said, I think that it is only right that I should assess the package from the point of view of the Council.
The increase in the 2007 budget matches the objectives of the Member States fairly well and does not place too great a burden on the taxpayer.
Fortunately, the Council and Parliament reached agreement on a realistic figure for payment appropriations.
Strict budgetary discipline has therefore now been included as a key principle.
This should continue to be the approach in the years to come.
Overall it has been a significant achievement to adopt the amendment to the Financial Regulation in a situation where there are ever-growing pressures on making financial administration more efficient.
In connection with the Financial Regulation, I might say that the Council this morning began a written procedure.
That way this Council Regulation can be passed this Wednesday, that is to say 13 December, after Parliament has delivered its opinion on it.
Regarding that, I would have liked to hear the Commission's commitment to the letter sent yesterday by the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Budget on the topic of the rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation.
On behalf of the Council, I wish to thank Parliament for allowing both budgetary powers to decide jointly now on pilot projects.
The Council will act responsibly in the years to come.
Similarly, compliance with the new interinstitutional agreement, especially with regard to the appropriations for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, is to be applauded.
The budgetary powers are showing a sense of responsibility and realism in not using the Flexible Instrument in 2007.
This will provide a firm basis for budgetary practice in future years.
Budgets need to be drafted within the context of frameworks.
The budget for 2007 contains clear priorities.
The promotion of competitiveness, the introduction and monitoring of posts in association with enlargement, and the commencement of new generation programmes are practical examples of these.
This budget process also, however, contains some worrying prospects for the future.
We did not make sufficient progress in making administration more efficient.
The Commission and Parliament cannot ignore their responsibility for making the Union's administration more efficient.
If people in the Member States feel strongly about cuts in the number of posts, why are not the same measures, with nobody suffering personally, approved at Union level?
This is a matter of the credibility of the work of the EU as a whole from the public's point of view, and that means the budget, which the citizens of the Member States are responsible for financing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that the Council and Parliament should have finalised this package adopted jointly within the framework of this budget process.
I want to say again that I am glad that the budget approved for 2007 will contain adequate margins in almost all categories.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, today we are finalising our work and debates on the 2007 budget.
This is very important for all of us because it is the first budget for the 'new Europe' of 27 Member States.
It is the budget of a new financial framework; it is the budget of new Financial Regulation; it is the budget of a new financial legislative package, which we agreed to start fully from 1 January.
So that means that this budget is not only a budget about figures, it is a budget of many things that we have achieved this year together with Parliament and the Council.
In our negotiations today's budget required a huge effort from all sides and huge efforts of compromise.
The result was achieved when we met on 21 November in conciliation and finalised in a week.
For this package, the Commission always keeps its word and never changes the opinions reached in the conciliation negotiations.
I would like to thank the whole team that negotiated on Parliament's side, as well as their staff, for helping us to find the solution, and all Members, especially the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets, for helping us to achieve this package.
I am talking not only about the package for the 2007 budget, but also the Financial Regulation package.
I also want to thank the rapporteur who is not here now, Mr Pittella, who also helped us go through the 2006 budget implementation.
I would like to say that today the discussion is very important as a final stage for Thursday's vote and I am very grateful to all who made this day happen.
I wish you a good debate and a very fruitful and positive vote on the 2007 budget on Thursday.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (SL) Although I only have one brief minute at my disposal, I cannot but express my sincere admiration for the contribution made to the debate on the budget by Mrs GrÃ€Ãle.
Why?
There are, in my opinion, at least three major problems with the European budget.
In the light of the Lisbon Strategy, the budget is: firstly, badly structured; secondly, too small; and thirdly, of too little practical effect.
Mrs GrÃ€Ãle's contribution has done away with at least one of these problems, this being the third one, namely its minimal effectiveness.
The reform proposed by this report will make financial procedures less bureaucratic, more easily comprehensible, simpler and, above all, user-friendly.
For these reasons, Mrs GrÃ€Ãle deserves a great deal of gratitude for her contribution.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, firstly I wish to thank both rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, for their excellent work and levels of cooperation.
With regard to Mr Elles, I would just like to say in brief that I am especially pleased with his 'value for money' idea.
It will also be an extremely important tool in the years to come and will help us when we are drafting the budget.
With regard to Louis Grech, I want to say that his levels of cooperation were excellent and that we finally agreed on all the main budget lines.
I would just like to raise one issue, which concerns the report that we asked the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee for.
There is no intention here to criticise them, but they must not ignore this 'value for money' notion.
We will then see what the report brings when it eventually comes along.
What is particularly important about this package for the budget as a whole is that we can adopt the Financial Regulation which Ingeborg GrÃ€ssle has worked so well to promote.
It is really like she said: the prevention of criminal use of funds, transparency, and many other good things will ensue if this Financial Regulation can be jointly approved.
It will be a major step forward in the decisions on this year's budget.
Minister LehtomÃ€ki, as has been mentioned here, this process has perhaps been somewhat confusing in Parliament.
It is important now to find consensus so that the budget can be signed on Thursday.
This proposal regarding staff cuts, however, was unrealistic.
I myself always think it is advisable to question institutions and bureaucracy and what everyone is doing.
The idea was not bad, but perhaps the proposal that Finland made was just too general in nature.
The main thing, however, is that there have been good levels of cooperation and the budget will be signed on Thursday.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, Mrs Wideroos, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to say a big thank you to all of those involved in this budgetary procedure and, in particular, to our rapporteurs, Mr Grech and Mr Elles, without forgetting Mrs GrÃ€Ãle and Mr Pittella, and our secretariats.
Thanks to them, we have been able to establish a budget that fully respects Parliament's budgetary powers.
This draft budget on the financial perspective is particularly sensitive.
We have taken account of the time needed to launch the new programmes, while prioritising what are crucial actions for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament: policies on research, transport, innovation, social Europe, an environmental and knowledge-based Europe - in short, a People's Europe.
The budgetary instrument of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund puts in place a new instrument of European solidarity.
As regards external affairs, we are following the guidelines of the specialised committees, which respect the balance between the thematic approach and the geographical approach.
We hoped, thanks to the new financial perspective, to succeed in establishing better interinstitutional relations, and I will not hide from you my disappointment on this matter.
Even our relations with the Council are deteriorating.
Firstly, Mrs Wideroos, you have just reassured us about the commitments made by the Council regarding the conciliation procedure: indeed, we value this agreement on the financial regulation.
However, you have often lost sight of Parliament's powers, and we have often had the impression that our rights were not being respected.
Moreover, we take a very dim view of the contempt with which the new Member States are treated; you intended to deprive them of resources in terms of recruitment and structural policies.
We have therefore faced difficulties, before coming up with an appropriate programme for 2007.
Commissioner, Parliament puts all of the resources that you requested at your disposal: reasonable commitment appropriations, a low level of payments - 0.99% of GNI - which you nonetheless regard as sufficient, and, above all, very few reserves.
In return, we will watch over matters very closely to ensure that our vote is not distorted during implementation.
Let me be clear: the global transfer votes or the SABs, which are as important now as they were in the past, are excluded.
We will not stand in the way of the Commission's exercising its prerogatives.
Instead, we should reconsider whether the resources, in terms of staff, are adequate for the implementation of the policies we are seeking to promote.
In future, if we reduce the budget too much, we will no longer be able to develop any of these policies that the citizens expect.
Disrupted, as it is, in its project, the Union is a seriously ailing body, and we are providing it with a particularly modest budget for 2007!
For the forthcoming budgets, we need to adopt a constructive approach, which looks to the future, and no longer a defensive stance, aimed at containing national self-interest.
For Parliament, for the Socialists, the European project consists of genuine, financial solidarity, which the Council sadly overlooks on a daily basis.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, this budget process has been essentially uncomplicated.
It is less than a year since we reached agreement on the budget for the next seven years, and the budget on which we will be voting on Thursday sticks within the agreed framework beautifully.
Through this budget agreement we have achieved sound results.
We have ensured a Financial Regulation with less bureaucracy, with more transparency about who receives agricultural aid and with a common blacklist of those companies that have fiddled EU funds.
We have ensured a budget that fulfils our political desires within the framework drawn up.
The 2007 budget is the first within the new seven-year framework and it is characterised by the fact that many new programmes for, for example, structural funds, research and training and education are to get under way.
This is the first budget where actual agricultural aid amounts to less than appropriations for the development of poor regions.
Agricultural aid accounts for approximately one third of the nearly EUR 126 billion of the budget.
Most of the 2007 budget is thus being spent on ensuring growth and solidarity within the EU.
We have secured more resources for the Common Refugee Policy and for foreign policy and ensured more transparency in relation to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
As regards administration, Parliament was more willing to grant the necessary resources than the Council was, but we do, of course, agree that the administration of the EU needs to be flexible, more efficient and tailored to meet new needs.
I find it regrettable that we still have not had any statement from the Council and the Commission making it possible to remove the reserve on the appropriation for the development of rural districts.
It must be stressed that voluntary modulation must not impinge on Parliament's budgetary powers.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Elles, Mr Grech, Mr Pittella and Mrs GrÃ€Ãle for the substantial, constructive and serious work they have done - work that, I believe, has been topped off with positive results.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, having heard the Commission and the Council, I am delighted that an agreement is in prospect.
I would remind you that Parliament is prepared to increase funding for the CFSP from EUR 102 million to EUR 159 million, but it is prepared to do so because the Council accepts its amendments - at least a large part of them - on the financial regulation.
This is an overall package that must not be undone at the last minute!
As far as the financial perspective is concerned, you know that our group voted against, because it felt that the framework was too tight: we are going to do our best now to make changes to it.
Among the changes is support for studies on the added value of the programmes, but we, for our part, are already looking ahead to the thorough review announced for 2008 and 2009.
Make no mistake - for us, doing better does not mean doing less!
There is no question of our freeing ourselves of our obligations: that is why we declare ourselves in favour of doing away with the reserves.
As regards the financial regulation, we also agree on the need to simplify the procedures, so that everyone can get more involved in the European project, and we believe that we can simplify the procedures while maintaining their transparency and control with a great deal of rigour: both seem possible to us.
Finally, our group has presented an alternative package of increases for the external policy programmes because we believe that the instrument for stability, which includes a section on prevention, has suffered too much from the reductions imposed in the financial perspective.
We must be careful not to focus our attention only on issues that are under the full glare of the media spotlight!
It is true that the Middle East is very much affected at present but, in the Balkans, the fire is still smouldering ...
I shall conclude by thanking the four musketeers from the Committee on Budgets -Mr Elles, Mr Grech, Mrs GrÃ€Ãle and Mr Pittella - without whom nothing would have been possible.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister LehtomÃ€ki, next year's budget is less than 1% of combined GDP.
The majority in our group are dissatisfied with this figure and with the fact that the Council does not want to build a more social Europe.
Instead, it wants to militarise the EU and is proposing more expenditure for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
In negotiations on the budget, Parliament agreed to increase this militarisation expenditure when the Council agreed to compromise on the wording of the new Financial Regulation.
The Finnish Presidency showed a lack of skill in the conciliation process and harmony over the budget was only achieved after further talks.
Hopefully, Parliament will not have to witness another failure on the part of the Presidency, as the outcome of conciliation has not yet been approved by the Council with regard to the Financial Regulation.
It has remained unclear as to whether it will be approved.
Given these circumstances, it would suit our group very well if Parliament were to use its budgetary powers and cut militarisation expenditure, which the Council has set as a priority area.
There are special circumstances prevailing next year.
It is the first year of the new financial framework and not all the structural or other programmes are yet ready.
The new Member States might not be ready either to utilise all the funds that have been allocated to them.
If the low level of budgetary expenditure is approved, it will not be acceptable if again the Commission fails to spend EUR seven billion, as was the case this year.
We hope for an improved implementation of the budget, Commission.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, taking the floor in the debate on the 2007 budget on behalf of the UEN Group, I would like to remind you that this budget is an extremely important financial plan for the European Union for at least two reasons.
First of all, it is the first budget of the Financial Perspective for the years 2007-2013, which is especially important to the new Member States.
Secondly, it is the first budget of an enlarged European Union, a Union of the 27 Member States.
These two facts alone mean that the level of spending proposed in the budget should be as high as possible.
The European Parliament has proved itself up to the task and has proposed spending of 122 billion euros, in other words 1.04 of the GNP of the European Union.
Unfortunately, despite long negotiations with the Commission and the Council, the latter agreed to a figure of only 115.5 billion, that is, 0.99 of the GNP of the European Union.
In this way the wishes of the wealthiest Member States, the so-called 'one per cent club, have been fulfilled.
This Group did not want budget spending to exceed 1% of the GNP of the European Union.
Fortunately, the unavoidable financial cuts resulting from the Council lowering the level of spending have only affected the new Member States to a limited extent.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my hope that the solution proposed by the European Parliament which involves moving 30% of the funding for many budget lines, 400 million euros in total, will significantly contribute to rationalising budgetary spending.
The European Parliament's agreement to return the funding for the Common Foreign and Security Policy to a level of nearly 160 million euros should mean that the Council and Commission will, more than they have so far, take into account the suggestions of Parliament regarding the direction and implementation of foreign policy.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, there is a copious stream of exhortations from various EU institutions to the Member States about how important it is for them to reduce their public expenditure.
At the same time, this House constantly demands increased expenditure at EU level.
The whole thing is absurd.
The Member States spend public money on schools, health care, research, infrastructure and support for vulnerable groups in society, while most of the EU's expenditure goes on a lunatic agricultural policy, misdirected Structural Funds and the financing of EU institutions that should have been closed down a long time ago.
The Member States' expenditure is subject to continuous democratic scrutiny.
Officials who are guilty of inefficiency, negligence, fraud or corruption are not granted discharge and are in many cases dismissed.
Politicians who are not as honest and effective as voters demand are replaced in democratic elections.
The EU's expenditure is scrutinised by the Court of Auditors, which has still not, however, been able to issue a clean auditor's report.
When OLAF uncovers crimes, these do not go to court.
Essentially, this House grants discharge irrespective of what emerges about the way in which the EU's budget resources are used, and politicians never lose elections in their own countries because they have mismanaged EU funds.
In brief, the Member States have some effective democratic control over the way in which taxpayers' money is used, while the EU institutions and this House have not.
(SK) It is generally true that what is approved by democratic agreement with a large majority of votes tends to be good.
I assume that this premise will also apply after the voting next Thursday on the European Union's general budget for 2007.
In this context I would like to congratulate in advance the rapporteurs and the entire team, which has been negotiating the budget.
On the other hand, the budget parameters suggest that there are continuing problems.
The gap between commitments and payment allocations, as well as, the relationship between the available funds and envisaged spending is still too great.
This suggests that the arrangements for the draw-down and use of funds leave much room for improvement and, paradoxically, this is particularly true of countries that require the most development funding.
This also applies to the new EU Member States, where actual drawdowns are now ranging between 20% - 30%.
As countries report that the funding available to them fully matches approved projects, it would appear that the basic problem at the moment is the implementation of those projects and the payment of their costs.
The governments of EU Member States hold the key instruments necessary for dealing with the situation.
Unless a turnaround is achieved, they will limit their potential for economic development and the aims of the long-term financial framework will remain nothing more than scraps of paper.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for allowing me to take the floor, despite my absence at the start of the debate.
I should like to thank the Commissioner and my fellow Members, Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Jensen, for their words of appreciation to me, as well as Mr Elles and Mr Grech, for the positive way in which they carried out this budget procedure.
With this amending budget, we are giving the Member States back more than EUR 7 billion.
This amount is partly due to the inclusion in the budget of a substantial increase in estimated revenue, and is partly attributable to a high level of under-utilisation of the appropriations voted on and available in the budget, in particular EUR 4 billion.
This under-utilisation mainly affects the expenditure headings for agriculture, the structural funds and the pre-accession strategy.
We wanted to incorporate this debate in the one on the general budget precisely because the return of EUR 7 billion is not a trivial matter, but one that ought to worry us.
There are two aspects to the problem: on the one hand, the Member States constantly undervalue revenue, and this distorts people's ideas about the percentage of wealth set aside by the Member States for Europe - in the light of these data and of the previous amending budgets, it is in fact quite clear that the amount of resources set aside by the Member States for the European purse is still less than the 1% prized out of the miserly national accountants.
It is like me agreeing to allocate 1% of EUR 100 each year to a good cause and then, in fact, invariably earning more at the end of the year.
Therefore, even you will admit that this operation by the Member States is not as generous as it appears.
On the other hand, even the resources that are actually available are not being fully used: if we analyse the typology of the under-utilised resources, we realise that the ones responsible for the under-utilisation are always the Member States, and not the Commission.
I am not particularly generous towards Mr Barroso's Commission but, in fairness, I must say that, where this issue is concerned, there is no direct responsibility on the part of the Commission, but rather that the main burden of responsibility lies with the Member States.
We must take the opportunity afforded by this debate to encourage the Member States to be more effective in their monitoring and their controls and to be more vigilant so that allocated and appropriated funds are properly utilised.
Thus, instead of limiting ourselves to what is, by now, the tiresome exercise of blaming the European bureaucratic machine - the so-called Brussels eurocracy - let us also take a little look at our national situations, because if we more closely analyse the way in which our national public apparatus works, and if we call on the governments to work together in improving their administrative performance, then we might not have this figure of a EUR 7 billion return next year.
(ES) Mr President, I have been taking part in budgetary debates for twelve years and I have never seen a President of Parliament withdraw the microphone from the main rapporteur.
I believe that your manner of presiding in this case has been rather unfortunate.
I would like to congratulate the four rapporteurs on their reports and on the consensuses that they have achieved under particularly difficult conditions.
My political group placed particular emphasis on the quality of spending - value for money - and on the parallel negotiation of a review of the Financial Regulation.
In both cases we hope for a satisfactory resolution following the vote on Thursday.
At a time of great budgetary restriction, with budgets of around 1%, the only way this Parliament can improve the efficiency of Community policies is to set up an in-depth assessment of the resources applied and the results achieved.
I believe that this 'value for money' approach will be widely applied in the future.
As a complement to this approach, we have the review of the Financial Regulation, which we need in order to increase the spending discipline of the Member States and of the Commission itself.
With regard to payments, I must point out that this is a budget that has been very cheap for the Council and that may be insufficient for the European Union, but it is the case that in the years to come Parliament will be much more demanding in terms of obtaining a sufficient level of payments to meet our commitments.
I shall end by considering what the President-in-Office of the Council has said about the effectiveness and the responsibilities of each of the institutions: we are demonstrating them.
We are a particularly responsible institution and therefore from the outset we have supported the posts in the Commission and we have rejected the Presidency's approach.
I also regret having to chair this debate under these restrictive conditions.
Let me state that, should there be time at the end of the debate, Mr Elles may ask to take the floor again.
I am aware that I made my interruption at the end of the speech and do not think Mr Elles had anything else of substance to say.
(DE) Mr President, before I deliver my speech, I would just like to say to Mr Garriga Polledo that I, too, can look back on 12 years of budget debates in this House and in those 12 years I have never before seen a rapporteur on the Budget, once his own speech was over, simply get up and not listen to what the Members of this House had to say.
In the course of a Budget procedure, the European Parliament, being an assembly of politically thinking heads, engages in a certain number of internal debates, but, when it came to the subject of agencies, there were no differences between the various groups; we agreed that cooperation with the agencies had been improved over the last three years, although that does not mean that the good cannot be made better.
It is for that reason that we gave the agencies some homework to do before they could make use of all the money allocated to them.
They have to send us their work programme with a list of tasks and information as to what has changed since the previous year and why.
They are also required to implement the personnel policy guidelines already agreed to.
Such are the tasks for the agencies, which they are able to deal with themselves.
Others, too, however, need to take action, the Commission for a start, whose function is to promptly - and I emphasise 'promptly' - coordinate their personnel plans and put them before us, but also those of us who sit on the specialised committees, who are called upon to evaluate the work of each individual agency by reference to the work programmes, and that has to be done in pretty short order too if the agencies are not to be penalised for something for which they are not responsible, so please let there be no cliquery, and when I say 'prompt', I mean that everything has to be sorted out in the first quarter of the following year.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister LehtomÃ€ki, firstly I would like to thank the general rapporteurs, James Elles and Louis Grech, for a job well done.
Next year's budget shows budgetary discipline; its expenditure levels are less than 1% of GDP and clearly below the financial perspectives.
This year the debate was overshadowed by certain difficulties with the Council.
There was no great difference of opinion on budgetary expenditure.
It was not so much about money as procedure.
The Council reopened the debate on the agreed details a couple of times.
At the moment, the decision on the new Financial Regulation is still open.
At one time it was agreed on to the letter, but the Council has not as yet confirmed it.
The written procedure to adopt it that has begun will salvage the situation tomorrow.
It is important that the Council should do all it can to allow Parliament to approve next year's budget in its negotiated format on Thursday.
(DE) Mr President, I can go along entirely with what Mr Virrankoski has just said, in that I see the Budget Regulation as a really important matter, and would also like to reiterate my thanks to the Finnish Presidency of the Council for having picked up a really live issue by at least proposing that we might take a look at what posts might be saved in the Brussels institutions by reason of the changes this European Union of ours has undergone.
Your inability to get this through is a lamentable sign of just how resistant to change everything here is, but you are passing on the baton to the German Presidency of the Council, and so one can indeed hope that it may be enabled to make headway against the red tape that it has announced its intention of doing something about - 'red tape' being understood to mean bureaucracy, unnecessary regulations and the difficulty of getting one's hands on grants - while at the same time reducing the numbers of civil servants.
That would be a way of saving a lot of money, and would also do something to restore the credibility of the institutions.
(PL) Mr President, last year, when we were concluding the annual procedure, we were uncertain about the fate of the multiannual Financial Perspective.
This year, some uncertainty has re-emerged as to whether all the elements of our agreement with the Council will be fulfilled.
Of course, I am referring here to the financial regulations and would like to clearly state, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets and in the presence of the Minister, that we need a guarantee and that the approval of the budget next Thursday is conditional on receiving this guarantee.
In 2007 we will have a new generation of multiannual European programmes for the twenty-seven Member States and this budget will have a number of specific characteristics.
The first is the importance given to financial regulations, which are supposed to be more 'user-friendly' and, at the same time, more transparent.
The second characteristic involves the exploitation of ever richer sources of information on the use of particular budget lines in order to ensure better planning and achieve what James Ellis calls 'value for money' in the future.
The third feature involves the careful planning of spending over the next year, bearing in mind possible delays.
Fourthly, there is an effort to achieve greater democratic control within the scope of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, whilst still respecting the specific nature of this field.
In fifth place, there is a move to end the argument regarding employment in the Commission.
Having been provided with additional information, we agree to free up the reserves for Commission salaries, but still insist on a staff review.
We expect that this will facilitate the recruitment of staff from new Member States in particular.
These are the main points of the strategy for 2007.
I sincerely hope for a successful conclusion to this procedure, which will end the uncertainty regarding the financial regulations.
I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteurs, the coordinators of the political groups and the Secretariat.
I would like to thank Mrs GrybauskaitÃ© for her cooperation with the Commission which, in our view, has been better than it was last year, and I would also like to thank Minister Wideroos.
I am sure that a successful end to this procedure on Thursday will compensate for certain understandable tensions.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs on their work.
Despite this effort, however, it cannot be said that Parliament has achieved much as a result of this year's budgetary procedure.
I deplore the fact that the Council has shown a worrying lack of respect for the views of Parliament throughout.
We are the only democratically elected institution tasked with promoting the views of EU citizens, so I wonder whether the Council will even bother to respect its commitment to the agreement finally reached with the secondary budgetary arm.
I sincerely hope so.
I would like very briefly to make a few comments, not just in respect of the 2007 budget, but also bearing in mind the 2008 review.
First, our key ambition for the EU budget is that it must focus on priorities that deliver on the objectives set by us and our leaders.
So it is with regret that I note that, although there has been some increase in the programmes, such as the Seventh Framework Research Programme, it is nowhere near the amount requested by the Commission and Parliament.
This is an extremely important policy area with a direct impact on the way the EU develops its global economy and how we are seen by the rest of the world.
The Council knows this and has very vociferously tried to push the need for an increase in R[amp]D spending. However, we are still at 1.5%.
It really is time for the Council to put their money where their mouth is.
Secondly, if the EU is to be taken seriously as a global player, it must back up its position with the funding necessary to play its role - for example in Asia, which is the largest and most populous continent, with 60% of the global population in some of the world's poorest countries.
Therefore, the continuing trend of reducing resources to that region is a disastrous policy.
(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say just a few words about the key points of the 2007 Budget, which will be the first under the new Financial Perspective.
I think we have to very seriously ask ourselves whether it makes sense to first, through a laborious and bureaucratic process, extract money from the pockets of citizens and businesses, expend a lot of bureaucratic effort on transporting it to Brussels and then expend even more of the same on distributing it among the Member States.
This is where a great opportunity was missed by reason of the curtailment of the Financial Perspective and the failure to reformulate a plethora of legal bases, so that practically all the multiannual programmes had to be adopted afresh.
In particular, Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ, I can only urge the Commission to seize the initiative for 2008 and 2009, when we will have to give some thought to the preparatory work for the next Financial Perspective.
The second key point I would like to mention is that the Commission is delegating more and more of its functions to agencies and to executive agencies.
I look forward to the day when the Commission will submit proposals indicating its willingness to take staff back.
We have just completed the biggest round of enlargement in the European Union's history; by 1 January 2007, twelve new Member States will have joined it.
Since many of the tasks it used to perform have been handed over to agencies, the Commission needs fewer staff, and I am waiting for it to produce very definite proposals as to how it is going to make Europe less bureaucratic, something that is not accomplished by what Commissioner Verheugen is doing, namely looking at laws, but by making cuts in personnel so that red tape is not generated in the first place.
I would like to close on a self-critical note with a thought that we might well take away with us, namely that we ourselves need to give rather more thought to our own strategy too.
I think it highly regrettable that we have not done this as much as might be desirable when debates in this House are in the offing.
(PT) I wish to thank Mrs GrÃ€Ãle, Mrs Grybauskaitand, of course, the Council on the success of negotiations on the new financial regulation.
Congratulations are due in particular to our rapporteur for her hard work, persistence and tenacity.
I must say, though, that in the years ahead we will have to carry out a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of this financial regulation in order to gauge the extent to which the rules contained therein may or may not be excessive and whether or not they are the cause of the abnormally large number of material errors detected every year by the Court of Auditors.
What we need is a financial regulation that naturally imposes budgetary discipline and the effective use of budgetary resources.
We cannot, however, have a regulation that causes endless errors and puts us in our current, extremely embarrassing, position as regards the discharge, with the Court of Auditors systematically refusing to approve our accounts.
I shall finish, however, by simply expressing the hope that the Commission and our rapporteur will build on the work they have done thus far.
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a firm believer in development.
In 2007 the cost of the Community budget will be less than 1% of the Community's GNP.
Is this an achievement for which we must be proud?
Some of my colleagues are.
'At least we managed to enforce budgetary discipline' they say.
I am sorry if I cannot share their feeling of high achievement that has engulfed them.
While the European Union is expanding we, at the same time, limit our community budget, which does not make us more financially disciplined but less visible in the eyes of the European citizens.
I do not wish to be misunderstood, I believe deeply in the concept of financial discipline.
If pointless expenses are being made then we should stop them.
However, pointless expenses only exist in national budgets of Member States, not in our tiny community budget.
Nevertheless, national expenses are outside the European Parliament's jurisdiction and because we cannot make expense cuts on national budgets we are forced to make cuts on necessary expenses of our community budget.
However, we will not be taken seriously on matters of discipline and neither will we be taken seriously on matters of European integration.
How are we supposed to go to Lisbon like this?
The USA spends more than 20% of its GNP on its federal budget. We spend less than 1%!
How are we supposed to compete with them?
The truth is that we cannot compete with them.
A continuously shrinking European budget seriously undermines our status, our credibility and our capacity to impose any changes.
The inadequacies of the Finnish Presidency, which we all viewed in the Committee on Budgets, only made things worse.
Therefore, I fear that on a collective basis we are well below 1% of our capabilities as Europeans.
I am sorry to say this, but I think we are heading towards the wrong direction.
(SK) The 2007 budget is the first in a seven-year programming period and as such has undeniable strategic significance for the years ahead.
It is extremely important that we step into the new financial period resolutely and sensibly.
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the members of the Committee on Budgets, and all negotiators for their work in negotiating the European Union's budget for 2007.
In particular, I appreciate the support of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for the effort made by the new Member States in reducing the administrative reserve by EUR 50 million.
This issue is especially important to the new Member States.
The essence of the problem is that keeping a large financial reserve would seriously jeopardise the recruitment of new staff.
This is particularly true of the new Member States, as their quotas are far from being exhausted.
During their meetings with MEPs in the Committee on Budgets your officials, Commissioner, repeatedly drew attention to the problems that put the selection of staff for European Union institutions at risk.
Thanks to their warnings and to the united stance of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, things have moved ahead and we are now close to substantially slashing this unnecessary reserve.
The common achievement of this objective will be an excellent gesture vis-Ã -vis the new Member States of the European Union, which now include Romania and Bulgaria.
The citizens of our countries are watching closely the interplay of words and deeds within European institutions.
May I therefore urge your support for our efforts in achieving this common objective?
(FR) Madam President, at the beginning of December, NASA announced that a budget had been adopted with a view to the installation of a space station on the Moon in 2020.
We, for our part, have a draft budget in 2020 that is designed to allow a train to make the journey from Hendaye in France to IrÃºn in Spain.
Thus, the United States have a budget to go to the Moon in a rocket and we, we have a budget to cross the Pyrenees by train!
How can we explain this difference?
The United States provides itself with a budgetary policy equal to USD 2 500 billion per year, while we, we toy with a budget of EUR 122 billion.
We toy with 1 260 amendments, we toy with partnerships at international level, with Europalia, with Daphne, with Plan D - in short, we spread ourselves too thinly.
We have only two serious budgetary policies: agricultural policy and regional policy.
The remaining budgetary headings, in particular heading 3 'Citizenship', represent a communication budget, for women, young people, consumers, the unemployed, people who have been made redundant, people who have been assaulted ...
The real cause of this situation is not the lack of own resources: while there is indeed a real standstill, it is due to the ideology of balanced budgets, which prevents exceptional costs from being funded by exceptional resources, that is to say the loan, the loan intended for the major European networks, the rail network, for example.
The real budgetary debate, ladies and gentlemen, does not consist in coming out for or against a European tax in 2014, but in coming out for or against a European loan to fund the future of research, of transport, of health care and of education.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, I must now, so to speak, 'avenge' our Mr Elles, and so I am happy to accept the speaking time and would like, speaking on my behalf and his, to thank the House for its praise and its suggestions.
As regards the Financial Regulation, and the completion of reforms, I would ask that we should present every bit as united a front as we have done to date.
Mr Casaca has bidden me keep to the subject, and that I am happy to do.
There is, in fact, a homepage - set up by me - on the subject of our experience with the Financial Regulation, on which the EU institutions or their advisors can provide us with information on how things are working out with the changed Financial Regulation.
I believe that we have, for the first time with this Budget, succeeded - and this is Mr Elles' great achievement as rapporteur - in bringing planning, implementation and monitoring closer together, and these are tasks that we will have to take very seriously in future.
Before the Commissioner takes the floor, I will ask once more if there are perhaps any other questions that she might be able to help answer.
(FR) Madam President, I should simply like to say that we deplore the organisation of the debate on second reading in its current form.
Indeed, every time, the Committee on Budgets does a huge amount of work, and we find ourselves penalised by the time allotted to us to present our work and to explain the way in which we have worked and the outcome we have achieved.
It would have been extremely interesting to have seen other Members take part in this debate and to have heard the Commissioner's and, perhaps, the Council's, response.
All too often, we are overlooked when it comes to organising plenary sessions.
We note, once again, that more than ten minutes remain, which several of our fellow Members could have used in order to outline the work they have done this year.
(DE) Madam President, since the Finnish Presidency has shown that the Budget Regulation can work with the seventh research programme, I would like to ask our Commissioner to again enlarge upon the rules applicable to the Budget, which we regard as being of particular importance.
The European Union comes in for much justified criticism, and this is where we want to see really visible progress within a short period of time, so I ask that these issues be taken seriously, particularly as regards their technical aspects, for they strike us as particularly urgent in political terms.
Madam President, this is not on the substance, but may I just congratulate you on putting into practice exactly what I suggested at voting time this morning, namely, to take catch-the-eye speakers at the end of a debate.
I think we should do this for a short period at the end of every debate, but certainly when there is time available, as there is now.
That is an excellent initiative, well done!
You will be aware that that actually works only if there is a little time left over.
It is not actually possible to plan plenary debates down to the last minute.
Member of the Commission. (LT) I would like to thank all participants in the debate for today's discussions.
Truly, a very large job has been completed - all political groups and the Committee on Budgets have really worked quite intensively, so I would like to thank them too, because it was a task involving political responsibility.
Political opportunism was avoided and all the decisions were adopted with regard to the interests of Europe and all the people of Europe.
I would also like to thank my people, my Directorate, who is sitting here and who put in a lot of effort so that we could discuss this today, that is, what we are now doing.
In addition, I would like to thank the Secretariat, both the Committee on Budgets (in French COBU) as well as the Council personnel, who equally managed to see beyond their personal ambitions and overcome their errors so that in the end we could obtain the solution that we now have on the table.
Therefore, I urge you all, including Europe's budget and finance leaders who have spoken here today, to try and, as always, to impress on your colleagues in the European Parliament to vote positively and, on Thursday, to approve the budget of the new Europe, the expanded Europe of 27 countries.
That brings the joint debate to a close.
The vote on the Elles and Grech reports will take place on Thursday.
The GrÃ€Ãle and Pittella reports will be voted on tomorrow.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(HU) It seems that we have prepared the 2007 Union budget without any fierce clashes, even though in July there had been no agreement reached on financial regulation, for instance.
The budget will not work without valid regulations.
This is why Parliament will not sign it, unless the new financial regulation comes into force.
In the 2007 budget, Parliament has, in accordance with the Council, increased disbursements, in return for which expenditure will not exceed 1% of the Union's GNI.
Why did we not put up a harder fight?
A new financial framework plan will come into force in 2007, various programmes will be relaunched, which is why only a small disbursement will be required.
It has now also transpired that Member States have not used six billion euros of the total resources which were increased last year following some hard battles.
This year a new element has been introduced by Parliament in the form of a 'value for money' analysis, proving that the Union is putting the money to good use.
Unfortunately, the solidarity between Member States is decreasing from one year to the next, with contributors citing difficulties with their national budgets for this, while failing to mention the benefits they have gained from the market opening up.
We should not chip away at the budget, but what we need to do is allocate more resources where cooperation goes hand in hand with added value.
Such areas include research and development, as well as cohesion.
We can only win in the global competitive environment if we work together.
But the will of Parliament is not enough for the European Union to grow to its potential.
What we need is to have statesmen at the helm of our Member States and not politicians who only live for the moment.
Agenda: see Minutes
(The sitting was suspended at 6.25 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)
Commission Question Time
As a matter of principle, the Commission is in favour of full application of the four freedoms, including the freedom of movement of workers in the European Union.
One should remember that this freedom is one of the core principles of the Treaty of Rome.
However, the Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania, like those of the previous enlargement, lays down transitional provisions on the right to free movement of workers.
Essentially, these provisions leave it up to each current Member State to determine whether, during a transitional period, to grant Bulgarian and Romanian nationals access to their labour markets.
This is thus a prerogative of each and every Member State.
The Commission plans to send a letter to all the Member States recalling their obligations under Community law and asking Member States to provide the details of any national measures that might be introduced for the first two years that follow the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
At the same time, let me draw your attention to the Commission's report on the functioning of the transitional arrangements for the enlargement of 1 May 2004, and in particular to the finding that the arrival of workers from the accession Member States has had a beneficial effect and actually helped to reduce imbalances in national labour markets, without the newcomers largely taking the place of local jobseekers.
This applies, of course, to those Member States that have facilitated the free movement of workers.
This report also found that there have been overall positive effects on the economies of the EU 15 Member States, with workers from the new Member States contributing to a better functioning of the labour markets, to sustained economic growth and to better public finances.
It also found that restrictions on labour market access may increase the incidence of undeclared work.
The Commission believes that those findings are still valid and trusts that the Member States will consider them closely when deciding whether to introduce transitional measures applicable to Bulgaria and Romania.
We know that in the future there will be a shrinking workforce trying to support more pensioners.
In the light of that scenario, which is not that far away - in fact, much of it is upon us now - do you think that the countries which boosted their workforce by being more liberal and allowing free movement and migration have stolen a march on the other countries that have been more restrictive?
Member of the Commission. Thank you for your question.
It is perfectly possible that this might happen, but only time will tell, which is why we are constantly analysing developments in the labour markets in the EU and its Member States.
There are two basic scenarios, which may vary from one Member State to another.
Namely, a given Member State may benefit from having the possibility of receiving workers from the new Member States, owing to its demographic profile and the challenges posed by an ageing population.
At the same time, it may be that another Member State has labour market problems, and higher unemployment, and that the national government consequently decides that, given the circumstances, it would benefit from the transitional arrangements.
That is why we have decided to leave this matter to the Member States to judge, and why we have given them the option of applying the transitional measures.
The original written question from the questioner focused on the relatively minor transitional restriction that Ireland and the United Kingdom have brought in regarding the two latest Member States alone.
Do you agree, Commissioner, that it would be far more important to focus on the continued restrictions on all the new Member States that are still enforced even now by the majority of the old fifteen?
Member of the Commission. I have taken note of the decisions of the United Kingdom and Ireland.
It is without doubt a prerogative of those countries, as for any other Member State.
Prior to these decisions, I used the United Kingdom and Ireland as a benchmark when arguing the case for opening the labour markets of the other Member States to the candidate countries.
I am proud of having in my previous capacity helped the Prime Minister of the Member State I know best to draft his speech on 1 May 2004 when he declared that Member State - Finland - was likely to remove the restrictions on free movement of workers from the new Member States.
That particular Member State maintains the same liberal practice for Bulgaria and Romania.
The point is that on the basis of very reliable studies there are overall positive effects, but at the same time we want to leave it to the Member States - and we have to leave it to the Member States because that is the decision of the Council of the European Union, which is the highest decision-making body in cases of this kind in the Union.
I would just like to respond to Mr Corbett.
The interesting thing is that when you go to a restaurant or pub in the UK nowadays, the service you get is not in the Queen's English.
We Finns would find it very exciting to have 500 000 people speaking even a little bit of unusual Finnish.
I should firstly like to congratulate the Commission on its efforts in the area of free movement.
Secondly, I would like to congratulate those Member States which have opened their borders to the free movement of labour from the new Member States.
My question is simple and straightforward.
What is the Commission going to do to keep up the pressure on all the old Member States to open up to the free movement of labour, just as the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Holland and a few others have already done?
Member of the Commission. I thank Mr Martin for his question.
The aim of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 is to address the new threat to civil aviation that is posed by homemade liquid explosives.
As such, it prohibits passengers on flights departing from Community airports from taking liquids in hand luggage in individual quantities greater than 100 ml.
However, an exemption has been granted for liquids sold at airport shops and on board aircraft when certain security conditions are met, including the tamper-evident bag system.
Given that Community legislation does not apply in third countries, it is currently not possible to ensure that airports in third countries or non-Community air carriers have security requirements that are equivalent to those applied within the European Union and the European Economic Area.
Consequently, such airports and airlines cannot benefit from the exemption.
The Commission will consider whether it is possible to work with third countries to develop a means of establishing equivalence of security measures.
Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
However, I wonder whether you appreciate the anger that will be felt by many EU citizens and visitors from the rest of the world coming to the European Union this Christmas who, having brought premium Scottish whisky and other products into an airport like Frankfurt or London, from where they are going on to other airports like Edinburgh or Glasgow, discover that their duty-free goods are confiscated at that airport.
It is going to create a lot of unhappiness and a lot of dissatisfaction.
Commissioner, would you agree that we need some sort of publicity campaign in third countries to make people aware of this situation?
Secondly, will you urgently engage in discussions with international aviation organisations to see if we can arrive at a global common standard so that this problem does not arise?
Member of the Commission. Thank you for that question.
I wish to begin by underlining the fact that one cannot compromise on security.
The Commission and the Community is doing what it can to further open up the system in place with regard to the European Union, although it will probably be quite difficult to achieve significant results in the very short term, and therefore before Christmas, as this calls for negotiations with third countries in order to achieve similar positions to ours.
Regarding your point concerning the publicity campaign, the Commission has been working with the international airport and airline stakeholder organisations concerned so that they can inform their members in third countries about the new EU rules.
In addition, the Commission has assisted those stakeholders in their campaign to inform passengers by developing standardised information posters and leaflets that their members can use as part of their own information campaigns.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I know that flight safety matters are not within your direct remit, but you will probably have no trouble answering this supplementary question.
Day in and day out, we get innumerable complaints from airline passengers, and have ourselves had personal experience of all these things.
A very large number of us regard the action taken as no more than diversionary measures that do nothing to add to passengers' security, but make things considerably more difficult for them; in particular, they add up to more business for the manufacturers of toothpaste and contact lens solutions, while, in reality, doing nothing for security.
Member of the Commission. The Commission is of the view that in fact they do contribute to increased security in real terms, because, obviously, physical checks are carried out on passengers in order to determine that there are no such liquids.
Any liquids would be carried in transparent bags.
Secondly, there is also the question of perception: passengers feel that something is being done and that one would think twice before trying to take on board things which could be suspect and which would be spotted.
(DE) Madam President, I have a supplementary question which leads me on to a matter related to the original question, since whisky is made from water, and it is with water that my question has to do.
I live in a country where water is universally available, and people are not accustomed to paying high prices for it, but, if you look around European airports, the tiniest quantities of water are on sale there at incredible expense, with a small bottle of it costing between EUR 3 and EUR 4.
That is something I do not regard as acceptable, but it is a consequence of the security system that is currently in force.
What, Commissioner, is the Commission contemplating doing about this specific matter in order to protect European consumers?
Member of the Commission. According to the air passenger rights Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, airlines are not obliged to offer passengers financial compensation when stranded for long delays.
However, the regulation requires that passengers receive assistance from the airline, including food and drink and accommodation as necessary.
In addition, the Montreal Convention, the updated version of the Warsaw Convention which was transposed into Regulation (EC) No 889/2002, dealing with rules for international carrier liabilities, provides for certain rights in case of delays, from which the airline's liability is limited to 4150 Special Drawing Rights, which is approximately EUR 5000.
In this case, the passenger must demonstrate a causal link between the damages he or she has suffered and the incident provoked by the airline.
According to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, the Commission will submit to Parliament and the Council a report on the application of this regulation in the EU Member States.
A call for tenders has been launched in order to contract an external consultant to give input with regard to quantitative and qualitative data.
The study will deal in particular with issues related to delays and cancellations, as well as with the enforcement of the regulation concerned.
The Commission cannot at present prejudge whether additional measures will be proposed to improve the protection of air passengers.
The Commission will have to wait for the final results of the assessment made by the external consultants.
(DE) There are two things I would like to point out.
The compensation rules in international law, to which you refer, represent precisely the sort of compensation that we are not willing to allow our citizens to have, in that they should not have to take upon themselves the burden of major court proceedings in order to get what is rightfully theirs, and so I have to ask whether there can be changes in this area, and whether we can come to a clearer definition of the concept of 'force majeure'.
According to the airlines, an aircraft's breakdown is 'force majeure', but the fact of the matter is that the aircraft breaks down because the airlines, increasingly, use old machines on their flights.
Member of the Commission. I would like to point out that the important difference between the previous regulation and the present one which is based on the Montreal Convention is that passengers are entitled to receive direct and on-the-spot information, assistance and rerouting facilities, whereas the Montreal Convention only covers ad hoc claims to be presented in a court, as you rightly indicated, for possible damage caused because of a delay.
I will, however, pass on the remarks that you have made to Vice-President Barrot in order to see whether anything further can be done, although as I pointed out in my reply to the question, the Commission does not envisage coming up with additional measures before the final results of the assessment - which is being carried out by an external consultant - are known.
Thank you Commissioner for those remarks.
I would like to draw to your attention that yesterday evening Air France cancelled the evening flight form Gatwick to Strasbourg, quoting technical reasons, but refused support to passengers and refused to provide hotel accommodation for them.
Will the Commissioner take this opportunity to make it very clear to Air France and indeed to other airlines that current EU legislation - this legislation - applies to them and that they should not look for loopholes and try to wriggle out of it, but should respect EU legislation and support passengers when flights are cancelled, as they were yesterday.
Member of the Commission. As a general comment, Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 does not provide for any extraordinary circumstances linked to denied boarding.
If because of technical failure an airline replaces the original aircraft with a smaller type, and some of the passengers are denied boarding because not all of them can board that aircraft, and they have to stay behind at the airport, those stranded passengers have to be assisted and offered financial compensation as provided for in the regulation.
It is only for reasons of health, safety or security or inadequate travel documentation that passengers can be refused embarkation on a flight. I will also refer to Vice-President Barrot for his attention the specific comments you have made with regard to last night's events concerning Air France.
(DE) Madam President, the extreme security precautions in response to the threat of terrorism are more and more frequently the cause of extreme delays, and such security measures do, of course, also cost a great deal of money.
As these costs are currently borne by the general public, is the Commission considering transferring them, in effect, to the airlines or the passengers, or is it intended that the state, so to speak, should continue to bear these additional expenses?
Member of the Commission. You are right that security measures and additional security measures - and this links up to the previous question - have a cost.
However, one needs to underline that if we really want to tackle the question of security on board aircraft then cost considerations can only be secondary.
However, having said that, I will again pass your remarks on to Vice-President Barrot, to see whether there is scope for trying to identify possibilities of cost-sharing in this regard.
Member of the Commission. I hope I do.
In response to the question by Mr Davies as to when the Commission will introduce measures to end the discard of by-catch by fishing vessels, I should like to point out first of all that the Commission considers discarding to be a serious problem in European fisheries, and is committed to acting on this issue as a priority.
The cause of discards is that unwanted by-catch is taken in many European fisheries and then discarded.
Discarding can primarily be reduced, and eventually eliminated, by reducing unwanted by-catch.
This can be done through legal regulation or by providing incentives for the development of fishing technologies and fishing practices which produce little by-catch and therefore little discard.
In early 2007 the Commission will present a communication on reducing discards.
The instruments that will be considered in this context include selective fishing areas, closed areas, requirements to change fishing grounds when significant by-catch is encountered and the economic penalising of by-catch.
The Commission will outline the main elements of a new policy on discarding and open a debate on the implementation of that policy.
Following a debate in early 2007, the Commission will develop implementing regulations on a fishery-by-fishery basis, the first of which will be presented in 2008.
I should like to thank the Commissioner.
I met with the Fleetwood Fish Producers' Association recently.
They tell me that their inshore fishery currently produces some 70-80% discards on vessels above 10 metres.
They told me: 'he Irish Sea is full of fish, but we are murdering it by catching fish too small to breed'.
They say that if they use larger nets they are regarded as going out to catch cod and, therefore, they have to go out for fewer days, they lose income and it is a vicious circle.
Commissioner, I know that you want to do something about this.
I have talked to you about it over the years.
However, you have been a Commissioner now for more than two years and you are talking about something happening in 2008!
Are you satisfied with this rate of progress?
This is an obscenity and it must be stopped!
Member of the Commission. As in all aspects with regard to fisheries, I am certainly not satisfied.
The rate of progress is not attributable to a lack of willingness on our part, or to a lack of means to try to achieve results, or a lack of determination on the part of the Commission.
More often than not it is attributable to the fact that we have very complex fisheries in Community waters.
It is far simpler to operate a decent discard system further north, where fisheries are relatively clean, where you go to fish for mackerel and you catch virtually only mackerel.
In Community waters most of the time you target a particular species, but you have what is essentially a mixed fishery and that is much more complex to manage.
We are looking at ways and means of introducing measures which will reduce discards significantly.
This year we have tried to introduce an effort-management scheme for the Kattegat.
The North Sea Regional Advisory Council was heavily involved in this.
We had hoped that at the December Council I would be able to announce that this would start in 2007.
However, after considering the various proposals being made to operate such a scheme, the operators' representatives asked us for more time, because they realise that the impact on fisheries could be significant.
The North Sea Regional Advisory Council is of the same opinion and therefore I shall not be proposing that it starts in 2007.
I hope that during the course of next year this will materialise and that it will come with a much more general position with regard to the management of fisheries whereby discards are reduced as much as possible.
The fishermen you spoke to may be partly right, but there is also a significant element of exaggeration.
In the Commission documentation published for the upcoming Fisheries Council, reference is made to the prospect of cod fishing being brought within the framework of a 'cod bycatch fishery'.
Could the Commissioner elaborate on this, and could he define what is meant by a 'cod bycatch fishery'?
What would this mean in practice?
Will it involve a percentage limit, and will we still have the lunacy of valuable fish being discarded?
Could the Commissioner please cast some light on what is intended by the phrase 'cod bycatch fishery'?
Member of the Commission. It is somewhat premature to give details because if one starts going into detail now before discussions with the stakeholders, it could be somewhat alarmist, as always happens in fisheries.
Our intention is to heavily involve the regional advisory councils and to involve the stakeholders in how to manage fisheries in a way in which we try to tackle the cod problem effectively.
There is, as all of us know, a serious problem with regard to cod sustainability.
In most, if not all, Community waters it is in a virtually depleted state.
It is possible for it to be rescued, but we need to be inventive in this regard.
The general idea behind a cod by-catch fishery is that, for as long as cod is not recovered, you do not target cod.
Thus fishers would not target cod, but they would be allowed to land cod caught as a by-catch within certain limits.
In that way you can provide an incentive for the diversification of fisheries into other fisheries so you would not thereby be targeting cod and at the same time you would reduce the unnecessary and very costly discarding of cod.
These are initial ideas which we need to ponder further and which we need to discuss primarily with the stakeholders, to see whether there is a way forward, or whether, as in many other respects, we end up concluding that the system as it operates is giving better results in certain respects.
But I hope that we will manage to work out a system which will give much better results than those we have at the moment with regard to cod and to cod recovery in particular.
Question No 41 has been withdrawn.
Subject: Action taken by the Commission on the recommendations set out in the report on women and fishing
A number of recommendations from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality were incorporated in the report on women's networks: fishing, farming and diversification adopted by Parliament on 15 December 2005.
They included a call for action to secure better living conditions for women working in the fisheries sector and for the communities in which they live.
What steps will the Commission be taking in support of the efforts being made by such women to guarantee their social and economic rights and secure greater legal and social recognition?
Are steps to be taken to ensure full implementation of the principle of equal treatment and opportunities for women and men in relation to training and access to funding and loans, including micro-loans?
How does the Commission intend to step up direct involvement by women in representative, decision-making and advisory fisheries bodies at European, national and regional level?
Has it launched a project covering the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers?
Member of the Commission. I should like to thank the honourable Member for her question concerning the Commission's follow-up to the recommendation set out in the report on women's networks, fishing, farming and diversification adopted by Parliament on 15 December 2005.
The Commission considers the situation of women working in the fisheries sector, and in particular their legal and social recognition, to be a very important issue.
It is using all the instruments at its disposal to promote equal treatment and opportunities for women and men in the sector concerned.
As regards the four specific questions raised by the honourable Member, the Commission would like to point out the following.
Firstly, the European Fisheries Fund, which is the new structural instrument for fisheries for 2007-2013, explicitly states, in Article 4(g), that one of its objectives is to promote equality between men and women in the development of the fisheries sector and fisheries areas.
The EFF is based on the principle of partnership with all stakeholders in the fisheries sector, and this explicitly covers partnership with bodies responsible for the promotion of equality between men and women.
The EFF contains specific provisions promoting gender equality, both through better women's representation in decision-making processes and in the programmes to be implemented by Member States.
In particular, the Commission is encouraging participation by women in the various stages of implementation of the European Fisheries Fund, including the design, monitoring and evaluation of the Member States' operational programmes for the next programming period.
The Fund can also support measures aimed at promoting equal opportunities between men and women through networking and the exchange of best practices among relevant organisations.
The Commission will strive to ensure that Member States reflect these provisions and priorities in their operational programmes.
Secondly, the Commission recognises the importance of training in the fisheries sector, and education and professional training are eligible for support under the European Fisheries Fund.
Training measures are also expected to promote access to employment for women.
Moreover, under the Fund's new priority axis 4 on the sustainable development of fisheries areas, support can be granted for the diversification of activities and the promotion of alternative employment for fishermen through a large variety of measures.
Under this axis, special measures for the improvement of professional skills, work adaptability and access to employment for women can also be supported.
It should be stressed that the Commission is promoting the involvement of women in the local bodies, managing the measures supported under axis 4.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the EFF requires Member States to ensure broad and effective involvement of all relevant partners in the different stages of programming, and this includes bodies responsible for the promotion of equality between men and women.
The Fund also requires the operational programmes to contain information on how the partnership principle has been implemented, the list of the parties that have been consulted, the results of those consultations and how they have been taken into account.
The new priority axis 4 on sustainable development of fisheries areas, supported under the Fund, will be implemented through a bottom-up approach.
It will be the local players, including women's associations, that will serve as the engine for designing and implementing local development strategies.
This allows women's organisations to get involved in decision-making at the local level and ensure that their specific concerns and suggestions are taken into account in local development strategies.
Women and their representatives are also encouraged to participate in the Regional Advisory Councils, which were set up to improve the governance of the reformed common fisheries policy.
For instance, women's associations already have a seat in the North Sea RAC, which was the first RAC to be formed.
Women are also represented in the North Western Waters RAC.
Finally, in the present programming period, under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, Member States can co-finance studies and innovative projects covering the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers.
This possibility is also offered under the European Fisheries Fund, under priority axis 3 on collective actions.
The Commission has since 2003 been launching a series of calls for proposals for innovative actions in the fisheries sector.
These actions are now almost completed.
In 2005 the Commission conducted an ex-post evaluation of these actions in order to assess their impact and added value.
The results of this evaluation showed clearly that such actions do not have an added value, whereas innovative actions included in, and financed through, the operational programmes of the Member States, were more successful and better monitored.
Taking into account these conclusions, the Commission decided to integrate the implementation of those actions into the European Fisheries Fund Regulation and to support their implementation through the operational programmes of the Member States.
(ES) Commissioner, thank you for your explanations, but I would like to refer to the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers, the majority of whom are over fifty, who suffer health problems as a result of their work and who, in many cases, also lack the right to unemployment benefits, health services and safety at work.
In our report we therefore call upon the Commission to draw up a pilot project to deal with the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers.
Does the Commission agree with the implementation of this pilot project, as suggested by Parliament?
We would like to know what the Commission intends to do in relation to this issue.
Member of the Commission. I will look into the feasibility of creating such a pilot project which would be specific to shellfish gatherers and how their situation on all fronts can be improved.
I can only say at the moment that I am favourably disposed in that regard, but I need to study it further before I can give any commitment.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission agrees entirely with the honourable Member that the silver economy is a very promising area of development and should be boosted at local, national and European levels.
The silver economy is one example of how we can make the most of the fact that people are living longer.
In its recent communication 2006/571 entitled 'Demographic Future of Europe - From Challenge to Opportunity' the Commission used the silver economy as an example of the positive effects of ageing in terms of fresh economic growth opportunities.
The Commission welcomes initiatives like the Silver Economy Network of the European Regions (SEN@ER).
At the first European forum on demography, which was held recently, a politician from North Rhine Westphalia gave a presentation, in one of the workshops, of activities that Germany is pursuing in the area of the silver economy, within the framework of the SEN@ER network.
On 25 and 26 January 2007 the Commission will hold a conference on the theme of the regional response to demographic change, where a series of examples of successful regional silver economy projects that often receive support from the structural funds will be presented.
I should also like to mention that on 17 and 18 April 2007, the German Presidency, with the Commission's support, will hold an important conference in Berlin entitled 'Demographischer Wandel, Chancen erkennen, potenziale Nutzen, Wachstum fÃ¶rdern' (Demographic Change: Recognizing Opportunities - Tapping Potential - Fostering Growth) on possible synergies between ageing and the economy.
The silver economy is a new issue that, in the context of the Commission, touches upon a number of different policy areas.
The Commission has set up an internal working group to coordinate the various European policies on demographic change and in this regard the Commission will continue to work, in general, on the issue of demography, and, more specifically, on the silver economy.
This work may lead to a number of Commission initiatives, for example on the consequences of the ageing population and the opportunities provided by the silver economy.
In response to the ageing population, the Commission has also launched the key initiative i2010, which proposes a holistic approach and practical measures relating to development and to the innovative and more intense use of information and communication technologies.
This initiative will draw on all available instruments including the Seventh Framework Programme initiatives under Article 169 in the area of Ambient Assisted Living, the new programme for competitiveness and innovation in the area of the best use of information and communication technologies relating to ageing, including measures for raising awareness and political measures.
The Commission communication on this issue is expected at the start of 2007.
(NL) Madam President, whilst I should like to thank Commissioner Å pidla for his pro-active stance in this matter, the scope of the silver economy market for services and products is left a little vague at the moment.
In addition to the five instruments mentioned in the communication 'The demographic future of Europe: problem or challenge', the silver economy approach must be added as the sixth separate track.
Are you amenable to this idea?
I also have the following suggestion to make.
As you have already mentioned, on 25 and 26 February, the regions will be meeting in connection with this senior people network.
Are you prepared, on this basis, to look at what this might mean in terms of future adjustments in Parliament, for example by organising, together with this House, a hearing during the course of 2007?
Member of the Commission. (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, demographic ageing, its effects and the silver economy - in other words, complete awareness of the changes brought about by demographic ageing in both consumption and manufacturing - are such important issues that if Parliament adopts this initiative, all I can say is that I shall follow it closely and give it my full support.
As regards the search for organisational structures, I feel that at the moment we cannot yet opt for one fixed structure, but whatever happens, we will monitor the progress of the Silver Economy Network of European Regions, and we will also look at how effectively the relevant national coordination structures work.
Honourable Members, the Commission communication on demographic ageing clearly points out that demographic change is one of the most important changes facing our society; it pervades every area of society and has a cross-sectional impact.
The Commission has therefore opted for the concept of mainstreaming, that is to say, application across all policy areas, including consumer policy and consumer protection policy, as well as the economy as a whole.
(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, in the Lisbon Strategy it was already planned that competitiveness would be achieved by increasing the retirement age to 65 years.
In Germany, the retirement age has been increased to 67 years.
In the 21st century, instead of introducing new technology, we are increasing the retirement age and working time.
What, in your opinion, should be the age at which a person can retire to well-earned leisure?
Member of the Commission. (CS) The retirement age is a highly sensitive issue, and we cannot go for the easy option and simply stipulate a particular age on the basis of a decision taken at a European level - this matter falls entirely within the competence of the Member States.
I should like to emphasise the fact that this is a legitimate question and that the Commission's strategy is not to set a particular age.
The Commission's strategy, of which I am a firm advocate, is to extend people's active age and working lives.
The notion of stipulating an age at an administrative level is not especially important.
It is much more important to create the conditions under which people can continue in work for longer.
The administrative age is often set at 65, whereas, the average working life currently ends at the age of 59 in Europe.
I should also like to point out that life expectancy in good health is longer, and currently stands at an average of 62 in Europe, although this age varies greatly between different Member States.
This, too, is an issue that must be taken on board in the debate.
I should like to emphasise that the concept of an inclusive society is based on the fact that work not only has its economic aspects but is also about active involvement in society.
Scientific research has clearly shown that early retirement before a person has not made full use of his or her potential is felt more as a burden than a benefit.
I should like to come back to your original question.
The Commission is not planning to stipulate or recommend any fixed retirement age at an administrative level.
On the other hand, it takes the view that, in the light of demographic ageing and the longer period over which pensions are being drawn, it is right to extend people's working lives.
To this end, a range of measures should be adopted, of which, in my view at least, an administrative extension of the retirement age is among the less important ones.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, at the same time as there is increasing interest in getting the older generation to spend money, that is, to be consumers, people in their forties or fifties are already finding it more and more difficult to get work, and low pensions are, of course, a reflection of this, with women in particular risking the prospect of a poverty-stricken old age.
How does the Commission think it is going to deal with this dichotomy?
(DE) Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that very good answer and for having the courage to address an issue from which many of your predecessors had shrunk back.
I would just like to put a supplementary question and ask you whether you are planning measures to promote the non-material aspects of a favourable attitude towards children and families in European societies, and whether you are giving consideration to involving non-governmental organisations, private associations and individuals in this, in order to enable civil society to play a part in this work?
Member of the Commission. (CS) As time is very tight, I shall be brief.
Indeed, given that material conditions are a substantial component of our lives, of the quality of life and of support for people and families, it is clear that we will only move forward on this issue if we harness the capacities of non-governmental organisations.
Accordingly, we are counting on the extensive involvement of various non-governmental organisations and associations, as Mr Posselt said in his question.
Questions Nos 48 to 53 will be answered in writing.
Subject: Failure of consumer policy in the internal market
The most recent Eurobarometer survey, carried out in March 2006, highlighted once again consumers' total mistrust of the internal market and their complete ignorance of their rights and the legal remedies available to them.
Can the Commission explain why the existing body of legislation is so ill-suited to its task and/or has been so badly implemented to the point of deterring consumers and making them mistrustful of transfrontier purchases?
How does it intend to protect consumers against the ever increasing number of illegal practices of which they are now the victims following the rapid expansion in Internet sales?
Why is it ignoring the thousands of complaints it receives through its own networks concerning transfrontier purchases, travel, healthcare, etc.?
. - (FR) Thank you for your response, Commissioner. It does not surprise me insofar as it confirms precisely the Commission position expressed in the action programme that has just been adopted for the period 2007-2012 and that has the sole aim - I quote - of guaranteeing a high level of consumer protection and of guaranteeing the effective application of consumer protection rules.
How does the Commission intend, in practice, to bring proceedings against those Member States that, regarding guarantees or distance selling, for example, do not properly apply the existing directives and that expose consumers who try to take advantage of the internal market to very serious risks?
Finally, do you not think that, contrary to the spirit of the Treaty, the policy of this Commission has turned the citizen as consumer into the poor relation and the reject of this internal market?
Member of the Commission. It is true that this is a very important issue for us and it is clear that no unauthorised product can enter the market in the European Union.
We have a very strict system in place to ensure that no product slips through the very high standard assessment procedure.
The question of the contamination of US long grain rice, involving unauthorised GM LLRICE 601, proves that this is not just a statement but a fact.
Our reaction has shown that we intend to apply our legislation in every possible case.
As soon as the Commission was informed of this contamination of US rice, we took every possible measure to prevent unauthorised products from entering the market.
First, we introduced a requirement for certification of every single consignment arriving in the European Union.
But when we became aware that shipments of US rice certified as GM-free tested positive at the port of arrival in the European Union, the certification requirement was strengthened by the imposition of systematic counter-testing of each consignment originating in the US.
Furthermore, it is also important that this counter-testing be carried out on the basis of a harmonised and very strict sampling and testing procedure, which guarantees reliability and comparability of the results, so our consumers can be assured that every consignment of US long grain rice is tested twice, both in the US and on arrival in the European Union.
I have to remind you that Member States bear the primary responsibility for enforcing these requirements and verifying that they are fulfilled by business operators.
The Commission has systematically reminded national authorities of this obligation to carry out adequate checks and withdraw contaminated products.
The UK Food Standards Agency has clarified its approach by agreeing to the conclusions of the Standing Committee on 11 September 2006.
In that context, Member States commit themselves to checking all stored bulk consignments of US rice already on the European Union market.
When it comes to products on the shelf, our legislation provides that Member States will take all appropriate measures to ensure that these are tested and removed from the market if necessary.
But the aim is to provide the legislation.
It is up to the Member States to ensure that measures are taken in the most effective way.
On the issue of cross-pollination, it is important to remember that no GM crop can be grown in the European Union unless it has been evaluated as safe for the environment and human and animal health and authorised for cultivation.
Member States are developing coexistence strategies to ensure that they can limit as much as possible admixtures of GM and non-GM crops and address the economic consequences.
The competence for this lies with the Member States, following the recommendations and guidelines of the European Union.
However, the special characteristics of each Member State - the landscape, the environment, climate conditions - make it important for them to take the most appropriate measures.
We know that many Member States, including the United Kingdom, have defined or are in the process of defining approaches to ensure that GM crops can coexist with conventional and organic crops.
Member States are obliged to notify national coexistence measures to the Commission and the Commission follows this very closely.
Commissioner, you may say that it is clear that no unauthorised product can enter the EU market, but that has simply not been the case.
The fact that the US certified this rice as being GM-free turned out, as you have said, not to be true, and now you require testing.
You say that the FSA has clarified its position, but can you say what explanation you received from the FSA?
Was it correct in telling shops that they did not need to withdraw this rice?
Given that it is illegal to sell GM rice, how can the conduct advised by the FSA possibly be legal?
Have you reprimanded it?
Does this whole episode not go to show the attempts to pretend that organic and conventional food can be protected from GM contamination to be utterly unconvincing?
Member of the Commission. As long as we have GM products throughout the world that are not authorised by us, we will always have to be alert and to take all measures available.
I think the fact that we identified early on that we could not rely on US certification and that we introduced our own testing system proves that we are very serious about this.
On the UK issue, any product containing an unauthorised GM component has to be withdrawn because it is on the market illegally.
That is an obligation for all Member States including the UK; this was made clear to them and they understood that.
It is true that the European Food Safety Authority said that there was no imminent danger to human health, and the UK repeated that, but, as far as the Commission is concerned, any product of this sort that has not been authorised through our procedures is on the market illegally and has to be removed.
After we made it clear to the UK authorities that this was the legal position, they adjusted their position.
In this respect, we make sure that Member States also apply the legislation, which is very strict, and no unauthorised product can reach the consumer.
After some discussions, the UK has corrected its position.
Those questions that it has not been possible to take for reasons of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Establishing the European Globalisation adjustment Fund (debate)
The next item is the report by Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Globalisation adjustment Fund - C6 0082/2006 -.
Member of the Commission. (CS) Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament and in particular Mrs Bachelot for her unstinting efforts towards progress in negotiations on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF).
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the Finnish Presidency for its hard work in securing the adoption of the EGF proposal at first reading.
The adoption of the fund will send out a clear political signal that the EU depends on its citizens.
We should keep in mind why this fund came into being.
Nobody is in any doubts as to the contribution made by world trade to our labour markets and economy.
In some areas, however, the opening up of world trade has led to changes in the structure of our economies, which has in turn led to substantial job losses.
We are often able to predict change and to react to a particular situation by establishing support mechanisms such as the European Social Fund.
Sometimes, however, it is not possible to predict where and when job losses will occur and the extent of the impact.
We now have the EGF to react to such crises.
The Commission has, from the outset, highlighted the importance to European citizens of this fund, which is a tangible expression of European solidarity.
In recent years, the EGF has, for example, played a role in compensating for the serious job losses arising from changes in the textiles industry.
When quotas were abolished in the textiles and clothing sector at the end of 2004, as part of the WTO textiles and clothing agreements, many workers in the sector in Europe were threatened with redundancy.
Among the affected regions were Valencia and Catalonia in Spain, and the south west region of the Czech Republic.
There were also significant job losses in the footwear industry, for example in the French region of Pas de Loire and the Hungarian region of Western Transdanubia.
In this case, the EGF was able to help workers to find new jobs, develop new skills, obtain qualifications, or take the major step of starting their own businesses.
The Commission based its proposal on the Council's mandate to establish a fund specifically aimed at providing additional support for employees who have lost their jobs following major structural changes in world trade.
The criteria for assistance proposed by the Commission reflect the Council's requirement that the assistance from the fund should be subject to clear criteria concerning the extent of economic disruption and its impact on local, regional and national economies.
In the existing version of the adopted text, the positions of Parliament and the Council are perfectly in tandem.
The Council and Parliament supported the criteria for providing assistance in relation to cases, on the one hand, of large corporations and, on the other hand, of SMEs.
The amendment on flexibility, which should take into account the fears of Member States with smaller labour markets and should cover exceptional cases, also won considerable support.
The regulation also provides Member States with an opportunity to support aid from the fund more broadly, with measures that are dependent on the nature of the crisis and the actual situation in the individual countries.
Once again, I should like to thank you and in particular Mrs Bachelot for your efforts in getting this fund off the ground at the beginning of 2007.
We must now get down to work together so that all of our instruments and policies bring benefits to the people of Europe.
I am sure that the combination of policies and efforts at national and EU levels, with the European Social Fund and now the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, will bring benefits to our citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we shall in fact give our verdict for the third time on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
The founding act of the project was the adoption of the BÃ¶ge report on the 2007-2013 financial perspective.
In addition to the draft Fund, Article 28 of the interinstitutional agreement thus defines the annual sum of EUR 500 million, budgeted over seven years, together with part of the budgetary procedure.
The second ratification was expressed within the context of Mr Cottigny's own-initiative report on restructuring and employment, which was adopted in March: the latest events in the automobile sector tend to make us more vigilant regarding the future of weakened or declining economic sectors.
I should like, on the occasion of our debate, to pass on my thoughts and to give my support to the employees affected by the social disaster at the Volkswagen plant in Forest.
Parliament has therefore twice voiced its support for the conclusions of the Hampton Court Summit, which ratified the draft fund devised by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted the report on the draft regulation on Thursday 26 October by a very large majority, and this serves as a basis for the negotiations in trialogue, the aim of which is to obtain an agreement at first reading, such that, as you said, Commissioner, the fund might be operational as from 1 January.
The negotiation in trialogue ended positively on Thursday 30 November, with my agreement and with that of Mr Andersson and Mr Lewandowski, together with that of the draftsman of the opinion, Mr SeppÃ€nen, on the budgetary part, where he had access to enhanced cooperation.
I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive spirit - this report belongs to you, Mr Cottigny, Mr Beaupuy and Mrs Schroedter - as well as the group coordinators.
I am also grateful to the representatives from the Commission and from the Finnish Presidency.
The day after the trialogue, the agreement was ratified at the Council by Coreper: an agreement at first reading on the creation of the EGF is therefore in the hands of the MEPs, who will vote tomorrow.
Four principles have guided the work of our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we have preserved them throughout the debate.
The first principle is European added value.
It is by no means a question of substituting for the Member States when it comes to dealing with the social effects of industrial disasters.
The EGF's operations will be focused on cases symbolising European-wide social disasters, which take place following a change in the structure of international trade.
The European Parliament has therefore specifically insisted that the 50% cofinancing rule be laid down in Article 10 of our regulation, thus marking the European ambition and not the provision of European aid for international issues.
Equally, we have introduced the transnational element of certain issues.
The second principle is responsibility.
Responsible, as it is, for international trade negotiations, the European Union thus accepts the potential consequences of its strategic decisions.
Our responsibility is indeed to accept the positive aspects of globalisation, but also to take account of its potentially negative effects.
The third principle is justice.
Justice firstly, because we are addressing men and women.
Territorial justice, too, because all of the Member States are involved, and we have rejected discrimination against small labour markets, which will be eligible from now on via the safeguard clause and the extension of the provisions of Article 2 b).
The fourth principle is effectiveness.
In Article 3, on eligible actions, we have clearly prohibited passive social protection measures.
We want proactive measures aimed at getting workers back to work, particularly older workers, who should not be condemned to compulsory early retirement or to prolonged periods of unemployment.
The EGF programme thus has a place in the Lisbon Strategy, in that it helps European competitiveness.
Effectiveness also means controlling and evaluating the process, on which our Parliament has laid a great deal of emphasis.
Our objective is well and truly to provide Europe, thanks to the EGF, with a similar instrument to the one that has already existed for 40 years in the United States in the form of the Trade Adjustment Act, which last year helped more than 170 000 US employees, over 70% of whom found a long-term job.
Many of my colleagues support the idea of the Fund, but regret the lack of money involved.
I understand them.
Nevertheless, I would emphasise the fact that this is an experimental move, which will have to be analysed, then refined and enhanced.
This experimental move will constitute the first stage in the establishment of a genuine global European strategy on globalisation.
There is no such strategy today, and not for long will we be able to remain the only strategic trade actor in the world to do without such a road map.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, globalisation does not just make victims of developing countries, but also of countries in Europe.
The main victims of globalisation have been the populations of those developing countries where the abolition of tariffs by the WTO has not had any tangible effect.
However, there are sadly victims in Europe, too, where the living conditions of many Europeans have dramatically worsened.
There are no jobs, or they do not pay enough, or they are no longer secure.
The welfare state and social security are in crisis.
The Globalisation Adjustment Fund is important, insofar as it sends out a positive message, but unfortunately this is more or less just a symbolic message.
The appropriations are not actually sufficient to meet the ambitious objectives stated, and the number of workers that will be able to be helped - between 35 000 and 50 000 - is also more or less symbolic.
We can therefore expect the Fund to be spread here, there and everywhere, leaving the many applicants empty-handed.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (FI) Mr President, we on the Committee on Budgets are particularly interested in how money that has been saved in other areas of expenditure is to be transferred to this fund.
If the budget is drafted for year N, the Council wanted to use the money according to the following procedure: first the unused margins for year N minus 1 preceding the budget under debate would be transferred to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and only then would the unused commitment appropriations for year N minus 2 preceding it be transferred to the fund.
Parliament, however, could not accept the logic of this order of events.
We wanted first to use the known commitment appropriations for the year N minus 2 preceding the drafting of the budget and only then the margins for the year N minus 1.
The Commission supported Parliament's position, a strong indication of which is the letter on fund transfers sent to Parliament by Commissioner Dalia GrybauskaitÄ.
The Council accepted this arrangement at the trilogue meeting.
I want to thank Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin for her excellent levels of cooperation.
The Committee on Budgets can thus adopt the outcome of the trilogue discussions.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, despite differing opinions over the existence of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has concluded that the fund might act as an expression of EU solidarity with workers who have lost their jobs owing to changes in the structure of world trade.
In my view, the Commission's original proposal, which was based on the discussions and compromise proposals in the committee, was better suited to the needs of most Member States, including the smaller ones, and also to the conditions faced by SMEs.
The key criterion remains access to the fund.
Unfortunately the document before us today concerning the establishment of the fund fails to take sufficient account of the - unanimously adopted - conclusions of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
For example, the provision of financial aid still depends on reaching a minimum threshold of a thousand workers who have been made redundant.
The EGF should be a source of rapid assistance.
As we say in our country, 'He who gives quickest gives twice.'
Yet there are no deadlines set out here by which the Commission must issue decisions on the provision of resources from the funds.
The fact that EGF is restricted to compensation for relocations of production outside the EU is also, in my opinion, an unpromising sign, although I am aware that under Community law no other options are possible.
Nevertheless, I have often heard a similar opinion being expressed during negotiations in Parliament and the Commission, and the European trade unions have also criticised the double standard in the approach to the unemployed.
The proposal before us today to establish the EGF, as distinct from the version adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, does not reflect the conditions faced by the small Member States or the SMEs, which are the very backbone of the European economy.
For this reason, I will not be alone in finding it difficult to lend my full backing to this version of the EGF.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund came about as an attempt to address social emergencies that have arisen in EU Member States.
The economic scourge of unemployment, caused by globalisation-related phenomena, is clearly one such emergency, and, with 19 million people unemployed, solutions must be found.
This Fund is to be supplied from the unused amounts from other headings, up to a maximum of EUR 500 million per year.
It will not have its own funding line, nor will it be possible for the fund to be brought forward from the following year, as is the case with the Solidarity Fund.
This is a serious problem because we may be declining to intervene in clearly eligible situations owing to a lack of available funding.
I broadly welcome this regulation.
I must, however, register my scepticism as regards the tight eligibility criteria laid down in Article 2.
We managed to bring in a flexibility clause, but I fear that it may be insufficient to protect smaller countries and regions that may not have met the quantitative criterion but in which the impact of globalisation may be extremely serious.
It is essential we contribute with an instrument that strives to preserve the European social model, which lies at the very core of Europe.
For this to happen, we must use the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to support our workers and support the workers of the rest of the world by making social criteria a barrier to the import of certain products into European territory.
Only in this way, and by promoting fairer trade, shall we defend our social model and champion the interests of millions of citizens throughout the world.
Lastly, I wish to say that we must respond, as a matter of urgency and before it is too late, to these serious economic and social problems caused by globalisation.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the Council has, in its infinite wisdom, decided to set up, at Mr Barroso's suggestion, the globalisation fund that is the subject of today's debate.
We could have also opted to convert the ESF, for example, but we did not.
On the positive side, I think, is the fact is that we are acknowledging with this proposal that globalisation has implications.
It has positive implications in the sense that it is the best development aid, while the negative implications are to be found in our own labour markets.
We are now trying to cushion this with EUR 500 million annually, which will not be enough.
I would, however, thank the rapporteur for making a huge number of improvements to this proposal in recent months, and I should like to give you a thumbnail description of them.
First of all, the unemployed within the somewhat smaller labour markets will now also be able to tap into this fund, 15% of which has been set aside for this purpose.
Secondly, if thousands of people are made redundant within the next nine months, they will be able to enjoy the benefits of this fund and that is vitally important to the SMEs.
Thirdly, the 50% cofinancing measure has been removed, which is excellent.
Fourthly, the definition of the SME has been extended.
Fifthly, there is no longer any passive support, as this is termed in the proposal, for social security; instead, an active employment policy is pursued with means of this fund.
Finally, we can decide on spending together with the Council.
To sum up, I am pleased with the way in which adjustments have been made.
Even if a disaster were to strike in my region, this Fund can be used to enhance further employment.
I would extend warm thanks to Mrs Bachelot, as well as the Committee on Budgets and my own Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for this.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Å pidla, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, not because it is customary to do so, but because she has been able to put her stamp on this report.
During our work, she has been able to establish a constructive frame of mind with all of the draftsmen and the groups, which now enables us to examine a report at first reading, something that we could not have hoped for only a short time ago.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, to the great displeasure of those who think that Europe is nothing but a large market with no political objective, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is going to come into being.
It is true that the delivery has been painful and that, sadly, the case of the Volkswagen-Forest employees, about whom I cannot help but think this evening, has hung in the balance.
It has enabled the detractors of the project to realise how useful and, moreover, necessary, this Fund is.
It is quite clear that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament was unwilling to accept just any compromise when it came to reaching this agreement at first reading, but we are genuinely satisfied with the results of the trialogue.
We particularly welcome the integration of the Fund regulation; the assurances that we have obtained thanks to the tenacity of the members of the Committee on Budgets; the implementation of the safeguard clauses, which will enable us to support employees who have been made redundant; the creation of a European one-stop shop, which will guarantee everyone equal access to information; the certification of acquired experience, which recognises employees who find themselves out of a job after years of work; the funding of cooperative projects and the obtaining of micro-credits; and the maintaining of Article 10, which sets a rate of 50% for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund's contribution to the funding of issues, which makes this tool an entirely European fund.
An agreement is never perfect, of course; it is the fruit of compromise.
The Socialists regret, for example, that, as regards the resources allocated to this Fund today, the European budget does not exceed EUR 115.5 billion.
It is a pity that we did not see more money go into this budget.
Thanks to this agreement at first reading, this Fund will be operational as from 1 January.
It gives rise to a hope, that of seeing work finally begin on a social Europe.
It is important to understand that job insecurity and the pitting of European workers against each other is not the norm.
It is up to Europe to guarantee employee protection.
Social Europe is the only Europe that can now bring the citizens closer to their institutions.
This Fund represents the first stage towards a more united Europe.
Today, Europeans expect Europe to contribute to their job security and their lifestyles, in the same way that it has been able to guarantee peace and stability for almost 50 years.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Å pidla, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being present and, above all, thank you to Mrs Bachelot-Narquin who, as my fellow Member, Mr Cottigny, did such an excellent job of saying just now, has succeeded in uniting the ideas of various parties within Parliament: it is most certainly not the case that she lacks ideas, but the fact of supplementing them with the ideas of various parties has actually enriched the debate.
I should like to thank you too, Mr Å pidla, for the participation of the Commission which, acting on the Council's wishes, has proposed a text on which we have been able to work.
I note that the Council is not very well represented this evening: without doubt, the low turnout is compensated for by the quality of the persons present.
We have finally reached an agreement: that is the crucial point.
Once again, if anyone should doubt Parliament's ability to enrich the texts proposed to it by the Commission, well, this evening, we can prove it to them!
I do not wish to go back over what Mrs Bachelot-Narquin ably summarised.
However, I should like to highlight a point that I feel is crucial in terms of the positive aspect of the text submitted to us, which I have no doubt we will adopt tomorrow: it is the very proactive aspect that we are going to provide in the area of retraining, of reemployment, of the reemployment of employees who are going to be affected by these globalisation-related developments, at a time when they are going to lose their jobs.
We have insisted in our various debates that, thanks to training schemes, business start-up assistance and skills appraisals, to mention just a few examples, workers can immediately benefit from this money with a view to finding a job.
Over and above these congratulations, however, I should like to guard us against a great danger: the illusions created by the communication on this Fund.
Mr Cottigny, who is clearly highly motivated by human kindness and by his desire to create a social Europe, etc., did a good job just now of outlining all the hopes presented to us.
I would advise caution: we only have EUR 500 million and, even if we had more, is it up to the European Union to take the place of training bodies, of the State, of the regions, of the local councils and of all the contributors, of which there are many?
Next, it is quite important to understand that this system only exists when, unfortunately, a business winds up and has to file for bankruptcy, has to stop its activities.
The same goes for its suppliers, its various service providers.
Last week in Brussels, under the chairmanship and on the initiative of Mr Å pidla, a two-day forum was held on restructuring.
Well, I should like to say at this point that the work done by the European Union on these restructuring arrangements is very important because it is precisely going to allow us to take a dynamic approach to preventing a number of negative effects and, therefore, factory closures.
I believe that the message that we, and particularly you, Commissioner, together with our Commission bodies in general, should send out is that, on the one hand, there is a human desire to provide new resources through this Globalisation Fund, and that, on the other hand, Europe, using the bulk of this budget, is dedicated to adapting to the modernisation of our European Union so that our general economy, and therefore, in fact, our employees, are better able to dominate the world's developments.
I believe that this is the message that we must send out, so that we do not have the kind of communication that is simplified in the extreme and that penalises the entire European Union.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if you expect me to join in singing the praises of this Globalisation Adjustment Fund, then you are making a mistake, for, as we recall, the fund was made necessary by the unwillingness of the Commission and the Council to include consideration of the social dimension in their international trade policy from the very outset.
If European economic policy does not run in tandem with social cohesion, then the fund is, in essence, a fire extinguisher, one reliant on modest, indeed minimal resources in a reserve the funds for which have to be collected together as and when European policy, being socially unbalanced, has failed.
This House was then left with no option other than to help establish this fund, but it would have been better if the Council had topped up the Budget with more money for the long-term restructuring and modernisation of, and job creation in, regions and sectors, so the rapporteur, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, really does deserve gratitude for having - in the face of resistance from both this House and the Council - ensured that a draft with real improvements in it can become, in a single reading, the legal basis for this Fund.
It really is good that she has agreed to our amendments.
This House has done away with discrimination against older workers and enabled them to have the same opportunities for continued employment as their younger colleagues; it has caused the same weight to be given to the principle of gender mainstreaming as it receives in the European Social Fund, and - crucially - this Fund has been enabled to make microloans enabling workers to acquire the capital they need if they are facing unemployment and want to become self-employed for lack of any alternative - and that is precisely the point: they have no alternative, because Europe's trade policy has been wrongheaded from the word go.
In this area, too, we have supported the rapporteur, since she has done her bit to improve the opportunities for making use of this fund.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) The Commission's proposal is no more than a palliative for the serious problem of the impact of globalisation in a number of Member States.
The restructuring and relocation of multinationals are, alone, known to cause many thousands of redundancies and to hamper development in large parts of various countries in which there are no employment alternatives.
Apart from the obvious inadequacy of the overall amount proposed, restrictions have been imposed that, in practical terms, prevent the Fund being used in countries such as Portugal, which is experiencing serious problems due to multinationals relocating their factories.
By not allowing the use of the Fund when companies are restructuring and relocating within the EU, we are preventing the workers in well-known cases such as that of Opel in Azambuja, which is to relocate to Spain, from receiving support.
The same could happen in other cases, such as that of Johnson Controls, which is threatening to move to Romania, that of Lear and those of many other firms relocating to Poland and other EU countries.
In reality, then, this Fund is a symbolic measure that does not provide solutions.
Its budget is limited and its eligibility criteria are restrictive.
The Commission estimates that between 35 000 and 50 000 workers could benefit from the Fund, but, by 2005 alone, the number of workers laid off as a result of restructuring had topped 570 000, most of the redundancies being due to relocations within the EU.
Despite its grandiose name, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund is no more than a smokescreen designed to conceal the serious consequences for workers of the neoliberal policies pursued and implemented by the EU.
The Fund is not intended to stop the redundancies, factory closures, relocations and the quest for the maximum profit at the minimum cost, with the workers treated as mere numbers to be cut back on.
The only intention is to soothe the consciences of those responsible for such actions.
(PT) Mr President, globalisation is one of the defining features of our times and should be seen in a positive light because, first and foremost, it puts everyone in contact with everyone else, which is a good thing.
Globalisation has already pulled millions of people out of poverty, and that is another good thing.
In coming to terms with globalisation, Europe is doing what it has always been able to do well: it has opened up to other cultures.
Yet we must be aware that globalisation also has some worrying aspects, for certain regions of Europe in particular.
There is a political angle to the decision to set up the Globalisation Fund, which was taken simultaneously by the three most important EU institutions.
This was the first time that the three institutions had acknowledged the existence, in the European area, of the negative aspects of globalisation.
With the closure of industrial units, there are clear signs of major concern in certain strata of our societies.
People are not so much concerned at the moment with fighting for more rights, but rather with trying at least to keep things as they are.
In broad strata of our society, there is a feeling that I have no qualms about describing as a certain fear, a fear of the future, which I feel will only be overcome if people are prepared to change.
When people are concerned and fearful, it is very difficult to accept any kind of change.
To my mind, this fund is, more than anything, a way of helping to encourage the most vulnerable workers to change.
It is not, and nor, in my view, does it seek to be, a miracle cure for redundancies and for the consequences of company restructuring, closures and relocations.
The Fund's raison d'Ãªtre relates solely to people in a very precarious situation, whom we want to help regain a high level of self-esteem as quickly as possible.
I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that I support this report.
(SV) Mr President, I want to begin by thanking not only the rapporteur, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, for a quite excellent piece of work but also the shadow rapporteurs, including Mrs Schroedter, who became involved.
I also wish to thank the Council, which is not present, for being so attentive, and the Commission for its constructive approach to the trialogues.
Others have talked about the improvements made, for example, when it comes to cofinancing, small labour markets and such like.
A host of improvements were made.
I want to emphasise what Mrs Bachelot-Narquin said, namely that the fund will not solve all the problems, that what we have here is European added value and that the Member States, regions or companies are not relieved of their responsibility to face up to globalisation.
What we are talking about is added value.
Do not imagine that this fund will solve all the problems, most of which will have to be solved in the Member States.
It is an important contribution, however.
Secondly, the fund is not about supporting companies or specific regions.
We have other aid for those purposes.
It is about reintegrating workers who, through no fault of their own, have been affected by globalisation, so that they might re-enter the labour market as soon as possible.
Fortunately, the proposals will enter into force as early as on 1 January.
I should like to thank everyone for their constructive cooperation.
- (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mrs Bachelot for preparing this complex report.
I am sure that the authors of the Globalisation Fund idea and the rapporteur herself had a lofty goal - to help people who find themselves without a job.
However, ladies and gentlemen, before voting I would like you to ask yourselves a few questions:
1.
Is it really the role of the Commission to regulate and interfere in the micro-management of enterprises in the entire Community?
2.
How will the Commission determine whether an enterprise is leaving the market because of the effects of globalisation or just because of normal competition?
We know that every year thousands of enterprises go bankrupt due to the normal course of events.
3.
How will we explain why no help is forthcoming for the employees of enterprises that go bankrupt in the normal course of events?
Is this Fund likely to become yet another bone of contention among the people of the Community?
4.
Why would the programmes, that the Commission is going to offer for re-qualifying, help in finding employment and other consultations, work better than the programmes already in place that are often offered free of charge?
As we know, they are not very effective.
The Globalisation Fund idea may make sense politically, but the proposed Regulation clearly lacks economic logic.
It goes against basic free market principles and particularly against the principle of competitiveness.
There is no guarantee that the funds will go to people who have found themselves without a job, rather than to consulting enterprises or other intermediaries.
Therefore, without clear answers to these questions I think it will be hard to vote in favour of this document.
(FR) Mr President, Mr Å pidla, Mrs Bachelot-Narquin, as my colleague, Mrs Schroedter, has already pointed out, our group has indicated that it agrees with the outcome of the trialogue, and has done so in order to have the Fund implemented as quickly as possible.
I should like to stress in this House that this aid is intended directly for workers and that its primary aim is to get people back to work, which I feel is very positive.
Regarding the intervention criteria laid down in Article 2, there remain some margins for interpretation, which the Commission will have to clarify in its guidelines.
The planned job losses are clearly linked to structural changes in international trade for the sectors concerned.
That being the case, what is regarded as a serious economic disruption remains subject to interpretation.
That is why we believe that the automobile sector can come under this plan and that, as such, the Volkswagen Forest workers and the sub-contractors should be able to benefit from this extra aid.
As desirable as it is, this new Fund will obviously not prevent working conditions from continuing to deteriorate under the pressure of competition organised between various production sites of the same group, located inside and outside the Union.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance repeats its request for the Commission to propose a legal framework aimed at creating European, sectoral and group collective agreements, enabling us to anticipate restructuring and not to suffer it.
(HU) We are all aware that views differ among the political groups in terms of an assessment of globalisation, but the same is true within European society as a whole.
Although nowadays it is mainly the relocation process in Europe the public is aware of, let us not forget either that Europe was the main beneficiary from globalisation during the last century.
Taking all this into consideration, it is possible, in principle, to agree to the establishment of this fund.
However, the draft text for this has also raised serious concerns in a number of respects.
It would not be appropriate if interfering in European funds only helped to cover up the lack of competition, or if the method of determining the criteria for the funds turned old and new Member States against each other.
As regards the first issue, we need to create the opportunity for improving and maintaining competitiveness within a European framework.
This is where legislation has a serious role to play.
I would mention, first of all, efforts to create an internal market.
This means that the globalisation fund cannot dispense with those whose job is actually to ensure that European companies, based in Europe and employing EU workers can not only continue to operate, but increase their revenue too.
The other issue is connected with this.
I would like to emphasise that it is not our job to create difficulties between old and new Member States, as is happening with the free movement of workers, but to work together to make the Union commercially competitive.
This is why the award criteria system needs to be just and fair to all Member States.
We have managed to improve the original proposal, thanks to Roselyn Bachelot, so that, in its present form, it is already acceptable, even if it is of mainly symbolic significance.
(ES) Mr President, like other Members, I shall begin by expressing my satisfaction, though also a degree of caution.
We have reservations because, though it is a very appropriate response at this time of so much anguish for so many of our fellow citizens, it would be a mistake to raise expectations only for them to be dashed.
We can say, however, that a positive message will be sent out tomorrow, which will firstly show that a way of working has been employed that overcomes the differences amongst our parties, in order to reach agreement on problems that we have in common.
There is broad agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, also demonstrating that a good method has been employed.
Above all, however, this legislation demonstrates that we are once again seeing that Europe means solidarity, that Europe provides a social model, and that we are sensitive to our citizens' demand that Europe should exist between our States and the world in order to support the victims of globalisation, those who pay the price for globalisation.
Though in a symbolic and limited manner, we are prepared to provide them with a new instrument, which must of course be managed extremely efficiently, given its limited resources, and which is dedicated to those who suffer most, the workers, enabling them to return to the labour market.
Mr President, Parliament has done a good job and tomorrow I shall vote in favour, like the majority of my fellow Members.
(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this Parliament, when we are discussing the effects of globalisation, we often hear certain countries expressing pride in having transferred manufacturing processes to third countries with cheap labour costs.
However, the transfer of manufacturing processes has another side to the coin - the loss of jobs and prosperity of EU citizens.
We can see the first sign of European solidarity with those becoming unemployed - Europe adapting to a Fund for the consequences of globalisation.
According to the Regulation, the Fund's money will be used in accordance with strict criteria, having regard to the scale of economic disruption and the effect on the local, regional or national economy.
How is the scale of economic disruption to be determined?
The Regulation suggests that aid be offered when job losses affect 1 000 employees; the EP suggests that in exceptional cases it could also be offered for 500 employees.
However, in the small EU countries over 90% of enterprises are medium-sized or small, and over 90% of these are micro-enterprises.
Therefore, in reality the aid will go to large enterprises in large countries.
EGF aid is paid only once, but it should be tied to the creation of new employment opportunities in an endeavour to reintegrate workers into the employment market.
(DE) Mr President, the approach taken by the Globalisation Fund is very much the right one, in that it is intended to act in solidarity with those workers who have lost their jobs as a result of international business relocations, making available temporary income support for the purpose of their further training and reintegration, in order to give them new opportunities for employment.
Having the right idea, though, is a long way from doing the right thing.
The people on the receiving end are bound to be bitterly disappointed when the money - which amounts to a maximum of EUR 500 million per annum - runs out; raising high hopes and then dashing them is a sure-fire route to long-term frustration.
The fund goes about things the wrong way, in that it addresses the symptom rather than the causes of the lay-offs; the authorisation procedures are too complicated, and there is loads of red tape, which makes for considerable expense, but, above all, it does not work for SMEs, in that, for example, a reduction in the threshold from 1 000 layoffs to 500 has been refused, and, moreover, when fewer than 1 000 workers are laid off, only 15% may be paid out as against the 20% that we seek.
The Fund is meant to kick in when a given Member State reports 1 000 layoffs from its SMEs over a period of nine months, whereas the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had demanded a period of twelve.
There is a need for a great deal more structural investment in our Member States, not only in research and innovation, but also in high-quality education and training, which the European Union is supporting in both the short and long terms with programmes for lifelong learning.
Money from the ESF is also being used to fund older workers through retraining, the completion of their education, and their integration.
The Globalisation Fund was pushed through the institutions in short order; in its present form, not even its basic approach is likely to meet the public's high expectations.
(IT) Mr President, Mr Å pidla, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to say how satisfied I am with this important measure.
The fund is one of the most significant tools for forging a European identity.
This is true on both a symbolic and a practical level, since it provides backing for active policies for male and female workers who are at risk of losing their jobs, or who have already lost them, mainly as a result of company relocations.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not express its opinion because of an unexpected and inexplicable majority of votes against, which luckily I now see has been readjusted.
Thus, the committee has sidelined itself from being able to offer positive contributions, and has lost the opportunity to improve the text on matters that fall within its competence.
I would like to say that, despite the device of a reserve for exceptions, the setting of a quantitative ceiling is liable to make it difficult to perceive the diversity of individual countries' productive systems, and risks failing to target the true losers: those who do not have effective national legislation to protect workers of both genders, small businesses and industrial areas.
Mr President, British Conservatives are not unreservedly enthusiastic that there should be a globalisation fund at EU level.
The good news is that this proposal is about helping people, helping them cope with the challenge of change, and we support such a principle wholeheartedly.
At issue is whether such help should be at EU rather than Member State level.
However, to be frank, the fund is also about helping certain governments sell the idea of globalisation to their voters.
This is not a criticism.
We support that idea too.
There is indeed unease in certain countries and certain quarters that the wind of global competition can be a chill wind for some.
This is understandable.
It is also true.
It is in all our interests that concerns regarding possible downsides of globalisation are addressed so that the upsides of globalisation can be released.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her thoughtful and considered report and for her positive work in the trialogue.
However, concerns remain about the fund itself and it has been no surprise that in the various discussions in committee voices have been raised saying: if there is to be such a fund, let it be bigger; if there is to be such a fund, let it be easier for us to get our hands on it.
Once the EU proposes any new budget line, there is usually such a clamour.
But in this case there is not really a separate budget line, as the amount available will basically be made up of monies unspent elsewhere.
This is not just untidy, it is bad accountancy practice.
I am encouraged that the rapporteur and indeed the committee have supported a key amendment of mine to Article 18(3), which states that 'it is the responsibility of each Member State to ensure it has smoothly functioning management and control systems' to track the expenditure and to make sure it is justified and that 'it is the responsibility of the Commission to verify that such systems are indeed in place.'
Globalisation can indeed be a challenge but, in the context of the auditors' failure to sign off the overall annual accounts for the 12th successive year, the management and control of this spending is possibly the biggest challenge of all.
(FR) Mr President, I, like my fellow Members, welcome the creation of this Fund, which gives great hope to employees worried about relocations and which has given rise to countless debates within our respective committees, particularly with regard to its amount, to the award criteria and thus to the risks of unfair treatment between regions that could result.
However, it is important for European workers to know that the Union has finally decided to take account of the job losses that badly managed globalisation can cause in each of our countries, particularly in traditional industrial regions.
I join with those who have congratulated Mrs Bachelot-Narquin and all the draftsmen on their thorough work, and I am delighted that the Fund will be operational as from 1 January 2007.
Like many, I regret that the threshold for the granting of the Fund has not been lowered, that the sum is not larger and has not been definitively allocated and that the Fund cannot be harnessed for relocations within the European Union, where the majority take place.
However, this Fund does exist, and we need to get it up and running very quickly because there is a sense of urgency, as events frequently demonstrate, and then we need to assess its scope and usefulness, so that we can adjust it and replenish it if necessary.
I am also pleased that there is an obligation to inform the workers and the regions that will benefit from it, because anything that can help make our often sceptical fellow citizens more aware of the added value provided by the European Union in terms of cohesion and solidarity is most welcome.
(IT) Mr President, Mr Å pidla, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the urgent need to restructure the fabric of European business, because of the process of globalisation, and prompted by the emergence of a large European market, we are concerned to ensure that the costs of such changes, which are in themselves positive, are not borne solely by the world of work.
We therefore welcome European initiatives such as the creation of a globalisation fund, which we are debating today, and the report on corporate social responsibility, which we shall discuss tomorrow.
The development of the free market within the context of a social economy must of necessity combine the creative impetus of economic freedom with the positive values of action to promote solidarity.
Only in this way will businesses and work be an asset to the European Community.
To that end, the creation of the globalisation fund is an important tool in achieving this balance, which would otherwise be lost, leading to social injustice and the loss of jobs.
At the moment, we can see significant examples of this in the difficulties of large firms such as Volkswagen in Belgium, and significant regional problems such as those of Magrini Galileo in the Veneto - my region.
We therefore hope that this initiative, although it is experimental, can produce positive results and can be properly funded.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment.
(HU) It continues to be the Union's job to remove the structural barriers which trade liberalisation and the open markets are facing.
We need to harness the benefits of globalisation to increase employment and raise our citizens' living standards, as we will otherwise suffer its disadvantages.
While globalisation is associated with positive developments at a European level, it can cause serious problems leading to acute economic and social trauma in individual areas.
The Community, as a whole, enjoys the benefits of globalisation, but problems that may have a negative impact can arise at the local level.
The Community's job is to provide workers with appropriate, effective support enabling them to access the labour market.
This is also dictated by the duty of solidarity.
Rapid, effective help is required in these areas, which is why I welcome this new fund, in addition to the existing funds.
But to ensure that this programme can provide a real panacea, a suitable budget is necessary.
We must not be prevented from doing this by the unrealistically high cofinancing commitment, nor is it ideal if we exclude smaller areas from this opportunity to improve their situation.
(EL) Mr President, first let me congratulate rapporteur Mrs Bachelot-Narquin on her work.
Furthermore, I would like to say that from the list of speakers we have today it is clear that the issue we are discussing is very important.
We could not have it any other way considering that globalisation is an unavoidable reality, which has negative effects on the economy.
Its consequences have to be dealt with and I think that the idea of the Globalisation Fund handles them in a rather smart way, because instead of using new budget funds, it uses funds that were not allocated in order to cope with these adverse consequences of globalisation.
I feared that the implementation of the idea as proposed by the European Commission would encounter problems, but I am glad that Parliament dealt with them.
I am referring to small countries, in particular, which because of their size were running the risk of being left outside from the fund's planning, given that the required amounts would be too high to apply to major enterprises in smaller countries.
The regulation that was adopted deals with this issue and at the same time we send out the message that the European Parliament cares about all European Union countries, equally.
For Greece, my country, the final amendment of the document is positive and I believe that the message that we send out to the citizens regarding the creation of this fund, is positive.
In this way the European Union shows sensitivity towards social problems and I believe that in this way the European Union's credibility is boosted.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think you will agree with me when I say that globalisation begun, I would say, with the appearance of man on Earth; it is a form of a natural phenomenon, namely an unavoidable one.
Now that we are feeling its intensity, our goal, our vision ought to be that of a globalisation with a human face.
Due to its special European history and culture, the European Union can have a major contribution to this process.
However, any negative effects should not, under any circumstance, cause us to take protective measures, which will have negative long-term consequences.
Therefore, I agree entirely with the Fund's objectives and I would like to point out two important elements, first that all Member States should have access to it and second, that it should be dynamic in nature and adapt depending on market conditions.
However, the question at hand is whether, in reality, all Member States can benefit from the Fund.
The globalisation phenomenon affects all countries and more so the small and weak ones, which because of their size will never reach the one thousand terminations of employment per sector.
Therefore, it is a step in the right direction to adopt exceptions when serious consequences in employment and local economy are substantiated.
However, 15% for aiding such exceptions, I believe is small.
I do, though, consider it a positive fact that the Fund will be dynamic in nature, which means that if the need arises, this percentage will be readjusted.
For all the above and for the facts that I did not mention, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, this fund is indeed creating an opportunity for us to bring Europe's social dimension to the fore.
We will not leave the workers affected by the job restructuring out in the cold.
We will send out the message - and it is important that this signal is also sent out at European level - that, in those cases, we must, and indeed will, pull out all the stops to steer those people who lose their jobs as effectively as possible in search for another job, of course.
This is in the short term, as someone mentioned a moment ago, the case for the restructuring that is being conducted at the Volkswagen Vorst plant in Brussels, where thousands of people, not least the suppliers, are facing job losses.
Today, many of the workers affected are opting for a high redundancy pay-out, but this, Commissioner, does not make the need and support of those workers in search of new jobs any less urgent; quite the reverse.
We are therefore relying on their being eligible for support from the fund, because this is very much a sector that is feeling the effects of globalisation.
By way of conclusion, Commissioner, I should like to add that a huge number of the workers are pinning their hope on the Commission in the next few weeks and months.
I take it as read that we will not let them down.
Member of the Commission. (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for this debate, which has addressed the issue of the fund from a variety of perspectives.
I feel that every aspect has been considered and assessed.
I must be brief and would like to highlight just a few points that emerged clearly from the debate.
The fund is not a panacea, a cure for all ills.
It is simply one weapon in our armoury that is useful and that we have assessed from various points of view.
The conclusion we have come to is that this is an effective weapon that is capable of providing help for a large number of people in a short space of time.
A further important perspective that I should like to highlight is that this fund is earmarked for people, and should not, therefore, benefit large corporations.
This is a fund designed for individual workers, a point that must not be overlooked.
Another issue that came through implicitly from today's debate was the fear of whether the criteria that have been established are actually the right ones.
I feel we can safely say that these criteria have been considered extremely carefully by all those with an interest in work and in the creation of this fund.
No human undertaking ever offers absolute certainty.
The regulation includes a concept relating to the rendez-vous clause that will make it possible to consider other changes very quickly depending on the course of events.
It is clear, however - and this debate has convinced me of this - that all criteria have been deeply thought through from all relevant points of view.
As regards individual amendments, I can say clearly that the Commission can accept all amendments on which there is agreement at first reading.
I sincerely hope that tomorrow's vote goes successfully and that the regulation can be up and running as of 1 January.
I should like to quote a phrase used by Mr Remek: 'He who gives quickly gives twice', a phrase often used in Czech, and understood everywhere.
It would be far better if we could establish the fund by 1 January, rather than if it were to happen weeks or months later.
With tomorrow's vote the European Parliament can send out a positive signal to the citizens of Europe.
I believe that this has been explained in the debate from different perspectives.
I thank all speakers in the debate and, in particular, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for its serious work in a difficult and challenging global environment.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(FR) One can only welcome the adoption of the report on the European Globalisation Fund (EGF), which marks a new position on the part of the EU when it comes to dealing with the social consequences of globalisation.
Its implementation, as from January 2007, testifies to the desire of the European institutions to find an effective solution to relocations and to put the social rights of the individual back at the centre of the system.
This fund will enable selective, individual aid to be offered to workers who have been made redundant on account of globalisation, so as to help them retrain for new jobs.
While it is recognised that, by and large, the opening up of economies to competition is positive for growth and competitiveness, it can also lead to painful relocations and brutal job losses.
The case of Volkswagen in Belgium is a perfect example of this.
Admittedly, instruments for supporting employees affected by globalisation-related relocations already exist at Member State level.
Nevertheless, the adoption of this report means that an instrument can be created at Community level that reflects the solidarity of the EU.
