It is for this agenda, and so as not to distract public opinion, that the Convention has to be called.
The Convention needs an agenda, but it also needs a mandate, a membership, a working method and a timetable to make it worthwhile.
I would like to highlight the words of Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo: it would be incredible to keep the same number of representatives of the European Parliament as in the Convention that had the task of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, when the total number of participants in the next Convention will increase significantly.
This imbalance would, of course, be unacceptable.
Secondly, the Convention should work not on the basis of unanimity, but on the basis of majority consensus.
I think that this is the exact definition.
It should have the right to decide who to choose as President and the right to finish its work on time.
This is important in order to ensure that the conclusions of the Convention are not put on ice, because although time, heals all, it also makes us forget.
This is the commitment that we ask of Laeken: an ambitious reform with a different method of achieving more Europe and a better Europe.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I initially wanted to respond to the points made by each speaker, but unfortunately, I do not think that I will have time to go into details.
I shall, however, try to answer as accurately as I can.
First of all, I would like to give my very sincere thanks to the European Parliament and to the majority of the speakers for the quality of their comments, and for the overwhelming European voluntarism that I have heard in this House.
I must say that I do not always hear the same voluntarism in the other European institutions where I work.
I have therefore found a great deal of optimism here, which I was not expecting.
The ambitious goals that you are setting for European integration are very much in line with the ideas and the ambitions that I share, that we share.
So, with only a few days to go before Laeken, it is most certainly a welcome commitment, one that I heard voiced by almost all Members.
One of the speakers said that the Laeken Summit would be a difficult exercise. I am sure that it will be, because the EU candidate countries, particularly during the debate on the future of Europe, will be faced with a number of choices which are virtually breaking points, and which are so important for the future of Europe that some of us will just have to demonstrate a virtue that is extremely difficult in politics, in other words, that of the ability to make sacrifices.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus briefly on the Convention, and I would first of all like to explain to you what the Convention is not.
I may thus be able to reassure those of you who already see a thousand and one reasons in the Convention for sacrificing some things that they have always believed in, and which are, in fact, crippling Europe.
The Convention is not and no one has ever thought that it was the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Convention cannot, and I think that it was Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo who said this, act as an alibi either.
To my mind, it should, first and foremost, be a worthwhile sounding board.
I could also put that another way.
It can also be a challenge upon the political responsibility of the IGC members, who will have to take up this challenge, because the Convention will, at any rate, make all Council members face their political responsibility.
Let us imagine, for example, that the Convention is proposing three or four options on a specific subject related to an issue that is fundamental for the future of Europe. One of these options receives unanimous support or consensus, another receives the support of 80% of Members, and the third is given 50-50.
We are well aware that the Intergovernmental Conference is not going to be forced to choose between these options and that it could very well decide to choose another option, to come up with something else, to give these options a different response to the one that the Convention would have given.
In this case, all IGC members, when shouldering their responsibilities, when adopting one option or another, or when selecting from the options which are presented by the Convention, will, at the same time, risk being at odds, not only with the Convention, but with civil society which must, at some point, make known its intentions, its expectations and its aspirations for this Convention.
Therefore, do not underestimate the Convention due to the fact that it is not a decision-making body; do not underestimate its political weight or its political force.
I make no secret of the fact that I have several reservations as to the composition, even though I do not believe that we should no longer consider the request to increase the number of MEPs.
I think that this is quite a legitimate question, even if I must reiterate that, in our proposal, we took up the proportions that were used in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The difference compared to the Charter is that we agreed the candidate countries would take part.
We must take this difference into account.
I shall reiterate that, at the Ghent European Council, we received requests that ran counter to the requests made by the European Parliament.
Several countries demanded an increase in the number of members from the national parliaments, perhaps so that the ruling coalition could have better representation, perhaps to take into account sub-national entities or perhaps because of the bi-cameral system.
Essentially, it is quality, rather than quantity, that counts, and I think that the MEPs will always have an advantage because of the fact that they are in control of this dossier and of procedures.
I would still like to add a brief comment regarding the composition, namely that it would be regrettable if latent rivalries between political groups or specific components rise to the surface.
I think that the debate must be open; we must not consider ourselves according to the grouping to which we belong.
I think we must consider ourselves on our intellectual strength, our intellectual objectivity, on our intellectual, philosophical, cultural and political freedom of thought.
This must be done in an objective manner and I am sure that we are all capable of doing this.
Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I am willing to see whether an increase in the European Parliament' s representation will cause too many difficulties, such as, for example, too many Members taking part in the Convention, and whether we will encounter similar requests.
This could mean that the number of representatives might prevent the Convention from working smoothly.
In my opening remarks, I gave my thoughts on the outcome of the Convention and how worthwhile it is.
I think that our work is moving in the direction proposed by Parliament.
We use the consensus method where possible, and have the possibility, where necessary, of presenting options in preferential order, for example.
However, we must avoid imposing the consensus method from the outset, because I think that this would weaken the Convention, which would then only be adopted by the smallest common denominator.
The possibility for the Convention to present various options must enable us to hold a debate with conflicting views.
I would like to go over the various questions that were put to me concerning enlargement.
I would like to respond to the speakers who are not sceptical, but who are obviously concerned.
Everyone says that they are in favour of enlargement; everyone says that it is an important political and historical step. At the same time, however, a number of people seem to put forward arguments as if they have not heard what has been said, to express their reservations over enlargement.
I would like to make something clear.
We have always said that we would, first of all, try to keep up the pace of negotiations with the exceptionally rapid pace set by the Swedish Presidency, and that, secondly, we would do this by judging every country on its own merits.
The fact that we can today give a particularly positive progress report on the negotiations does not mean, of course, as some speakers have suggested, that we are being almost politically negligent and would be willing to accept 10 countries before 2004 without any further verification, further judgment or criteria.
Of course we would not, and therefore we continue to say, with regard to enlargement, that yes, it is irreversible, but also, yes, each country must be judged on its own merits.
These are my comments on enlargement.
I think that Mr BarÃ³n Crespo mentioned the presidium and wanted the forthcoming presidencies to be a part of that.
I am not against this at all, but we must keep a sense of balance.
A compromise might be for the next presidencies to take part as observers.
The Convention can take up any issue, including European security and defence policy.
As we know, these are the four themes from Nice relating to the Convention.
However, as soon as you say that the Convention was not an Intergovernmental Conference, and was not going to take certain decisions, and I do not really understand why, some people appear to want to limit the scope of the Nice themes at all costs.
If, having considered every aspect of the themes from Nice, other issues are tackled, it would be quite worrying for an exercise, which will widely involve civil society in the debate, to say 'you are going to be restricted to very specific topics and you can only discuss the issues that we want you to discuss.
That is a bit mean.
Instead, we are in favour of a more optimistic view, where the four themes from Nice are more widely interpreted.
I hope that I can count on the European Parliament, at least the more optimistic of its Members, to help us to convince others of this point of view and of this direction.
With regard to Mr Cox' s comments, I share the point of view that Mr Poettering also expressed, that the Commission must remain at the centre of the Community system.
The question of timing is also important.
There are a number of constraints and there are many elections.
I believe that the time period between the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference must be six months.
If it is any longer, I feel that we will be in danger of undoing all the good work of the Convention and the debates, and the worst scenario would be for everyone to arrive at the IGC having forgotten the options in the meantime, or for some to have had the time to pretend they have forgotten them, or having completely stripped the options of all substance. Thus, all the worthwhile work of the Convention will also have been for nothing.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is largely what I wanted to say.
I have almost certainly forgotten to say something, but it is time now to answer the last speaker, who asked me if I was in favour of transparency in the Council' s work.
Of course, I am in favour of transparency in the Council' s work.
Unfortunately, I have many more reservations about carrying out a public relations exercise that would weaken the quality of debate within the Council.
Mrs Maij-Weggen, I am a seasoned parliamentarian, having spent more than 20 years in Parliament.
I was also head of opposition in my country for a long time, too long for my liking.
Even in Parliament, if we really want to take the general interests of our citizens into account on specific subjects and specific dossiers, it is sometimes better to hold the debate behind closed doors, and not only when naming names or individuals.
I think that it would be unwise to turn essential debates on extremely delicate issues into media fodder, debates where 15 Heads of State or Government are trying to reach agreement.
I am not totally against holding public debates on a number of issues, but if all the Council formations had to be organised and carried out publicly, I am not sure that that would yield the results that you want, and that I want as well.
Therefore, I say yes to transparency, but I have much greater reservations as to propaganda.
There were two suggestions as to how to involve civil society in the work of this Convention.
The first suggestion was to create a second forum, a second institution and a second assembly.
The major difficulty in doing this is to determine how to select the members of this second assembly, which would bear the huge responsibility of representing European civil society as a whole.
It is extremely difficult to select who is the best spokesperson for a specific subject.
We would have therefore created a competing institution, existing beside the Convention, made up of representatives of the institutions.
This was one choice, this was the first suggestion.
The second suggestion that we considered was to work with what I will call a structured network whose origins are found in civil society.
We must ensure that this structured network is not at all limiting, ensure that all those involved, all those representing one aspect of public opinion can submit their thoughts, their expectations, their criticisms, their proposals to the Convention, and that the Convention can, if necessary, call upon them to interview them. In other words, this approach is a dynamic exchange of views between the Convention and everyone in European society, be it the academic world, schools, NGOs, or associations.
It is important to give everyone the channels through which they can express their views.
We have chosen a structured network, on the understanding that everything produced will be included in the Convention' s official documentation, and that all those who contact the Convention will receive an answer, not just an acknowledgement.
I think that the most representative forces of our society will emerge in time.
I am clarifying this so that there are no misunderstandings.
Thank you, Mr Michel.
It is gratifying to hear that you are convinced of the good will of this Parliament, but you will understand that we, and hence the European citizens, also stand to win or lose the most from the success of this Convention.
I will now give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I too would like to thank you for the weight and quality of the speeches you have made throughout this debate on the two major subjects on the agenda: governance and Laeken.
Please excuse President Prodi, who had to leave us a few moments ago for an essential engagement with the Economic and Social Committee.
With regard to governance, allow me to highlight the very first words of Mrs Kaufmann, who, like Mr Prodi, I would like to thank most sincerely for her availability and for the quality of the work that she has done on your behalf on this both important and difficult subject.
You put it very well, Mrs Kaufmann: the debate on governance is part of the great debate on the future of the Union.
It is not only our reason for being, our raison d' Ãªtre, that is in question, and I will come back to that in a moment, it is also our way of being, our way of acting.
The Commission, particularly in the White Paper on governance, is going to promote the co-legislation function of the European Parliament.
Through this White Paper, we are offering Parliament the opportunity to be in a better situation to exert its prerogatives, including better checking of the quality of the choice of legislative instruments, better monitoring of the quality of the use of expertise - is it pluralist? - and the quality of the use of consultation - is it fair?
To be quite frank, there remains a point of debate between us which Mr Swoboda stressed in his speech just now, you pointed it out: we are not convinced of the benefits of a mechanism that would allow legislative acts to be suspended at any time, this famous call-back mechanism, when the Commission' s responsibility in the current comitological framework is not itself certain.
We proposed looking, together with Parliament and the Council, at other mechanisms that will allow, the European Parliament to exert its responsibility for monitoring in a proportional, that is to say, a balanced manner in the matters currently covered by codecision.
However, ladies and gentlemen, beyond that point of debate on which we need to do more work together, I would like to say that we consider the debate that you have just had on the whole subject of governance to be the means of forging ahead after today' s sitting.
I would also like to say a few words about the Laeken Summit, on which we, like President Prodi, have worked very hard.
We still have a great deal of work to do on Laeken and on the situation post-Laeken.
But I, too, must praise the quality of the work of your two rapporteurs, Mrs Leinen and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, as I have already done before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
One of you, with their usual frankness, had very harsh words to say about the Commission, which is at the heart of the Community model and method, and which intends to remain at the heart with the threefold role of proposing, monitoring and implementing which was conferred on it by the Treaties. With the reunification of the European continent, as the disparities increase and the centrifugal forces become more numerous, that role of the Commission, at the heart of the Community model, is going to become even more necessary than it has been in the past 50 years.
Mr Voggenhuber accused the Commission of having no vision.
I do not think that he is here to listen to my reply, but I am nevertheless going to give it.
Everyone is free to interpret the word 'vision' as they choose.
Personally, I tend rather to practise the pessimism of reason and the optimism of will, and the reason I quote this fine phrase from Jean Monnet is just to echo what Mr Michel was saying just now, as he confessed that, in a way, he had come here to find some optimism therapy that was not forthcoming elsewhere.
So I just wanted to refer you to that fine phrase from Jean Monnet.
With regard to political will, which has been a common feature of many of your speeches, President Prodi announced four strategic objectives in this House.
We want to pursue them, and he will have the opportunity in his State-of-the-Union speech to the plenary on 11 December to prove that he is serious about them.
What would Parliament have said if, even before the start of the Convention for which we fought together, the Commission had produced its final vision of our Constitutional Treaty or of our Constitution, ignoring or pre-empting the democratic debate that is going to take place, for the first time, on such broad subjects.
I am well aware of this, and I say so under the supervision of my colleague and friend, Mr Vitorino, who worked a great deal with you on the previous Convention on fundamental rights: here we are dealing with subjects that are more politically open and probably more problematic.
The debate needs to take place.
We are going to take part in it but there was no question of us pre-empting it or acting as though it did not count.
Let us not underestimate the approach of governance and the White Paper. The intensity of your debate, today, proves that they are not trivial matters.
Before concluding, as I promised to be brief on the issue of the Laeken Convention and especially on the situation post-Laeken, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Michel, in particular, for the political will and courage that they have shown and which they are going to have to show in the few remaining days before Laeken in order to convince the Member States that the draft declaration on which they have worked and which they are proposing to the Member States will be well respected and not diminished.
I, too, heard Mr Michel using familiar words just now.
I feel that, taking into account the Convention and the fact this is the first occasion on which an institutional debate has had to allow time to accommodate the work of a Convention, we do have enough time: two years, and we have an open method which, as it concerns a reform of the Treaty on the institutions themselves, consists of more than just dialogue between the government ministers in the secrecy and comfort of the intergovernmental method alone, of which we have all seen the limitations, both at Amsterdam and at Nice.
Let us use this opportunity and make this Convention serve its purpose as a tool for projecting ideas upwards, to the institutions, to the governments who will ultimately have to decide, and to the people that you represent.
This Convention, let us say it again so that it is clear, will not take any decision.
And once that point has been made quite clear, we need to agree, and I was very pleased to hear Mr Michel' s words on this point, not to be overcautious or too closed in our reading of the four Nice points.
On the contrary, we need to look at them openly and constructively, to take the four points together and deal with them ambitiously.
It is clear that this leads to a Constitutional process.
Let us not be afraid of words.
And let us be ambitious as we look at these four points, particularly the point on the use of powers, good tools for exercising current powers and the clarification of competences, which, of course, leads us to ask questions about the European plan.
What do we want to do together?
Do we want to stay where we are?
Do some want to go backwards and unravel the acquis communautaire?
Do we want to go further in integration, in the general interest of the citizens, on the third pillar, on foreign policy, on defence?
These are the demands and requests from the people.
If we want to go further, do we want to go all together or do just a few of us want to go?
And how?
All these questions are both central to and pervade the matter, together with the four points, and the Convention, which will not take any decision but needs to make strong proposals, will have a lot of work to do.
This is what I wanted to say and, finally, I, too, think that those of us who are going to take part in this convention need to be open and to listen to what is said outside the debating chamber during that time.
Among the citizens, in each of our countries, in each of our regions, and I am very aware of the forum that the regional framework provides for public debate, for debate among the people, where many useful things can be said and passed on.
We should be open to the debate that will take place during that time in civil society.
The Commission will not be a spectator throughout that period.
It will have its special place within this Convention, as it will subsequently take part in the Intergovernmental Conference and as the President of the Commission will ultimately take an active part in the European Council of the very last Intergovernmental Conference, scheduled to take place at the latest at the beginning of 2004, before the European elections.
Next week, we are going to decide on a communication, on which I am working with President Prodi, on Laeken, on the situation before Laeken and on the likely scenario after the Laeken decisions have been implemented.
Trust us, trust me; the Commission will make regular proposals and will put forward contributions and communications on each of the subjects.
I have heard a group Chairman requesting this.
I can assure you, Chairman Poettering, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and Mr Cox, that, not only, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, on the issues of simplification or competences but on all the other subjects as well, although first of all on the issue of competences, which directly concerns us, the Commission will put contributions and suggestions on the Convention table in order to express a vision. However, I must make it quite clear that that vision, and we will confirm this next week in our communication, will, in all probability, be the preservation of the model of the community method and also, once its preservation is assured, its reinvigoration and legitimisation.
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Procedural motions (continued)
On 15 November, I brought to your attention the plight of the plane spotters arrested in Greece, amongst them my constituents Lesley and Paul Coppin.
That was two weeks ago and they are still in jail.
Last week I visited Mrs Coppin and she is very distressed.
It may be that some of those arrested have been over enthusiastic in their activities and, technically, may have appeared to have broken Greek law but others in the group, including Mrs Coppin, have done absolutely nothing wrong.
There is no evidence against them and no foundation for holding them.
These people have therefore been held in custody for almost three weeks on no justifiable basis.
Neither they nor their lawyer were present when evidence was originally presented to the investigating judge who took his arbitrary decisions in camera.
For much of the time Mrs Coppin and the other detainees had no idea of the nature of the charges against them or how long they were likely to be kept in prison before their case was dealt with.
This is disgraceful by any standards and a flagrant abuse of their civil and human rights.
Provisions under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, along with case-law, make clear that persons arrested within the European Union must be brought promptly - and that means within seven days - before a judge who must free them immediately if no foundation for their detention exists.
It must have been clear to the judge, by 16 November at the latest, that there was no evidence against many of the individuals and they should therefore have been released immediately.
What we are now seeing is a charade of justice.
I ask you, Madam President, and the President of the Council and the Commission President, to take immediate action with the Greek authorities to secure the urgent release of all the detainees from custody, particularly Mrs Coppin.
This cannot be allowed to go on for another day.
Thank you.
The President has already taken this matter up with the Permanent Representation of Greece via her Cabinet.
She has also declared herself prepared to take steps personally if this situation persists.
I now give the floor to Baroness Ludford.
Early this afternoon the President felt she needed to cut short and postpone the opportunity for Members to raise this matter.
She felt she had to prioritise the debate on the future of Europe.
But the future of Europe will be nothing if our people do not support us.
This case is a perfect example of the impact on individuals of the quality or otherwise of European integration.
Parliament had a chance to show its relevance to people and missed it in prime time.
Our motion now clashes with the Presidential debate where most of our colleagues are.
I find it difficult to believe that after nearly three weeks it has been impossible to clarify, let alone hear, the charges against the 12 Britons.
I am also puzzled about the role the Greek air force has reportedly had in reviewing the charges as opposed to an independent prosecutor.
The defendants have not had an opportunity to challenge the evidence in open court and now the higher tribunal to which the case has been referred is to be held in secret.
Mr Souladakis said earlier that the Greek criminal justice authorities had respected all relevant rights.
I am surprised that the European Convention on Human Rights is so weak.
We might need a Europe-wide review with a view to reinforcing those standards and we certainly need that in parallel with the European arrest warrant.
I call on the Greek authorities to clarify the charges, release the defendants on bail and hold a trial in open court by Friday of this week.
I would just like to underline that this is an issue that has the support of all parties in my own country.
It concerns not just British citizens but also Dutch citizens.
It has massive public interest and raises questions at a time when we are proceeding in the field of Justice and Home Affairs at European level on the basis of mutual recognition.
That implies that we need to be confident that every country's legal system is up to scratch and meets the minimum standards set down in the European Convention on Human Rights.
It is important and I am glad you have announced that the President will take this up.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
The points made by all speakers are absolutely clear.
I have already told Mr Van Orden that the issue is being monitored by the President' s Cabinet, that action has already been undertaken and that, if necessary, the President will personally see to this matter if the situation persists.
Following on from the points of order made earlier today, I am grateful the President is going to raise the issue yet again with the Greek authorities.
I am speaking particularly about my constituent Wayne Groves from Tamworth.
He did not even possess a camera so I still do not know why he is being held in detention.
He is sleeping on a floor with a thin mattress, as I understand are the other prisoners.
He has been there for three weeks.
Why, when the magistrate said yesterday that there was no real evidence against them, are they still being held?
I believe along with everybody else that this is in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.
If applicant countries have to say that will adhere to it before membership, surely current members should adhere to it now.
I should like to raise the same issue without, however, repeating what has already been said on the matter.
Two lads from my constituency are also still in captivity in Greece on account of the same crime: this is evidently the seriousness with which this matter is being dealt with in Greece.
I would point out that the next item on the agenda is the European arrest warrant.
In relation to what is currently happening in Greece, that is a topic which we, as well as the Council, will have to treat with extreme caution to prevent the situation from causing European distortion in the field of criminal law policy.
Thank you, I have already responded to this point.
Madam President, as we are talking about human rights, I would like to speak on an issue of method, which applies to all the association agreements.
Today, a joint debate is going to take place on the association agreements with Egypt, and it will include oral questions and motions for resolutions.
For the sake of a democratic debate and a more coherent vote on all the association agreements, it is important for it to be split into separate parts.
We suggest that the debate should deal, first of all, with oral questions and resolutions and then, secondly, with the vote on the association agreements.
It is neither logical nor coherent to take a position on these issues at the same time.
The oral questions and resolutions are intended to question the political powers of these countries and to give them time to debate and respond to those questions.
This two-part method allows us to confirm the fundamental importance that we attach to the whole agreement, particularly Article 2 on human rights.
The example of Egypt is telling in that it shows that we do not silently accept a decision that constitutes a violation of human rights, the recent condemnation of homosexuals, and flouts the values that we defend in Article 2 of our agreements.
Our group would therefore like to keep the debate and vote on oral questions and motions for resolutions in one part-session, and put the association agreements back to another part-session.
We have already made a request to that effect by letter to the President.
This point will be dealt with in this evening' s debate.
Mr President, you may not, but Mrs Fontaine certainly will be aware of the following matter which we have raised in the European Parliament, time and again, over the last ten years.
It concerns three Greek seamen from the lower ranks of the crew of a Greek ship who were arrested in Egypt, found responsible for the 7.5 tonnes of drugs on board the ship and handed down very heavy sentences.
To give the Egyptian courts their due, it was not the owners per se or the master of the ship who were responsible, it was the three unfortunate lower-ranking members of the crew.
Mrs Fontaine and all her predecessors have already expressed their support and asked for them to be released and sent to Greece.
Two and a half years ago, one of the three prisoners died as a result of their appalling conditions of detention.
A few days ago, a second man died of tonsillitis of all things.
The third man is still alive but his health is shot to pieces.
The Bureau should call for his release before he, too, gives up the ghost.
Combating terrorism/EUROJUST
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
Report by Mr Watson (A5-0397/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism (COM(2001) 521 - C5-0452/2001 - 2001/0217(CNS)) and the Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States (COM(2001) 522 - C5-0453/2001 - 2001/0215(CNS)), and the;
report by Mrs Gebhardt (A5-0398/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against major organised crime.
Madam President, it is a matter of regret and perhaps even of shame that it took the events of 11 September to push European governments into tackling effectively a problem which has plagued our continent for over a generation.
In 1997 in Amsterdam, and again in 1999 in Tampere in Finland, the Heads of State and Government committed themselves to tackling terrorism.
Our review of progress early this year showed that they had done nothing about it, which was why we as a Parliament brought forward a report calling on them to take action.
The events of 11 September have fortunately brought such action and I look forward to travelling to Washington shortly to talk about common action between the European Union and the United States of America.
I would like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in drawing up this report, particularly the Members from Spain.
In my report, I broadly welcome the Commission proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and for a European arrest warrant.
The amendments which I put forward seek to restrict the list of crimes defined as terrorist crimes and covered by the European arrest warrant to the most serious cross-border criminal offences, and if I may quote Amendment No 16, it specifies those crimes "which aim to destroy the fundamental freedoms, democracy, respect for human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law on which our societies are based".
We seek too to insert safeguards for civil liberties by basing action clearly on international human rights documents, by reinforcing the principle of ne bis in idem, by taking account of time spent in detention awaiting trial and by allowing Member States refusal to extradite when there are manifestly sound reasons for doing so, including in those cases where a person found guilty could face a penalty of death.
Moreover, we seek to provide aids to victims of terrorism and their families.
I shall ask the House to accept one amendment, which was submitted after the deadline and which takes account of the most recent developments in Council.
One Member State is threatening to block progress towards a European arrest warrant.
There is a method - not one which I recommend - but one which may be needed in extremis, in order to press ahead, and that is to invoke Article 40 of the Treaty allowing reinforced cooperation between a certain number of Member States.
Terrorism is a supranational challenge and calls for a supranational response.
We cannot allow the blockage of one Member State to prevent common action in fighting it.
When we met in this Chamber, on 12 September, we had a debate in which I remember Mr Poettering and many others said that we were all Americans.
Since then, we have discovered that we must first be Europeans.
We acknowledge that recognition of judicial judgements and judicial standards requires trust in each other's systems, but not blind trust, and for that reason I have put forward an amendment calling for urgent measures to improve judicial systems in our Member States, to encourage benchmarking, to encourage exchange of best practice.
The process of creating an area of freedom, security and justice is similar to that of creating the single market, but it is more urgent and, moreover, we are dealing not with the freedom of movement of goods, services or capital, but with the freedom of people.
The Greens and other political groups are saying, don't go ahead until you are sure that everybody's judicial standards are perfect.
Majority opinion, however, on the Committee recognises that the scope of the challenge we face and the historical imperative are such that we must press ahead with these measures with prudence, and with vigilance, but also with determination.
We must ensure effective action against terrorists and yet we must not deny legitimate political expression of grievances.
I was surprised to read in El PaÃ­s this morning an interpretation of one amendment, which I support, that it would outlaw Herri Batasuna.
I do not interpret the amendment in this way, nor would such an amendment be necessary to target those involved in supporting terrorist acts.
Other provisions in what we are proposing do that.
I would say to colleagues, and particularly to our Spanish colleagues, that in our determination to tackle terrorism, we must acknowledge that terrorists sometimes express political grievances, and that these require a political response.
Council is discussing the proposals put forward by the Commission; Parliament, which desperately needs powers of codecision, may be reconsulted on this matter.
We are determined to assist governments in their work and yet maintain the delicate balance between the security needs of our citizens and preservation of their democratic freedoms.
In this, cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs has received quite a boost.
Whatever it was that we planned at Amsterdam, the paradox is that events are what drives Europe forward: just as Mr Haider's election led us to adopt effective legislation against racism and xenophobia, so it may be that Mr bin Laden has done much for European Union integration.
May I say, finally, what a pleasure it is to see you as a fellow Liberal Democrat in the Chair in this session.
I wish you a successful debate.
, rapporteur. (DE) Madam President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the improvement of judicial cooperation between the European Union's Member States is an important key to the European area of freedom, security and justice.
The establishment, at long last, of Eurojust puts this key in our hands, so that we can combat serious crime, such as terrorism, trafficking in human beings and drug-smuggling flexibly and successfully, without regard to the Community's internal borders.
When Parliament approved the establishment of Eurojust, as long ago as early 2001, it envisaged 1 January 2002 as its starting date.
The Council has made substantial changes to the initiatives underlying Eurojust, which made it necessary to consult Parliament again, but, despite this, I do not see Eurojust's starting date early next year as having been jeopardised.
The Council has, since 11 September, demonstrated its capacity for rapid reaction when circumstances require it, as the safety of people in Europe most certainly does.
The document under consideration today already incorporates significant amendments by the Council at Parliament's suggestion in the first consultation.
Eurojust's areas of competence were therefore defined in such a way as to include borderline cases and new forms of serious crime.
Eurojust can also, moreover, at the request of a competent national authority, support investigations and prosecutions outside the areas described.
This ensures maximum flexibility and efficiency in our shared struggle against crime, which knows no boundaries.
Parliament's proposals for smooth cooperation between Eurojust and the national authorities are also welcomed in the Council's new document, something for which I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.
Despite this, we still have to make a few changes in order to make Eurojust the best possible instrument against cross-frontier crime.
If I rightly understand the indications from the Member States' governments and from the Council, these will meet with wide-ranging agreement between Parliament and the Council.
Last weekend, the German and French governments, at their summit in Nantes, underlined Parliament's view that Eurojust should become the basic unit of a European State Prosecution Service.
This would strengthen the European Union's judicial aspect, give effect to conventions that have been drawn up but not yet ratified, and continue existing initiatives in this area.
I also consider it important that Eurojust's involvement in investigations and prosecutions should not be hampered by unnecessary bureaucracy.
It makes no sense for Eurojust to set up national branch offices.
Investigators and prosecutors, in Eurojust and in the Member States, must be able to communicate with each other directly.
We know from our experience of organised crime that short routes and procedures alone can offer hope of speedy and sure success in investigations.
Let me conclude with data protection, a point which is of especial importance to me.
The processing of data by Eurojust must include an appropriately high level of protection for the individual citizen. This can only be taken for granted if the storing of personal data is kept to the minimum required and if data is not stored for longer than is absolutely necessary.
It goes without saying that special requirements must apply to the handling of data on victims and witnesses.
There is also a clear need to safeguard the individual's right to information, which he must be in a position to demand.
It is most encouraging to receive favourable indications from the Council, including in data protection matters.
I hope, though, that they will go much further yet.
Only one wish will no doubt not be granted me: Eurojust will not be based in Luxembourg, which would have symbolised so well this institution's independence and its closeness to European Community law.
Madam President, I have indeed the honour of representing the Presidency here, because, unfortunately, the Minister of Justice is unable to attend today.
I have been asked to discuss this topic on his behalf, which I naturally do with great pleasure.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, first of all, like to start by thanking you for the speed and flexibility with which you have worked over recent weeks.
The Council meeting of 20 September, and then the European Council that met the following day, decided, as you know, on rapid implementation of the Action Plan against terrorism, with a December deadline for each of the three decisions that we are discussing today, which are key elements of this action plan.
European citizens would not understand if the European Union did not work as fast as possible to adopt the measures in question.
The speed with which the rapporteurs have worked and with which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has examined the reports, and you are to discuss them today, are exemplary.
Respecting the deadlines set for adopting these decisions depended on all of that, and the Presidency is very grateful to you for that support for its work.
Madam President, first of all, I will deal with the decision creating Eurojust, then the framework decision on the European arrest warrant, and I will finish with the framework decision on combating terrorism.
I will not go back over the objectives of each of the instruments, or not much.
You know them well enough.
I would like to confine myself to the reason why you invited the Presidency here today, and I will therefore go through the preparatory work for each of the decisions.
(NL) With regard to Eurojust, the setting up of a permanent unit was one of our absolute priorities in the field of justice.
The terrorist threat has only reinforced this intention.
We are doing everything we can to ensure that this instrument is adopted in December so that we can meet the objectives of Tampere.
I am delighted to be able to inform you that everything seems to suggest that the Council will be able meet this deadline.
Admittedly, a political agreement had already been struck during the Council meeting of 27 and 28 September on Articles 1 to 8 of this Decision.
You are aware of the fact that these articles constitute the actual core of this Decree establishing Eurojust.
Under the Belgian Presidency, the working party has spent 13 meeting days on this instrument.
The entire text has already been the subject of overall reading in the working party. It has also been examined by the Article 36 Committee and is now before the COREPER.
(FR) An initial opinion from Parliament was adopted on 17 May this year but, given the many changes that had been made to the text, it became necessary to have a fresh consultation.
The Presidency has taken particular care to ensure that the opinions given by Parliament were taken into account throughout the negotiations.
Eurojust should bring real added value compared with the existing instruments.
Bringing together magistrates from the Member States in a single body will surely enable good coordination and close cooperation between the authorities responsible for prosecution.
Eurojust will thus provide an effective instrument with a view to creating the area of freedom, security and justice which has been our aim since the Treaty of Amsterdam.
To this end, we therefore needed to ensure genuine, effective cooperation between Eurojust and the other bodies created as part of our Union.
We therefore needed to be careful to avoid overlaps of responsibility and redundancies.
All these issues are covered by provisions in the draft decision.
Cooperation between Eurojust and Europol and the relationship that those two bodies will have to maintain will be the subject of a separate agreement.
This draft agreement is being drawn up by the members of the pro-Eurojust provisional unit and the representatives of Europol.
It was most desirable to include those primarily affected in the discussion and to better integrate the further developments in Europol that are currently under negotiation within the European Union.
(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in line with your wishes, Eurojust' s areas of competence have been set up in such a way as to afford Eurojust the scope needed to deal with borderline cases and new forms of crime.
Eurojust will take part in the coordination of the competent authorities of the Member States and could ask these to set up joint research teams.
The authorities of Member States which fail to meet Eurojust' s request will need to justify their actions.
A whole host of provisions in the draft Decree concern the introduction of rules to protect personal data.
After all, it was, and is, vital, on the one hand, to provide Eurojust with the possibility of dealing with such data, but, on the other hand, to offer every guarantee that privacy is protected.
The expertise gathered by the interim unit which was set up on 1 March of this year was taken into consideration.
Representatives of this unit took part in the working party and were given the opportunity of sharing their findings during those activities.
I should like to underline the fact that the activities carried out by the interim unit have more than adequately attested to the significance and value of a unit such as Eurojust, particularly over the past few weeks.
Hopefully, you will be pleased to hear that, according to the latest state of activities, it will very much be the task of your Parliament to grant Eurojust discharge for the implementation of the budget.
Despite this, a few important questions remain unanswered, although they are limited in number.
They mainly concern the modalities with regard to the right to perusal of personal data, the entry into force of the Decree and the statute of Eurojust staff.
(FR) Finally, the issue of the headquarters remains open.
It should be possible to make a decision on this at the Laeken Summit.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will finish this part of my statement by drawing your attention to the fact that, on 16 November, the Presidency insisted that the Member States prepare from now on to implement the framework decision creating Eurojust, so that it can be wholly operational as soon as possible.
Allow me to move on to the work regarding the European arrest warrant.
As you know, the Commission' s proposal is based on the principle of mutual recognition of final decisions.
That means that each national authority must recognise ipso facto, with minimal checks, a request to hand over a person made by the judicial authority of another Member State.
The European arrest warrant is meant to replace the current extradition mechanism for the crimes that it covers.
(NL) The framework decision on this arrest warrant is technically a very complex instrument, because it deals with important issues within criminal law procedure, but also with issues which, for example, pertain to the description of people which facilitates the tracing of them.
Given the extent of the tasks and the deadlines to be met, the Presidency has speeded up the Council activities considerably.
The dossier was immediately dealt with by the Article 36 Committee, thus allowing the most delicate issues to be discussed there straight away.
This has necessitated the convening of various extraordinary meetings.
Furthermore, a group of experts has also met several times in order to prepare the groundwork for the most technical aspects.
At the Article 36 Committee, the debates to date have mainly focused on the scope of the instrument that addresses the problems involved in the dual criminality requirement and on the modalities of judicial inspection within the implementing Member State.
The Member States are agreed that the scope must be determined on the basis of a positive list of infringements.
It was impossible to retain the principle of a negative list because it has appeared impossible to reach agreement about the withdrawal of the dual criminality requirement with such a broadly defined scope.
During the Justice and Internal Affairs Council of 16 November, there was broad consensus about the Presidency' s compromise proposal for a positive list and also a mock agreement to apply dual criminality to the infringements which feature on the list.
(FR) These offences are those covered by the Treaty on European Union, the Tampere conclusions, the Annex to the Europol Convention and the four offences proposed by the Commission, which are sabotage, arson, crimes against humanity according to the statute of the International Criminal Court, hijacking of aircraft and hijacking of ships.
It includes, among other things, terrorism and in the trafficking of human beings.
In order to reach a unanimous agreement, it will undoubtedly be necessary to alter the list.
The Council agreed to work on the basis of two proposals.
One envisaged that, for the offences on the list that have not yet been harmonised, the double jeopardy rule should only be withdrawn if the offence is considered to be serious in the issuing State.
That would imply a sentence threshold greater than the twelve months currently established for offences which have not been harmonised among the fifteen Member States.
Under the other proposal, removing dual criminality would be limited to offences committed wholly or partially on the territory of the issuing State, the idea being that a handover could not be refused for acts committed on the territory of the State issuing the warrant.
(NL) During the Justice and Internal Affairs Council of 16 November, the ministers managed to reach agreement on the conditions under which an appeal may be made to the rights enjoyed in the implementing State, as well as on the deadline for handing over a suspect.
The basic principles are as follows: the law of the implementing State determines the modalities under which the rights can be called upon.
In the event of the wanted person consenting to their surrender, a period of ten days is stipulated.
In the event of an arrest, a period of sixty days is stipulated and in special cases, these periods can be extended by thirty days.
The other provisions of the Commission proposal were discussed in the Article 36 Committee on 22 and 23 November.
The discussions centred around the reasons for refusing to implement the warrant and the conditions for applying the principle of territoriality and the principle of speciality.
It is too premature at this stage to moot the idea of an agreement, but the activities are very constructive and all provisions have already been discussed in detail.
(FR) Particular attention is paid, and I think, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a concern that you have expressed, to the rights of the requested person: rights to defence, rights regarding the use of languages, rights regarding transfer.
In this respect, it will be stressed that the requested person' s interest in benefiting from a judicial procedure and appearing before the judge as soon as possible should not be neglected.
Another area of obvious improvement on the current extradition procedure is deducting any detention enforced as part of the execution of the European arrest warrant in the executing State from the prison sentence that the person handed receives.
This is the state of the negotiations concerning the framework decision on the European arrest warrant.
As I have said before, there are still difficulties, but we are hopeful that they can be resolved before next week.
(NL) The third instrument, I should like to mention today, is the framework decision on the fight against terrorism.
For that decision, we can, of course, draw on the experience already gathered in connection with the two instruments I mentioned a moment ago, but that does not take away from the importance of the decision.
First of all, because it is also essential to promote judicial cooperation by harmonising penalisations.
It is crucial to develop a common strategy on terrorism and in that way to develop a truly European criminal policy in that area.
It is also vital to grant European courts of justice broad judicial powers.
But the significance of the framework decision also lies in the subtleties thereof, as some of you have rightly pointed out: all actions in connection with terrorism, including taking part in and supporting a terrorist group, must be considered.
At the same time, great care must be taken not to go too far, and accordingly, a definition should be introduced which rules out any risk of abuse.
The Council is acutely aware of this, and it is with those elements in mind that the activities are moving forwards.
They are making steady progress and that is borne out by the outcome of the meetings of 16 November.
Indeed, we can already ascertain that the changes that were made have brought the positions closer together.
(FR) The definition of terrorist offences is almost finalised.
The element of initial intention has been clarified.
Added to this are two elements that can also be characteristics of terrorist intent, namely severely intimidating the population or unduly forcing a State to carry out an act.
At the same time, the types of conduct affected have been redefined so that only extremely serious offences are covered, in response to the concerns and criticisms that the initial definition was too broad.
Two additional elements have been adopted by the Council in order to confirm the guarantees of respect for fundamental rights.
First of all, the preamble will state that the framework decision is without prejudice to the exercising of human rights, in particular, the right of association, expression and demonstration.
Also, a political declaration will add to these precautions, specifying that the decision does not cover people who are acting to preserve or restore democratic values, or people who are exercising the right to express their opinions, even if, while exercising that right, they commit offences.
Finally, the preamble will exclude from the framework decision' s scope, the activities of the armed forces in a period of armed conflict when they are performing their official duties, as governed by international law.
This is the situation with regard to the crime of terrorism itself.
(NL) With regard to judicial powers, the Council continues to attach importance to the wide scope of these judicial powers on account of the seriousness of terrorist acts.
A coordination mechanism will be brought about in the event of any conflict of judicial powers among the Member States, which is not inconceivable, given the wide judicial powers of the same States.
Progress continues to be made in the activities in the field of punishment.
The current text provides for the obligation on all Member States to increase penalties for punishable acts of terrorism compared to the same acts without any terrorist intent.
The debates which were held on this topic last Friday in the COREPER were about the very same punishment for punishable acts which are associated with terrorist groups.
Consensus appears to be growing about a maximum penalty of fifteen years for leading a terrorist group and of eight years for taking part in such a group.
If the group has not yet carried out any acts of terrorism, the leading of such a group also incurs an eight year sentence.
However, the debates on this issue have not yet been completed.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that brings to an end the account that I wished to give of the three Council framework decisions that are on your agenda today.
As I have already said, the Presidency expects to see the discussions on these three instruments completed between now and December.
That would certainly be an amazing feat, given the Council' s loaded schedule, but it will, above all, show, on the eve of the Laeken Summit, that the European Union has now achieved a certain maturity in the development of European criminal justice and that it is capable of realising the objectives that it set itself.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on her report on the creation of the Eurojust unit.
The ideas that the Commission expressed on this matter in its communication of November 2000 and the recommendations adopted by the European Parliament in May of this year, following the report by Mrs Gebhardt, are, to a large extent, echoed in the text that is now being studied by the Council.
I shall, therefore, limit myself to emphasising two or three aspects in greater detail.
Firstly, as Mrs Gebhardt stated, in the version currently under examination, the rules on the protection of personal data have been extended and improved.
The draft document adopts a balanced approach that respects both the legitimate interests and fundamental rights of Europe' s citizens and the need for the effective coordination of investigations and prosecutions.
There will be an independent joint supervisory body for data protection and, if necessary, legal solutions will be provided for appeals to be lodged in national courts.
Secondly, the role of the Union' s institutions has been strengthened and the Commission is fully involved in the work of Eurojust in its various areas of responsibility.
Parliament will be kept fully informed of the budgetary issues and I hope that it will also be given the task of discharging the budget.
Mrs Gebhardt' s excellent report also includes a list of supplementary amendments, most of which meet with the Commission' s approval.
I shall only mention the examples of the amendments concerning membership of the joint supervisory body for personal data, cooperation with OLAF, the Commission' s anti-fraud body, and Eurojust, Parliament' s discharge of the budget, the time limits for the storage of data and the law applicable in the event of damage resulting from incorrect data processing.
I hope that the Council will also bear these suggestions in mind.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the other two initiatives under consideration, the events of 11 September 2001 have, I am sad to say, confirmed the validity of the recommendations adopted by the European Parliament on 5 September 2001, following an own-initiative report drawn up by Graham Watson.
As Commissioner responsible for Justice and Home Affairs, I wish to congratulate and pay public tribute to Mr Watson, the Chairman of Parliament' s Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, whose efforts and name will always be associated with this initiative of enormous political scope; the fight against terrorism and against crime in the European Union.
The recommendations in the Watson report, published in September, were, to a large extent, taken into account in the proposals presented by the Commission on 19 September which are now being studied by the Council.
I wish firstly to discuss the proposal for a framework decision on combating terrorism.
The Council debate on this proposal has focused on the three most important and, at the same time, most problematic issues: defining terrorist crime, clarifying the rules of jurisdiction for the prosecution of terrorist acts and the framework of penalties and sanctions applicable to terrorist acts.
With regard to definition, there has been concern to ensure that the framework decision cannot, under any circumstances, apply to legitimate action, for example in the context of the activities of unions or anti-globalisation movements.
The Commission has subscribed to this interpretation from the outset and considers that the solution we are working towards respects the basic structure of the Commission' s initial proposal, which is to, "define a terrorist offence on the basis of the identification of an objective factor: the terrorist act, accompanied by the identification of a subjective element: a terrorist motivation under the terms of the proposal" . This is the text currently under consideration by the Council.
At the same time, the solution also provides more detail on allowing the requirements that must be met for the offence included in the positive list to be considered a terrorist offence, to be identified in legislation itself. We are, therefore, in favour of improving the definition contained in the text currently being studied by the Council.
This aspect, in fact, provides a further guarantee: no common crime, not even acts of violence committed incidentally in the context of certain demonstrations, will be covered by the instrument to eliminate terrorism.
The Council is currently considering the possibility of issuing a statement explaining that anyone acting in the interest of preserving or restoring democratic values, instances of which occurred in some Member States during the Second World War, cannot be considered to be a terrorist.
This aspect is in line with some of the amendments tabled by Parliament to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms on which our countries are founded cannot, under any circumstances, be endangered by the present framework decision.
With regard to jurisdiction, the debate in the Council is close to reaching a solution that is very similar to the one recommended in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament.
There is consensus in Council on a balanced formula that combines the Commission' s initial proposal and the more ambitious project suggested by some Member States and by Parliament on national jurisdictions being extended to cover the entire territory of the Union.
Consequently, Member States can, if they so desire, extend their jurisdiction if the offence has been committed in any part of the Union' s territory.
With regard to the third issue, that of penalties and sanctions, I would say that this is still the main problem with the framework decision, given the lack of consensus on a common level of penalties and sanctions for individual terrorist offences.
The Commission is not yet satisfied with the approach that is currently applied for individual offences, under which the penalties and sanctions applicable to terrorist offences committed by individuals would not be harmonised. Instead, weightier penalties and sanctions than those provided for under national legislation for the same offences committed without the special intention required for classification as terrorist acts would apply.
If we limit our ambitions in this way, we will not be fulfilling the mandate laid down in the Article 31(e) of the Treaty, nor will we be following the recommendation contained in the Watson report.
Furthermore, we would be acting inconsistently since, in previous instruments, we have managed to adopt common penalties and sanctions for the counterfeiting of the euro, for assisting illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings, and it would be inexplicable not to be equally ambitious when it comes to punishing terrorist acts.
I hope that it is possible to find a solution on the basis of the proposal that the Commission presented on creating a range of penalties and sanctions for the individual offences listed in Articles 1 and 2 of the Commission proposal, with greater flexibility to adapt them to the scale of penalties in force in the national legislation of each Member State.
Lastly, this framework decision stipulates that the Member States must adopt all possible measures to guarantee appropriate assistance to the families of victims, implementing, where possible, Article 4 of the Framework Decision on the Status of Victims in Connection with Criminal Proceedings.
This approach is entirely consistent with Parliament' s point of view.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the second framework decision, on the European arrest warrant, must be based on the principle of the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, in line with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, and with the recommendation made to us by the Heads of State and Government at the Ghent European Council of October this year.
The text we are now discussing, submitted by the Presidency, includes a positive list of offences for which a double jeopardy verification does not have to be carried out.
As you know, the Commission proposal that is being discussed today seeks to make the abolition of the double jeopardy rule universal, with the exception of a negative list identified by the Commission.
Since the Ghent European Council, it has become clear that this approach by the Commission would not have majority support in Council.
Hence the Presidency has moved ahead with a compromise proposal, which assumes that the execution of an arrest warrant for offences included in the positive list does not require double jeopardy verification.
The Commission is prepared to support this compromise proposal by the Presidency provided that the definition of offences included on this positive list is substantial and that it sends a clear, unequivocal message that we are strengthening the mechanisms of judicial cooperation to fight against the various forms of transnational organised crime.
In order to ensure that the mechanism of the positive list works and is effective, the definition of the offences on this list must respect the definition of these offences in force in the legislation of the Member States issuing a search and arrest warrant.
This is an essential component.
Unless this component is complied with, the double jeopardy condition would also be reintroduced for these offences, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.
I think that we are approaching an agreement on the content of the positive list.
However, at the moment, this agreement is not yet completely signed and sealed.
I hope that, by the Council of 6 and 7 December, it will be possible to conclude a unanimous agreement on a substantial positive list that fulfils the objective of a mechanism for an effective European arrest warrant that can be implemented in a straightforward way.
Regarding the last aspect that I wish to focus on, the Commission has included in its proposal a set of rules that are intended to reconcile effectiveness in the fight against crime, on the one hand, and the protection of citizens' rights and fundamental freedoms on the other.
I hope that the Council resists the temptation to remove provisions that offer protection on the grounds that they are not necessary, since the Member States are, in any event, bound to respect legal safeguards.
It is true that one of the essential elements for the creation of this mechanism is the principle of mutual trust that has resulted from the Member States signing up to the Council of Europe' s European Convention of Human Rights of 1950 and from having jointly proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in December of 2000.
I would say, however, that it is, nevertheless, important to emphasise some specific mechanisms that should be included in this framework decision in order to guarantee and safeguard the fundamental rights of our citizens.
Other amendments along the same lines consist of bringing the wording of the Ne bis in idem rule, laid down in Article 29 of the Commission' s proposal, into line with the wording of Article 50 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights so as to obviate the requirement for the arrest warrant to be accompanied by proof that the individual has been duly informed of the procedure in time to prepare a defence in the event that he or she is sentenced in absentia.
Another good example of these rules is the deduction of the period of deprivation of liberty from the punishment laid down in Article 24 of the Commission proposal, which states that the period of detention in the Member State executing the warrant must be taken into account for the purposes of calculating compensation in the event that the individual surrendered is not convicted.
There must be a balance between the need for speed and effective cooperation between judicial authorities and the interests of individuals, who must not be subjected to additional or excessive constraints or have their ability to mount a defence hampered.
The Commission feels that it would be desirable, where the identification of the laws and principles that safeguard fundamental rights in a European judicial area is concerned, to extend these rules. The Commission realises, therefore, that it would be desirable to pursue the task of approximating legislation on criminal proceedings in the Member States.
We must, simultaneously, guarantee the effectiveness of prosecutions and the safeguarding of the rights of individuals.
It may, therefore, prove necessary at Union level to address, in a more concerted way, the right to language assistance, the proper treatment of evidence and the issue of the courts' bail system.
The Commission is considering the possibility of issuing a communication on these aspects that could cover a huge range of factors.
These issues require a horizontal approach and, therefore, we propose finalising them at a later date in a specific mechanism.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude by referring to Mr Watson' s proposal for an oral amendment that was tabled here today.
Now that we are debating the Commission' s position, we must step up negotiations to conclude an agreement supported by all fifteen Member States.
Not an agreement at any price, but an agreement that responds to the challenge of the fight against terrorism and organised crime before us.
We also welcome the Belgian Presidency' s commitment to obtaining this agreement.
I also wish to make it clear, however, that, where the European arrest warrant is concerned, an agreement can certainly be concluded on the list of thirty-four offences to which Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has just referred.
I must also clearly state that the list does not include minor offences because this is a list annexed to the Europol Convention.
I would also say that, if these offences are considered to be offences that warrant police cooperation under the terms of Europol, they must also be considered to be unquestionably serious for the purposes of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
Regardless of national legal cultures and regardless of the moral censure that a particular offence might generate at national level, I am convinced that the option we should pursue at the moment is to conclude an agreement with all fifteen Member States, a substantial agreement on the list of offences to which the European arrest warrant should apply.
If this agreement cannot be concluded with all fifteen countries, we will then have to consider what to do next.
Madam President, I think that today our thoughts should focus on the basics, which are the good fortune and responsibility of living in democratic States governed by the rule of law.
In a democratic State governed by the rule of law, any political demand is acceptable and to be respected and the democratic confrontation of ideas is always to be welcomed; these are our standards, our very essence, our identifying mark, on which the whole idea of European integration is founded.
By the same token, however, the democratic State governed by the rule of law rejects those who express their ideas through bloodshed.
When faced with those who sow the seeds of terror, death and destruction in our societies, there is only one dialogue possible, the dialogue that arises from the implementation of the law.
This is our guiding thought on this matter.
I said that we are constructing, on the bases and principles of our legal systems in democratic States governed by the rule of law, a democratic Europe governed by the rule of law.
We had a situation that was completely lacking in balance between progress in the field of security and progress in the field of freedom and justice.
The three proposals debated respond, and it was about time, to a request from Europe' s citizens and to the clear political will, at the highest level, of the Heads of State and Government, which, as Mr Watson has clearly pointed out, runs from Vienna to Tampere, and has been strengthened since 11 September at the Extraordinary European Council in Brussels and in Ghent.
These three methods also respond to the principles upon which Europe has been constructed.
Firstly, cooperation and coordination, as seen in Eurojust, where we cooperate and coordinate in order to be more effective in the field of justice.
Secondly, the mutual recognition on which the internal market is based, and this, as the Commissioner has said, a corollary of the confidence between States, which is the fundamental element of the European search and arrest warrant.
Finally, harmonisation wherever this may be necessary and the need for harmonisation with regard to terrorism is obvious, because only six Member States had any legislation covering this area.
Madam President, I trust, no, I am sure, that by voting for these reports with an overwhelming majority tomorrow, Parliament will be giving, as it always has, the political signal that, as responsible representatives of the citizens, we have the obligation to work on the construction of democratic States governed by the rule of law, in those countries in which we are fortunate enough to live.
Madam President, since 11 September, there have been many opportunities to think about and debate upon the consequences of the events of that fateful day and today is no exception.
Without a doubt, the attacks in New York have made us realise that nobody can feel entirely safe from terrorism. When a man and a woman are murdered in BeasaÃ­n, as happened last week, for example, each and every one of us is affected, and it is not reasonable to ask the elected representatives of a democracy, Mr Watson, to have to debate under the threat of death.
These events have also reminded us that we were a long way behind in meeting the commitments that the Heads of State and Government had given in Tampere in order to develop the third pillar of the European Union.
The report that we approved by a large majority in committee contains contributions which, in my opinion, are very valid, to the otherwise excellent Commission proposal. For example, to define street violence as clearly being one form of terrorist expression, or to incorporate a reference to victims and their families and to offer political support and legal protection with the aim of identifying terrorism and bringing terrorists and their supporters to justice through the courts.
This is precisely the purpose of the amendment we tabled in plenary and should be interpreted in this way.
I hope that these and other contributions will be added to the text that the Council is debating, and, in particular, this latter amendment, which I hope the rapporteur will also vote for and will be taken into consideration when the European list of terrorist organisations that Parliament requested is drawn up.
The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs should fulfil their duty on the 6 and 7 December, and if they do not do so, the Presidency will have to honour its commitment to Parliament to take this issue at Laeken, and if any Member State there is tempted to block a proposal that has the widespread support of our citizens, it seems appropriate to me that closer cooperation should be implemented according to provisions of Article 40 of the Treaty.
The Council' s requests do not date from 11 September.
In September 2000, one year ago, the vast majority of MEPs signed a written declaration requesting the methods that today have been submitted for our consideration. These are the same methods that we are asking the Commission for in the own-initiative report on the role of the European Union in the fight against terrorism that we approved, also by a very large majority, on 5 September.
Therefore, it needs to be made very clear that none of these measures makes the slightest reduction in the civil liberties of European citizens.
The opposite is the case, we are giving the judicial system instruments to enable it to better protect everyone' s freedom because, faced with the free movement of crime, we must open the doors to the free movement of justice.
Madam President, the two provisions we are debating today respond to both a conviction and an objective: the conviction that we can defeat terrorism and our objective to strengthen the Rule of Law, providing all the instruments necessary to achieve this.
In a democracy, political ideas are put to the test in the voting booth, and not put forward by terrorists.
I am sure that all my fellow Members are of this opinion.
I would like to clearly point out what will be changed by these two initiatives when they are adopted by the Laeken European Council : firstly, Europe will cease to 'show solidarity with' and instead be 'responsible for' .
The solidarity of Europeans with Spanish democrats in their fight against ETA will give way to the responsibility of all European democrats to defeat terrorism.
Secondly, and with regard to the European search and arrest warrant, agreements between governments will be replaced with recognition and cooperation between their various judicial systems.
An injunction will have to be able to be executed without delay, whether it has been issued by a Spanish judge or a French judge, against an individual who is sought in one or other of the countries.
To make my position clear, I feel there should be no more disgraceful spectacles such as the one that took place at Olano.
As well as thinking about the future, however, I cannot help but think with a certain degree of bitterness that these two provisions have come far too late, for the victims.
How different their lives would have been if we had done this earlier!
If only this had been done ten years ago, I am sure that ETA would, by now, have been defeated, and that many of my close friends who have been murdered by ETA would still be here with us, still taking their children to school, giving lectures, writing articles for the press, administering justice, representing their voters.
I would, therefore, ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to reflect upon this tomorrow before you vote.
I would like you to consider that the consequences of this will not only be political, but will, more than anything, be of a human nature, and I would ask the Council to rise, in political terms, to this occasion, and not to miss this opportunity.
There are those that think that politics is the art of the possible.
My opinion is that the purpose of politics is to make what is necessary possible.
I trust that the Fifteen will share this opinion.
I assure you that the defeat of terrorism is possible, and, ladies and gentlemen, you do not realise just how necessary this is.
Madam President, the argument that the anti-terrorism measures and the European arrest warrant do not skimp on fundamental rights, is only sustainable if the protection system of the European Convention on Human Rights for defendants is adhered to in practice.
But that is dependant on the ability of every single judge in the European Union to understand and apply ECHR provisions. We have no coherent EU programme to ensure they do.
Lest I be thought chauvinist in raising the problem of Britons in Greece, let me criticise my own government in the UK.
They are trying to put through an anti-terrorism bill with a derogation from the ECHR in order to detain suspects without a proper trial, with no legal representation, no judicial review and without being able to hear the evidence given by the intelligence services.
This certainly leaves the UK lacking credibility in a campaign for mutual raising of standards in the EU.
Another worrying development in the UK is the intention to let police and security cooperation measures slip through the Westminster Parliament without proper democratic scrutiny.
Here we debate, but we have no equality with Ministers in deciding the legislation.
Coupled with Council secrecy, this means a very unsatisfactory position in terms of democracy, justice and human rights.
Finally, may I make a direct appeal to Commissioner Vitorino to ensure that organisations acting in the field of raising justice standards, such as the admirable Fair Trials Abroad, can be assisted under the Community budget.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against terrorism is an absolute necessity, the legitimacy of which should not be questioned or we could see our democracies collapse.
However, under no circumstances should it serve as a pretext for gagging our fundamental rights and democratic freedoms.
How can we justify a European proposal to combat terrorism if no added value can be gained from it?
Under the current legislation of the Member States, perpetrators of attacks could not go unpunished.
As the public enemy number one is terrorism, why not limit the European arrest warrant to terrorist offences?
If the illegal capture of State or government facilities, public modes of transport, infrastructures or public places constitutes a terrorist offence or if the legitimate expression of our freedoms of expression and association, our trade union rights, could, in the future, be criminalised or described as terrorism, if those elements are retained, by voting in favour of these reports we will be renouncing all of our democratic rights.
An explicit guarantee of these rights and freedoms must be included in this proposal for a framework directive.
Our fears also extend to certain offences that could fall under the warrant, as the criterion used is that of the sentence, while the accused persons may deserve protection, for example if they are migrants or asylum seekers.
Even those giving support to those people would, in the future, become guilty of terrorism.
A minimum degree of harmonisation of Member States' criminal procedures is necessary in order to safeguard the principle of equality before the law and guarantee the protection of rights in the principle of collegiality.
Furthermore, as minors cannot be the subjects of an arrest warrant, their description for criminal purposes also needs to be harmonised.
If we are to establish an area of security, freedom and justice, these three dimensions need to be fully effective.
Unfortunately, we observe that the security aspect is dominating the policies of the Union and the Member States.
The fight against terrorism needs to be reflected in security for all residents, without exception and in total respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Finally, if a new text has to be adopted by the Council in the future, we hope that this House will be consulted once again.
Madam President, there is an ongoing relationship between the constraints on individual and collective freedoms in the United States and those in Europe, just as there is an ongoing connection in the matter of such freedoms that has been maintained by the United Kingdom government, first with the Reagan/Thatcher partnership and now with the Bush/Blair partnership.
Many European governments are using the criminal terrorist action of 11 September against the United States as an excuse to issue further legislation curbing freedoms which has nothing to do with combating terrorism.
Leaving aside the special military tribunals set up by President Bush, it is enough to reflect upon the recent laws issued or proposed in Italy or in the United Kingdom in order to understand that their objective is to curb and control growing political opposition to a world social and economic order which is unfair and inhuman: the wealth, well-being, growth and development of a fifth of the human race are mirrored by the starvation, lack of resources, ongoing economic decline and underdevelopment of the other four fifths.
It is strange that we can never manage to find a legal formula to define this major social massacre as an act of terrorism, while we had no hesitation in labelling as terrorist acts all those demonstrations of social opposition which have taken place recently in Seattle, Genoa and so forth.
Article 3 of the proposal for a framework decision on terrorism sends a clear message to all those who, in the future, attempt to show their opposition to the neo-liberal monopoly on thinking and the resulting social system.
Women, men, workers, students, the unemployed, pacifists and ecologists will no longer be opposing the system but will be terrorists because - as Hegel, then an old man, wrongly said - 'the real is rational and the rational real' , and for our legislators nothing is more real than the present social and economic disorder and nothing is more irrational, and therefore terrorist, than the need to overthrow and eliminate it.
Lastly, I would like to make it clear that I do support the European arrest warrant and that, as an Italian, I condemn the fact that my country' s government should be the one to oppose a unanimous decision.
It is shameful because the intention of the Berlusconi government in adopting this position is to prevent corruption being listed among the offences on the 'positive' list.
Madam President, after the events of 11 September, Europe and the European institutions must also assume their responsibility and find the courage to achieve a joint agreement between the Member States on combating terrorism and, in general, combating organised crime, without delay.
The legal instruments which will make this fight genuinely effective include the European arrest warrant, which will, at last, replace the complex and excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures which have now become insufficient and inadequate for fighting crime, particularly international crime.
That said, we need to move one step at a time.
The emotion of the tragic terrorist attacks of recent months must certainly prompt us to strengthen judicial cooperation between the Member States without delay, but in speeding up this process we must take things one step at a time and act responsibly.
Indeed, good laws are not compatible with haste or with lack of precision or emotional reactions, particularly when it comes to identifying the offences in respect of which the European arrest warrant is to be applied.
We would therefore express our concern at the Belgian Presidency' s proposal to apply the European arrest warrant to a list of around 30 categories of offences immediately.
In our opinion, terrorism or the trafficking of human beings, to give just two examples, cannot be placed on the same level as counterfeiting or forgery.
It would therefore be more in the general interest to propose and adopt, first of all, with the unanimous consent of all the Member States, an initial, limited list and then, subsequently, to extend this list gradually, thus focusing initially on terrorist crimes, organised crime, the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings and the exploitation of minors.
Mr President, naturally, measures must be taken to combat terrorism. That much is clear.
Upon reflection, however, it is interesting to note in this context that most countries have adequate rules.
That being said, an extension to the mutual obligation to hand over wanted criminals might be contemplated, but it should be far more restricted than provided for here.
Having said that, I want to say that I have difficulty finding words strong enough to express my rejection of the proposals before us.
That rejection is something I express not only as a politician but, first and foremost, as a lawyer.
I want to say that it is difficult to find even one lawyers' organisation of any kind in the Member States that wishes to endorse these proposals.
They all have major or minor reservations, and many are forthright in their rejection of them because it is a case of the end justifying the means, and the means to be used amount to a violation of what are fundamental ideals in terms of legal rights, something which, for example, Denmark' s General Council of the Bar has come out very strongly against.
In my view, this panic reaction has meant that these proposals have been treated with a quite scandalous disregard for any basic demand that they be properly examined.
These fundamental legal reforms, which are among the most complicated of legislative matter and require an extensive consultation procedure, are to be implemented without any substantial debate on the issues involved and on the basis of, if I may say so, Commissioner, what is, to put it mildly, inadequate preparation.
It is unpleasantly reminiscent of political 'body-snatching' , and that is a violation of fundamental legal rights.
Madam President, there is a pressing need to harmonise judicial standards but I would like to draw the attention of the President and the Members to the need to harmonise the roles of the intelligence and anti-terrorist bodies as well, for otherwise harmonising judicial standards will serve no purpose.
Current events show just how necessary this is, irrespective of the many considerations put forward by Members from the left side of the House which have the effect of shifting our attention away from the numerous dangers presented by the way terrorist groups work and are interconnected.
In fact, by way of example, the revelations published today in the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica on the change of hands of important nuclear material which is already part of the stock owned by the Mobutu regime, offer a very serious perspective on this trafficking which has taken place and may still be taking place at this very moment in the States of the European Union.
The story of this transaction, the protagonist of which was a former governmental ambassador who was moving freely throughout Europe by virtue of his status as a political refugee, is incredible.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually tragic that it took an event like the dramatic terrorist attacks in New York and in Washington to rouse Europe, and the European Council in particular, from slumber, but I am glad that we have managed in such a very short time to put together a package - a counter-terrorism package.
It extends from money laundering, by way of the freezing of accounts, to the measures we are discussing today.
I am glad that, at last, terrorism is defined as an offence in all fifteen Member States and not just in six, as was formerly the case, and can therefore be proceeded against.
I am glad that there is the hope of a European arrest warrant.
I hope that national animosities do not again lead to the postponement of this European arrest warrant, which we so urgently need.
Just go back to Parliament's proposal, when, I believe, the position we took up was a good one.
I am glad that we will make Eurojust a reality and that the enlarged powers to combat terrorism take us another step forward in the right direction.
I am glad that Europol will have joint investigative teams.
All this is very positive in that we are showing the public just what added value the European Union can have.
I demand, though, that currently unresolved points in certain areas be dealt with.
The Member States must finally be required, and with consequences in the event of their non-compliance, to supply Europol with information and to ensure optimum coordination between Eurojust and Europol and appropriate parliamentary management and monitoring.
Parliament has made some excellent proposals on this point, and I congratulate the rapporteur and the whole team of shadow rapporteurs.
I hope that the excellent work they have done will meet with complete support tomorrow.
Following the attacks of 11 September, policy against terrorism had to be tightened in Europe too.
The Commission proposal on the definition and penalty standards for acts of terrorism therefore deserves our support.
However, the Commission proposal on a European arrest warrant with a general scope, and which abolishes the dual criminality requirement across the board is met with less enthusiasm.
This is a bridge too far for a variety of reasons: it pushes countries with a milder climate in terms of criminal law into the defensive and calls into question the fairness of the course of justice.
The proposed general scope is no longer related to combating terrorism.
As such, it constitutes no ground for the enormous political pressure and the break-neck speed of the decision-making process.
Such a proposal revolutionises the application of national and European criminal law and therefore deserves a well considered and transparent decision-making process, preceded by a proper public debate.
Moreover, Parliament is forced to pronounce judgment on the Commission proposal while the Council has, in fact, already turned it on its head: a positive list instead of a negative one, and behind closed doors.
One can hope and expect that the discussion in the Council will eventually culminate in an acceptable compromise, but we do not know this yet and neither are we voting on this tomorrow.
This is why this plenary debate and the vote in this form and at this time are a little absurd and premature, in fact.
For that reason, the delegations of the Dutch Labour Party will abstain from tomorrow' s vote on the Commission proposal for a European arrest warrant.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I will adopt a slightly different position from that of the previous speaker. The Members of the European Free Alliance will approve the measures to combat terrorism.
We want to strengthen the criminal law measures to combat terrorism.
However, we do want to underline that the term terrorism is to be defined as proposed by the European Parliament, for I am a little wary in that respect.
A moment ago, we discussed the procedural motions on train and plane spotting in Greece and on the people who are imprisoned in this connection.
You may well say that this is a completely unrelated matter, but the sense of justice is very different in the different countries.
Similarly, the keenness with which some label anything and everything as terrorism, makes me a little suspicious.
But the measures should not be exploited by the authorities and neither should it be possible to exploit them.
Some of our representatives of the European Free Alliance struggle more with the European arrest warrant. The approval we grant in this connection is clearly conditional.
The guarantees we want to give are contained in the EP amendments which will hopefully be adopted and which we really consider to be minimum requirements.
If the Council refuses to accept these, we will review our position and convince our colleagues in the national parliaments of the fact that better protection of citizens' freedoms is necessary for a fair course of justice.
In other words, this is about minimum conditions, but further to the speeches of both the acting President-in-Office and Commissioner Vitorino, we are quite optimistic about the right direction which this could be heading.
It is, of course, clear that we must be able to make further progress in the harmonisation of legislation, and in the European judicial procedures involving a European public prosecutor, etc. A number of people put the federalisation of the Third Pillar first and foremost, and maybe we need to be more pro-active in this direction.
We will not tolerate normal, democratic opposition being muzzled or suppressed, or the actions of trade unions and of movements and associations being thwarted in the name of combating terrorism.
But more than anything, we also want progress to be made in the fight against internationally organised crime.
I have first-hand experience of hopeless situations in the fight to surrender people of whom it had been clearly proven that they had committed crimes.
I therefore want to give you my unqualified support in this matter, but subject to the conditions I have announced.
Madam President, I too would like to join others in welcoming the opportunity to have this debate.
The time is so short that it will not allow us to get fully into all the intricacies and details.
However, I can say at the outset that every one of us is in common cause in opposing terrorism and violence of any kind to further political or other aims To that end, we would support coordination and cooperation between the Member States in protecting the rights and interests of each of the Member States and of the European Union as a whole, as well as its 370 million citizens.
At the Tampere summit we took the first step towards that process.
However, what is before us here today with regard to the European arrest warrant represents a major interference in and alteration of the national criminal justice systems and the civil rights and protections afforded to each individual within each of the Member States.
It is a mistake to move this far, this quickly, without properly understanding or fully recognising the differences between the criminal systems within the European Union.
Therefore, I would urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by myself and my colleagues, in particular, Amendments Nos 92 to 101, which put in place firstly, the requirement for a judicial review or a right to appeal against the warrant at both the executing and issuing stage, secondly, a common list of positive offences, which must be drawn up and not used as a stumbling block, thirdly, no interference with the double jeopardy rule, fourthly, that there must be prima facie evidence presented before the warrant can be enforced, and finally, to ensure that there is a quick trial process where a warrant is issued.
I have represented constituents in other Member States in the European Union where they have been held without trial for two years, without getting any opportunity for habeas corpus or any opportunity to present their case.
Finally, on the overall package on combating terrorism, we have to ensure respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms.
It is no good for the Commissioner to say that we have the Charter of Fundamental Rights: That is only a non-legally binding political decision.
Each Member State has signed up to the European Convention of Human Rights which puts in place specific provisions for each individual.
I note that one Member State, just in the last week, has ridden roughshod over the rights and liberties of individuals.
We as a European Parliament, representatives of a transnational organisation, should not allow this to continue.
I would like to use the brief speaking time I have to highlight the plight of the too-soon forgotten victims of terrorism.
I sat in the home of one of my constituents the other day, a woman who lost her husband because he was a member of the army and had been killed by IRA terrorists.
When she came to get compensation for her three sons - just young boys - they offered her a paltry few hundred pounds for each son.
I could go on and list a sad litany of how terrorist victims have been treated.
This Parliament should realise that these people need special treatment.
The governments responsible should ensure that treatment is provided to bring some alleviation of the awful hurt and sorrow they bear.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very difficult to talk about such sensitive issues when there is so little time available but I would like to confirm that, contrary to what many speakers have said, we have increased protection following 11 September and drawn up a raft of measures which include those we are debating this evening.
However, last year, we instituted Eurojust and we have already delivered one major opinion, as has been mentioned, to the effect that Eurojust should harmonise judicial cooperation within Europe.
Today, we are taking a large step forward.
We are taking a quantum leap towards laying the foundations for the institution of a European public prosecutor in the future, and I therefore feel that the area of justice in which all this is taking place is gaining in significance, and it is not an area of repression, Mr Vitorino, but an area of freedom.
I am sure you have drawn inspiration from these principles.
I believe that this is an issue of primary importance on which we are about to deliver an opinion and which we feel will certainly open up a whole world of cooperation and solidarity in this area.
There are clearly specific problems and they clearly concern the arrest warrant, which merits close reflection.
Only Mr Di Lello could be so superficial and irresponsible as to cast such hasty aspersions on the Italian government.
I do not feel this is fair.
The legal institutions have their own procedures, and we are fine-tuning this European procedural law, this European area, but it is clear that we must proceed with great caution and not draw up a list of offences, for we would never finish adding to it, and any list of offences will clearly never be comprehensive.
We must realise that transnational crimes do exist, that the crime of international terrorism does exist, Madam President, and that it is a sensitive, significant and tragic issue in today' s society.
All we have to do, and it must be our priority, to combat it is, of course, to coordinate the activities.
Italian procedural law, for example, has its own peculiarities, and we hope that there will be reasoned, active unanimity within the Council.
Thank you, Madam President.
I certainly welcome the fact that, today, we are finally debating these two reports: the Watson report and the Gebhardt report, although it is unfortunate that this should be a consequence of the tragic events of 11 September in the United States.
However, I think that there is an opportunity here.
We can make an advance of fundamental importance, a giant step forward in complying with the Tampere agreements and in creating a European area of freedom, security and justice, that everybody wants, respecting the balance between freedom and security, the importance of which no one doubts.
And, most importantly, we shall be able to provide our own small contribution to the solution of this difficult, complex and painful problem that weighs heavy upon us and knows no borders, which is terrorism.
Parliament carried out its work before 11 September and it continues to do so now: I am referring to the Resolution we approved on 5 September.
The Commission has proved its fast reflexes in proposing the framework decisions that we are debating today.
We hope that the European Council is also able to rise to the occasion and makes the right decisions as along the lines of those made by the Commission and that Parliament is making today, and that, at the Laeken Summit, it responds to the demands of Europe' s citizens to close the net ever tighter on terrorists and terrorism in general, despite the technical difficulties, and to appropriately punish the guilty parties who have spilt the blood of so many innocent people and who have cruelly and pointlessly ended so many lives.
Madam President, when we were discussing the Schengen Agreement, one of the most frequent objections raised was that the borders would stop policemen and judges but not criminals.
That was a logical objection, although the Schengen Agreement did represent a step forward.
Well then, the instruments that the Council is about to adopt now, particularly the European arrest warrant, are the answer to these objections.
At last, borders will no longer stop judges and police.
I therefore see the European arrest warrant as a huge step forward in European integration too, and that is why I find the position of the Italian government, which is showing concern at the inclusion of offences, particularly financial offences, in this list, frankly incomprehensible.
I hope that the government will review its position in the coming days and I call upon the Commission and the Council of Ministers to pursue this path, which I feel is quite appropriate given that investigations of any kind include inquiries of this nature.
I would, moreover, point out that, last July, Parliament - including Mr Gargani and the Forza Italia group too - almost unanimously adopted the other Watson motion, which called precisely upon the Council to adopt a decision providing for a European search and arrest warrant in the area, and I would stress this, of corruption and fraud as well.
There is, therefore, already a precedent but, in any case, I feel that this is the right path to take to achieve security and justice in Italy and Europe.
Madam President, I come from a country that has been stunned by the most atrocious totalitarian horror, which seeks to spread terror by indiscriminate and relentless killings.
I can say, with pride, looking at my colleague BÃ¡rbara DÃŒhrkop, and at so many victims, and almost with emotion, that in my country, nobody has given into the temptation of implementing or asking for emergency measures.
Something that has never been understood and which no one has ever been able to tolerate in Spain is that once murderers have crossed a border that, theoretically, no longer exists, they are not pursued with the same vigour with which they are pursued in Spain.
There is no technical reason, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that can justify this, and no European citizen will accept the explanation that, for technical reasons, we are unable to make progress on tracking down terror and crime.
A common definition of the crime of terrorism and common sanctions are needed, as we have heard the Commission say so many times, to prevent there being safe havens in Europe where criminals can escape prosecution.
These measures would also send out a clear political message of the European Unions' commitment to this issue.
We can say the same of the proposal for the mutual recognition of final decisions that we have agreed to call the European search and arrest warrant.
We support the Commission' s proposals for improvements on extradition between Member States and the elimination of the double jeopardy rule.
I also hope that the Council will take Parliament' s wishes into consideration.
I think, Madam President, that extending judicial cooperation in the fight against terrorism and crime is the way to become more effective whilst not reducing, by any means, the very freedom that terrorists and criminals are seeking to destroy.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would first of all like to rectify an omission during my presentation.
I forgot to thank and congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work and I therefore do so now.
I feel that today' s debate is a very good illustration of the difficulty of the exercise, if I may use that word, of the task that we have before us, which consists of accepting both what Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ has just said, namely that terrorists should not have the freedom to repeat the atrocious crimes that they have committed, but, at the same time, we need to ensure that the fundamental freedoms which we all hold dear are also respected.
That, in a nutshell, is what is making our task so difficult.
I have tried to explain to you the approach that we are taking to this matter and that we have the twofold concern to work quickly but not negligently, to ensure respect for our fundamental freedoms as well, which should be constant, including the right to defence for those who are accused and including victim' s rights, as the victims should also receive all the necessary attention and care. We are trying to combine all of that, and it is clearly not an easy task, especially because, as you well know and has also been pointed out in this debate, what is more, the different Member States do not have the same legal or judicial traditions.
All of that needs to be reconciled too.
What I can tell you, and this is my final point, is that we will continue to keep this twofold concern in mind, and it is with this in mind that we will try, with the support and guidance of the Commission, of course, to complete our task successfully.
Finally, just to be on the safe side, I want to confirm once again, as I did during my introductory speech, that we will, of course, ensure that action taken in the context of the exercising of political or trade union rights can under no circumstances be defined as a terrorist act or, therefore, engender the application of the new mechanisms that we are working.
Madam President, I would firstly like to say to Mr Krarup that no, we have not acted hastily, we have been working for over a year in consultation with national experts and university lecturers.
We have always listened to experts.
It cannot be said that our proposal has not been thought out.
I categorically refute this.
Secondly, I would like to say that there is no need to worry, ladies and gentlemen.
As the Minister has just said, the definition of terrorism has been improved during the Council' s work.
It is entirely in line with the 1977 Council of Europe Convention.
It is entirely consistent with the Indian proposal which is now under discussion at the United Nations in New York, and I can assure you that it is completely clear in the recitals that we do not include anti-globalisation demonstrations or trade union action in the scope of terrorist activities.
It is so clear that I would describe it as Cartesian.
You will see this from the texts.
Finally, I would like to say that the Commission' s conscience is quite clear.
We understand the political difficulty and, even, the political drama, constituted by this enormous step forwards that we are taking in order to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice, and we know that, ultimately, what we need to do is to be true to the values, as I am sure we will be, of respect for the rule of law and the fundamental freedoms of the citizens, but, at the same time, we know that with freedom comes the responsibility to resolutely combat crime and terrorism, and we will therefore combat crime and terrorism resolutely.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Aviation safety
The next item on the agenda is the debate on the report (A5-0415/2001), by Mrs Foster, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security. [COM(2001) 575 - C5-0481/2001 - 2001/0234(COD)]
Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September in the United States have given new impetus to the reinforcement of arrangements for aviation security.
The European Council meeting the day after the terrorist attacks on the USA instructed the Transport Council to evaluate the measures to be taken to improve aviation security and complete its consideration of those already proposed.
The draft regulation itself was fairly straightforward and has been amended.
However, the attached technical annex, Document 30, based on the European Civil Aviation Conference - or ECAC - was found to be out of date.
Whilst Parliament has responded speedily to the challenge, we believe that this should not lead to a lower level of parliamentary scrutiny and we reserve the right to amend in second reading the revised annex to this regulation adopted by the Council in its common position.
I have met with representatives from the Council and Commission and have consulted widely with the industry.
Due to the difficulty with the annex, as mentioned earlier, I chose to proceed with the report along the following lines: to work with the draft regulation and annex without amending the original annex as given to Parliament but to reserve the right to a second reading after the Council's common position has been adopted.
This option accords with established procedures and ensures proper scrutiny.
The draft regulation concerns, principally, access control and passenger luggage and freight screening on the ground at airports and is outlined fully in my explanatory statement.
The scope does not extend to on-board security which may need to be addressed at some future date.
The technical standards themselves are those adopted by ECAC in 1992 in Document 30, part 2, relating to security issues revised in January 2001 and, as mentioned, currently being updated.
ECAC membership extends to 38 European States including all EU Member States.
It is worth pointing out to Parliament that this agreement reached by the 38 countries will set a precedent in so far as for the first time the agreement will have binding force upon its contracting parties.
Document 30 had previously been used for general guidance only.
Following on from the joint resolution which Parliament adopted at the last plenary session on the subject of aviation, the key areas for amendment to this text are as follows: first, Member States assume responsibility for additional security costs in the light of the terrorist attacks; second, inspections of airports should be unannounced if airports are to be inspected under real operating conditions; third, Member States take responsibility in assisting employers in the screening of employees engaged in all security tasks, not least because employers are not always entitled to access personal data due to strict privacy laws; fourth, where there is a requirement for structural modifications at airports a six month time-limit will be implemented; and fifth, that a procedure be formulated, as is currently the case in ECAC, that would allow industry access to the Comitology Committee without running into problems of existing legal structures.



In addition, on a general point, we are calling for more effective international cooperation in the area of exchange of information for security purposes.
To conclude, we are all aware of the catastrophic effects on the aviation industry and tourist sector as a result of 11 September.
Around 200 000 directly-related jobs have already been lost worldwide, 30 000 in the EU alone, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
It is not only big businesses which have been affected but also thousands of small businesses, such as small aviation clubs who produce the pilots of tomorrow.
Airlines, airports, manufacturers, hotels, the transport sector are all reliant on finding a solution to this problem.
This report is not the sole solution but it is a step in the right direction provided that the Member States recognise their moral duty to protect their citizens and accept their responsibility to assist in the financing of these additional security measures.
It is quite clear that urgent action must be taken to restore public confidence which, in turn, would assist the aviation industry, the tourism sector and the European Union as a whole.
Mr President, my group would naturally like to help in the rapid creation of common security rules for civil aviation. This is self-evident after the events of 11 September.
In our opinion, there are four points at issue which we included in our amendments. In this respect, we want to take account of the interests of the industry, in which security and a fair distribution of the burden and expenses involved, must be the overriding factor.
First of all, we must aim to achieve the highest possible level of security when it comes to the protection of airports and their users.
This is also the least citizens can expect from us.
Secondly, additional measures which will probably be taken at a later date, must be verified against the implementation of present legislation.
This means that we will need to consider very carefully whether what is being proposed will also be viable in practice.
The third point is that the Commission, in tandem with the ECAC and the ICAO, must determine whether airports in third countries, in other words, airports outside the scope of the Regulation, meet essential security conditions, for any loopholes in the new system will surface particularly at those airports.
I know from my own experience how to board a plane in Albania without passing through bomb control.
The fourth and last point is that we would like uniform rules to finance the proposed measures in order to prevent unfair competition.
This could be government aid, provided that that is directly linked to the extra expenditure in connection with the present Regulation.
It should also be demonstrated, of course, that the aid is really needed.
The industry itself, operators and users, must also bear a proportion of the costs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament, the Council and the Commission are united in agreeing that efforts must be made to increase the safety of air travel.
The discussions that have just begun show, too, that we are fundamentally in complete agreement with this.
The events of 11 September have, of course, revealed additional deficiencies, which we have to consider in isolation from the structural problems already suffered by many airlines.
The two must not be confused.
We are of the opinion that there is room for improvement in all the areas relevant to security - the airports, the aprons, the registration and clearing of luggage, even on board the aircraft itself.
My group and I also take the view that, since safety is in the public interest and must be guaranteed for every citizen who uses airlines, public funds must also bear their share of the costs that an increase in safety entails.
This, of course, demands standardised European procedures, without which we will not solve the problem, and because competition would be distorted if the burden were to revert to the airports or the airlines.
We are, of course, aware that we have a problem.
There is, generally in Parliament, constant discussion of liberalisation, meaning that we now want to use public funds to improve safety in this liberalised sector.
This, of course, means that we have to talk in general terms about what standards can and must be applied in order to use public money to intervene in liberalised markets.
Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me firstly to express my gratitude to this House, to this Parliament, for including the theme of security in civil aviation on the agenda for this part-session.
I would also like to thank you for your promptness and speed in dealing with this subject, given the urgent nature of the current situation.
I would like to congratulate the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on having concluded its first reading of the Commission proposal in such a short time, because although this has been achieved very quickly, it must be added that this has not been done to the detriment of the quality of work carried out, and with regard to this I would particularly like to thank Mrs Foster, the rapporteur for this initiative, for the excellent work she has carried out despite the urgency of the situation, the lack of time and also for having carefully listened to all the sectors involved, which is the best way of undertaking such work.
Taking the gravity of the situation into account and the need to give an immediate response, and considering the mandate of the European Council of 21 September, our objective was to conclude an agreement before the end of the year.
In her report, Mrs Foster fully recognises the need to strengthen, in a standardised way, the security requirements applicable to civil aviation since 11 September.
I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission is, generally speaking, in agreement with the report, given that it supports our intention of introducing common security standards for civil aviation in the European Union, of establishing a Community inspection system aimed at checking the effectiveness and uniformity of these standards, and, therefore, and on this point I insist, at improving the security measures that, as Mr Wiersma or Mr Markov pointed out, are absolutely necessary and urgent.
With regard to the proposed amendments, we can, in principle, accept the first part of Amendment 14, which refers to the gradual introduction of specific security measures, although the measures involved and the timetable will have to be slightly adjusted.
A series of amendments is dedicated to ensuring that part of the implementation costs of the security measures are covered by the Member States of the European Union, on a permanent or temporary basis.
With regard to these amendments, the Commission fully agrees with the spirit of Nos 1, 6, 10, 11, 15, 19, 21 and 22, and can accept them in principle, even though they raise important issues relating to the method of financing the security measures.
We will have to take a look at the exact wording they will need in order for the Commission to adopt them.
Today, the situation can vary between one county and another, even between one airport and another; however, the Commission does not think that this factor could improve the effectiveness of the security measures.
The Commission communication of 10 October, on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks, suggested that the financing, with public funds, of additional security measures could be considered a positive move. However, I am sorry to have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that this measure was not received with any great enthusiasm by the Council, to put it mildly.
To tell the truth, it was not supported by the majority of States in the European Union.
This is how I know that making such a reference in the current regulation will cause serious problems in the Council, although, I repeat, we agree with Parliament' s position, because we are aware of the tremendous crisis the European Aviation Sector is experiencing at the moment.
This is a sector that is also having to face competition, often unfair competition, from American companies that are benefiting from significant direct aid, provided by the Administration of that country.
It is also possible that the financing of provisions that are not directly related to the improvement of security will not be included in this regulation.
However, with the aim of finding a solution to the significant problem of financing additional measures, I repeat that I am ready to undertake an analysis of the need to harmonise the organisation and financing of security controls in Member States, given what is happening in the United States, and to make the proposals necessary to take the result of this analysis into account.
With this action, the Commission would be taking account of the opinion demonstrated by this Parliament through the various amendments that will surely be approved tomorrow.
With regard to Amendment No 7, which proposes the removal of a Community control mechanism aimed at checking the proportionality and justification of stricter security measures in civil aviation adopted by Member States, the Commission must reject this amendment, even though Parliament and Council are of the same opinion.
We think that it is legitimate to grant the Commission the power to prevent artificial restrictions that are justified for economic reasons.
Amendment No 9 suggests that the results of the Community inspection reports should be sent to each airline.
These reports, ladies and gentlemen, contain general information on the implementation of the regulation by European Union Member States, and on the functioning of their own quality control systems and their ability to detect faults.
However, they do not include details such as the indication of the level of risk and its changes from airline to airline, and therefore, passing on these reports will not contribute to improving individual security, and with this in mind, the Commission cannot accept the content of this amendment.
Other amendments have been rejected because they cause legal problems, as is the case with the last paragraph of Amendment No 14, for example, Amendment No 5, which changes the reference standards produced by an external organisation, the ECAC, Amendment No 12, which goes against comitology procedures, Amendment No 17, which would delay the entry into force of the regulation, making it subject to an impact study, without there being any indication of the final decision.
The remaining amendments improve or clarify the text and the Commission can accept them with slight changes to their wording.
The Commission could also accept Amendment No 20, but would point out that implementing its extraterritorial effects on the basis of bilateral or multilateral controls would be a complicated matter.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has spared no effort to try to achieve, or to facilitate, an agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading, on a subject that is so important and, above all, urgent.
I fear that this may not be possible given the absence of prior agreement on tomorrow' s vote.
I think, however, that in the near future, in March, we could be in a position where we have a text, slightly late, it must be said, but if this results in a better quality text and better proposals, this is not such a serious issue, since some of the methods we have discussed here are already being directly implemented by Member States.
Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Foster once again.
And I would also like to thank Parliament for the urgency and effort it has afforded this measure, which is of fundamental importance, and I hope that in March we will finally reach full agreement between all the institutions.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Communities' financial interests
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0390/2001 by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the criminal-law protection of the Community' s financial interests. [COM(2001) 272 - C5-0225/2001 - 2001/0115(COD)];
A5- 0393/2001 by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission annual report 2000 on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud [COM(2001) 255 - C5-0469/2001 - 2001/2186(COS)] and on the Commission communication on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud - Action plan for 2001-2003 [COM(2001) 254 - C5-0470/2001 - 2001/2186(COS)]
Mr President, protection of the Community's financial interests is a concept that the citizen out there finds difficult to understand.
But it is of deep concern to him, as someone who pays his taxes, that his money should be used for the development and extension of a united Europe and that it should not be misused or employed for the purposes of fraud or other kinds of criminal activity.
He has every right to demand that the European institutions to which he entrusts his money will handle it carefully and that, should frauds be committed, these will be detected and punished.
The message we must get across is that we are using every available means to justify the citizen's trust.
The means to hand have, though, been blunt weapons to date, and there has been increased leakage from the Community budget due to criminal practices - figures show it as having doubled to over EUR 2 billion in the past year.
The percentage of undetected crime, may well, by the way, be even higher.
Despite better detection of fraud, judicial cooperation across frontiers is limping along, far behind multinational organised crime.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament have been lamenting this situation for years, but little or nothing has as yet been done about it.
The agreement on protection of the Community's financial interests, signed in Cannes all of six years ago, and the protocols appended to it, have still not been ratified by all the Member States and are therefore not in force.
Despite all the appeals and resolutions by Parliament, and several summit declarations by the Council, there is still no common European legal area to protect the Community budget, indeed, not even an unambiguous definition of the concept of fraud against Community funds. Still less are any investigations carried out or punitive sentences handed down, which must be in equal measure effective, proportionate and deterrent.
This blockade situation has now seen the Commission produce a proposal for a directive which recalls elements of the 1995 agreement and incorporates parts of them in the protocols, a proposal which, incidentally, Parliament had already made before the 1995 Summit.
The Commission, rightly, bases its proposal upon Article 280(4) of the Treaty of Amsterdam under which the Community is obliged to play an active part in protecting its funds.
This should circumvent the sterile debate about allocation to the first or third pillar of the Treaty, particularly as the Treaty of Nice affirms that the protection of the Community's finances belongs in the first pillar.
So we should not lose ourselves in legal analyses, but send a clear signal.
For us, the criminal-law protection of European funds against criminal misuse is a serious matter.
We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal for the harmonisation of national legislation.
It can, though, only be a first step towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office to protect Community financial interests, something that was called for at the IGC for the Treaty of Nice but was not, unfortunately, actually discussed.
Mrs Schreyer, we are waiting impatiently for the Green Paper from the Commission on this subject.
It would have been a good thing if we had already had this Green Paper together with the proposal for a directive.
In order to make good this deficiency, the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control call for the next revision of the Treaties to include the establishment of a European State Prosecutor's Office, on the corpus juris model and appertaining to the first pillar.
The course must be set for this as early as the Laeken Summit.
The Committee on Budgetary Control proposes, as an intermediate step without amending the Treaty, the establishment of an internal financial prosecutor in accordance with the three-phase model in the second report of the Committee of Wise Men.
As has already been said, we welcome the Commission's proposal, but call for an effective instrument, that is to say, a regulation rather than a directive.
Why?
Directives commit the Member States to objectives, whilst regulations prescribe the instruments they are to use to achieve those objectives.
The proposal for a directive is meant to insert into the criminal law of all the Member States a standard definition of offences such as fraud, corruption, money-laundering etc. to the detriment of the Community Budget. There is no doubt that a regulation is the legal instrument to be preferred in order to avoid new confusion of the sort that there has been in the past.
I strongly invite Parliament, the Commission and the Council to now go down this necessary political road together.
I ask you to adopt my report, on which no amendments have been tabled.
Mr President, if you take a look at the figures for fraud and the irregularities affecting the European Budget in the year 2000, you see, above all, a massive increase in the irregularities that have come to light.
Just so we can put this beyond dispute for once: for the taxpayer, it is essentially irrelevant whether it is a question of fraud or irregularity; the money has been improperly spent.
Now, one can, of course, argue about whether more fraud is actually being committed or whether it is being cleared up more effectively, or whether there are more irregularities.
I tend to think it is probably a combination of these.
The Commissioner may well think differently, but we cannot go so far as to say that having discovered 100% irregularities means that we have had the best way of combating fraud, because then we will not have any budget left.
In my position - and perhaps the Commissioner responsible was herself once a Member of this House in a past life - and in this situation, one asks oneself what would happen in a business if the management presented figures like these one year.
Here, we are always coming up against the fact that people say we are among the best administrations.
We are striving to be that.
I think that what would happen would be something quite different from what the Commission expects from us as an action plan.
The actual point of my report is that I believe we should just consider where this road might take us.
Mrs Theato has already mentioned one possibility, and an important one at that, which we will not be able to avoid if we want to make changes.
We must address the issue of a European State Prosecutor, and do it without excuses about amendments to the Treaty.
The possibilities are already there in the Treaties.
Your opposition to it, Mrs Schreyer, is your own business, but we will not carry on standing idly before our taxpayers and tell them that we just cannot do anything.
That is not what we have a Commission for.
The Commission is there to act, and of that I would remind you, Mrs Schreyer.
In exactly the same way, we must give greater priority to the protection of the EU's financial interests in the applicant countries.
There were, and are, proposals on this which amount to saying that we will, at some point, have to let our anti-fraud unit be active in an advisory capacity, which we know already.
As the example of Slovakia has shown, the point at issue is not the acceding countries, but the continuing inability of this Commission to get a proper grip on the problematic aspects of enlargement, so that our fellow citizens might get the idea that enlargement has been prepared for in such a way, including financially, that they can happily say yes to it.
The Commission bears great responsibility in this respect.
Madam Commissioner, I am inclined to think that, when one has to submit those sorts of figures and turn them into something tangible, one has to seize every available opportunity to improve matters.
My final point is on an issue on which it would be good if we could seize the opportunity for common action.
It has to do with a question that I will raise now.
Mrs Schreyer, the plan is to appoint Mr Alberto Perduca as Director of the operational department of OLAF, the anti-fraud office.
His qualifications as a public prosecutor, his experience in combating the mafia, and also his experience at an international level make him the ideal man for the job.
Unfortunately, his appointment has been blocked for months now by the new Italian government.
Perhaps, Mrs Schreyer, you might tell us what the Commission has done about this to date.
Would personal intervention by the President of the Commission not be necessary in this case?
Has this, as is to be hoped, already taken place?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1995 the Member States jointly signed a convention under which, in order to safeguard Community interests and finances, the Member States make fraud against Community finances a punishable offence.
Subsequently, further protocols were signed also specifying corruption and the laundering of money derived from fraud against Community finances as criminal offences.
There is actually nothing wrong with this convention and the protocols except that they have not all been ratified yet and therefore they are still not in force.
I do not deny that in the year 2000 there was some movement in the direction of ratification.
Whenever I have met with finance ministers I have constantly repeated my request that they be ratified, but the speed is determined by the slowest.
The protocol that makes money laundering a crime has so far been ratified by only seven Member States.
So you can see how long it would take if we were to wait for the process to be completed.
We cannot accept that; that is why we have put forward the proposal for a directive that converts the main content of the protocol and the convention into a directive; this has already been discussed in Parliament on a number of occasions and has repeatedly been called for by the President himself.
I would like to thank you, Mrs Theato, and, of course, the committee as a whole, for joining us in saying that things have gone far enough and we are now going to use Community law and not rely on the convention, the third pillar instrument.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has tabled many amendments that were voted on in the Committee.
The Commission shares the objective and concern expressed by many of these.
But the Commission believes the present proposal for a directive is not in legal terms the right place for the vast majority of the amendments.
I must therefore ask you not to take the proposal for a directive as some kind of tree on which to hang many wishes, concerns and suggestions, correct as these may be.
That is especially the case with the European Public Prosecutor.
Again a word on that, Mr BÃ¶sch. Of course, the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
In our clear analysis Article 280 does not, as it appears in the Treaty, lend itself to that, not even the 'little' public prosecutor, to use that term again.
In our estimation, and other people do share this view, there is no basis in law for the OLAF Supervisory Committee.
Neither would it be possible to choose the instrument of the regulation, because the proposal as you now have it provides, for example, for the European Court of Justice to have an investigating judge. But the duties of the Court of Justice and its judicial functions are laid down in detail in the Treaty.
It is, therefore, not possible to use a regulation to institutionalise a new investigating judge.
That, too, requires an amendment to the Treaty.
But we shall be presenting the Green Paper in a few weeks' time, as Mrs Theato has mentioned.
The Green Paper will, of course, initiate a wide-ranging discussion.
I am sure that, as protagonists of this proposal, you will take this discussion to the experts and to the Member States, so that we do not have a repeat of the situation we had in Nice, where there were only reservations and no agreement.
In our opinion, there is no legal basis for some of the other amendments, either.
Provisions concerning cooperation between the national criminal prosecution authorities would be incompatible with Article 280 of the Treaty since they are concerned with the application of the Member States' criminal law and their administration of criminal justice.
Neither can the Commission go along with the suggestion of converting the directive into a regulation, since the Community cannot, at present, create law that is directly applicable in the Member States.
I understand your concern and in view of the present situation I, of course, also support the call for your wish to be met swiftly, but we are a long way from a situation where the European Community can create directly applicable law.
I am sure that this would really not meet with the agreement of the national parliaments either.
The Commission is able to agree without reservation to Amendment No 2 and No 11. They underline, once again, how important the introduction of the new Article 280 is for protecting the Community' s financial interests.
Amendment No 27, which provides for custodial sentences, possibly leading to extradition, is essential for effectively fighting economic crime, and the Commission would also like to agree to the first sentences of Amendment No 3 and No 7 if these should be voted on separately tomorrow.
I also want to explicitly say that the proposals for extending the list of offences for the protection of financial interests are very worthy of note and, in my opinion, very much worthy of consideration, namely that market-rigging and abuse of office should be included.
It is really more a question here of the strategy to be adopted.
The Commission' s proposed strategy is to adopt the wording of the convention, more or less, as it stands and to present the Member States with a situation where they have already agreed to this very text and there is, therefore, now no reason to convert it into another instrument that sets a clear time for its transposition.
That is one of the legislative measures the Commission is putting forward to protect the Community' s financial interests.
The Commission has listed the proposals we put forward in the year 2000 in the fraud prevention report, for example the proposal to amend the money laundering directive, the proposal to prevent counterfeiting of the euro or measures to combat product piracy.
That is all part of preventing fraud, after all.
The Commission' s report also contains 50 pages listing the measures taken by the Member States to protect Community finances in the years 1999 and 2000.
It starts with Belgium extending its customs administration' s powers to a twelve mile zone outside coastal waters and includes, for example, the creation of a central control information system by Denmark' s customs and tax administration and an increase in staff at Spain' s general inspectorates for agricultural expenditure in the regions.
The United Kingdom has, for example, set up a coordination point for general investigations involving the Structural Funds.
For the Structural Funds, the rapporteur, you, Mr BÃ¶sch, has included the Court of Auditors' highly critical report, which highlights the differences between the Member States in the application of the regulation that irregularities in the implementation of the Structural Funds must be reported.
I can assure you that I share your criticism and that of the Court of Auditors.
We are, therefore, working very hard with the Member States to get a more uniform and above all a more thorough implementation of this reporting regulation.
And this is beginning to bear fruit.
I really must reiterate: even if we will probably continue to differ on the interpretation, in earlier years, transposition was extremely hesitant.
We have found that it took ages for an irregularity to be reported.
It is now de facto better, but that, of course, also means that more irregularities are being reported.
It is like police statistics. Is it a good thing or a bad thing when the number of cases the police detect rises or falls?
I really must therefore ask you not to discredit those Member States that take their reporting of irregularities seriously and make frequent reports as required by the Regulation by saying they are the 'strongholds' , because it is a difficult instrument.
There is, as it were, a negative incentive: the more irregularities are reported, the more information we naturally have on the basis of which to make financial corrections.
We cannot do without this mechanism.
I also agree with the rapporteur, I agree with you, Mr BÃ¶sch, that we must make the statistics more meaningful so we can see which are the new reports and which were already in the statistics before.
Above all, we must look at what has been the result of the reports, what measures have been taken.
OLAF is working on it, the Directorate-General for the Budget is working on it, the Directorate-General for the Regions is working on it, but it is a laborious business.
I am sure we will not have the success we are actually looking for next year either, but we will see that they are becoming more meaningful, as it were, sector by sector.
It also depends on cooperation with the Member States, and OLAF is working closely with the so-called COCOLAF.
I can inform you, however, that every suspected case of fraud, especially in the Structural Funds, is passed on to OLAF.
The most common irregularities with the Structural Funds are concerned with cases where, for example, the Member States approve projects after the period for support has actually finished.
Irregularities also appear, in particular, because other Community policies are not followed.
One quite frequent irregularity is that projects have been approved without an environmental impact assessment being made first.
A lot of money is spent on infrastructures, and that is a very common error, as I said.
If you now ask what damage results, that is, of course, difficult to say.
There is no financial damage, but there may be environmental damage because the environmental impact assessment was not carried out.
Regarding the financial corrections, another important point, we shall have tighter rules for the new support period.
In the report, you have now called for all irregularities affecting financial corrections and the Structural Funds reported in the period from 1995 to 2000 to be listed individually by 15 December.
We do not have that information available and will not have it available so quickly.
The Commission can promise that we will now try to get this information direct for the new irregularity reports in a way that makes the reports meaningful so that we can see which irregularities result in financial loss.
How is the protection of financial interests directive likely to be treated in the Council?
Unfortunately, some Member States have already taken quite a clear stance against this directive on grounds of legal dogma.
You have mentioned this.
All the Member States say in the Council, yes, of course, we must do something about this, but then they argue no, that is something that belongs in the third pillar, not in the first pillar.
I would like to see the justice ministers who argue in this way, doing so in a public debate.
Nobody would understand it.
And the population will not accept them saying they can do nothing because one thing is the first pillar but another is the third pillar and the Community can only take action in the third pillar.
It is quite clear that the protection of Community interests requires Community instruments, and I am very pleased and very grateful to you that the European Parliament and the Commission are pulling in the same direction here.
Mr President, those involved in the construction of Europe have always been prepared to take risks. This has certainly been the case as far as the protection of the Community' s financial interests is concerned.
Parliament, notably its Committee on Budgetary Control, has indeed taken risks. We should pay tribute to the determination shown by Mrs Theato who chairs that Committee and is one of the rapporteurs.
Whatever is achieved in this field will be largely due to her efforts.
Having said that, I must admit that along with many other Members I share the Commission' s concern.
We need to work towards creating an area of justice, but we must do so in a responsible manner. Throughout the whole process of the construction of Europe, the forces attempting to hinder it have consistently taken advantage of the mistakes made by more enthusiastic individuals when they lose sight of the Treaty.
This is why I am bringing a critical note into today' s debate.
I do not wish to argue against the concept of a European Public Prosecutor, but I am concerned about laying down the details of the necessary statute. It is indeed a transitional statute but a statute nonetheless.
The House needs to give due consideration to this office. Not only should the Committee on Budgetary Control give it due consideration, but so should the House itself.
Such consideration should also involve dialogue with other institutions, notably the Commission. Not until that has taken place will we be in a position to move forward together and present a proposal consistent with the Treaty.
The same applies, in my view, to the Commissioner' s comments on the rapporteur' s idea of resorting to a regulation in place of a directive.
That is not within Parliament' s competence.
It falls within the competence of our societies and of states governed by the rule of law.
Only in very specific circumstances may direct obligations be imposed on citizens from a Community level.
This is why I have ventured to voice some criticism here today, Mr President.
I am, however, full of admiration for the work completed.
I should like, first of all, to thank the two Members for all their work in writing these reports.
They have been tireless workers on fighting fraud in the European Union since they were appointed.
However, there is a problem.
According to the Commission report, there has been a doubling of fraud, in particular, of the revenue collected over the year 2000.
That is of great concern but we must put it into context and remember that much of this is due to Member States not taking fraud seriously.
They are not collecting the money that is due to the European Union, for example, from cigarette smuggling and the money that we could get through taxes.
Member States are also not taking fraud seriously because we still have four Member States who have not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests which means that nobody can move on in terms of fighting fraud.
As regards the Structural Funds, 40% of the money is spent in the Member States and the data we have, in terms of following up where that money is spent, is unreliable.
This situation is quite pathetic.
What do we do when we find fraud?
We pass a file onto OLAF who do the investigation and then it sits on a shelf because nobody prosecutes.
This is a real problem.
Who is going to take responsibility for prosecution?
Only two people have ever been prosecuted by OLAF and this is a green light to fraudsters in the EU.
We must ask if people are against the European Public Prosecutor, then what alternative do they want to see?
We are asking a little bit too much in this report by asking for a regulation.
But we also know that about half the Member States are against this and there is a possibility of losing an opportunity to have a European fraud prosecutor for the EU financial interests.
We may be asking for too much too fast and I am concerned about that, but I respect the Members for really trying to push the boat out on this fraud issue.
Mr President, I too should like to start with a word of thanks to the two rapporteurs.
I know that they have both worked hard on this topic from the outset.
I should first of all like to turn my attention to the BÃ¶sch report.
As the Liberal Group, we have tabled a few amendments to this report, to the effect that we consider mid-2002 somewhat premature as a firm deadline for a public prosecutor.
In order to avoid any misunderstandings, we are clearly in favour of a public prosecutor, but mid-2002 is slightly too early.
In our opinion, more attention should be devoted to the future Member States in Central and Eastern Europe and we would therefore ask the Court of Auditors to issue a report on this as soon as possible, thus enabling us to assess whether these countries are also capable of managing their financial affairs effectively before they accede.
Furthermore, OLAF must obviously work closely together with similar organisations in the new Member States.
We would also like to make our position clear on the Theato report: we are in support of a public prosecutor, but the lion' s share of the amendments that have been adopted in committee, in most cases by one majority vote, go too far in our view.
At this stage, we prefer a directive to a regulation.
We want to avoid a confrontation course with the Council: the line of the Commission is preferable to the abundance of detail in the various amendments.
If these amendments were to be adopted at this stage, we ought to revisit them in the Committee on Budgetary Control, for we believe that, at this stage, matters of this kind should attract the greatest possible consensus and that the decision should not be made by a narrow majority.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the Prodi Commission' s existing policy on fighting fraud can really only be described as hesitant and dilatory when it comes to the really crucial questions.
And I have very little hope that this will change, especially in the matter of the European Financial Public Prosecutor.
A Green Paper is all the Commission has planned for the remaining years of its term of office.
Your much-vaunted Commission reform programme lacks the crucial safety net.
Those who abuse their freedoms must be capable of being brought to account.
Your first duty ought to have been to clear up the old cases and call those responsible to account.
Instead, you are hiding behind a hesitant judiciary in Belgium and Luxembourg.
To prevent this sad truth from becoming so evident, you are following a policy of concealing information from Parliament, which you now want to get expressly embodied in the Financial Regulation.
You are claiming for yourself the right to decide whether informing Parliament about a procedure is in the European Union' s interest or not.
I would like to have seen you when you were a member of the State Parliament in Berlin, Mrs Schreyer, if the Governing Mayor had told you it was not in the city' s interest to inform you about certain things.
That is precisely how you are presuming to treat the European Parliament today and you clearly fail to appreciate that in so doing you weaken not only this Parliament but, ultimately, also the Commission of which you are part.
Thank you very much, Mrs Stauner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Quality of petrol and diesel fuels
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0389/2001) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of petrol and diesel fuels (COM(2001) 241 - C5-0197/2001 - 2001/0107(COD)).
Mr President, I am here, this evening, to present a report which relates to the improvement of the quality of fuels.
The European Parliament was involved in drafting this legislation, which was originally approved in 1998, in other words, over three years ago; and Parliament was quite successful in using the co-decision procedure to push through cleaner fuels, which significantly facilitate a reduction in traffic emissions.
Even at that stage, the European Parliament noticed that one crucial factor in improving the quality of a fuel is a reduction in its sulphur content.
In the course of the co-decision procedure and conciliation, we accomplished a significant lowering in the sulphur content of both petrol and diesel, despite the way in which the oil industry stridently emphasised the costs of this programme.
On the other hand, we can state that the motor industry and catalyst industry considered it absolutely essential that these low-sulphur, cleaner fuels would be introduced to the market, since, otherwise, it would not have been possible for them to bring about cleaner, better and more advanced engines which feature lower emissions.
We are now at the directive revision stage, at which the Commission, quite rightly, has noted that sulphur is an even more strategic ingredient in the quality of fuels than we then understood.
The Commission proposes that by 2011 both petrol and diesel fuel should, for all practical purposes, be sulphur-free.
We are talking about very low contents.
This is of essential importance, since it has been observed that the consumption of fuels also falls when the sulphur content is reduced, and, in the meantime, climate policy has become a central objective in the European Union.
We must find all possible means by which we can reduce car fuel consumption.
This is, indeed, one of the most important aims of this proposal.
Hopefully, then, the European Parliament will come to the decision tomorrow that we will attain one hundred percent of the target of getting these sulphur-free fuels on the market as early as 2008, rather than by 2011 as the Commission is proposing.
In our judgment, this is entirely possible, and it will be a positive influence on the development of cars.
The motor industry will be able to develop better and more advanced engines, which will use less fuel.
We are also proceeding from the assumption, which the Commission also proposes, that this introduction to the market shall start in 2005.
It is important that Parliament decides that sulphur-free fuels should be available (by stages) throughout the area of the Union, with the first steps being made in 2005.
We are also demanding that this availability be geographically comprehensive.
Previously, the situation has been that the various Member States have proceeded at slightly different rates with regard to this improvement in the quality of fuels.
The Environment Committee proposes that the Member States be offered the possibility of certain transitional periods or derogations when this directive is next revised.
Parliament is proposing that this revision take place a year earlier than was decided by the Commission: we would like the revision to take place during 2005.
Despite the demands of certain parties, the Environment Committee has decided that in this connection no topics other than sulphur should be involved.
We can then return to the question of fuel quality parameters other than sulphur during the course of the revision in 2005.
In my opinion, this is a well-justified policy, since the Commission will have time to study this topic in the meantime.
I would also like to stress that a transition must be made to using cleaner fuels also in work machinery, or non-road machines of this type.
This is entirely possible: in eight Member States diesel fuels are already being used in work machinery.
Hopefully, Parliament will decide, tomorrow, that these work machines must begin to use cleaner fuels to the same extent as vehicles on the roads.
The Industry Committee accepts the desirability of moving to zero sulphur in petrol and diesel.
The hotter burn of modern vehicle engines delivers higher efficiency and thereby cuts CO2 emissions.
However, the resulting increase in nitrogen oxide has to be dealt with by catalysts and the virtual elimination of sulphur renders the catalysts effective in dealing with these.
A further benefit is a reduction in the emission of particulates, so the Industry Committee is in favour of the Commission proposal.
A majority vote in the committee demanded a rather faster implementation than the Commission proposed even if some of us were concerned at the Commission's assertion that this will, in fact, produce a net increase in CO2 emissions.
So please tell us, Commissioner, if you stand by your warning or whether you can accept the quicker implementation requested by both the Environment and the Industry Committees.
We would also point out that the EU standard of 10 parts per million of sulphur contrasts with an American standard of 15 ppm of sulphur.
This will make it difficult for us to import fuels from the USA in an emergency.
We would also suggest that the Commission instigate research into the implications of ultra-fine particle emissions from gasoline diesel injection engines.
The question of fuel quality for non-road and off-road machinery is still outstanding.
We understand that proposals on this matter will be forthcoming in 2002.
This is surely urgently needed but we urge the Commission to give full consideration to the interests of those in industry and agriculture who operate such machinery.
We give this proposal a fair wind.
Indeed, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would suggest that the Commission hoists a spinnaker and speeds up its implementation.
Is the Commissioner prepared to accede to this demand?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission undertook a good deal of preliminary work in preparation for this directive. I refer to the Auto-Oil I and Auto-Oil II programmes.
This work resulted in a balanced proposal which is well-documented from a technical point of view. Congratulations are due to the Commission.
I should also like to commend Mrs Hautala, the rapporteur, very warmly on her excellent work.
I agree with her that it is important to make low-sulphur fuels available as soon as possible. This is because technological advances in the automotive industry permit fuel saving, and, more especially, a reduction in polluting emissions.
It is, nonetheless, true that refineries need to consume more energy and emit more polluting gases in order to produce these fuels. Also, the environmental advantages of low-sulphur fuels will not be felt until vehicles currently on the roads are replaced.
It is a matter of balancing out the emissions. We must therefore be pragmatic as regards schedules and adjust the pace of the introduction of the new fuels to the rate of renewal of the existing vehicle population.
Otherwise, we would be forcing users to change their vehicles, but that is not an option.
I do agree that it would be appropriate to reduce the transitional period during which the various fuels could coexist. For the reasons I adduced earlier, however, a degree of flexibility should be afforded to certain countries.
My group therefore proposes that, whilst bringing the date forward, we should retain the option of granting temporary derogations to those Member States who can demonstrate that the balance of air quality will prove negative.
