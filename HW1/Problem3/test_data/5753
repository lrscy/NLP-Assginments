It is the big States which are obtaining more power, those and the central institutions.
There is no trace of decentralisation and the redistribution of power and no sign of any substance being given to the subsidiarity principle.
Secondly, no adjustments are being made in anticipation of enlargement, which is perhaps the most serious feature of all.
If a Union of 28 Member States is to be successful, it must obviously have a flexible structure.
There must be clear definitions of powers in regard to what is to be decided centrally, what is to be decided in the Member States and what can be decided at regional level.
There is nothing of this, however.
If such a large Union is to be a real success, a large proportion of the decisions now made centrally must clearly be decentralised to a lower level. Otherwise, the whole system will implode.
Thirdly, this is no democratic, constitutional process but a case of a power game behind locked doors.
I have therefore voted against.
Mr President, I express my disappointment at my Green colleagues and my own group, because I was left with no opportunity to vote on two key amendments on the common, foreign and security policy.
One was an amendment on the arms industries and arms exports and the other was on nuclear weapons.
It was very important for us to have an opportunity to say whether nuclear weapons play a role of any kind in the future of the common, foreign and security policy.
Unfortunately, my Green colleagues deemed these amendments unnecessary, which raises the question whether the Greens are changing their policy on nuclear weapons and on the arms industries.
I voted against the report itself, because I feel that more centralisation means less safety for smaller Member States, less democracy, less involvement of people at a local and national level.
This is not in the interest of the ordinary people of Europe.
A new constitution for Europe that overrides national constitutions, a legal personality for the European Union and, of course, more militarisation: this is not the kind of Europe I want.
I want a de-militarised Europe, a democratic Europe where the people have the real say, not bureaucrats.
Mr President, I voted for Amendment No 100 to the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report on the European Parliament' s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, which, I regret, was not adopted by the House.
It laid down that elections to the European Parliament should be held as soon as possible using the same lists of candidates in all 15 Member States, that is to say genuinely European lists.
I feel that this amendment is based on a point which brings the citizens much closer to Europe and the European Union: the citizens who are called on to vote realise that the candidates are the same throughout the 15 States, and this would show them that Europe does exist and that there is a reason for its existence.
This is why I voted for this amendment.
Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution although I did not agree with the individual points.
I regret that, at the end of the day, only 238 Members voted for the text, and I would like to ask those responsible for the running of this House to check whether the procedure followed really made sense.
To my mind, the fact that so many amendments were tabled is a sign that there had been a failure to reach sufficient agreement beforehand, and the fact that not even the compromise amendments were adopted is a sign that we were not yet ready to vote on this in plenary.
I would also ask you, Mr President, to raise this vote in the Bureau, and to consider whether we cannot arrange matters differently, so that we avoid a mammoth voting session like this, which has lasted two and a half hours.
And I am sure that in the end there was not a single Member here who could understand what this was all about.
We should make sure we do not have procedures like this in plenary in future!
Mr President, although I am broadly in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos report on the Intergovernmental Conference, I abstained on the final vote.
In fact, in the course of one paragraph - paragraph 32 - the scope of which will certainly have escaped the majority of Members, the door has been opened to calling into question the current status of public services in the context of international trade negotiations, especially WTO negotiations, without the agreement of a Member State. This is proposed on the pretext of amending article 133 of the Treaty and, in fact, making it possible to break the principle of the agreement of all the States in establishing the position of the European Union as regards services, investment and intellectual property rights.
The rejection of Amendment No 57, which would have removed this ambiguity, therefore leads me to abstain on the text although, I repeat, I support its main thrust as regards the IGC.
And I am quite sure the IGC will not retain the current wording of paragraph 32.
Mr President, I voted for the Dimitrakopoulos report, although I do have some reservations about it.
The Dimitrakopoulos report does not go far enough for me in terms of EU federalisation and integration.
I believe that we should go much further, and move more determinedly, towards federalisation and away from nation states, towards the regions and the peoples of Europe.
I hope, even if the omens for this Intergovernmental Conference are not the best, that there may still be an opening here or there.
I am enough of a realist to know that this is a gradual process.
That is why I voted for this report and I hope that we will take many more such steps in the near future.
Mr President, I abstained in the final vote for several major reasons and also some minor ones.
It was difficult for me to support the resolution because it mixes the worst in with the best.
On the other hand, I did not want to vote against a resolution which probably represents the best the European Parliament can do at the moment.
The obvious conclusion seems to me that Parliament itself still has a long way to go to meet the profound aspirations of the majority of European Union citizens.
Moreover, the rejection of two compromise amendments during the sitting bears witness to the difficulty of finding representative majorities, as does the rejection or acceptance, by the narrowest of margins, of institutional measures of the highest importance.
To take just one example, Parliament was only able to maintain a compromise on the composition of the Commission with difficulty, but truth obliges me to state that the compromise incorporates two contradictory ideas.
We have passed a resolution actually stating that the number of members of the Commission should be limited, as long as it is not.
Is that really a very sensible position for a Parliament to take?
Ainardi, Bakopoulos, Eriksson, Figueiredo, Frahm, Koulourianos, Meijer, Herman Schmid, SeppÃ€nen and SjÃ¶stedt (GUE/NGL), in writing.
We, Members from different parties in the GUE/NGL Group, have not voted in favour of the report concerning the European Parliament proposal for the IGC.
We oppose the development of the European Union towards a state with superior powers to those of the Member States in all aspects of policy, as the report in practice advocates.
Instead of transforming the EU into a state, we are of the opinion that the Union must be democratised.
Democratisation of the European Union must be achieved through a decreasing of the Commission's power, the introduction of openness and transparency to the legislative practices of the Council, and strengthening of the role at EU level of the national parliaments.
We further protest against the report's advocacy of the militarisation of the EU.
We insist that the EU remain a civil organisation and that the non-aligned countries' special status be respected.
We are of the opinion that the Intergovernmental Conference must reconsider the construction of the EMU, reassessing the currency union's lack of democracy and its right-wing policies.
We demand that the stability pact be reconsidered and Article 56 of the Treaty be rewritten in order to bring the ECB under democratic control.
We reiterate our condemnation of the failure to submit the EMU project to referendum in all of the Member States.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament today voted against the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen on the European Parliament' s proposal for the IGC.
We consider that in insisting on a broad agenda, the European Parliament is not facilitating what should be the main task of the IGC, namely that of resolving the outstanding institutional problems regarding the composition and voting rules of the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice and the other institutions, and so making enlargement possible.
The European Parliament ought instead to take up the important task of ensuring that the essential issues which need to be resolved are debated in such a way that Europe' s citizens are involved and can form their own views on the important subjects being debated.
The EU should build on a common political will to achieve the overriding objectives relating to peace, the environment and prosperity in Europe, focusing on the interests of its citizens.
The debate in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which adopted the draft report with a very small majority, plus the fact that more than 200 amendments have been tabled for consideration in plenary, show that this report cannot contribute to creating a common basis for the IGC.
Despite the fact that we do not consider that the European Parliament should propose all these amendments to the Treaty, we have elected to adopt positions on the individual points, as will be evident from our voting.
However, we would like to draw particular attention to the points which we think the IGC should concentrate on.
As regards the composition of the European Parliament, we have voted for calculation of the number of Members from each Member State according to a sliding scale so that the European Parliament' s composition reflects the size of the individual States, populations as well as the fact that there are benefits to be had from making the European Parliament more representative by enabling the different political viewpoints in the individual countries to be represented there.
As regards the composition of the Commission, it is important that all States have the right to a Commissioner with the same rights and obligations, particularly as in our opinion, the Commission must continue to enjoy the right of initiative.
When it comes to the voting rules in the Council, we consider that a balance must be maintained between the interests of the small and large states. This can be achieved by laying down requirements for a certain number of votes in the Council which must, at the same time, represent a simple majority of the total population of the Union.
We are open to discussing increased use of qualified majority voting, although we do not consider that it should be the rule.
Each particular instance of a transition to qualified majority voting must, however, be analysed and debated thoroughly and a balance struck between what is fundamental as far as the individual Member States are concerned and the need to make cooperation work.
It is especially important that this matter be discussed on an on-going basis with Europe' s citizens.
All Member States must demonstrate the political will to make cooperation work.
It is this will and the desire for common solutions which the EU must also build on in future.
We are not, therefore, worried that, following enlargement, the EU will be paralysed unless a thorough reform of the Treaty is carried out now.
In parallel with the IGC, the Member States are discussing a common European security and defence policy.
These discussions are far from complete, and we do not think that the European Parliament should table amendments to the Treaty before the outcome is known.
We continue to believe that the EU should not be an actual defence alliance.
In this area, the EU must focus in particular on conflict prevention and civil crisis management.
Also in parallel with the IGC, the creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights is being debated.
We would like once again to stress that we want a charter in the form of a political document and that it should not be raised at the IGC with a view to incorporating it into the Treaty.
The commitment of the Portuguese members of the Socialist Group to the European project is a constant point of reference in its work and in its founding principles.
The building of Europe is today, more than ever, essential for peace and progress not only in Europe, but also throughout the world.
The European project is a gradual process, which has been able to adapt to changing realities and to respond to the vicissitudes of history.
We find ourselves today at one of those key moments at which the European Union needs to rethink and adapt its policies and its institutions so that it can respond better to the challenges of enlargement and of the effective and democratic functioning of its institutions.
Advocacy of a progressive political union, pursuing the federalism which was at its origins, strengthening European citizenship and the economic and social cohesion and cultural diversity of its peoples are essential and inseparable aspects of the options before us.
The institutional implications of enlargement cannot be allowed to damage the fundamental balance - which the Treaties successfully express - between the twofold legitimacy of the union of peoples and the union of states which underpins the European project and which has made a decisive contribution to shaping its institutions.
The deepening, at global level, of European integration with a view to political union must satisfactorily preserve this fundamental balance which has ensured the success of the European project, bringing together states with such divergent demographic and geographical characteristics.
Enlargement should not in any way be used as a pretext for making institutional changes which would gratuitously upset the equilibrium carefully created since 1957, as these institutional changes have no direct logical or political link with enlargement.
It was out of respect for these principles and convictions that we recognised the value of, and voted for, the European Parliament' s proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) on the revision of these Treaties.
And it is also out of respect for these principles and convictions that we have felt obliged to vote against the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report, which, in our view, attempts to respond to the challenges of enlargement by means of solutions which would lead to a significant imbalance in the twofold legitimacy of the union of peoples and the unity of states.
Accordingly, with regard to the solution proposed for the composition of the European Parliament, we believe that insufficient attention has been paid to certain aspects which, in our view, are fundamental. These relate to the need to eliminate a quantified minimum number of seats in the European Parliament for each Member State and to introduce a degressive approach which can correct the negative effects of strictly applying the rules of proportionality.
Furthermore, we believe that the references in the report to the composition of the Commission are also not totally clear.
We do not believe that the proposal in the report describes with sufficient clarity and openness the adoption of a criterion putting all Member States on an equal footing, whether the Commission is made up of one Commissioner per Member State or of a college of 20 Commissioners.
The same thing could also be said about the idea of a simple rotation principle and about how this would work, which we believe should be properly spelt out if the scenario of a Commission consisting of only 20 members is adopted.
With regard to qualified majority voting in the Council, we believe that the system proposed is not in fact the most acceptable.
In fact, although we agree with the double majority principle, we believe that the solution to be adopted should involve Council measures requiring two thirds of the votes of the Member States and a simple majority of the Member States with a majority of the population. We believe that this approach will ensure greater cohesion in the decision-making process.
As regards the rotation of the Council Presidency, we are also unable to accept the new system proposed, under which the presidency of the Council in its various formations shall be divided among the Member States so that the same Member State may not hold the Presidency of more than one of these formations at the same time, and shall rotate by periods of at least two years.
We consider that this new rule does not guarantee the necessary balance and equality in the representation of the Member States in the Council.
The issue of electing 10% of the Members of the European Parliament via European lists is also insufficiently clear.
We believe that the wording used in the report to describe this option is relatively vague and does not as such offer any guarantees that it would be used to create genuine European public opinion of the kind we would like to see.
The European list is a good idea, especially if the only people included in it are individuals who represent a genuine point of reference in the spirit of Europe.
Nevertheless, it is our view that this concept should be considered in greater depth so that the fears that we have legitimately expressed here can be set aside.
We are also unable to accept the rule on qualified majority voting for decisions concerning appointments.
Until now all decisions in the European Union relating to appointments have been taken unanimously, and there has never been a lack of appointments or any kind of crisis.
We believe that the unanimity rule has the virtue of ensuring a greater balance and of avoiding possible conflicts between large and small countries within the European Union.
However, the spirit in which we have voted should not be confused with the motives of those who have a self-seeking and limited vision of national interest.
Unlike certain others, we want a politically strong European Union capable of sharing sovereignty and of making an ever greater contribution to social progress and to the well-being of its citizens.
The Portuguese members of the Socialist Group will continue to work, alongside those political forces which favour the broadening and deepening of our political union, to find better formulas for pursuing this political struggle.
For procedural reasons we have made this statement immediately, but some of the points remain dependent on a more detailed knowledge of the changes that have been made.
We wish to add that, because of the speed with which we proceeded to the vote, it was not always easy to understand what we were voting on, there being a certain degree of confusion, specifically about votes on amendments and paragraphs. The Portuguese members of the Socialist Group therefore reserve the right, after studying the results of the vote, to change the way they have voted.
- (ES) The process of enlargement which the European Union has started has brought it to a crossroads and its ability to continue making progress will depend on the direction it takes.
It can therefore be said that the IGC, which is charged with proceeding with the institutional reforms which will make enlargement possible, holds the future of the European Union in its hands, since it has to decide between the minimal reform laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the broad reform which will allow the Union to accept the countries which are preparing for accession and pursue its task in favour of respect for human rights, peace and social justice.
Therefore, given that we are at a crucial moment in the process of European integration, it was appropriate for Parliament to send a message indicating what it understood to be the key points of the reform.
In the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report which we have just approved and which I have voted in favour of, Parliament indicates that we have to make further progress and that, to this end, we have to give the European Union the necessary means to complete the shared project of peace and well-being initiated 50 years ago.
Let us hope that the IGC is aiming sufficiently high for the great challenges facing the Union and that it follows that path which Parliament has set for it.
- (SV) Enlargement of the European Union is one of the most important issues for the future of Europe.
The aim of the present Intergovernmental Conference is to prepare the EU for this enlargement.
If enlargement is to be implemented successfully, certain institutional changes are required.
The EU must become more efficient and more democratic, and a balance should be maintained between the small and large countries. Moreover, it is important that the Intergovernmental Conference should be concluded before the end of the year so that the process of enlargement which has been embarked upon is not delayed.
The report on the Intergovernmental Conference is the European Parliament' s contribution to that conference.
It discusses both the necessary institutional reforms, about which no conclusions were reached in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and a number of additional questions which must also be dealt with prior to enlargement.
We, the Swedish Members, Mr Pierre Schori, Mr Jan Andersson, Mr GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm and Mrs Ewa Hedkvist Petersen, support the main features of the report, but we would highlight the following points on which, to some extent, we have different opinions, which is why we abstained from voting in the final ballot.
The role of the European Parliament is to represent the people in the Union.
Enlargement means more States' representatives in Parliament.
If an efficient decision-making procedure is to be maintained, there must be a change in the way the seats are distributed.
We advocate a ceiling of 700 Members of the European Parliament.
The number of seats allocated to each country is determined through a system of degressive proportionality on the basis of the country' s population.
Should a system with a single European constituency be introduced, the number of Members should not be increased.
A new weighting of votes in the Council is a prerequisite for successful enlargement of the EU.
It is important that the solution should be a permanent one and not need to be changed in connection with any future enlargement.
It ought to strike a balance between the principles of, on the one hand, 'one country, one vote' and, on the other hand, 'one citizen, one vote' .
An alternative would be for the weighting of votes in the Council to be calculated on the basis of the root of the population in the individual countries.
We believe that each Member State should have a Member in the Commission.
The Members of the Commission work for the whole Union and are important if a consensus between the Member States is to be achieved.
The Commission should therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the countries in the Union.
In that way, the legitimacy of the Commission would also be strengthened.
The task of protecting the Union' s interests against fraud is to be carried out by the individual Member States' institutions and not by a supranational authority.
It is nonetheless important and desirable that there should be European prosecutors in each Member State and that they should cooperate.
Unanimity in the Council must be required in questions of a constitutional and fundamental nature, as well as in questions affecting general security and defence policy.
Closer cooperation between at least a third of the Member States cannot apply in the case of defence cooperation.
EU cooperation is, in the first place, a civilian European project and ought to be distinguished from military cooperation.
The Member States have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned.
We made great progress in Cologne and Helsinki by preparing ourselves for preventive crisis and conflict management.
It is therefore important that the Treaty should reflect the difference between civilian and military cooperation.
Military aid of a kind which places countries under obligations to each other has no place in the EU' s Treaty.
We are not prepared to dispense with the veto in regard to military cooperation.
- The agenda of the IGC has now been set by the Member States.
We now know its general scope, and it is clear that much of the content of this resolution, regardless of its merit or lack of it, has nothing to do with it.
While Parliament is fully entitled to be aspirational, it is a mistake for us not to have focused our input into what the IGC is actually going to discuss and decide.
I fear that not doing this will damage Parliament's reputation and standing, and will not be as helpful to the IGC as it could be.
- (EL) The citizens of Europe, especially workers, farmers, small and medium-sized enterprises, women, the young, the nouveaux pauvres, all those who suffer under the policies of the EU, are already voicing their anger and disagreement, some more forcefully than others, with the choices being made by the European Union.
Unfortunately, instead of heeding the anxiety and supporting the claims of all these classes of society, the resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference kow-tows to capitalist forces and adopts the decisions made by the monopolies to militarise Europe and intervene in third countries, including militarily, in order to limit further still the national independence and the grass-roots sovereignty of individual countries.
With the Single European Act and the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, the ÃU is now beginning, under the pressure of enlargement and the new order, to address issues which it was unable to solve at previous intergovernmental conferences.
Despite proclamations to the contrary, what we have before us is an integrated plan of attack by capitalist forces on the democratic, social, collective and personal rights and freedoms which workers have fought hard to acquire within the context of bourgeois democracy.
The European Union is being used by imperialists and multinationals as a battering ram to break the people' s resistance and make them give up their fight for a better tomorrow.
The efforts being made, supposedly in the name of democracy and the "effectiveness of the institutions" , seek mainly to serve the interests of monopolies and they will inevitably be opposed by the workers and people of Europe.
What is the implication behind generalising the majority voting rule by introducing majority voting, in terms of both the number of States and the number of EU citizens, if not complete indifference to, and degradation of, the interests of the "smaller" countries, of the less developed regions, of the weaker classes of society and of the working and grass-roots classes of the EU in general?
How else are we to interpret the abolition of a country' s right of veto when its vital national interests are at stake?
What is the point of rotating Commissioners' nationalities and not rotating the presidency of the Union if not to exile a supposedly small country from the centre of power for long periods of time so that it is basically unable to defend its interests and the interests of its people, insofar as they can be defended within the framework of the European Union?
What is the point of limiting the number of MEPs, despite the increase in the number of Member States of the European Union, if not to silence those voices which criticise capitalist forces and their plans and promote political processes which brook no alternatives and which are confined to vapid changes of power which pose no threat to capitalism?
Why is the role of national parliaments being eroded by substantially limiting democratic scrutiny?
Why is the weighting of votes in the Council being changed for the benefit of the large countries, at the expense of smaller countries?
There is only one conclusion to be drawn from the EP resolution, which the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against, and from the Commission' s recent proposals. The people of Europe can once again expect no good to come out of this Intergovernmental Conference.
They alone can defend their rights by conducting their own fights, fights which the EU will face in ever more acute form, ever more dynamic form, despite all its efforts to mislead, pull the wool over everyone' s eyes and sugar the pill.
Fights which will lead to coordinated action by the peoples of the EU, to a strong, pan-European, grass-roots front opposed to the EU and its policies and fighting for a different sort of Europe free from rulers, exploitation and war.
The institutional changes envisaged with a view to the enlargement of Europe, whether relating to the composition of the Commission, the weighting of the representation of the Member States or qualified majority voting, do not answer the basic questions we face ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall about the kind of Europe we live in.
European Union policy detaches the most developed regions from any sense of solidarity, accelerating the break up of multinational federations.
It imposes forced privatisation.
Above all, it leads to the policy of a pyromaniac fireman in the Balkans, where all the political, social and environmental consequences still have to be reckoned up.
The stability plan for South-East Europe is a failure: the declarations of loyalty to NATO by the governments of Eastern Europe do not prevent the European Union treating them with contempt and imposing anti-social policies on them.
We must build a Europe capable of enlarging towards the East and the South, to all peoples who democratically express the wish to join.
A genuine public debate, involving all the peoples in drawing up a charter of rights and a common plan for society, would allow us to make progress towards that.
That is why we have voted against this report.
I am sorry I could not vote in favour of the report which contains the European Parliament' s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, despite the efforts made, especially by the rapporteur, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, to humour small Member States and look after their interests to some extent.
It is inadmissible to seek to cut the smallest national delegation, the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg' s, by a third, without giving any details about reductions to the large delegations.
There are other excesses in this veritable shopping list. I denounced them yesterday in my speech and Parliament has adopted them, in particular as regards the composition of the Commission and the decision-making procedures.
Unanimity cannot be limited to constitutional decisions.
It is completely unrealistic and utopian to think that the members of national parliaments will ratify a treaty which contains such dismantling of their rights, as useless as it is unacceptable, and such a veritable castration of the national parliaments.
The Intergovernmental Conference is not intended to increase the powers of the Union; the point of the operation is to improve the functioning of a Union enlarged from 15 to 26 or even 30 Member States.
Through these excesses a majority of this Parliament has done Europe a disservice.
, in writing.
(SV) The Intergovernmental Conference is an historic opportunity for Member States to transform the EU into a democratic, open and efficient organisation, which is why we regret that the governments of the Member States do not have the political will to carry out an in-depth reform of the Union.
We therefore welcome the fact that Parliament wishes to accept the challenge to reform the Union along these lines, but we wish to clarify our position as follows.
A Union of 25 to 30 Member States cannot operate in the same way as a Union of 15 Member States.
Instead, we need both an overview of the institutions' working methods and a clearer distribution of labour between the Member States and the EU.
The EU can only function efficiently and democratically if it deals exclusively with cross-border issues and leaves other issues to be resolved mainly at national level.
The difficulty for the Intergovernmental Conference is to find a delicate balance between the desire to create an efficient and democratic Union and the need, at the same time, to reflect the historic balance of power between small and large Member States. In other words, it must be borne in mind that the EU is a Union of both peoples and States.
On this basis, we think it is important for the present Intergovernmental Conference to establish the size of the Commission at one Commissioner per Member State.
With regard to the distribution of power in the Council, the Commission has proposed a system of 'double simple majority' voting on certain questions. This means that a majority is required from the Member States, but also that these States should represent a majority of the citizens if a decision is to be implemented.
This is important from a democratic perspective in view of the fact that, in this way, the voting clearly reflects the will of the people.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the Commission' s proposal but would emphasise that small countries should not be placed at a disadvantage.
Parliament ought to have 700 seats, distributed among the population on the basis of a degressive proportional scale.
We are well disposed towards trying out a new system involving European lists, which means that elections for a limited number of the 700 seats could take place within the context of a single constituency.
We are aware of the fact that European parties at present have little support among our citizens, but we believe that a supplementary system involving European lists would, in time, lead to an increased European identity.
An EU of approximately 25-30 Member States will lead to more countries wanting to exploit the opportunity that exists for a number of them to go further than others in certain areas of policy (so-called closer cooperation).
We do not think it is appropriate to see this as a permanent solution to the problem which will arise when the EU is enlarged.
The risk entailed in a Europe 'Ã  la carte' is that the whole integrity and basic idea of EU cooperation will be lost.
The solidarity between cooperating States would be in danger of becoming fragmented, something which might have very undesirable consequences for the Union as such.
Flexibility of this kind ought to be seen, rather, as a temporary alternative for countries which are not yet ready, or sufficiently well prepared, to enter into deeper cooperation.
The wording in the Treaty of Amsterdam about closer cooperation is therefore an adequate and acceptable solution.
Too many parallel concentric circles create a system which is difficult to supervise.
The Union' s common objectives should be promoted within the context of such cooperation, and no Member State should be excluded from participating.
We welcome the EU' s increased opportunities to pursue a credible foreign and security policy so that the EU can assume increased responsibility when it comes to solving conflicts in the vicinity of the EU.
At the same time, we would emphasise that this development ought not to lead to our having two parallel and competing organisations for resolving conflicts.
It is therefore important to emphasise that the development concerned must take place in the context of close cooperation between NATO and the EU and that representatives of these organisations must sit down together as soon as possible and agree upon a satisfactory distribution of labour.
- While not able to endorse every dot and comma of this report, I support its broad thrust.
If we are to make a success of enlargement a number of key reforms are essential.
A Union unable to make decisions would not serve the purpose of existing or applicant states.
Therefore,
we must increase the use of qualified majority voting in the Council in order to avoid paralysis in decision taking,
we must limit the number of Commissioners so that the Union's executive remains efficient
and we must limit the number of MEPs to 700 to enable Parliament to function effectively.
We must continue to improve the Community's capacity for external action and further democratise key areas of the Union's activities.
- (PT) Once again, the European Parliament finds itself compelled to adopt a maximalist position on the institutions, a position bereft of any realism.
As usual, it is going all out for an unfettered federalist approach.
This is reflected in the proposal to almost totally eliminate the unanimity rule, to make the codecision process the norm, to institutionalise the European political parties, to create a European electoral club, to integrate the Western European Union, to strengthen Europol, and, to constitutionalise the Treaties in a far-reaching way.
These are ideas from which we have always unequivocally distanced ourselves and will continue to do so.
However, this report also proposes new and unacceptable ideas.
On the pretext that it is necessary to adapt the institutions to the prospect of enlargement, it is now being suggested that there should be a disproportionate strengthening at various levels of the decision-making powers of the large countries and an intolerable reduction of the decision-making powers of the small- and medium-sized countries. All this suggests and implicitly encourages the creation of political inner cabinets, which are totally unacceptable, and which will make it easier to achieve 'enhanced cooperation' .
We are, of course, opposed to such ideas.
At the same time, if the European Parliament approves a report like this, it will appear to be indifferent to situations which are obviously urgent, such as the need to overcome or at least mitigate serious democratic deficits; the need to modify the monetarist principles - in particular the Stability Pact - which are the root cause of today' s social scourges such as unemployment and unstable employment; to change the Statute of the European Central Bank so as to ensure greater transparency and appropriate controls and limits on its powers; and to make the existing principle of economic and social cohesion a reality, which is a vital step in creating a Europe of the future based on solidarity.
The European Parliament could demonstrate its worth by adopting these policies.
But if it opts for the proposals contained in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, this will suggest that it is becoming increasingly remote from the people it is supposed to represent.
We will therefore be voting against the report.
- The complexity of the IGC process inevitably requires a complex response from the European Parliament.
The Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report covers a wide range of issues which could be considered in the framework of the IGC which is taking place over the remainder of 2000.
The debate which has begun between Member States is reflected in the points of view expressed within the European Parliament, as is the tension over the scope of the IGC.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that it is imperative to conclude the IGC before the end of 2000 in order to leave the EU fully prepared for enlargement.
In order to achieve this, we believe that the scope of the IGC should be restricted to "tidying up" the outstanding points from Amsterdam, plus a small range of other issues.
EPLP Members voted in accordance with this approach, reflecting our concerns over the following areas:
There are doubts over the practicability of a European top-up list from 2009 of 10% of MEPs to be elected on a single European constituency.
We have concerns over the workings of a European Public Prosecutor's office whilst being concerned to protect the Union's interests and resources against fraud throughout Community territory.
Likewise, the legislative measures in criminal matters in respect of fraud damaging the interests of the Union will need to be carefully constructed.
The EPLP believes that unanimity cannot solely be restricted to constitutional items, as issues including tax and social security must be dealt with at national level.
Constitutionalising the Treaties and division into two parts is not acceptable to the EPLP, and the same concerns about unanimity apply here.
The EPLP wishes to see a Charter of Fundamental Rights, but until the content of the Charter is determined, the question of giving it binding legal force should be left open.
Whilst greater coordination is required at European level over our airspace (i.e. Eurocontrol), service provision should remain at national level - the Commission has never suggested a single agency and Eurocontrol already exists to coordinate.
The Commission has not previously called for the establishment of a single European air traffic control agency and the request in this report is superfluous.
- (SV) As representatives of the Swedish Christian Democrats, who view enlargement towards the East as being clearly the most important issue for the EU, I wish to make the following remarks before the Heads of Government and State discuss the European Union' s powers and forms of decision making at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.
1) There ought to be one Commissioner per Member State (paragraph 10).
This is about the Commission' s legitimacy and future and about its being able to claim popular support.
2) There ought to be at least six Members of the European Parliament per Member State and, thereafter, a degressive proportional system as at present (paragraph 3.2) and not, as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes, only four Members per State, followed by a strict proportional system.
This is required if it is to be possible to mirror the political breadth and diversity in each Member State.
3) There ought not to be any pan-European lists or single European constituency (paragraph 4).
So as not to make the distance between electors and elected representatives still greater, the Member States should remain as constituencies.
4) 700 should not be set as the upper ceiling for the number of Members of the European Parliament (paragraph 3). Instead, a certain flexibility should be possible, depending upon the number of Member States in the EU.
5) No EU financing of parties which operate at European level should be introduced, nor should any democratically dangerous and arbitrary suspension procedure (paragraph 6).
6) Decisions by qualified majority voting in the Council should not be taken on the basis of a simple majority from the Member States. Instead, it ought to be a two-thirds majority (paragraph 8), and this in order to win legitimacy.
7) A decision as serious as that of suspending a Member State from the EU should require the unanimous agreement of the other Member States and not, as proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the agreement of four-fifths of the Member States (paragraph 29).
8) Social protection should not be regarded as an issue of Community interest (paragraph 42). In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, this ought instead to remain an issue to be legislated on at national level.
9) The financing of the EU should not be completely independent of contributions by the Member States (paragraph 44.4).
10) Respect for neutral States' solutions in the field of defence policy and for their right to make their own decisions should be clearly upheld within the framework of the CFSP (paragraph 34).
11) To make it easier for citizens of the Member States to know which institutions are responsible for what, the principle of subsidiarity (to which there are unfortunately no references at all in this report) should be integrated into the Treaty in such a way that the EU' s powers are concentrated upon clearly defined, cross-border core issues.
The national parliaments and local authorities should play an important role by ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is respected and by monitoring governments' action in the Council.
- (SV) When the European Parliament today stated its position on the Intergovernmental Conference, I advocated solutions which also provide for the interests of the small Member States.
The trend within Parliament towards less understanding of smaller countries' needs will increase the antagonism between Parliament and the Council of Ministers.
I am concerned that there is no desire to find a balanced solution regarding the weighting of votes within the Council of Ministers and regarding the number of Commissioners who should provide for the interests of both large and small Member States.
Through my Group, I have tabled an amendment aimed at guaranteeing that all of a particular country' s nationalities and regions are represented in Parliament.
I also supported the proposal which emphasised the right of regional ministers to participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers on matters which fall within the scope of their autonomy.
However, I would express my satisfaction at the fact that so much attention has been devoted to the way in which the EC Court of Justice operates.
The Intergovernmental Conference must now give consideration to Parliament' s constructive proposals.
I am extremely surprised at the proposals which would give Members of the European Parliament the right to participate in the appointment of the judges.
Finland supports the proposal that the Commission might be given a mandate to conduct trade negotiations in regard to services and immaterial rights following decisions in the Council with a qualified majority.
When the Council in this way reaches a decision about a negotiation mandate, Parliament' s consent ought to be requested. Otherwise, there will be a loss of democratic and parliamentary control over the trade negotiations.
Since I do not consider the report to be in earnest with regard to the demands for decision making in the Council, to the way in which judges are to be appointed and to the number of Members of Parliament, I voted against the report in the final vote (238 votes in favour, 147 votes against and 73 abstentions).
Because the report is far-reaching in its scope and because there is considerable disagreement about it, Parliament' s point of view will be of little significance.
That concludes the vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 2.02 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
I would just like to ask whether Mr Berlusconi' s name was included by mistake in the attendance register in the Minutes of yesterday' s sitting.
I do not remember Mr Berlusconi being present.
Mr Frassoni, the department responsible will, of course, check up on this in the simplest way: we will ask Mr Berlusconi or his assistants directly whether he was present yesterday.
Mr President, with reference to Mr Frassoni' s intervention, we sent a letter to President Fontaine this morning.
We, too, would like to know how Mr Berlusconi, who is tied up in an electoral campaign in Italy, came to be included on the attendance list; we would like to know the identity of the joker who played this trick, which is in appallingly bad taste, or whether there is something going on which has nothing to do with politics.
We therefore asked the President of the Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, to carry out an internal enquiry, which we hope will take place during the mini part-session at the beginning of May.
This is certainly a most regrettable incident, Mr Fiori, and I hope that the internal enquiry will shed some light on the matter.
Topical and Urgent Debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Iraq
Mr President, it is very important to point out that sanctions are themselves a form of warfare.
They are targeted at the most innocent civilians, at the innocent people in societies, especially children, the most vulnerable.
The sanctions on Iraq have become a weapon of mass destruction against the helpless people there.
Over 200 children die there every single day.
This is not acceptable.
We cannot allow this to go on.
Denis Halliday, who resigned his position as Director of the UN Humanitarian Mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions, confirmed the UNICEF statistics that 5 000 to 6 000 children die every month as a direct result of sanctions.
Mary Robinson, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, has been speaking out against sanctions for a long time.
She said you cannot expect her to condemn human rights abuses in other parts of the world and let the United Nations itself be responsible for what is happening in Iraq following the sanctions.
In February Mr Hans von Sponek, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, followed in the steps of Mr Halliday when he also resigned in protest at the on-going sanctions and the bombing of the Iraqi people.
Within hours of his resignation, the head of the World Food Programme in Iraq since January 1999 also resigned in protest at the sanctions.
These resignations must cause the world community to reconsider the justification for the continuing sanctions policy and also the bombings.
I would like to point out that 70 Congressmen sent a letter to Bill Clinton in the United States asking him to lift the embargo, asking him to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place in Iraq.
It is not just here in Europe that people are concerned, but right across the world.
If anyone looked at the very good documentary by the world-famous journalist, John Pilger, they would see what is happening there.
Can we allow this to go on without saying something about it?
It is a blatant violation of international human rights laws.
The sanctions are targeting the most vulnerable in society and making them suffer yet, at the same time, the elite in that society and the people who are part of the Saddam Hussein regime do not suffer from the sanctions.
It is the ordinary people who suffer.
We cannot allow this to go on.
It is not right and the US Congressmen who sent the letter to Bill Clinton are quite right: we have to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place.
We also have to address the bombings that are taking place without any UN mandate.
That is absolutely unacceptable.
A whole family was wiped out by these bombings, as shown in Mr Pilger's documentary.
This is something we cannot ignore and we must push for an end to this inhumane policy.
Mr President, firstly let me say to my colleague and friend, Ms McKenna, that there is nothing in what she said that I do not agree with.
No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves.
The facts have been presented by respected international bodies such as UNICEF.
We have no reason whatsoever to doubt their veracity.
There are shortages of essential foodstuffs and agricultural infrastructure resulting in severe nutritional deficiencies.
Iraq, once one of the most economically advanced countries of the region, is being reduced to underdevelopment.
But let there be no illusion as to the role of the Iraqi regime in the suffering of its people.
The consistent refusal by the regime to fully implement United Nations resolutions has led to a situation where the sanctions remain firmly in place almost ten years after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
Furthermore, the refusal of the regime for five years to accept the oil-for-food programme has certainly contributed to the humanitarian situation.
We, in Parliament, are well-intentioned towards the people of Iraq and are serious in our desire for a peaceful and lasting solution.
We must concentrate our efforts on convincing Iraq to implement the United Nations resolutions.
We must make it very clear in this forum that United Nations resolutions are legally binding on all members of the United Nations.
The European Parliament must not be seen to undermine the legitimacy of such resolutions in any way.
Any such action would be grist to the propaganda mill of the Iraqi regime.
It is within the power of the regime to have the sanctions imposed by the United Nations lifted.
To date, the regime most regrettably has preferred to allow its people to be threatened by disease and starvation than to respect international law.
Full implementation of Resolution 1284 obliges Iraq, among other things, to cooperate with the Red Cross in overseeing the repatriation of detainees.
Let us recall that last January this House voted unanimously a resolution calling on Iraq, as a minimum, to provide answers to the Red Cross as to the whereabouts of the missing Kuwaitis for which there is documented evidence.
I too have met some of these people.
I have shared their suffering with them.
Let us clearly understand that is a tragedy in itself.
We are caught between a rock and a hard place.
It is heartbreaking to see innocent children being sacrificed by their own leaders for purely personal, political motives.
Mr President, during these last few days, Parliament has been watching an extraordinarily powerful documentary on the effects of the sanctions on Iraq, and I would like to thank Patricia McKenna for this.
Civilians, men, women and children are dying because of the sanctions.
I will not repeat the figures, for we are all aware of them and they have been quoted many times in this Chamber.
But what a contradiction. What a tragedy.
In the name of the protection of human rights, the rich, powerful countries of the West are killing communities and starving them to death.
During the war in Yugoslavia, American aircraft continuously bombarded towns, killing civilians.
It is better to tell the truth and admit that the interests of the United States take precedence over those of communities.
Today, we are going to vote on a motion, a very important motion for a resolution calling for an end to the sanctions, an end to the embargo.
I feel that we must then act in order to give practical effect to our resolution.
There is no doubt about the fact that it is important for Iraq to change its policy and that the existing arms must be monitored and decommissioned, but, in this regard, there is abundant documented evidence that the nuclear and chemical weapons have already been decommissioned.
And that is essential.
However, I also feel that a clear policy must be developed for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons where they exist in the Middle East.
For example, Israel is full of nuclear weapons and no one is asking Israel to decommission. Unfortunately, even the resolution called for by Egypt was not supported by the European Parliament in Cairo.
We must do everything possible to free this world from the nuclear threat.
Today, I would also like to pay tribute to Dennis Halliday - mentioned by Ms McKenna as well - who was responsible for the oil-for-food deal.
In a world of hypocrites and careerists, Dennis Halliday had the courage to speak out over the implications of the sanctions on the Iraqi people and to condemn the lies of the United States departments.
Saddam Hussein is certainly responsible and guilty, but we are also incurring a great deal of responsibility and guilt in continuing with a policy which maintains the population of a country in extreme poverty, a population such as the Iraqi people, with a rich history and culture, a population made up of people, women, children, who want to live.
I hope that when the embargo imposed on Iraq is lifted, this will be the end of all embargoes everywhere throughout the world.
This is important for all of us.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are debating a tragic issue - a source of shame to all of us - and Mr Ford is not here. Not one of Parliament' s noble spirits is here, and yet the sanctions against Iraq are already ten years old, ten years!
People think the war, the missiles and the gassings are over, but the filthy effects of this war, which was never clean, go on.
There is still bombing in the North and in the South.
Cornfields are being burned in a country which invented agriculture; date palms are being burned daily.
In the Strasbourg newspaper yesterday, there was an interview with a priest who risked his life just to go to the Babylon area, in Ur.
For people who go there, taking ambulances and medicines, like me and the National Front, Iraq is a vast concentration camp.
18 million women, children, old people, men, a whole Arab people, are being held captive in their own country by the West, with millions of deaths every day, hundreds of children dying, a systematic, scientific, meticulous, planned, cynical, perverse genocide.
It is not just their bodies which are under attack by being deprived of food, milk, meat and fruit. Their minds are under attack as well.
There are no books.
Even pencils are banned, on the pretext that their graphite could be used as coolant in the nuclear power stations.
There are schools but there is no paper.
There are doctors, but there is no medicine.
There are hospitals, but there is nothing inside them.
It is perverse.
They were promised food in exchange for oil.
But they are asked to practically give their oil away and then buy food.
Ladies and gentlemen - especially Members who are not here - by what right is this happening?
Do not keep silent!
Do not be accomplices!
UN officials are resigning.
We should not have to go there in thirty years time, like the Belgians in Rwanda, and say sorry, or like the Holy Father, who is prostrating himself all over the place.
The honour of Europe depends on our speaking out for these young Arabs, for this great people being consigned to the night.
It is all very well being afraid of imaginary dangers in Vienna, but it is in Baghdad that the violation of human rights is taking place.
Let Washington' s Nebuchadnezzar let these people go, these slaves in their own country.
They must be released from this poverty.
I appeal to your consciences!
Europe is denying itself!
Just as people kept silent about Spain in 1936, just as people kept silent about the camps, they are keeping silent about Iraq.
There is no time to lose; this people could cease to exist.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to act quickly.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament will shortly be voting on a joint resolution and that is certainly not just because we are determined to have a clear conscience and actually condemn the perpetuation of sanctions which have never achieved their goals, as everyone agrees.
It is also because we think there is a real possibility of preventing a new risk of military force being unleashed there, given the experience of our colleague, Mr Buttiglione, who has been to Iraq and has alerted us to the fact that there is currently a significant risk of renewed bombing.
He had the opportunity of meeting representatives of the Iraqi government, from whom he was able to obtain a commitment to respect the United Nations resolutions.
So he undertook to ensure that Parliament would send a strong signal to the Iraqi people, given that its government agrees to implement the United Nations resolutions.
We have committed ourselves to ask for the immediate lifting of sanctions.
That is the purpose of this joint resolution and all the groups have agreed that, to show Parliament' s unanimity on this distressing issue, there should definitely be no amendments.
Mr President, I can only endorse the speeches that have just been made, especially Mr Morillon' s.
We certainly cannot continue to accept this situation.
But we can feel gratified that we are voting in Parliament today on a resolution on the situation in Iraq which has, for the first time - and I hope we will take advantage of this to change our style a bit - won the approval of almost all the political groups.
That unanimity is reassuring, because all the signatories to this resolution are in agreement on the essential point. That has happened because we all now know that the essential point is a certain concept of humanity, relations between peoples, values - in short, civilisation, the heart of Europe' s identity.
Mr President, this resolution clearly calls for respect for the UN resolutions, especially Resolutions 687, 688 and 1293, and also Resolution 1284 on which we are seeking clarification.
I would mention, too, that only two members of the Security Council voted for it, against the advice of the three other members who abstained.
Mr President, this does not mean we are releasing the Iraqi regime from its responsibilities and obligations.
It means that, for the first time, the international community is being asked to show consistency with its own principles, because the various UN committees agree that these resolutions have been virtually all applied by the Iraqi regime, except for some minor points of interpretation or detail.
And here I differ slightly from Mr Collins.
The fact is the discrepancies between Iraq and the international community do not justify maintaining the embargo.
Remember, the Iraqi people are innocent.
But it is they and not their rulers, who were never democratically elected, who are now paying the price of these sanctions in human lives.
Mr Hans von Sponek, the former head of the UN Oil for Food Programme, mentioned by Ms McKenna just now, said that, as a human being, with a heart and a soul, he could no longer tolerate what he was seeing in Iraq.
He decided to resign.
The disproportion between the constantly reiterated demands of certain members of the Security Council for the sanctions to be ruthlessly maintained and their consequences for the Iraqi people is - I am weighing my words - truly terrifying!
UNICEF estimates that half a million children have died as a result of nine years of sanctions, to the utter indifference of the civilised world.
It must be remembered that the rules of war involve respect for civilians.
The right of coercion over populations - it must also be remembered - should not lead to the right to starve them.
That is also one of the great principles of Western civilisation!
Mr President, our resolution is very consistent.
It calls for respect for all the UN resolutions first and foremost, clarification of Resolution 1284 and, consequently, the lifting of sanctions and constant vigilance against the Iraqi regime, respect by all for the rules of the UN Charter, including the members of the Security Council who are carrying out military action contrary to international law and, finally, the search for a global political solution.
Mr President, that is the only way dictatorships can really be weakened and concord between all the peoples of the region promoted.
For once, Europe must speak with a European voice!
Mr President, Mr Morillon has already explained my Group' s position, which is in favour of this joint resolution.
For my part, I would refer to the procedure which seems to me in this case to be important.
This is a debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, which has been devalued insofar as we are not getting a declaration from the Council, as Parliament had requested, on including this point as a Council declaration.
I would like to say that, without presenting any valid argument, this attitude on the part of the Council seems to me to show a lack of respect towards Parliament, especially when Parliament offers the Council the opportunity to make any declaration on any subject, as laid down in Rule 37.
It is truly contradictory that this Parliament cannot obtain a Council declaration on an issue as sensitive as this.
Therefore, Mr President, I would like to say that my Group intends to ask the Committee on External Affairs, at its next meeting, to present, pursuant to Rule 42, an oral question to the Council so that the Council will reply.
If this initiative is not successful, my political group will present, pursuant to the same article, an oral question to the Council so that the Council really takes seriously the worries and concerns of this Parliament and really does what is laid down in the Treaties, that is to say, to inform and cooperate with Parliament in all those areas which affect and concern the citizens of the European Union.
Mr Salafranca, you and those who are of the same opinion as yourself could also make the Conference of Presidents aware of your views.
The Conference of Presidents is shortly to meet here in Strasbourg in order to establish the programme for the forthcoming part-sessions, and it could issue a request along the lines that you have suggested.
Mr President, I am as concerned as anybody in this House about the suffering of the people of Iraq as the result of sanctions but also of the actions of their own government.
We should all remember that sanctions are sometimes better than the alternatives that we may have to consider.
If we are to support this resolution then Iraq must most definitely honour its obligations under all the United Nations resolutions.
We, as a Parliament, must stand by our resolution of January this year, calling for the release of all Kuwaitis and other non-Iraqi nationals who are still imprisoned in Iraq.
I had the opportunity to visit Iraq last month.
I met the families of the Kuwaiti prisoners.
I can tell you that fathers do not forget their sons, brothers do not forget their brothers, children do not forget their fathers; nor should this House.
We should remind Saddam Hussein that he must honour his obligations to the international community and we shall then honour our obligations to Iraq.
Mr President, the Commission shares the concern expressed during this debate.
It regrets Iraq' s decision not to accept United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284.
As Mr Collins and Mr Morillon in particular have pointed out, this decision delays the application of the new instrument of control and hence the relaxation of sanctions.
We think the Oil for Food Programme is still the best short-term solution to ease the suffering of the Iraqi population, and the Iraqi government should reverse its policy of non-cooperation and comply with all the United Nations Security Council resolutions, as has been said.
Since the Gulf War, the Community has been the principal source of humanitarian aid to Iraq, with at least EUR 240 million provided to reduce the considerable sufferings of the Iraqi people.
And we could have done even more if the Iraqi government had not imposed restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organisations, hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid in Iraq.
Given the situation we cannot pretend that humanitarian aid can do any more than alleviate some of the effects of this awful economic and human situation in the short term.
The economic situation in Iraq can only improve as economic activity develops after sanctions are lifted. This involves engaging the Iraqi government, perhaps more than we are doing today, in a dialogue on the implementation of the Security Council resolutions.
In this regard, we agree with the draft resolution.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m.
Chechnya
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-350/2000) by Mr Markov, Mr Vinci, Mr Papayannakis and Mrs Ainardi, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Chechnya;
(B5-0363/2000) by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, Mr Haarder, Mr Maaten and Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Chechnya;
(B5-0366/2000) by Mr Oostlander and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPEÂ­DE Group, on Chechnya;
(B5-0375/2000) by Mr Sakellariou and Mrs Krehl, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Chechnya;
(B5-0387/2000) by Mrs Schroedter, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the armed conflict in the Republic of Chechnya.
Mr President, Parliament has been dealing with the situation in and around Chechnya for some time.
We have followed with concern developments in the fundamentalist Islamic forces' attempts to split Chechnya away from the Russian Federation.
We are categorically opposed to any form of terrorism and we support the fight against terrorism in every country in the world.
I believe that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country is an inviolable and fundamental principle.
However, for several months a war has been raging in Chechnya which none of these arguments can justify.
I spent over six years of my life in Russia and have very close ties with that country.
So I feel it all the more that Russia is totally overreacting in its use of military force in the Chechen conflict.
I find it totally unacceptable that we are witnessing violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian army.
It is a matter of deep regret and profound concern to me that militaristic thinking has now again taken hold in Russia.
It has long been recognised that military might never permanently resolves any conflict, and this needs to be remembered now.
It is high time that this war ended and that a political solution to this conflict was found, no matter how difficult and complicated that might be.
Furthermore, an enormous effort is required to restore this devastated region for the people who have lost all their possessions in the war and to make it habitable once again.
In the long term, this is the only way to remove this focus of conflict.
My Group supports this motion for a resolution, and we consider it essential that this Parliament, in conjunction with the members of the Russian Duma, should seek means of restoring peace in Chechnya without delay.
Mr President, ten days ago, the UN' s Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, returned home from a visit to Russia where she was to investigate the situation in Chechnya in regard to human rights abuses.
Mary Robinson obtained limited access.
She was not allowed to meet the Russian President and was treated in a most humiliating way.
In her report to the UN' s session on human rights in Geneva, Mrs Robinson reported on individual testimonies concerning very serious crimes which had been committed in Chechnya.
The witnesses she had met had told of murders of civilians, summary trials, executions, rapes, torture and kidnappings.
Domestic affairs can never be pleaded as an excuse for atrocities of this kind.
We have a global responsibility to defend basic rights.
Abuses of these cannot - must not - be seen as internal matters.
The UN' s High Commissioner must continue to be supported in his work.
The European Parliament has, on a number of occasions, expressed concern about the situation in Chechnya.
We support the Council of Europe' s decision of last week to suspend Russia if no appropriate measures are taken.
For a liberal, considerations of trade and short-term benefits cannot come before the defence of human rights.
We would therefore react vigorously to these atrocities, but we also see it as very important to cooperate with democratic forces in Russia and with the new government.
We therefore hope that we can organise a joint delegation from the European Parliament and the Russian Duma to travel to Chechnya and, there on the spot, engage in discussions, conduct investigations and bring about a dialogue.
We presume that Russia will be of assistance and allow the delegation to travel freely.
We also hope that the EU can eventually contribute to a reconstruction programme in the region.
Mr President, what has happened in the war in Chechnya has shocked us all.
A guerrilla war is being fought without the civilian population being spared, in fact, the civilian population is also suffering the dreadful atrocities that can occur in wartime.
The first war in Chechnya may have evoked sympathy from us as a battle for autonomy and independence and setting things right in their own territory, but we now have to say that, although this war really ended quite well for the Chechens, the intervening period was not used to best advantage and Chechnya became a country of complete chaos, where kidnapping was commonplace and where the citizens were no longer safe.
At one stage, Chechen generals even invaded Dagestan, an action which merited absolutely no sympathy whatsoever.
This illustrates that there are various movements within Chechnya.
On the one hand, there are the military who tend to play the Afghan card or count on Iran for support.
The other two groupings seek more of a political solution.
One of them is seeking a solution more in terms of what we in Western Europe would also wish to achieve and the other is again seeking to strengthen relations with Russia.
Mr President, the President of Chechnya has limited control over the troops in his country.
We are pleased to hear that Maskadov does not support the actions of his military.
We are also delighted to hear that the Russians are at long last admitting to the fact that Mr Putin is contacting the Chechen authorities indirectly.
We have also noted hat the Council of Europe has adopted a position in this regard.
We know from the Russian delegation that was here until yesterday that this has hit them exceptionally hard and we spoke about it with them in detail.
We have also heard that there is the possibility of a joint parliamentary delegation undertaking a fact-finding mission on an ad hoc basis under the best possible conditions with a view to looking around the territory of Chechnya wherever it sees fit to do so.
A mission of this kind must take place soon and I believe it is important that in the resolution tabled on the basis of the liberal text, an amendment is included to this effect.
Mr President, we support an exceptionally brief resolution in that regard, perhaps even the briefest ever made in this House, consisting of the first two recitals of the liberal resolution, followed by the recital in which the decisions of the Council of Europe are mentioned.
We shall vote against Article 1 because once again it involves support for this statement and we could substitute a better statement of our own.
We shall willingly support Article 2 of the liberal resolution and then Amendment No 2 as well which refers to the joint parliamentary delegation which may be more useful in the future, because it is the future that we must concern ourselves with here.
The delegation will have to examine what can be done to preserve the defence of human rights in the region, but also examine what we can do in the future to help Chechnya become a democratic constitutional state.
Who knows whether with help from the European Union and Russia, a Stability Pact for the Caucasus region can ever be achieved.
Mr President, for these reasons we support this resolution, which initially was not to our liking, but which, at the moment, provides the best basis for a statement from this House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to repeat what the three previous speakers have said, with which I totally concur.
In addition, my colleague, Mr Swoboda, will also say a few words about the reasons behind this war.There is a very broad consensus within this Parliament condemning both the war against civilians in Chechnya and the terrorism which started in Chechnya, and this same consensus applies to the desire to maintain good and special relations with Russia.
On the other hand, we are determined not simply to stand by and watch whilst Russia violates one international convention after another in this war in Chechnya.
We support the proposal from Mr Lukin, the Co-President of the Interparliamentary Delegation of the European Parliament and Russian Duma to send a fact-finding mission to Chechnya to gather information on the ground.
We want to make use of this information at a later stage, that is after the delegation has returned, as the basis for a major debate in this House, involving the Council and the Commission, and leading to the adoption of a really well founded resolution.
For this reason and this reason alone we, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, urge you not to adopt a motion for a resolution today - which would in fact bring the total to seven - and instead wait until we have the information we need for an in-depth debate resulting in a joint resolution.
Mr President, firstly I would like to say that, through political pragmatism and through loyalty to the work that we do with the other groups in this House, we will support a joint resolution which basically supports the decision of the Council of Europe and the sending of a joint delegation from the Duma and the European Parliament.
We must also say that we do not share this kind of silence on the part of the European Parliament which is spreading to all these issues like a low mist which obscures everything.
We have even noted that the Council of Europe itself is showing more courage than this Parliament.
What has happened in Chechnya is shameful, the crushing of a whole people, and it is also shameful that this House has had to listen to 'Mr CFSP' talking about issues such as 'the proportionate use of force' or recommending that the Russian authorities lessen the intensity of the conflict.
What is a proportionate use of force in a case such as Chechnya?
What proportion are we talking about?
This is unacceptable.
What is meant by lessening the intensity of the conflict in Chechnya?
Perhaps stopping the massacre of women and children?
Perhaps stopping the bombing of hospitals?
Please explain this to us.
Of course, we still believe that there is sufficient reason to suspend the partnership and cooperation agreement on the basis of the human rights clause.
I would like to end by saying that I fully agree with what Mr Cohn-Bendit said in this House: in this Europe and this World which we want to build, let us have no more masking of attacks on entire peoples on the grounds of their being internal matters. We have had enough of excuses of this type.
There is no such thing as internal affairs in this world we want to build.
Either we have human rights or we do not have human rights.
Mr President, our Group firmly supports the short resolution tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which largely goes back to a proposal on our part, because we want to see threefold solidarity: solidarity with the people of Chechnya, which is still imminently threatened with genocide, because that is what all this is about, together with energy interests.
Just now we heard about the issue of maintaining order. The history of the twentieth century is littered with strong men who used secret services and other means to create chaos so that they could then present themselves as a force for law and order.
Let there be no mistake, we should not let Mr Putin get away with that.
We must not allow the people of Chechnya to become victims of a genocide motivated principally by raw materials interests.
Secondly, we want to show our solidarity with our colleagues on the other side of the River Ill, with our colleagues in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, who have taken a courageous step and who we should not lag behind in fighting for human rights.
Thirdly, we would like to demonstrate our solidarity with the Russian people, because the war in Chechnya is threatening to become an instrument of nationalism, which will be used to lever out the rule of law and freedom of the press, which are still very weak in Russia, and to turn the clock back in that country.
Anyone who wishes to defend the Russian people must work to ensure that attempts to remove press freedom, as evidenced by the Babitsky case and by many other cases, do not succeed, and that Russia continues on the path towards greater freedom and towards closer links with the European Union.
That is why we must say a resounding 'yes' to steps against these wrongdoings and why we believe that it is important for representatives of this Parliament to visit Chechnya as soon as possible, following the example of the Council of Europe and the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Robinson.
This joint delegation needs to set off without delay.
It would be a great step forward if this succeeded.
And, as I have already said, it is vital for us to make it crystal clear that we back human rights for the people of both Chechnya and of Russia.
We wish to help both peoples and both peoples have the right to advance towards freedom and towards taking their proper place in the international community.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, foreign policy needs to be based not only on fundamental moral values and principles, but also on success in achieving its aims and objectives, and this should not be confused with opportunism.
I therefore support everything that has been said here about condemning the barbaric war being waged by Russia, which is a war that recalls the darkest days of the Soviet Union.
What we want to see is a new Russia, not a seamless transition from the Soviet Union, but a new Russia.
To my mind, it very much remains to be seen whether the new President Putin can guarantee this, certainly on the basis of what we have seen so far.
So there is no alternative to condemning this war and saying that although we certainly condemn terrorism we regard Russia' s reaction as being totally disproportionate, inappropriate and unacceptable.
That is what we should condemn.
But we should not fool ourselves into imagining that in this case we simultaneously want to achieve something important for peace in Europe and throughout the world as whole, that is to say a dialogue with Russia and ultimately a partnership with Russia.
Unfortunately, Russia is only accepting this in words, not in deeds.
That is why I think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists.
It is the job of the Council Presidency and the Commission, whilst at the same time defending moral values and condemning this war, to endeavour to ensure that we support those forces which are all too poorly represented in Russia, but who nevertheless wish to pursue a European path, a path towards a European partnership, a partnership with the European Union.
This is the formula we need: condemnation of the war and a visit by the delegation, after which we must take whatever steps are necessary.
And if those steps have to be harsh ones, then we should, in full awareness of the facts, not shrink back from taking them.
Mr President, once again we are discussing the situation in Chechnya.
In the last few days the Commission and the Member States have held several meetings with their Russian counterparts: the ministerial troika with Mr Putin and Mr Ivanov on 7 April in Moscow, and the Cooperation Council with Russia, last Monday in Luxembourg.
During these discussions, we have reiterated our main demands: cease-fire and political dialogue, access for, and presence of, international and humanitarian organisations, and independent inquiries into any human rights violations.
All these demands are also in the European Parliament' s resolution and the recommendation from the Council of Europe' s Parliamentary Assembly.
As the European Parliament has emphasised, the Russian authorities have failed to respond satisfactorily to these requests.
All that can be said is that Mr Ivanov finally accepted the European Union and ECHO embassies at the last Cooperation Council.
Recent discussions in the Council of Europe, the Committee on Human Rights in Geneva and this Parliament reflect growing concern amongst the European public.
For our part, we support the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson' s request to Russia to set up a broad independent committee of inquiry into any violations of human rights, based on recognised international criteria.
Last Monday' s General Affairs Council stressed the importance of maintaining an open and frank dialogue, including on this subject, with the Russian authorities.
We think Russia should pursue implementation of the partnership agreement in terms of its elements - I do mean all its elements - and provide more concrete results than we have at this stage.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m.

Jewish prisoners in Iran
Mr President, what is the purpose of this joint resolution?
Surely it is to establish a proper and public judicial process against the thirteen members of the Jewish community in the Southern Iranian town of Shiraz?
The European Parliament in no way disputes the right of the Islamic Republic of Iran to react against foreign attempts at espionage and where the burden of proof is decisive, to punish them accordingly.
The point is, however, that the arrest and imprisonment of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz up to now has been a real caricature of a normal judicial process, a process that the constitution of the Islamic Republic itself actually provides for.
What fundamental objections are we actually raising against the judicial action taken by the Iranian authorities?
To start with, a variety of scarcely plausible accusations have been levelled at the accused.
For example, proselytising against Islam and the joint teaching of boys and girls, a violation of the customary separation of the sexes in education in that country.
The latest accusation was scarcely credible to the orthodox Jewish community in Shiraz.
Finally, the official accusers raised the almost stereotypical subject of spying for 'America and the Zionists' , which means the state of Israel.
And so these thirteen Jews are being threatened with the death penalty.
And remember, this has been the case for over a year as they were arrested in March 1999.
The whole affair in the meantime smacks of the unremitting power struggle between the reformist camp around President Khatami and the conservatives around revolutionary leader Khomenei - by trampling on a defenceless Jewish minority of about 30 000 people.
What position should the European Parliament take in this tough, domestic political struggle with regard to the specific case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz?
Of course, it goes without saying that we should support those Iranian powers that publicly declare that they are striving for a society based on the rule of law and human rights and who are open to contact with the West.
This fundamental choice involves, at the same time, not giving the hard-liners in the Islamic Republic any excuse to undermine this promising path of reform.
Our amendment in paragraph 5 is based on this very consideration.
Iranian fundamentalists will immediately attack the European request to Teheran to support the complete abolition of the death penalty - note that this is a provision that runs directly counter to Islamic law, the sharia, as a renewed attempt at the pernicious westernisation of their own Islamic Republic!
And, in their view, the abolition of the sharia is equivalent to the abolition of the present Iranian form of government.
In short, this addition does nothing to support the case of the thirteen Jews from Shiraz.
The European Parliament must not, therefore, give ammunition for propaganda in this matter of life and death to the ultra-conservatives in Iran, who, in the last few years, have quite simply been pushed onto the defensive by Khatami and his followers.
What we have in mind is a clear legal settlement of this tragedy, ending we hope with the release of all prisoners.
That would really add a happy chapter to the almost 2500 years of history of the Jewish community in the land of the Persians.
God willing, that is what we shall see!
Mr President, the trial of thirteen Iranian Jews accused of espionage has opened today in Teheran.
The trial is taking place behind closed doors.
These people have been in prison for months under conditions we know virtually nothing about.
Their lawyers, some of whom are state appointed, were only allowed to look at the files the day before yesterday.
There is no guarantee of the right to a defence.
I am afraid this may only be a mock trial.
Yet the charge is so serious it could lead to the death penalty.
When the case started, we had the privilege of hearing some leading government dignitaries publicly call for the prisoners to be put to death straight away.
This case, which was built up from nothing - I think we are all convinced of that - has mobilised international public opinion powerfully.
With strong feeling all over the world, including in Strasbourg today, the international pressure has had some impact because the Iranian leaders have softened their position, in particular announcing that most of the accused would no longer be appearing on the charge of espionage, tantamount to execution.
Three have been freed on bail. Finally, the court announced this morning that the trial was being adjourned until 1 May, which is a step forward, at least.
But some of the accused are still facing the death penalty and the others face heavy sentences.
The government' s various changes of attitude illustrate their embarrassment very well.
They were incapable of stating the charges clearly until the very last minute.
It is also clear that the outcome of this trial partly depends on how the Iranian political situation evolves.
In the last parliamentary elections, in February, the reformist tendency defeated the conservatives who include the most extremist elements.
So this trial is starting at a significant moment: on the one hand, Iran is signalling openness and progress, on the other, the conservatives are trying to hang on to power by every means at their disposal.
There is consequently a risk that this case of the thirteen Iranian Jews will be used by one faction against another, in step with domestic conflicts.
Justice has little place in that kind of battle, and human rights even less.
So it is imperative that we react.
The European Union is based on the values laid down in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As a member of the UN, Iran should be applying them too.
That is why we must demand the release of the prisoners: the thirteen Iranian Jews, but also the other eight Moslem prisoners and the students we know absolutely nothing about.
We must also call on the Union governments to do the same.
We also demand that observers be permitted to attend the trial, because public hearings are fundamental to holding a fair trial.
Finally, we must make it absolutely clear that the development of our relations with Iran will be subject to respect for human rights in that country.
Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, since 1979, fifteen Jews have been executed in Iran. The charge was espionage, but their real crime was being Jewish.
Today, a new trial is starting in Shiraz, in the South.
Thirteen Jews and eight Moslems have also been detained for a year in Iranian jails, facing death by hanging.
The youngest is only sixteen years old.
Back in September, Parliament resolutely called for respect for the fundamental rights of these prisoners in terms of a fair, just and public trial, with their own lawyers and with international observers present.
When the more moderate elements won the last elections, we thought our call had been heard.
But now there is this parody of a trial, a summary procedure behind closed doors before a revolutionary court presided over by a single judge, and a cleric at that. As for observers, so far Teheran has not granted any visas.
In other words, we are disappointed, disappointed and alarmed.
We are continuing to insist that the international community be able to follow the proceedings from start to finish.
Furthermore, at the request of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the European Parliament is urgently calling on the Council to send an official delegation to visit the prisoners.
There is no such thing as an internal matter where human rights are involved.
Our feelings are as strong as our concern.
We must make ourselves perfectly clear.
Iran' s possible return to the bosom of the international community has a price today.
We hope the Council and the Commission will rally unequivocally to our position.
We must remain intransigent on this point - human rights are not negotiable.
Mr President, Commissioner, if voices other than ours had not been raised in the last few days, to give the Iranian Government a warning, thirteen Iranians charged with espionage just for being in touch with relatives in other parts of the world would, at this very moment, be facing trial behind closed doors under summary procedure, leaving them no chance of their most basic rights to a defence being guaranteed.
You have just heard confirmation, from Mr Sylla, that this planned mock trial is at least going to be adjourned for a few days.
That means there is the utmost justification for dealing with Parliament' s second joint resolution on this issue under urgent procedure.
It also means there is a chance this resolution - expressing our indignation - might be heard in Iran, where the results of the recent elections have raised the hope of progress there on fundamental human rights. As everyone who has already spoken has said, it is our duty to ensure that those rights are respected.
Mr President, when we learned a few months ago that thirteen Iranian Jews had been imprisoned a year earlier, we were concerned for their fate. At that time, in an effort to reassure us, the Iranian Government told us it was not a racist trial because many Moslems had also been arrested and indicted on the same charge along with the thirteen Jews.
But the trial opening today only involves the Jews. They are being tried separately from the Moslems charged with them, which proves, if proof were needed, that this trial - which we are told is to be adjourned - is no genuine trial.
You will remember, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and it has been mentioned, that some Iranian Jews were arrested for spying for Israel a few years ago.
They were put on trial for it and hanged.
Who are the accused?
We should point out that they include a cobbler, a cemetery caretaker, a boy who is not even sixteen yet, and two old men.
It is hard to understand how these people are endangering Iranian democracy.
What are they supposed to have done?
No one really knows!
We do not have the right to know what they are supposed to have done.
A letter to a family in Israel may have been enough to set this case in motion.
In a previous resolution and in repeated letters supported by the President, we asked to be allowed to visit the prisoners.
That was refused.
We then asked to meet the families who are not sworn to secrecy, as far as I know.
That was also refused.
We asked - in a unanimous resolution - to be able to attend the trial.
Up to now that has been refused.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must recognise the immense risk run by these thirteen people and strenuously reiterate our requests to send observers to this trial and be given access to the evidence in the case. We must also make clear our intransigence on relations with Iran.
I hope we are not going to wake up, some day soon, and find that these thirteen people have been executed because they were Jewish.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wholeheartedly supports the joint resolution that will be put to the vote today.
I agree with all the previous speakers.
But I also support the massive protests that have been taking place for some time throughout the world in connection with this affair, such as today at 6 p.m. in Brussels in front of the Iranian embassy.
Today is a special day, 13 April 2000, the date of the so-called 'trial' .
In 1979, 1993, 1998 and 1999, resolutions were sent from the European Parliament to Iran, but what happened to them?
Via Amnesty International, Jewish families and organisations, we learned that, on 8 March 1999, thirteen Iranian Jews and Muslims were arrested and detained.
The youngest is sixteen years old and the oldest forty eight.
The reason: espionage.
Yet again.
Requests have been made to send letters, but to no avail.
The Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Levy, sent a letter to various ministers, including the Belgian Minister, to point out that these people are in no way guilty of spying.
They are Hebrew teachers and perform religious rituals, among other things.
Three of the thirteen have been allowed to choose a lawyer and the others have had lawyers forced upon them.
I heard today at 11.30 a.m. that the forum of Jewish organisations in Belgium says that there will not be a trial.
The Jewish communities are afraid.
What is likely to happen?
People disappear, they are locked up, but for how long? Either that or they are used for cattle trading.
It is very worrying and must be followed up.
I hope that Iran will act wisely and responsibly and not with hatred.
Mr President, we should be clear that already some 17 Jews have already been executed in Iran for charges of espionage, which basically involves no more than contacting anyone in the outside world, certainly anyone in Israel or the United States.
That seems to me an unacceptable position for any country that claims to respect human rights.
These 13 who were arrested were arrested in secret; nobody knew of their whereabouts for two or three months.
In addition, these 13 were all religious leaders or leaders of the Jewish community.
Therefore, we can only interpret this trial as a deliberate attack on the Jewish community in Iran.
We know that there will not be a free trial; it will not be open to the public and we have no idea whether these people will have representation.
Let us send our message very clearly from this Chamber.
If Iran claims to respect human rights, trials like this should never be allowed to happen.
- (EL) Mr President, we were most satisfied to see President Khatami' s forces of modernisation strengthened during the recent elections in Iran.
At the same time, however, hopes were raised that there would be an acceleration in the processes of democratisation, respect for human rights without discrimination on the grounds of gender, religion or nationality and stronger dialogue with the European Union.
Unfortunately, the case of the 13 from the Jewish community, including a sixteen-year-old boy, is yet another link in the long chain of prosecutions, usually on trumped-up charges, intolerance and discrimination against minorities living in Iran.
Greece has started using its good relations with Iran to wage a campaign and to take steps to rescue the 13.
We are using diplomatic channels to try and ensure that the death penalty is not imposed or, more to the point, is not carried out.
We feel that such an occurrence would put both relations between Israel and Iran and stability in the already sensitive Middle East to the test, which is why the European Parliament must send a strong message to Iran today, a message stressing the need to respect human rights, respect the international conventions which Iran has signed and grant a moratorium on the death penalty.
Akin Birdal
Mr President, Turkey is now standing at a crossroads.
It can choose the past, it can choose oppression and barbarity, or it can choose the future, freedom and humanitarianism.
Akin Birdal has now been imprisoned for such a statement, in spite of his ill-health.
We are faced with a country which apparently fears its own citizens so much that it is willing to violate the most basic human rights and place the unity of the state above the freedom and rights of the individual.
We must say to the Turkish Government that the policy which the country is conducting belongs to the past.
This type of behaviour does not belong to the future, where we hope that human rights will be foremost.
Such a country will never achieve the unity which it desires.
My advice to Turkey must be: choose the future and free Akin Birdal and his colleagues.
Mr President, in Helsinki, the EU countries confirmed Turkey' s status as a candidate state.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supported this proposal.
We hope that we shall one day be able to welcome Turkey into the Community.
We believe that this message gives an important signal to the Turkish people.
But - and it is an important but - before negotiations can begin, a good many changes are required in Turkey, especially with regard to human rights.
Many of us had hoped for improvements in this area.
It is therefore all the more distressing to study all the reports about atrocities which arrive on an almost daily basis.
Turkey has signed international agreements on human rights but, as has become bitterly apparent to journalists, writers, human rights activists and opposition politicians, these are not observed.
We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wish especially to express our concern about the chairman of Turkey' s Human Rights Foundation, Akin Birdal.
He had scarcely received a just trial and had been sentenced on flimsy grounds.
Following a period of freedom, he has again been imprisoned and is being denied the proper medical care he needs following the severe injuries he suffered in the attempt on his life in 1998.
He must be released immediately.
In the EU, we are proud not merely to be an economic club.
The EU is a Union founded upon values, respect for human rights, democracy and the principles of the constitutional state.
Everyone, both existing and future members, must respect these criteria.
Unfortunately, Turkey still has a long way to go.
Mr President, during the debate the day before yesterday with the Council and the Commission, I mentioned the savage reaction of certain Turkish leaders to the fear that the European Union might try to interfere in internal Turkish affairs on the Kurdish question, at the very moment when a new path to membership is opening up for Turkey.
I can only repeat here as firmly as possible what I said in Ankara on my last visit there.
The European Parliament has no intention whatsoever of allowing the micro-nationalist miasma which has just drenched the Balkans in blood to develop in Turkey.
Turkish public opinion need have no fear of our being tempted to encourage any separatist claims whatsoever.
On the other hand, the values we subscribe to include respect for human dignity the world over and the right of European citizens to keep their roots in their native soil and in the culture of their upbringing.
At any rate, that is my interpretation of minority rights.
We are not trying to tell anyone what to do, but we must constantly reaffirm that the European Union - as Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m said - is not just about creating wealth at home. There are many of us in this House who believe we must go on building Europe to promote and uphold its fundamental values, in the spirit of the founding fathers.
That is the purpose of the draft resolution we will be voting on shortly.
Mr President, two weeks ago, we met Akin Birdal in Ankara at the offices of the EU delegation.
These were his words to us then: "For five months we have had a new Turkey.
Now that the country has acquired candidate country status, we see opportunities for democracy and freedom in our country.
In addition, the internal armed conflict has ceased and our relations with Greece have improved" .
Those were Akin Birdal' s words.
Akin Birdal was free at just that particular time because of what was termed 'ill health' .
However, he would shortly be forced to return to prison if he were too healthy.
He also, of course, forfeited the right to be chairman of the Human Rights Foundation.
His so-called crime was that he had spoken about the Kurdish people on World Peace Day.
Because of this crime, and in accordance with Article 312 of the law in force, he was sentenced to one year' s imprisonment and ordered to pay fines.
Akin Birdal is a gentle and peaceful man.
He still suffers from the after-effects of the attempt upon his life in the spring of 1998.
In the course of our conversation, he said that he wanted democracy and a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question and that he saw the value of EU membership.
He also commented on how important it was to abolish 152 laws and articles which limit freedom of expression and cause so many people to be put in prison.
Mr Birdal was re-imprisoned the day after our conversation and after we had spoken with Prime Minister Ecevit about him.
What we are seeing in this case is how an undemocratic system imprisons, persecutes and oppresses democrats.
That is why, in our resolution, we are demanding that measures be taken swiftly to guarantee freedom of expression, reform the judicial system and release all political prisoners.
Mr President, the previous speaker made it easy for me because he spoke in detail about Akin Birdal who was the leader of the human rights organisation in Turkey and who is mainly known for calling for a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question.
In 1998, he survived an assassination attempt by right-wing extremists, but since then his health has greatly deteriorated.
He is now in prison again, at the very time that a number of our MEPs visited Ankara.
From Mr SchÃ¶rling' s statement, it appears very clear that this is in no way coincidental.
It is real provocation.
Through this kind of action Turkey alienates itself from Europe.
The gulf becomes deeper instead of the other way round.
If Turkey wishes to heed our call, then it can only respond by releasing Mr Birdal because this is out-and-out provocation.
This is not the only instance of human rights violations that concern us.
I understand that a press bureau in Amsterdam has been ransacked and that this was formally sanctioned by the Belgian judiciary.
In the meantime we also know from incidents in Belgium who is really behind this.
Human rights are unambiguous, human rights are the same everywhere and Turkey must also be aware of that, otherwise it will never become a Member of the European Union.
Mr President, once again we protest and call upon the Turkish Government to release a prisoner who is guilty of the desire to live in a country where democracy, rights and freedom are truly respected.
Akin Birdal is not a Kurd.
He is a Turk, a man of peace, condemned for speaking out about the Kurdish issue and calling for an end to this dirty war.
His imprisonment is the product of an illiberal legal system, the abolition of which Turkish democrats are fighting for, a legal system which has made hundreds and hundreds of citizens suffer.
No one who has met him could forget his smile and gentle nature.
And yet he has had to endure great suffering.
This is not the first time he has been arrested and an armed attack has been made on his life; he escaped with his life, but he was unable to leave the country and was rearrested.
Leyla Azan is still in prison, and so are thousands of Kurds.
When will this end?
There is no justification for the behaviour of the Turkish Government.
The KWP has stopped fighting and its leader, Mr ÃÃ§alan, is calling from jail for peace, reconciliation and recognition of the cultural identity of his people.
The European Union has accepted Turkey' s candidacy and now the Turkish Government must respect our agreements and conventions.
We must explore every possible avenue, save military interventions and embargoes, starting with a refusal to sell Turkey any more arms, so that, at last, democracy and freedom can be established in Turkey.
Tibet
Mr President, from all accounts, the human rights situation in China has deteriorated considerably.
This is especially true of Tibet, where, for the time being, the Dalai Lama' s reasonable five point plan has no chance of finding its way onto the agenda.
The European Union cannot continue to turn a blind eye.
The United States presented a resolution on the violation of human rights in China at the fifty-sixth session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
We are extremely concerned by the fact that the Council of the Union has also not yet announced its intention to support this resolution, and this may not be coincidental, since the EU-China dialogue on human rights is at a complete standstill.
We call for an end to this policy of turning a blind eye to events in China, and for the European Union to join the American initiative without worrying about losing choice economic opportunities, and to cease this silent and tolerant stance towards the continuous violations of human rights in China, and, in particular, Tibet.
Europe is laboriously and extremely inconsistently shaking off her lethargic attitude to the horrors taking place in Chechnya.
I sincerely hope that she will follow the example of the United States and, at last, wake up to the human rights situation in China.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago an interparliamentary conference on the human rights situation in China was held at the European Parliament in Brussels.
We Members of the European Parliament agreed, together with the Foreign Minister of the Tibetan government in exile, the US government official responsible for Tibet and members of national parliaments, that it is time we put an end to shady compromises with China for the sake of maintaining purely economic relations.
The Chinese are still refusing to enter into a constructive dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and political repression is on the increase.
People are being mercilessly persecuted, and religious freedom and freedom of speech are being curbed.
Tibet' s culture and identity are being systematically obliterated.
These continual violations of the most fundamental human rights must now become an issue.
The United States needs the support of the European Union at the 56th UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
The European Union must use its inherent authority to work for human dignity and minority rights.
If it takes the first step, other countries, including the candidate countries, will certainly follow suit.
My own group, the Group of the European People's Party, is firmly convinced of this.
Commissioner Lamy, Europe needs to stick its head above the parapet.
The Commission and the Council belong at the head of a movement fully supporting the Dalai Lama' s five-point peace plan.
Point one: Tibet must become a peace zone.
Point two: China must finally renounce its policy of expulsion.
Point three: democratic civil rights must be guaranteed for all minorities.
Point four: Tibet' s culture and environment must be protected.
Point five: genuine negotiations must take place on Tibet' s future autonomous status.
Commissioner, all our economic agreements with third countries need to be based on the same premise: respect for human rights.
You demonstrated in Seattle, Commissioner Lamy, and I was there to see for myself, that you know how to build bridges.
How did a Tibetan delegate put it?
"We will survive because of your moral support, but above all because of your solidarity" !
Tashi delek!
Mr President, as you are calling on each Member in his own language, perhaps you could address me in Bavarian!
Eight years ago I was rapporteur on Tibet.
In 1992, I presented a motion for a resolution that was unanimously adopted by the European Parliament.
It is with some dismay that I have realised today that eight years later the same motion for a resolution could be presented on the same grounds, lamenting the same poor, nay appalling, conditions in Tibet.
The Tibetans' human rights are being trampled upon and their cultural and spiritual heritage is being threatened with complete extinction, especially in Tibet itself.
Nature and the environment are being polluted and damaged to an extent never seen before.
Millions of Tibetans have no human rights, let alone civil rights. Above all, they have no right of assembly, no freedom of association, and no right to freely practise their religion.
For this reason we are calling on the Chinese Government as a matter of the greatest urgency to seek a political solution for Tibet through discussions with Tibet' s political and religious leaders, on the basis of the proposal made by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.
Mr Mann has made it unnecessary for me to reiterate this.
But I would like to stress this point: if a people is prepared to fight for its autonomous status without questioning borders and without separatist tendencies, then we should really be supporting them, as they are setting an example for our own European Union model!
Mr Sakellariou, unfortunately, the seriousness of this subject prevents me from responding to your introductory comment with some Bavarian humour. This subject is so serious that I think it would be out of place.
A great many people are involved here.
Mr President, today we are discussing Tibet, but we have also discussed Chechnya, Kurdistan and Taiwan, and we will continue to do so.
In my opinion, the reason for this is that when we talk of human rights, we always focus on individual rights and too often disregard the rights of peoples.
The fundamental right of self-determination is all too often ignored, possibly for reasons of political convenience.
It may be easier to act in defence of a person who has been wrongfully imprisoned, tortured or denied freedom of speech than in defence of an entire people.
But this is the crux of the matter: until the right of self-determination is declared and applied everywhere, we will continue to witness such situations and we will continue to debate and adopt resolutions, but, as Mr Sakellariou said, sadly, nothing will change.
We must change our perspective completely and progress from the protection of individuals to the protection of peoples, for it is not fair for the inhabitants of East Timor alone to be able to exercise this right: all peoples must have the facility to exercise this right if they so desire, from the Sahara to Chechnya, from Taiwan to Kurdistan, and, of course, in Tibet.
I am sure a large majority of the House agrees with you.
Death penalty in the United States
Mr President, as I am sure you are aware, at the moment there is much talk of the reform of the urgent debates, and there are certain influential members of the larger groups who see these debates as unnecessary and consider our resolutions to be somewhat superfluous.
And yet I would argue that no topic more than the death penalty in the United States has proved that this type of humble debate can, over time, play a major role.
Things are changing in the United States.
I would not presume for a moment to think that this is entirely due to the European Parliament, but I feel that it is partly the result of the attention constantly paid to the matter by our institution.
I do not see the motion for a resolution that we are about to vote on as simply yet another resolution, but as further proof that things can change.
Moreover, I believe that the three elements which are highlighted as positive in this resolution - the stances adopted by Janet Reno, the governor of Illinois and the U.S. Justice Department - should be brought to the attention of the Americans.
From this point of view, I feel we can congratulate ourselves.
Mr President, you could say that there is something of a feeling of helplessness in standing here yet again and talking about the death penalty in the USA, since it is certainly not the first time we have discussed it, not even the first time during my short period in Parliament.
Most recently, we discussed the Mumia Jamal case, and now it is the Juan Raul Garza case, among others.
However, these men are just examples as there have been so many that you could say that the USA, in its legal policy, is almost waging war against its most destitute and most marginalised people.
In this way the USA has brought itself into line with China, Congo and Iraq.
You may well feel that it is strange to sit in a near half-empty chamber, apart from the visitors, and discuss such an important subject, but I think it is a subject which we must continue to take up, and I would ask the Member States to also respond to it here, to respond swiftly and in no uncertain terms to this so-called friendly state which repeatedly violates the most basic human rights.
Mr President, the European Parliament has, on various occasions, approved texts which state that the death penalty is an assault on human dignity, on human rights and it is a great pity that we have to establish once again that the death penalty still exists among our American friends and that, regrettably, the number of executions is increasing - there have been 350 since 1990.
What I find particularly distressing is the fact that young people as well, people under 18, can also be sentenced to death, and even the mentally handicapped can be sentenced to death.
Those are particularly depressing aspects of the text now before us.
Every execution is an irreversible act and that makes it so extraordinary.
In the case we are discussing here it was not life imprisonment that was imposed, but the death penalty, and that is on the basis of facts that were not proven beyond any doubt.
For that reason even the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked for time to re-examine the case and to be able to issue an opinion, and it also asked that no date be set for an execution.
We must urge the Americans to act not only in this specific case, but to ensure that the death penalty is abolished in their country.
Together with a few other countries where democracy is a long way off, they are the only ones where the number of death sentences is rising.
This is by no means an enviable record.
Our Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has repeatedly argued in favour of the abolition of the death penalty, not only in this specific case, but in general.
More specifically, I would ask our American friends to abolish it once and for all.
Mr President, we should be clear as to why this resolution today is so important.
Firstly, we all know that there is a wave of judicial executions across the USA - over 600 since 1977 - but this would be the first federal execution since 1963.
Secondly, it is important because this is the only case since executions resumed in 1977 in which the evidence of unsolved, unadjudicated crime in a foreign country has been used to secure the death sentence.
Juan Garza's death sentence came as a result of murders in Mexico, which he was never charged with.
Thirdly, there are 21 prisoners currently in federal death row: 14 are black, 5 are white, one is Asian and one is Latino.
We know that in state trials black defendants are four times more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants.
Fourthly, Governor Ryan of Illinois, as we have heard already, has imposed a moratorium on the death sentence in his state because of its appalling record of wrongful convictions.
When we bring all those factors together we see that the death penalty in the US is an arbitrary process and is fundamentally a racist process.
That is why we constantly demand that the death sentence should not be carried out in the US.
In this case it is particularly important because it is a federal execution and will be the first since 1963.
That is why we urge President Clinton to grant clemency in this case and a moratorium on federal executions.
There is a presidential campaign under way.
In a presidential campaign executions, regrettably, become a political football in the US.
President Clinton has the opportunity - he is not standing for re-election - to make a stand on this issue today.
Mr President, I join with previous speakers in demanding the immediate and unconditional abolition of the death penalty in the United States, and everywhere else in the world.
The death penalty is a political arm used by the American Government apparatus to settle accounts with militants like Mumia Abu Jamal.
Like the whole prison system, it is also an instrument of social discrimination because Afro-Americans, ethnic minorities, and more generally the poor, are far more at risk than others of being condemned to death.
It is also a penalty whose irreversible character makes any reparation impossible if a mistake is made - and mistakes are often made.
A government which makes legal assassination one of the pillars of its justice system is infinitely more criminal than those it claims it is protecting society from.
The death penalty expresses all the barbarity of a society organised in a way that also condemns so many children and adolescents, even in the richest country in the world, to die from drug use or insecurity, actually from material and moral poverty, simply because they had the misfortune to be born in a poor area.
On a planetary scale, that barbarity condemns millions of human beings to die of hunger or disease when they could easily be cured - but they are not cured because they do not get the medicine they need.
In rising up against the death penalty we also rise up against all that barbarity, against the barbarity linked to permanently organising society so that all the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a minority and the great mass of humanity is condemned to poverty.
- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the death penalty was abolished in Portugal over a century ago.
So for the Portuguese, being opposed to the death penalty is inherent in our culture.
I would like to remind you of another reference: the US Declaration of Independence, an inspirational text which defines the three rights on which the United States war of independence was based: "the right to life, to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness" .
Some two hundred years on, the right to life has still not been fully recognised in the US legal system and this deserves a strong reaction on our part.
Mr President, my Group firmly supports this resolution.
We owe a debt of gratitude to the USA for defeating two totalitarian regimes, for defeating national socialism and communism, and for establishing democracy and the rule of law throughout our continent. Nevertheless, the existence of the death penalty in the USA means that they could not join either the Council of Europe or the European Union.
That means that we should tell even such an important partner as this one, in no uncertain terms, that they should finally abolish the death penalty at individual state level and all the more so at federal level.
The American election campaign could provide a unique opportunity to send a strong message about this.
Sad to say, just the opposite has happened, and the candidates are vying with each other in a populist way on this issue.
However, we believe that the Atlantic Alliance is founded on democracy and the rule of law, so that the right to life should form the centrepiece of the legal system in both the USA and in Europe.
That is why we want to state unequivocally in our Charter of Fundamental Rights that we support the right to life and that we are opposed to a culture of death as typified by the death penalty.
Zimbabwe
Mr President, this short debate takes place against a background of increasing tension in Zimbabwe.
All of us who speak should remember that every word of our speeches and the resolution will be eagerly read in Zimbabwe within the next 48 hours by all sides.
We must, therefore, all encourage Zimbabwe to move towards elections in May.
The old parliament was dissolved on 11 April and President Mugabe pledged at the EU-Africa Summit in Cairo that the elections would go ahead.
It is therefore worrying that constituency boundaries have yet to be set.
This could take up to three months.
I hope that, when the elections are called, observers from Europe will be invited to Zimbabwe to monitor the proceedings.
This would show real transparency.
It is not for Europe to meddle in the internal affairs of any nation.
African countries must work together to consolidate their future.
However, the old LomÃ© Convention made democracy, human rights and the rule of law a requirement for development aid.
The new Partnership Agreement goes further and asks for good governance.
All we ask is that disputes of any kind be settled through courts and not in open conflict.
I particularly highlight land issues.
Zimbabwe has much to gain from the Partnership Agreement and urgently needs aid and debt relief.
Much of this could go to rural areas for agreed land resettlement.
It is disappointing that Zimbabwe feels the need to be involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo at a time when precious resources could be spent on domestic requirements, such as education and health.
We all look forward to the rule of law being strengthened and a democratisation process fully operating under an independent judiciary to allow civil society to express its wishes through a fair and open press.
The Zimbabwean people must be given a chance to choose their future.
Mr President, in the last few decades Southern Africa has formed the subject of much attention in this House.
We have fortunately been able to witness a democratic regime that seems to function well coming to power in South Africa.
At the moment we are receiving very alarming reports from Zimbabwe.
There are clear signs that democracy in that country could be in jeopardy.
The court rulings were ignored.
I sincerely hope that the ruling that was taken about an hour ago, that the police must act against those occupying the farms, will not be ignored this time, as was unfortunately the case with other court rulings.
What is more serious is the fact that innocent people are being beaten for no apparent reason.
The only possible reason for this is that they oppose the government of President Mugabe.
All this, Mr President, is a recipe for anarchy and a threat to democracy that could endanger the entire region.
We therefore believe that elections must be held as quickly as possible, preferably under the supervision of international observers so that everyone can be satisfied that they are held as fairly as possible.
Land reform is necessary.
There are many landless farmers and unemployed people in Zimbabwe.
It must, however, take place lawfully.
Above all, it should not occur along racial lines and it must certainly not be the case that holders of political office of whatever party be given priority in the distribution of land.
Finally I should like to say something about the war that is currently raging in a certain part of Africa.
I agree with Mr Corrie that the money for this war could be better spent on development in Zimbabwe, on education, training and health care.
One can think of a whole range of things.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my confidence in the people of Zimbabwe.
These people have, over the last few years, shown that they deserve our confidence.
Zimbabwe is a country which, since independence in 1980, has steadily chosen the path of peaceful development under the leadership of President Mugabe. Not only in the economic sphere, but also politically, with a degree of press freedom in which the leadership of the country has also not been spared from criticism.
As one of the leading SADEC countries it was at the forefront of the battle against apartheid in South Africa.
It would be particularly sad if this country of all countries became the victim of war, racism and civil strife.
Zimbabwe does, of course, still have considerable problems, but the European countries and the Union will continue to assume their responsibilities as partners of Zimbabwe in jointly tackling the problems of poverty, ill health and under-development.
These problems will not be resolved by letting the Zimbabwean army fight in the Congo.
The country cannot afford such a drain on its resources, as is evident from the economic situation.
Neither will the occupation of the land of white farmers resolve the problems.
Land reforms can be introduced through legal channels by a lawful government, and a lawful government comes to power after normal elections.
These have been announced for June at the very latest.
I hope that nobody will use the current problems as a pretext - by exaggerating and increasing these problems, for example - to postpone the elections and heavily influence the spontaneous development of this movement.
In my view, Zimbabwe deserves our confidence.
The population has chosen the path of development.
I hope that nothing whatsoever is done to put an abrupt end to this.
With this in mind, we support the resolution.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to agree with the comments made by my fellow MEPs.
I believe that we have a reasonable common position.
Land reform is one of the most important issues throughout southern Africa, so it is therefore not surprising to see that it is again being exploited by Mugabe to his advantage, just prior to the elections, exactly as he has done in previous elections.
After all, this issue is so important for so many black and poor people.
The elections are therefore necessary.
The rule of law is necessary.
You need to have faith in the people and in the law for the system to function properly.
I support what other speakers have said about the SADAC countries who will no doubt be looking upon this situation with great concern and who are undoubtedly working behind the scenes to maintain a democratic climate.
It is also true that they are continually pressing for the withdrawal of troops from the Congo.
Could the Commission and the Council help us, as the European Parliament, to remain involved as observers at these elections, because if things go wrong in Zimbabwe, there will be more trouble in the region.
After South Africa and the democratic government there and the sound developments that have taken place in the region, we very much need to see the positive side.
Let us express our complete confidence in the Zimbabwean people and wish them successful elections for 1 June.
Mr President, it is five to midnight in Zimbabwe.
Everything points to the country sitting on a volcano that could erupt at any minute.
In the run up to the elections, Mugabe will not hesitate to use violence against his political opponents.
At the beginning of this month, peaceful demonstrators were attacked by his followers while the police looked on.
What is more serious is the fact that the demonstrators were arrested and the attackers left alone.
Similarly, Mugabe will not recoil from provoking anarchy and racial hatred by encouraging the illegal occupation of white farms.
Whites are being systematically intimidated and driven from their land through violent means to punish them for their support for the opposition and to buy the votes of the landless farmers.
The government systematically disregards the rulings of the Supreme Court.
In fact, the public prosecutor warned that any attempt to remove the occupiers could lead to civil war.
It is clear that Mugabe, who has become unpopular through his mismanagement of the economy and his exploits in the Congo, intends to do everything necessary to stay in power.
Some people even fear that he is inciting the chaos in order to be able to proclaim a state of emergency and postpone the elections.
At long last, the European Union has this week threatened to suspend aid if the President does not keep his promise of free and fair elections.
But it is already clear that the elections have been rigged.
A quarter of the names on the electoral lists are fictitious or duplicates.
The President is still not allowing any foreign observers in.
What else has to happen before structural aid is suspended?
I would urge the Council and the Commission not to wait until it is five past midnight.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is a shame that this resolution was not adopted at the March part-session, just as I think it is a shame that the recent EU-Africa Summit did not tackle this subject head on.
These are subjects which should be at the forefront of political action by the European Union.
We cannot hide the seriousness of what has been going on in Zimbabwe for many weeks now.
The fact is that Hitler is on the loose again - Hitler is out and about again there.
It should not go unnoticed that the leader of the band that is encouraging these arbitrary acts in Zimbabwe chose the name Hitler as his own name.
He is a gentleman by the name of Chenjerai 'Hitler' Hunzvi.
We know that the instigator is the President of Zimbabwe himself, but the leader of the movement took this name, a name that we know all too well from the horrors of our own history.
This is what is happening in Zimbabwe.
That is why we have to take more vigorous action.
The chaos, the threats and the intimidation taking place in that country are unacceptable and it is also unacceptable that this is being encouraged by the person holding the highest office of state, the President of Zimbabwe himself.
Mr President, I will comment on the various issues that have been dealt with during the debate, starting with Iran.
The concern expressed in Parliament' s motions for resolutions on human rights in Iran is entirely shared by the Commission.
Like you, we are particularly worried about the fate of the thirteen Jewish and eight Moslem Iranians detained under this strange charge of espionage.
A number of approaches were made last year by the Union and by various Member States.
Consultations at Union level are continuing, along the lines of the motions for resolutions, in order to establish the most likely ways of guaranteeing the fair and just trial we all hope to see.
Further approaches and the possible presence of observers at the trial could, in our view, be part of that perspective.
So we share the attitude expressed in the debate by those of you who said that, given the progress observed in Iran since the recent parliamentary election, we should, as far as humanly possible, avoid giving the impression of foreign interference which could be counterproductive and which might reverse the improvement we believe we are seeing in the internal and external political climate.
On the subject of Akin Birdal, again we fully share the concerns that have been expressed during the debate and in the resolution on the return to prison of Akin Birdal, ostensibly to complete his sentence.
We entirely support the declaration of 30 March by the Union Presidency, inviting the Turkish Government to take steps to secure the release of this activist.
As you mentioned during the debate, the Helsinki European Council confirmed Turkey' s status as a candidate country on the basis of the same criteria that apply to the other candidate countries.
So it is important for Turkey to engage resolutely in the democratisation process and adopt the necessary reforms in terms of human rights.
Revision, or even repeal, of Article 312 of the criminal code, which was referred to earlier and which is the basis on which Mr Birdal was found guilty of, and I quote, "incitement to hatred" , seems absolutely essential in this respect.
In the context of the regular report it has been producing since 1998 for Turkey, like the other candidate countries, the Commission is following the human rights situation very closely.
In our last report, published in October 1999, we were already expressing our concern about the provisional nature of Mr Birdal' s release, with good reason, unfortunately.
So we will continue to follow up the matter, in the context of the detailed examination we carry out every year.
As you know, we are currently working on a membership partenariat with Turkey, within the framework of the pre-accession strategy.
This document, which establishes the list of priorities to be met by Turkey in preparation for membership, should be adopted by the Commission next November.
By the end of the year, Turkey will need to adopt a national programme reflecting its own priorities for the partenariat and listing the resources put in place to achieve them.
So we have some important deadlines coming up and, in the Commission' s view, questions relating to the democratisation process, in particular freedom of expression, will have an important place in the examination of this partenariat.
As regards human rights in Tibet, we also share your concern.
Like you we are worried about the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the autonomous region of Tibet, which the Chinese authorities clearly do not respect.
As we have done, with you, many times before, we call on China to re-enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama.
We regard the renewal of this dialogue as the only realistic method of achieving a peaceful and durable solution to the Tibetan question.
To respond to Mr Mann, the Union has raised these matters many times in the context of the specific bilateral dialogue it is holding with China on human rights.
The situation in Tibet was also one of the main items on the agenda at the last summit between the Union and China, held in Beijing last December.
We will doggedly continue to raise the case of Tibet with the Chinese authorities.
On the death penalty in the United States, like many of you, the Commission is concerned about the growing number of people condemned to death and executed in the United States since the reintroduction of the death penalty in 1976.
In 1998, opposition to the death penalty became one of the most high profile factors in the whole of Union policy on human rights.
