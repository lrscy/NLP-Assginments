The principle of gender mainstreaming is enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty, which requires a gender equality perspective not only to be applied to measures designed specifically to promote equal opportunities, but also to be incorporated into all policies at all levels of the budgetary process by means of gender budgeting.
Since 2003, when this House adopted a resolution on gender budgeting - that is, building public budgets from a gender perspective - the fact that public budgets, including the EU budget, are not gender-neutral and have a different impact on women and men has been taken into account.
A gender budgeting approach should be used to assess and restructure all pertinent budget programmes, measures and policies, as well as to determine to what extent resources are allocated in gender-equal or -unequal ways and ultimately achieve gender neutrality, where equal consideration is given regardless of gender.
When the Finnish Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Tuula Haatainen, addressed our committee in early October, she highlighted the mainstreaming of equality policies in budgetary planning and evoked the Finnish example of seeking to ensure that all items, not only in the national, but also in the EU budget, take gender equality policies into account.
I certainly hope that the Finnish Presidency will succeed in this respect.
draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. - (HU) I wish to speak on behalf of the Committee on Petitions about the budget for the European Ombudsman.
We often speak of bringing Europe closer to its citizens, of helping the citizens to gain a better understanding of what the European Union really is.
The office of the European Ombudsman is a small institution, one that does a considerable amount of work in this area.
It is therefore very important for the Ombudsman to have sufficient budgetary resources available to be able to perform his duties successfully and effectively.
In April of this year, we spoke very positively about the European Ombudsman during the discharge process.
I would like to remind everyone that we spoke of this office as a model (for other institutions, with clearly defined competencies) and a well-administered budget.
The European Ombudsman is sparing with translation charges and does not wish to add new items, and it is precisely for this reason that, on behalf of my committee, I request that, because we have to take account of the forthcoming enlargement, we support a moderate increase in the budget requested by the European Ombudsman, while emphasising the need for budgetary discipline and for citizens to be provided high levels of services.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Grech, the rapporteur for Parliament's budget.
It was a pleasure to work with him and to reach joint compromises in my role as shadow rapporteur.
I congratulate him on the excellent end result that we achieved.
Above all, we have to remember the principles upon which the budget is drawn up.
Firstly, we have to be precise about how we intend to spend taxpayers' money.
Another principle is that we spend money on what is necessary.
We should not be doing all sorts of nice and interesting things, but what is really necessary.
The 20% increase principle is hopelessly outdated.
It sometimes leads to madness, such as the proposal for Internet television.
The idea behind Internet television is for Parliament to have its own TV channel.
The money for that cannot really be justified to taxpayers.
As an example, I might mention the speech given in Brussels by Finland's second Minister of Finance at the beginning of the Finnish presidential term.
The speech was broadcast via Internet TV to everyone in Europe, but in the whole of Europe there were just 14 interested viewers, half of whom were the Minister's own advisers.
If we are to make an investment of tens of millions for just a handful of people, the money is certainly going to be in the wrong place.
It would be more cost-effective to spend the money, for example, on bringing journalists from small local and regional newspapers here, after which they would write articles on Parliament and what happens here.
People read these sorts of newspapers carefully, but they will not really follow these Internet TV broadcasts.
We need all budget headings to be closely evaluated and monitored, and this applies especially to building policy.
I am happy that we have found a common view, because the building in Strasbourg became a scandal, and we no longer need publicity like that.
We therefore need to be a lot more careful about how we spend money.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mrs Wideroos, Mrs GrybauskaitÄ, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank our two rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, who, through the work they have done and the tenacity they have shown, have been able to give direction to our work on this first reading of the budget.
This budget, the first of the 2007-2013 programme, is a very modest one, representing only 1.04% of GDP.
Not only is it very modest, but it is probably not up to the challenges facing the European Union: the energy crisis, the crisis of confidence, world conflicts and the increase in poverty and job insecurity, all coming at a time when Europeans are expressing ever more expectations of the European Union.
The restricted framework forces very modest ambitions on us.
Quality, and not just quantity, characterises the approach to this 2007 budget, therefore.
The budget has also compelled us to adopt a hybrid strategy.
Indeed, not only are our legal bases for the new policies not ready, but we are not ready, either, to champion and implement all the policies wished for by Europeans.
We want to be ambitious, as people expect us to be, but we must also be realistic, as we do not know whether we shall be able to implement these policies.
For the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the minimum consisted in reinstating the preliminary draft budget for all the policies to which we are attached and, in particular, for the Lisbon objectives and the Gothenburg policies, not forgetting employment, solidarity, the environment and rural development.
2007 should be the year in which our communication policy is overhauled, given that Europeans have been very much forgotten up until now.
Where external policy is concerned, I would also appeal for us to adopt a balanced approach to administration, particularly where the EU's borders are concerned, as we cannot be satisfied with a unilateral approach that concentrates on law and order.
I should like, if I may, to emphasise two important points: first of all, the role to be played under the heading of the EU budget by cofinancing involving the European Investment Bank, and this with a view to relaunching the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; and, secondly, the role of pilot projects and preparatory actions, which have always favoured the birth of new ideas and which should be implemented.
In reality, I am mostly concerned about the implementation of this budget.
Our rapporteur has opted for spending with a qualitative focus. This amounts to championing the way in which our priorities have traditionally been financed, but it also constitutes an appeal to the Commission to respect fully the political choices made by Parliament.
If, moreover, Parliament can make criticisms of the way in which policies are administered by the other institutions, it is because such criticism is authorised by the Treaty, the institutional agreements and actual practice.
Parliament is one of the branches of the budgetary authority, and we do not wish to be dispossessed of our power as a result of abandoning all authority regarding the way in which our votes are brought into play.
Is it fair, however, for us, in the name of that power, to make it more difficult for these same institutions to exercise their prerogatives?
No.
It would be dangerous, and even counter-productive, to try to intervene too much in administrative practice.
I would also say to the Council that the Commission could not do better if, at the same time, we were to agree to freeze recruitment by that institution.
However, we have little room for manoeuvre if - as we have cause to fear, given the latest line proposed - all our priorities are adjusted in accordance with the European Commission's shortcomings in implementing policy.
Finally, and in conclusion, I wanted to tell you, Mr President, that the Council must remember that it cannot impose its point of view, because we need together to comply with the priorities of the European political project and because, if we reduce the budget by too much, we shall no longer be able to develop any of these policies of which Europeans expect so much.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, the budget we are presenting today is a responsible and sensible budget.
We have not accepted the Council's indiscriminate cuts to administrative expenditure but we have, on the other hand, put EUR 50 million from the Commission's administrative budget into the reserves and demanded a clearer explanation of trends in certain areas of expenditure.
We must not close our eyes to the facts when we establish the budget, but go into details and ensure that precisely those resources that are necessary are available.
In that connection, I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mr Elles, for the approach he has chosen to adopt in this year's work on the budget.
I am thinking of the idea of 'value for money', following on from criticism by the Court of Auditors and in cost-benefit studies and other reports.
In particular, I would draw attention to the cost-benefit studies as a constructive innovation, offering us a far better survey of, for example, trends in the Commission's information and communication policy and the development of the common foreign and security policy.
Specifically on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would emphasise the need for adequate resources for the legal and asylum policy and for the foreign policy.
There is a sharp contrast between the fine words uttered by EU Heads of Government in formal speeches and the resources that their finance ministers are prepared to make available.
At the same time as Heads of Government emphasise that the EU should present a united front in refugee policy and strengthen the common border management agency, FRONTEX, finance ministers make a point of cutting back on appropriations to the agency.
Clearly, this is inconsistent.
I am pleased, moreover, that we have had to reach agreement to sort these matters out.
In connection with the financial perspective, it is quite clear that the EU's foreign policy was badly handled.
That the budget we are presenting today is clearly a responsible one is shown, however, by the fact that Parliament has not tried to challenge the interinstitutional agreement.
We have established a budget within the framework of the agreement.
Foreign policy is an area that will demand close attention over the next few years, however.
I think that, especially in regard to our close neighbours in Central and Eastern Europe, we in the EU have an obligation to promote stronger economic development and to encourage a view of democratic development as something hopeful and positive.
The money needs to be used well, and we therefore ask that the Commission ensure that the new programmes take account of the Court of Auditors' criticism of the aid to Russia.
With regard to Parliament's and other institutions' budget, my group has adopted the approach of our rapporteur, Mr Grech, whom I should also like to thank for a constructive and substantial piece of work.
It means that the budget is somewhat below the level originally announced by the institutions but, after thorough analysis of each individual institution, a position has been adopted on what is in reality needed and a suitable margin thus created.
We have had a number of debates about whether Parliament needs 20% of the total administrative expenditure, and we have ended up with a figure that is rather on the small side.
My group supports the policy of recent years to the effect that Parliament should purchase the buildings it uses, but we must ensure that we have a clearer overall view of what resources are needed for buildings over the next few years.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House's budget debates may well not be renowned for being sexy, but they are very important, for we, in the 2007 budget as in all the others, are setting out the priorities for our work over the coming year.
You will be aware that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not vote to approve the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective on the grounds that we see this financial plan as resolving too few problems.
We take the same view of the 2007 budget, and ask ourselves whether it will enable us to do those things that have to be done.
For example, we do not agree with our agricultural policy or with the excessive subsidies paid out for agricultural exports.
Our deep-frozen chickens sell in African markets for half the price of those that the Africans produce themselves, and then we end up complaining about how we get too many refugees from Africa, when it is we ourselves, with our own agricultural policy, who are helping to create the problem.
There is also fisheries policy, where our fishing quotas are still too high, and we are endangering our fish stocks.
This is another policy that the European Union should change.
Not to mention our policy on tobacco, for we are still subsidising tobacco growers while at the same time banning tobacco advertisements.
That, too, strikes me as inconsistent and not a smart policy for Europe to adopt.
Now that many European countries have the globalisation blues - remember the referendum in France? - our globalisation policy ought to be a more just one, with us speaking out more emphatically in favour of fair trade and getting more serious about our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, in which respect we are lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to funding the war on poverty.
Europe, though, must also do more towards a forward-looking energy policy; we need to invest more in research into renewable energies that would make us less dependent on Mr Putin and enable us to be more forthright in our criticisms of his autocratic regime.
What do we have to do instead?
We have to invest more in education, research, culture, the media and in the cultural industry, which is an important pillar of the Lisbon Strategy, and that would enable us to make that strategy more precise and more forward-looking.
What we in Europe need is to be more of one mind where policy is concerned; that is the only way in which we will develop a responsible common foreign policy that is pro-active, that spreads civilisation, that reinforces civil society through the neighbourhood policy, but also intervenes when absolutely necessary.
If that is what we want, we are not spending enough money.
Much as I would love to see us take 'value for money' as our yardstick, we also have to work on the basis of 'good money for Europe'.
If each of our Member States is spending only one per cent of its gross national income on Europe, then not enough money is being made available for European policies that are both important and the right ones to pursue.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I was going to say Madam Minister, but I will not. The reading contains a kind of virtual version of the EU budget.
After the Council's reading, the level of payment appropriations was 1% of the Member States' combined GNP.
Parliament in its first reading is raising this to 1.04%. This is being done by increasing appropriations for the draft budget, which could be called virtual because Parliament has not been in the habit of holding on to its increases right to the last.
The Council has regularly been the winner in negotiations.
Parliament's credibility will suffer if that happens again.
Our group demands that Parliament keep to its priorities.
The rapporteur, James Elles, has been innovative in looking for appropriations where the Commission has not implemented the budgetary requirements of previous years.
We support his approach, where some funds are set aside in reserves and only released after the proper statements have been produced.
Our group supports the right of the new Member States to seek staff positions in the Commission for their own citizens.
Consequently, we cannot support the cuts in Commission personnel as proposed by the Council.
Public authorities, including the European Union, may act as catalysts in various economic processes.
On the other hand, the same money may also be spent on administrative projects led by Eurocrats, which in fact erode people's confidence in the Union.
An example has been the PRINCE programme.
Another will be the 3DGENOME project, plan D. There is a danger that Parliament's own Internet television channel will be another.
Our group does not support the use of Commission and Parliament appropriations to produce Euro-propaganda, and we do not want the militarisation of the EU using money for the common foreign and security policy.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to begin by congratulating both rapporteurs and thanking them for all their work.
This year, we are faced with a rather curious situation.
The meagre Commission budget was cut only slightly by the Council, whereas Parliament's Committee on Budgets is proposing an increase in spending and financial commitments above the limits proposed by the Commission.
This stance is obviously worth supporting, as the Union cannot rise to the challenges it faces without a larger budget.
I refer to the forthcoming enlargement and increasing competition at world level.
We can but hope that a suitable compromise will be reached in November and that the European budget will be closer to Parliament's proposal than to the Council's.
Given that the Council wishes to cut expenditure, as it is wont to do, it was entirely appropriate for Mr Elles to suggest a value for money approach.
This method involves working more efficiently to attain our aims.
Bearing in mind that the 2007 budget is the first budget within the new financial framework, it is to be hoped that it will augur well for subsequent years.
I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to reiterate my appeal to all those who care about human rights to support the amendments tabled by the UEN, in which we call for an end to Union financial support for programmes promoting compulsory abortion in third countries.
Allow me to stress that the issue at stake here is compulsory abortion, not abortion as such.
Rejection of these amendments will amount to supporting practices that infringe fundamental human rights. It will reveal the hypocrisy of all those who constantly advocate human rights whilst simultaneously trampling all over them.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, I must begin by thanking the rapporteurs.
Nonetheless, the 2007 budget is a bad one.
Most Members are aware of this, but only a small minority venture to say so openly.
It is a bad budget because it fails to deal with, or even to tackle, any of the European Union's major problems.
These include the sluggish economy and the increasing differences between the levels of development in the countries of the old and the new Union.
The 2007 budget is also bad because it does not respond to the new challenges facing society and the economies of the Member States. There is the destabilisation of the market for raw materials, and in particular the steep increase in the price of sources of energy.
There is also the important issue of economic migration from the new Member States to the countries of the old Union and the consequent rapidly rising social and economic costs in the poor countries.
If the amendments tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group had been adopted, the 2007 budget could have served to introduce a new approach to funding for the agricultural sector.
In view of the strong resistance to these amendments expressed at meetings of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets, we expect them to be rejected by Parliament.
This is a testament to the power of agribusiness and the large landowners. It also reveals where Parliament's true allegiance lies, as the House is quite prepared to defend the interests of a rich minority against the large majority of farmers who are poor.
It should be pointed out that the resources saved could be devoted to supporting entrepreneurship, research and development and investment in infrastructure.
The 2007 budget increases expenditure on administration, and provides for the creation of new offices and agencies.
We are strongly opposed to all that.
In conclusion, the IND/DEM Group will vote against the 2007 budget and we trust that other Members of the House will do likewise.
- (SK) On the liabilities side, the draft budget of the European Union submitted by the European Council is fully consistent with the ratio parameters of the approved long-term financial perspective for 2007 - 2013.
Appropriations for competitiveness and cohesion have increased significantly in the area of growth and employment as well as in the area of freedom, security, justice, civil society and the status of the European Union as a global partner.
In compliance with the financial perspective, the share of spending on direct payments in agriculture has decreased; by contrast, the share of spending on rural development has grown.
Unfortunately, as a result of the Council's efforts to significantly reduce the overall volume of funding, the positive trend in respect of payments has to a large extent dwindled away.
The Council's reservations concerning the beneficiaries' ability to draw down budgeted expenses have had some negative implications.
As the Council holds the key to the successful use of funds, I see this as the Council's reservations towards itself.
However, Parliament's conviction that the available funds will be used well and efficiently exceeds the Council's expectations.
Therefore, I will vote in favour of those amendments that bring payment parameters more in line with the long-term financial perspective.
(PL) Mr President, at this crucial stage of work on the 2007 budget, it seems to me that the European Parliament is taking more account than the Council of the priorities, figures and principles of interinstitutional cooperation agreed for the period of the 2007-2013 multiannual Financial Perspective.
As people elected by the people, we have a good understanding of the concern felt in the Member States.
There is concern that the new generation of multiannual programmes might not begin on time.
That will be one of the main criteria against which the year 2007 will be assessed.
We also share a common desire for a new financial regulation, hence our pressure on the Finnish Presidency to ensure that we can work on the basis of the new financial regulation in 2007.
The oft-repeated refrain that we are striving to rationalise the budget will become more than mere words this year.
Mr Elles, our rapporteur, has proposed, and obtained Parliament's support for, a very consistent position.
This entails giving strong financial support to the priority lines, whilst applying a 30% reserve to budget lines that seem unlikely to be used in full.
We should all sing from the same hymn sheet in this matter.
There is certain to be a difference of opinion, however, on the issue of posts and salaries in administration.
We believe that the European Union's new functions require motivation, a stable administrative staff and recruitment from the new Member States.
There is bound to be disagreement amongst us on this issue during the conciliation procedure in November.
Personally, I am not fully satisfied with the geographical focus, as our main commitment is to the continent of Europe.
The larger the European Union, the greater its responsibility for Europe.
This should be reflected in the geographical focus applied to the distribution of funds.
Nonetheless, the margins are retained and the flexibility instrument remains unused.
It should also be possible to reach a compromise this year, and our argument should be the strength of Thursday's vote in the European Parliament.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, and I welcome the Commissioner and all of my fellow Members.
I should like to make two very brief remarks.
The first relates to what was said by Mrs Guy-Quint.
Those who wanted proof of the inadequacy of the 2007-2013 financial perspective now have it.
The first budget of the new financial framework clearly demonstrates that the funds are overstretched.
The rapporteur has made some leaps of faith, some of which have been rightly corrected by the political groups, but nothing has been able to address the tight constraints of the multiannual financial framework.
After this first piece of evidence it should be obvious, even to those who argue that 1% of gross national income is enough to sustain the Community budget, that what is instead required is a change, a mid-term review.
I therefore call on Parliament to start preparing for this challenge right now.
My second remark will be brief.
Mr Elles has done well to propose an operation for controlling spending, which has our support and backing.
It is right to be as transparent as possible, but it is also right not to undermine the fundamental policies of the European Union.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to thank the general rapporteur on the budget, Mr Elles, for his excellent preparatory work.
He has demonstrated intimate knowledge of the work of the EU and the administration of its funds.
His approach has been well-argued and bold.
At the same time I want to thank Mr Grech for the excellent and responsible job that he has done, and Mr Lewandowski for his skilful leadership of the Committee on Budgets.
The 2007 budget is the first to be drafted within the framework of the new financial perspectives.
It is, moreover, an initial source of financing for new programmes and a final one for old commitments.
The draft budget is moderate.
It remains within the framework of the financial perspectives, and it does not even propose the use of the flexibility instrument.
Nevertheless, it has clear priorities.
In my opinion, it is quite right that appropriations for training, research and development have been increased.
We must build more than just a pile of paper round the Lisbon Strategy.
For that reason, we still need to make it easier for enterprise to flourish, which will mean competitiveness under the CIP Programme and a clear boost for innovation.
All these have been among our group's objectives.
The Northern Dimension and cooperation in the Baltic Sea region have been on the agenda for a long time, and it has been considered important to develop them.
My group has tabled two draft amendments, Amendments 492 and 493, in which there is an addition to the explanatory statement for the budget headings on pan-European road and gas networks, which states that funds could also be used for financing projects which implement the strategies referred to.
I hope that there is support for these draft amendments.
(FR) Mr President, I shall concentrate on the European Parliament's budget.
The Grech report is the definitive word on the European Parliament's budget, and I should like sincerely to thank Mr Grech for the quality of his work and, especially, for the climate of dialogue that he has been able to create.
For the period of a year - and a year is a long time - he will have to administer all the releases of funds, as well as the reserves. Make no mistake: we shall have someone open, coherent and fair to engage with.
For the second time in its history, Parliament will not achieve the mythical 20% mark.
It is useful to think in terms of an operational budget, but it is necessary to be very attentive and very much on the ball if, as proposed by the Grech report, we wish, as the need arises, to mobilise more money in order to acquire buildings, given that acquisition procedures are extremely protracted, what with the Bureau being required to give a decision, the Committee on Budgets needing to offer an opinion and the Council having to give us the go-ahead.
If, for example, I were to purchase a building in London or Paris over the next few days, I am not sure that we could, in a few weeks, release the funds for which we had, however, made provision the previous year.
It is therefore a very good idea to stay below the 20% mark whilst, however, remaining very much on the alert in case an opportunity should present itself.
The second very important feature of the Grech report is that it has placed the individual at the heart of our objectives.
Next year, and for the first time, we are going to embark on a new process through the setting up of the parliamentary web-TV channel project, the beginning of the work in our visitors' centre and the meeting of the first citizen 'agora', which will involve people in our legislative work.
I think that we have made a lot of effort to put the citizen centre stage, and I should not like to conclude without emphasising - since we learned yesterday evening that he was to be leaving - that Mr Priestley, our Secretary-General, has, during the ten years that he has headed the administration, worked hard to modernise our budgetary procedure and to make it more rigorous and transparent.
(EL) Mr President, the draft budget serves in an absolute manner the anti-grassroots, reactionary policy of the European Union.
It is within the framework of the new financial framework for 2007-2013, cut and sewn to the measures to strengthen European capital.
The 2007 budget promotes the anti-labour Lisbon Strategy and the united market, while at the same time cutting resources for many regions, such as Greece, strengthening inequalities and unequal measures with prospects of it not even being included in the poor Cohesion Fund.
It drastically cuts spending in the agricultural sector, completing the application of the anti-farming reformed CAP, thereby wiping out more small and medium-sized farms and, at the same time, cutting hundreds of jobs.
This is the modern spirit of the European Union: intensification of work, mass unemployment, poverty-level wages and pensions and, of course, drastic cutbacks and further privatisation both in public health and in social insurance systems.
Nonetheless, resources are increased by 98% for competitiveness, industrial innovation policy and entrepreneurship, as is the funding for measures for employability, temporary work and class cooperation.
They call it social dialogue.
It is a class budget, which is unfair and should be condemned by the grassroots classes, because it brings inequality, injustice, poverty and greater exploitation for the workers and greater profits for capital.
That is why it should be rejected.
(PL) Mr President, not only is the 2007 budget the first budget in the new 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, but it is also the first budget relating to 27 Member States, including Bulgaria and Romania.
For those two reasons alone, it ought to be as high as possible in terms of expenditure.
The 2007-2013 financial framework indicates that payments may amount, at most, to 1.06% of the Union's GNP.
Unfortunately, in its draft payments plan, the European Commission proposed payments totalling barely EUR 116 billion, which amounts to only 0.99% of the Union's GNP.
For its part, the Council of the European Union proposed a further cut of EUR 1.75 billion.
Against this background, we should welcome the stance of Parliament's Committee on Budgets.
It proposed payments at a level of EUR 121.9 billion, which amounts to 1.04% of GNP and is around EUR 5.1 billion more than the Commission's proposal.
Therefore, I very much hope that the House will endorse the proposals made by the Committee on Budgets and that they will be successfully defended throughout the course of our negotiations with the European Commission and the Council.
Mr President, in his report Mr Elles says that it is essential for policymakers to focus on what the real challenges will be for the EU in the years ahead.
When David Cameron was campaigning for the leadership of Mr Elles' party last year, he told the Daily Telegraph, 'we must challenge the culture of the EU, leaving it to focus on its real job, making the single market work properly and championing free trade'.
However, Mr Elles' policy priorities include common foreign and security policy, the European Neighbourhood Policy, terrorist threats, border controls on immigration, environment and communication.
This is the Tory hidden agenda and it is very different from the one Mr Cameron put forward when he needed the votes from the more Eurosceptic party members.
But of course this is the same Mr Cameron who was pretending he would leave the PPE-DE.
One year on, Mr Elles is free to carry on promoting the PPE-DE agenda.
His real leader, Mr Poettering, is no doubt delighted.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency for at last being so bold as to do something, even if only in a small way, about the sacred cow of appointments in the EU.
I think it extremely regrettable that the attempt at doing away with at least 200 posts before moving on to doing more of the same sort of thing should be repulsed in the way in which it has been in paragraph 29 of the Elles report.
That really is the wrong way to go about it.
To show just why it is so very wrong, let me quote Mrs Guy-Quint, the lady who tabled the amendment, and who said: 'I have never yet heard any rational justification for these cutbacks.
They are about nothing more than settling personal scores, about offended vanity, intrigues and aggression.'
That is what she said in committee.
Of course, the opposite is the case.
The EU has done the sensible thing by getting rid of plenty of jobs already, and it would send the right message if we were, for once, to make a few cuts of our own.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, This budget for 2007 follows on seamlessly from that for 2005, and the rapporteur deserves thanks for accomplishing something so unprecedented.
What we have to do in managing the budget is to do more to combat the waste of EU funds in the shape of displacement effects and lack of efficiency.
The job cuts in the Commission remain highly controversial; we say 'no' to them, albeit with reservations, and the acid test we apply is what gains in efficiency is the Council prepared to concede that the Commission - in its field offices in Luxembourg, for example - has achieved?
How well equipped is the Commission itself to perform its future functions, which will have less to do with making laws and more with the monitoring of how Community law is implemented?
There are no more than two posts for monitoring Community environmental law, which accounts for 40% of the laws we adopt.
Something else that we have to make provision for in the parliamentary budget is the means for dealing with a further loss of credibility on the part of Europe.
In 2007, we will be appointing nine translators and interpreters of the Irish language, even though eight of the thirteen Irish MEPs do not speak Irish.
Sixty Members are travelling around with the new EUROLAT parliamentary assembly, adhering, in so doing, to none of the customary practices of parliamentary assemblies, such as intergovernmental agreements, for example.
This Parliament of ours is having building work carried out at all three of its sites in 2007, and this is something I find difficult to explain to groups of visitors or to the voters back home.
These are all good issues that we can use to demonstrate that we are taking the Court of Auditors' criticisms seriously and also that we are serious about managing the EU's budget better.
(PL) Mr President, 2007 will be the first year of a new seven-year Financial Perspective.
It is therefore particularly important, at this point, for the institutions of the European Union to clearly define the real needs and priorities for the coming years.
Working on the basis of budgetary discipline and increased efficiency, we should, at the same time, depart from the practice of accepting very high margins of expenditure.
In the past, this often led to resources being wasted.
It also seems appropriate to retain the present strategy of purchasing the buildings we use. This will result in savings in the long term and make funds available for other activities.
It also seems essential to review the policy on staff management, particularly regarding outsourcing the implementation of activities, which has a detrimental effect on continuity and stability and could therefore have a negative impact on the functioning of the institutions.
As far as employment policy is concerned, the posts resulting from enlargement must be our priority at present.
This process must include information on accommodation for new staff.
The cuts in the budgets of individual institutions proposed by the Council should not be an aim in themselves.
Taking into account the enlargement in 2004 and the next one, which is almost upon us, the overriding aim must first and foremost be to ensure the effective operation of all the Union's institutions.
In conclusion, I should like to warmly congratulate both rapporteurs on a very well prepared document and us on a sound compromise and an ambitious budget.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too should like to congratulate our rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, on their painstaking work, and to thank and congratulate all of my colleagues on the tremendous work put in on this occasion by the Committee on Budgets when examining the 1 200 amendments, with the aim of meeting the expectations of the 450 million people in Europe.
Firstly, I, for my part, should like once again to point out that I regret the poor contribution made to the European budget by the Member States within the context of the financial perspective.
This contribution is clearly not enough to implement the policies that it now falls to the European Union to translate into something that Europeans want.
Our Parliament therefore has relatively little room for manoeuvre in this area.
If our ambition must be realistic - indeed modest - then let us at least make it as clear as possible.
That was the proposal made by the Committee on Budgets, and that is what we must examine today and in the weeks to come, by prioritising the most effective policies for attaining these objectives and thus for achieving the world's most powerful knowledge-based economy.
That is why I welcome the efforts that specifically focused, via the proposals, on research, innovation and development policies; on aid for SMEs; on pilot projects; and on the appropriations earmarked for cultural policies which, according to the recommendations made by our colleague, Mrs de Sarnez, are regarded by Europeans as a fundamental part of our common project.
Finally, and in keeping with the humanist and realistic image of our European integration process, I welcome the substantial increase in the appropriations dedicated to the policy in favour of the most impoverished people in Europe.
To conclude, I am pleased that, where external policy is concerned, a balance has been struck that takes account of the peace process in Palestine, even though the reservations voiced will enable us, in my view, to send out a strong signal to the Council in the weeks to come, since we are at first reading.
(PT) Although it improves upon the Commission's proposal of 0.99% of Community GNI, and that of the Council at 0.98%, in terms of volume of payments, it comes as no surprise that Parliament's proposal for the Community budget for 2007, at 1.04%, falls short in the very first year of what was agreed in the financial perspective, namely 1.06%, which in our view is itself inadequate if we are to promote genuine economic and social cohesion, particularly given the needs of an enlarged EU.
Given that this is part of the negotiation process, we hope that, unlike what has happened in the past, Parliament will at least seek to ensure that the minimum amounts provided for in the financial perspective for 2007 are adhered to as far as possible, and that these funds are used for the purpose of pursuing an effective economic and social cohesion policy and a genuine policy of cooperation and development.
Although we welcome the adoption in the Committee on Budgets of specific amendments that we tabled, we are very disappointed that other important proposals that we tabled were rejected, which were as follows: the creation of compensation packages to offset fuel price rises in the fishing industry; the creation of a Community programme to support small-scale traditional coastal fishing as a response to the specific problems experienced in the sector, in accordance with positions previously adopted by Parliament; and an increase in the funds earmarked for convergence in the European Regional Development Fund to compensate fully the 'regions affected by the statistical effect', such as the Algarve, since they have been cut by some 20% this year.
Mr President, I should like to refer to one particular budgetary matter.
The Commission is presently finalising its public health programme for 2007-2013.
We all know that in the recent past the Commission has had very effective information campaigns, highlighting the dangers of tobacco and AIDS within the European Union.
The Commission has a budget of EUR 56 million per year to highlight public health threats and to implement public information campaigns throughout Europe.
I believe the time has now come for the Commission to implement an information-awareness campaign to highlight the problem and dangers of, and the cures for, depression within the Union.
I have also written to many governments of Europe seeking their support for this political initiative.
One in four people in Europe experience at least one significant episode of mental difficulties during their lives and up to 18 million people in the European Union, aged between 16 and 25, suffer from major depression.
Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problems experienced in Europe.
Studies have estimated that by 2020 depression will become the highest-ranking disease in the developed world.
In fact, there are even higher levels of depression in Eastern and Central Europe.
We have identified the problem; we have the financial resources to highlight it; so let us go forward and meet this challenge now.
(SV) Mr President, first of all, the June List believes that the European Union's common agricultural policy needs to be scrapped.
As I have pointed out on so many occasions in this House, EU agricultural policy is reprehensible because the money is given to the wrong recipients, and often to recipients who are very rich.
What is more, it denies the world's poor countries an honest opportunity to sell their agricultural produce on the EU market because we subsidise non-competitive agriculture.
Secondly, the June List believes that structural policy should be returned to the national competence.
The EU resources that come back to Sweden come with a very large number of conditions attached and are in most cases not adapted to Swedish needs.
Next year, Sweden's contribution to the EU budget will rise to a good EUR 3 billion.
We shall get back approximately EUR 1 billion.
Thirdly, then, the June List believes that Sweden's membership fee should be halved in the light of how distorting and unjust the EU's agricultural and trade policy is.
(FR) Mr President, the European budget is like the theatre of Bertolt Brecht.
While 'Waiting for Godot' - while waiting for 2014 and own resources - we are managing the most modest of appropriations: EUR 116 billion in payment appropriations, which is not even 1% of gross national income. A game is being played here.
For example, the nomenclature has been changed, with a shift from eight headings to six.
An attempt has been made at humour: the Europe of 17 million unemployed is referred to under Heading 1 as 'growth and employment'.
The CAP budget, which is destroying farming and fruit and vegetable growing and uprooting 400 000 hectares of land, is referred to under Heading 2 as 'confirmation of resources'.
These changes in form apart, this is a classic budget in every respect.
Firstly, it includes a financial framework for 2007-2013, which is contained within an interinstitutional agreement - the fourth of its kind - signed on 17 May.
It includes Malthusian sums, for example for agriculture: indeed, market expenditure is going to be wilfully reduced by more than EUR 500 million.
It also includes the great classics: EUR 7 billion with which to toy with external policy in the world; EUR 5 billion for a research framework programme that will not research much; and EUR 850 million for the trans-European networks.
All of that, while we await the 2008-2009 review during which every issue will be discussed - not only the UK rebate but also, and above all, agriculture and the agricultural budget.
The great budget debate will therefore take place between 2010 and 2014.
While we wait to discuss the fisheries sector, Erasmus and the citizens, and if we cannot take tea - since it is almost 5 p.m. - we prefer, during this afternoon's budget debate, to exchange the little budgetary titbits with which our rapporteur has embellished his magnificent report, which is, all the same, very pleasing.
(EL) Mr President, the European Union is the most ambitious endeavour in history.
Yet we are funding this endeavour with a minimum 1% of GDP.
It is not only that we are giving so little; it is that the Commission and the Council do not even want the minimum amounts committed to be taken up.
The Commission made provision in the preliminary draft for just 1%.
The Council reduced it still further to 0.98% and we increased it to 1.04%.
The Council is doing its best to reduce funding for the Union, the Commission is not doing its best to defend it and thus this role falls to the European Parliament alone.
Many also proposed that we should put spending on agriculture in reserve.
We rejected that proposal.
The destruction of European farmers is not a development policy or a unification policy of Europe; it is - quite simply - a disastrous policy.
Now to a sensitive political issue: we reinstated the amendment for the restoration of Christian churches in northern Cyprus.
A vote in favour of this amendment will demonstrate Europe's respect for its cultural heritage and will strengthen the application of European principles for peaceful coexistence between different religious and ethnic groups.
Lastly, so far we have been informed after the event about the Council's decisions on the CFSP.
This cannot continue.
We need to debate in advance with the Council all the basic options, before the decisions are taken which we are then called on to fund.
In order to send our message to the Council, we reduced spending on the CFSP in 2007 by 50%.
I should like at this point to say, while agreeing that Mr Elles was obviously right, that the Minister will be making a mistake if he truly believes that what we did was what she herself called 'tactical words'.
I hope that the Council will now rethink its stand to date.
(SK) Energy security is one of the political priorities of the new financial perspective and the 2007 budget of the European Union.
It is part of the Competitiveness and Innovations Programme, and there is also a separate research programme within the Seventh Framework Programme.
Our goals in this area are ambitious: we would like to transform the unsustainable, fossil fuel-based energy system into a sustainable one that draws on a variety of energy sources; we must improve energy efficiency, secure energy supplies, prevent climate change, and increase the competitiveness of European enterprises, first in the energy sector and then elsewhere.
The strategy of the European Union and the European budget are important factors in helping to tackle the bleak outlook for European citizens as regards the provision of sustainable, stable and affordable energy.
Undoubtedly, the budget for 2007, that is to say, the first year of a new programming period, is of strategic significance.
However, it is necessary to emphasise that resources are limited and much will depend on how efficiently they are used.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, 2007 is going to be a very exciting financial year, for in it, that which the Heads of State or Government, in December last year, adopted as their political priority, and was agreed on by this House and the Council this May, is, for the first time, to become a living reality.
There are a few aspects of this that I am already getting seriously worried about.
This very week, we will be adopting a number of legal bases for multiannual programmes intended to run with effect from 1 January next year.
The stage we are currently at is that the Member States are putting together their framework plans for the conduct of structural policy and submitting them to the Commission.
My very real concern is that the 2007 budget will become an austerity budget as a consequence of many programmes not even being able to get started, even though they are urgently needed.
What I will say, in quite specific terms, and speaking as someone from a country that has the honour of providing the EU with one-fifth of its funding, is that our concern is that, when so much money is called for - despite the lack of any increase over the past in terms of percentages of gross national income, although I will mention in passing that gross national income has increased as a consequence of enlargement - there must of course be some value given in return for this money.
It is for that reason that I am very glad that our rapporteur, Mr Elles, has said that we want to fund more programmes and less administration, although what the Commission still has to do is to demonstrate that it can run the programmes in a proper manner and that all this will not be absorbed by administration costs.
The agencies are another issue that we really have to sort out, since there are apparently going to be three more of them.
What I also want to say with regard to this House's budget is that we have to reap the benefit of what we have achieved through the success of our building policy.
It is intolerable that we should, just because the money is available, keep on inflating the parliamentary budget and funding things that may well not actually be needed, such as WebTV, for example.
What we need, then, is value for money, and that is what matters most of all.
The report from the Court of Auditors that was presented this morning gives me reason to believe that there is a great potential there for more to be achieved.
(HU) I would like to join Mr Ferber, in stating that the 2007 budget does indeed have particular significance for all of Europe and specifically for the new Member States, including Hungary.
This is the first year of the 2007-2013 financial perspective which we have been involved in drawing up, and which thus fully applies to us.
Consequently, especially given the lengthy and not always smooth process of its development, it is very important that 2007 should constitute a good starting point for the subsequent years.
This presents us all with both an exceptional opportunity and a responsibility.
It is an opportunity in the sense that by making use of the resources approved in the financial perspective, we can begin not only our own process of catching up, but also the structural and cohesion policies that serve as the foundation for Europe's future and its competitiveness.
At the same time, we must take responsibility for overcoming the national self-interest that has, regrettably, become commonplace in both the old and the new Member States when it comes to preparing the budget.
Let us not neglect the common values of Europe as a whole and the international role of the EU.
(MT) The budget that this Parliament will be approving next year will, for the first time, allocate money to a new fund known as the External Borders Fund, purposely created to help Member States strengthen their borders with a view to curtailing the uninterrupted flow of illegal immigration.
Given the seriousness of the illegal immigration emergency, it is almost unbelievable that this is only the first time that the European Union is establishing a fund specifically for external borders, but we have succeeded.
Thanks to this Parliament, the budget for this Fund will be greater than that requested by the Commission itself.
I am talking about a budget amounting to EUR 170 million and designed to protect our frontiers more effectively and thus reduce the influx.
My second point is about FRONTEX, the European Agency for External Borders.
Up to now, this Agency, which has only been in operation for one year, has not been allocated enough resources to do its work.
Suffice it to say that while, up to last week, FRONTEX was coordinating patrols in the Mediterranean, yesterday I saw an advert in the papers announcing that FRONTEX wanted to recruit a director responsible for its sea patrols.
This shows that we must not leave this Agency to its own devices in the belief that it will solve everything.
Therefore, even in this regard, it is gratifying that this Parliament will vote a bigger budget than the Commission requested, almost EUR 35 million, to strengthen this Agency and help it to carry out its duties more effectively.
It is a pity, Mr President, that, rather than follow suit, some European governments have, in a most miserly manner, tried to cut the FRONTEX budget.
We would like them to know that the European Parliament will be doing its utmost to ensure that FRONTEX is given all the means necessary to carry out its duties.
(EL) Mr President, the priorities of this budget should have been clear and adequate in terms of funding, so as to promote the integration of the new Member States.
Instead, in the Council an accounting attitude prevailed in order to reduce appropriations and in the Commission its fearful stand.
How will the Lisbon Strategy be accomplished?
How will the Structural Fund programmes be completed?
With EUR 425 million less?
How will the rural development policy be implemented?
With the fictional transfer from the first pillar though the voluntary modulation mechanism or - as proposed - by putting rural development funds in reserve until the Commission decides and gives guarantees for voluntary modulation?
How will the role of the Union be strengthened in its foreign actions, in the Balkans, in Palestine, in immigration?
By reducing the CFSP by 50%?
How will Europe compete with America in the field of research and competitiveness?
We cannot set political priorities and not provide the necessary financial tools to implement them.
We are losing credibility and this is undermining the future of the European Union.
(HU) I would like to share four thoughts with you and comment on one problem.
The Commission's proposals for next year's budget are well below of the resources provided for in the financial perspective.
The EU's competitiveness is deteriorating rather than improving.
Secondly, it is a nightmare that the Council has tried to cut back even this moderate proposal.
Thirdly, in its current form this will not allow for any development, but simply represents an unsuccessful attempt at survival.
Fourthly: it is good news for the new Member States that the great rush to cut back does not affect support for the cohesion funds, or has a minimal effect.
The problem, undoubtedly a significant one, is that while one of the characteristics of the Union is expressed as 'unity in diversity', we are at present far from satisfying this requirement.
The translations of the proposals are either not prepared in time or are done so only at the last minute, and sometimes only in rough form.
We are obliged to participate in many meetings at which only some MEPs have native language interpreters available.
The enlargement of the Union in January will further increase justified demands in this area.
Linguistic diversity is a value that we can under no circumstances renounce.
(DE) Mr President, as a number of speakers have already said, what we have here before us is the first budget of the new financial period, and one that is described as a budget for savings, even though the only savings have been in terms of the interests of the European public.
What we are dealing with here is a misconceived budget policy on the part of the European Union's Member States.
Over the next seven years, then, the Trans-European Networks will have to get along with only EUR 8 billion instead of the EUR 20 billion that they actually need.
Once more, the Council of Ministers has recourse to the old coercive trick of telling us, in this House, that if we do not pass the budget promptly, the programmes due to start in 2007 will not be able to do so on time.
The Council can, and will, make scapegoats of Parliament and other bodies, even though it sometimes drags out its own decision-making processes over many months, and this is something we have to be on our guard against.
While I am on this subject, let me remind the Commission that it is this House, rather than the Council, that is constantly defending the Commission's line, and it would have a salutary effect if the Commission were sometimes to be aware of that rather than constantly bowing down and taking dictation from the Council.
Also this week, we have to come to a decision on a quite unacceptable proposal that has been made for plugging a hole in the budget in the second pillar, in agriculture and rural affairs, which involves the Member States being allowed to shift up to 20% of the funds from the first pillar into the second, into rural areas, and that has been inadequately thought out.
It runs counter to the prerogatives of this House, and it should be rejected.
What do these two things - the trans-European networks and rural areas - have in common?
Firstly, they have both fallen victim to the Council's irresponsible austerity policy; secondly, in both cases, the Commission has distanced itself from its original position and quietly gone back to taking dictation from the Council, and thirdly, in both cases we have to try to put funds in reserve as a means towards bringing pressure to bear on both the Council and the Commission, in order to eventually save whatever can yet be saved.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mr Elles and Mr Grech, who have shown prudence in their respective draft budgets.
Prudence does not necessarily mean an agreement with the Council, because it does not necessarily mean agreeing with the indiscriminate reductions that the Council has established in those budget lines that were not of interest to it, in other words all those that do not relate to common foreign and security policy, a field in which Parliament has made a reduction.
We very much agree with the principle of value for money which our rapporteur advocates for the general budget, particularly at a time like this, a time of extreme financial restriction.
Given the European Union's prevailing ideology, which some of us do not share, of applying 1% to the budget, a careful analysis of the budget lines, of their level of execution and of European added value is essential.
Perhaps we do not see the notion of 'value for money' in the same way as the Council, but, in any event, it is good that it should be accepted as a budgetary principle.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for being here for the majority of the budgetary debate; that does not normally happen and I therefore thank her.
Issues such as the fight against terrorism, the funding of a genuine common immigration policy and implementation of the policies linked to the Lisbon Strategy are treated as a priority by the European Parliament at its first reading.
We agree with the strategy on payments proposed by our rapporteur, as well as with the proposed focus on the funding of the common foreign and security policy.
Finally, Mr President, we see the budgetary reserves as a very useful instrument, not just for negotiation and good financial management, but also so that, as budgetary authority, we can acquire the information that the Commission often finds it difficult to provide us with for practical reasons.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.05 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Membership of Parliament: see Minutes
Commission Question Time
Mr President, the Commission currently receives fewer complaints about overbooking than before the compensation levels were raised by Regulation (EC) No 261/2004.
At the present time, only 8% of the complaints received by the Commission concerning air passengers' rights relate to instances of overbooking or denied boarding, while 60% refer to delays or cancellations.
This trend is due, among other things, to the development of low-cost carriers and to the increasingly frequent use of charter companies, which do not tend to integrate overbooking into their working methods.
Since this regulation entered into force, the airlines have demonstrated more flexibility in looking for volunteers who will agree to give up their seats in return for certain agreed benefits.
This practice encourages the airlines to resolve the problem there and then.
That being said, I should like to point out to Mr Evans that, in accordance with Article 17 of the regulation, the Commission is going to present a report on the functioning and application of this regulation to Parliament and the Council at the start of 2007.
This communication will be based on a study carried out by an external consultant.
An invitation to tender has been published for the purposes of recruiting this external consultant.
Overbooking is one of the items that will be dealt with in this study, and the Commission will obviously wait to learn the results of the study before it decides whether or not there are grounds to adapt the legislation.
The fact is, Mr Evans, while these new regulations have indeed had a noticeable effect on passengers' rights, it is the decline in overbooking that has become, in certain cases - it must be said - a trend that is very detrimental to passengers.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for that very thorough and clear answer.
However, it is a fact that people still complain about over-booking.
My other concern is that there are still airline companies which are ignoring this Regulation on Air Passengers' Rights and are telling their customers that it does not apply to them.
Is the Commission going to get tough on some of these operators who seem to think they can operate outside the law and outside EU regulations?
Mr Titley, it is absolutely vital that we ensure that these passengers' rights are applied.
I must also say that, at the moment, I am trying to call on all of the airports to display passengers' rights, so that it is quite clear that all passengers must be informed of the fact that they cannot be made the subject of an overbooking without being offered significant compensation in return, as the regulation stipulates.
There are three key words in relation to this issue: information, investigation and audit, as I pointed out to you.
Next, we shall see whether there are grounds to impose penalties or, at any rate, to bring before the Court of Justice those Member States that have not really monitored the application of these passengers' rights.
There you have it, Mr Titley.
I thank you for your question, which highlights the importance of applying European law.
(DE) Mr President, the Vice-President of the Commission was right to point out that we, together, have managed to solve the problem of over-bookings or, at any rate, to improve the situation.
In adopting this directive back in 2004, we had set the standard for delays very low after the airlines told us that the 9/11 disaster meant that stringent rules would make life virtually impossible for them.
They make a practice of simply letting delays pile up, so that, with several landing and takeoff manoeuvres in the course of a day, these delays eventually add up to many hours, for which no financial compensation is paid.
We have put stringent rules in place for the benefit of railway passengers, who can be entitled to full reimbursement of their fares, yet airline passengers ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
I just briefly want to say to Mr Rack that we receive numerous complaints about excessive delays and that we specifically wanted to carry out this audit in order to determine how exactly we can ensure that the new passengers' rights are applied more effectively.
You are right: as European citizens, we have a right to demand to be treated decently as air passengers and, in the future, as rail passengers.
Therefore, rest assured, Mr Rack, that it is indeed the aim of the Commissioner for Transport to ensure that passengers' rights are applied more and more rigorously.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I am glad that the number of complaints appears to be relatively low, but I have myself had the experience - for we are relatively frequent flyers - of the last three flights I was on being overbooked.
I would now be interested to know whether this is a more frequent occurrence on any airlines in particular.
Can it be said that there are certain airlines that make overbooking a matter of professional practice?
Might it not, under certain circumstances, be possible to consider taking action - quite apart from proceedings for breach of contract - against these companies, not only in order to obtain compensation, but against those companies themselves.
What is the likelihood of an improved public relations effort to make passengers aware of the possibility of compensation payments?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication that the European Commission adopted in July, at my suggestion, addresses the general theme of a European strategy on the protection of children's rights.
It is clear that special attention is paid in this European strategy to the risk of children and young people falling victim to the actions of criminal paedophiles who use the Internet.
We support very strong preventative action.
In particular, we are in favour of the creation of an international database that can gather together all of the principal data relating to criminals and to those who operate via the Internet for paedophilic purposes, mainly so that we can stop the spread of images that, obviously for reasons to do with sexual exploitation, affect children and young people, and so that we can root out and clamp down on the culprits, namely those who use the Internet for these purposes.
We have also decided to fund a programme called 'Safer Internet plus', which consists of a European network of telephone lines and, above all, of Internet communications aimed at allowing Internet users to cooperate with the police.
Through this system of safer Internet use, which is called Safer Internet plus, Internet users will be able to inform the police authorities or Internet providers of any potentially dangerous 'hits', and thus the presence of those who use the Internet for pornographic purposes.
Furthermore, we have recently adopted a communication on the trafficking of human beings that includes a chapter specifically dedicated to children and to violence against children.
I am looking into the application of the framework decision on the fight against the sexual exploitation of minors and children and against the use of children in pornography.
In conjunction with the application of this framework decision, I believe that we will be able to come up with measures to further enhance the legislative framework and to clamp down even more harshly on Internet-based sexual exploitation that harms children.
I will report on this issue before the end of the year in a Commission communication.
Finally, the general theme of computer crime will be addressed at the start of next year with a strategic document that will contain a chapter specifically dedicated to child protection.
Mr Ebner will be aware that we have refinanced the Daphne programme.
The Daphne II programme is dedicated to European initiatives combating violence not only against children but also against women and will have a budget of EUR 50 million for the new operating period.
Through this system, we plan to promote best practice in preventing violence against children and to launch information campaigns aimed at promoting more responsible Internet use on the part of children and young people.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Frattini for his very thorough reply.
I must acknowledge the fact that he has done some very extensive work in this area, and I believe that he will succeed in bringing about the security and the protection that we want for our children.
I hope that this programme and its activities bear fruit and I, for my part, hope that Parliament will firmly support its work.
Vice-President of the Commission. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly grateful to Mr Ebner.
We are currently at the implementation stage.
The European strategic plan will, however, include other important advances.
We are thinking about launching a European emergency helpline in the near future for children who are in difficulty.
It will have the same three numbers for the whole of Europe - 116 - followed by a national number for each country, and will help children who have been kidnapped, who are lost or who are in difficulty.
Together with the major international credit card companies, I am also looking into the possibility of blocking the credit cards of those who access paedophile websites for the purposes of buying pornographic material involving children.
Everyone will recognise that a threat such as this is already in itself a signal designed to strongly discourage this type of criminal.
I am asking my question as the father of Emily, who turns five on Friday, and Oliver, who will be two and a half.
Oliver is not yet surfing the net, but Emily already is.
I fully share the views put forward by the Commissioner and the previous speakers about protecting youth, but can the Commissioner guarantee that we are not starting to impose restrictions on our general use of the internet, because the last thing we want is a headline to the effect that the European Union is preventing us from using the internet freely?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, obviously, no one is thinking about restricting people's use of the Internet, which is one of the most extraordinary means of communication, insofar as it puts children and young people throughout the world in touch with each other.
However, it is quite clear that we must make sure that we root out and clamp down on criminals who use the Internet in order to establish closer contact with young people, who must obviously be protected.
It is therefore not by restricting Internet use, but by doing more in terms of prevention and control, that we can help children to use the Internet in complete safety.
Member of the Commission. The Commission remains deeply concerned by the human rights situation in Iran and views the practice of execution by lapidation as particularly abhorrent.
It is fully aware of the reports by Amnesty International covering sentences of stoning, referred to by the honourable Members.
Stoning is a cruel, inhuman and degrading form of punishment, which the Commission finds totally unacceptable.
The EU has repeatedly called on Iran progressively to restrict the use of the death penalty and insisted that it be carried out according to UN minimum standards, including the requirement that capital punishment may be imposed only for the most serious crimes.
In December 2002, the EU started a human rights dialogue with the Iranian authorities, with the participation of civil society representatives.
One of the practical results at the time was confirmation by the Iranian side of a moratorium on stoning.
Regrettably that dialogue has not taken place since the summer of 2004 because of the reluctance of the Iranian authorities.
However, tentative dates for a new round of human rights discussions have been fixed for mid-December.
- (PT) Mr President, so the Iranian authorities have promised a moratorium and have failed to keep to it; no surprise there.
What I should like to ask you, Commissioner, is why the Commission insists on talking with a fanatical clique that is tyrannising Iran, rather than with the vast majority of Iranians, who think differently.
I should like to recommend a book to you, written in your language, entitled We are Iran, a collection of writings by a large number of Iranians who think differently and with whom the Commission ought to speak.
Member of the Commission. We talk to all elements of civil society in Iran.
It is difficult for the honourable Member on the one hand to ask us to make representations; to make a case to the Iranian authorities; to make a stand for human rights and against this abhorrent practice; and, at the same time, to criticise us for engaging in a dialogue.
If you do not have a dialogue, then it is harder, if not impossible, to communicate your view.
In my view, the European approach is right.
In close collaboration with EU embassies in Tehran, the Commission monitors the situation on the ground very closely, in particular as far as the death penalty is concerned.
Whenever it learns of a death sentence passed on juveniles or on women at risk of stoning, the EU undertakes immediate dÃ©marches with the judiciary and other competent authorities.
So the EU is not relying on dialogue alone.
It makes its views very directly and clearly known whenever such a case arises, and will continue to do so.
Commissioner, when you say that the European Commission takes the human rights situation in Iran seriously, when is this issue discussed in other dialogues with Iran?
We now have a dialogue about the nuclear programme in Iran.
Is this issue addressed in those negotiations, or in the negotiations on trade issues?
This is a serious matter and I do not think it is enough to say that we are trying to get back to the negotiating table on human rights.
This has to be put on the agenda in all dialogues with Iran.
When do you intend to do that?
Member of the Commission. The Commission follows up human rights cases through several channels.
It does not simply rely on the dialogue, the last session of which was held in June 2004, and another session of which is due to take place shortly.
We make diplomatic representations through a variety of different channels, in addition to the set-piece dialogue that is in place, and we shall continue to do so.
(PT) Following the remarks of previous speakers, I should like to know the Commission's position on the rape of pregnant women and young children, as a means of silencing the opposition in Iran.
This is a violation of women's rights and human rights, and I should like to know if the Commission is aware that this occurs and what its position is on the matter.
I am grateful to the honourable Member for asking the question. This gives me the opportunity to give an answer which I know is very important to Parliament, because Parliament has given much prominence to the topic of international roaming in recent years.
As you know, for citizens there are two problems: first, the high prices they have to pay for crossing the borders; and then the problem of inadvertent roaming on a foreign network when they have not yet crossed the border but are living in a border area.
In competitive markets one expects to see convergence of prices and costs, but when it comes to roaming there has been for many years now no evidence of a real relationship between prices and underlying costs.
This point was also made very clearly in the impact assessment which accompanied the regulation which I have put on the table.
The question is very simple.
Why should a French customer who just crosses the border to Italy and makes a local call be charged from 50 cents to over EUR 1 per minute, when an Italian customer who is doing exactly the same will be charged between 10 and 13 cents per minute?
All right, there are some additional costs if you take your phone into a neighbouring country, but there is very little justification for such high differences in price.
In every other area of telecoms - fixed and broadband - European consumers are seeing significant improvements in price, choice and quality; only for international roaming has this not been the case.
There are millions of citizens who have been very frustrated at these high prices for many years.
We estimate that there are roughly 99 million European citizens living in regions located within 50 km of the borders and 11 million citizens within 5 km of the borders.
They are those most affected by the extraordinarily high roaming prices.
The regulation I have proposed, which is under discussion in Parliament and the Council, proposes substantial reductions in the roaming charges for all Europeans, consumers and business travellers.
It is clear that when that is put in place, those living and roaming in internal border regions will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the regulation.
From a technical point of view, because of the nature of mobile networks, consumers who live in such areas will have to pay some roaming charges, but there will be guarantees, if the regulation is passed, that the prices will be far more reasonable than they are today.
There is also the question of inadvertent roaming, which is a possibility wherever mobile services are available and national borders exist.
That is also why it is very important for those people that the charges will be closer to the cost.
I very often criticise the operators for charging high prices.
On the other hand, I must also say that when operators make the right moves in the right direction, I have to give credit where it is due.
I am pleased to note, for example, that operators in Ireland and the United Kingdom have started to offer all-island rates.
That means, for instance, that citizens in Ireland and in Northern Ireland now pay only one single rate, irrespective of where they are.
That is a good example of best practice.
I would like to see such initiatives encouraged and followed in other areas across Europe.
(NL) Mr President, roaming costs, particularly those in border regions, account for some EUR 5 billion annually in unacceptable and, in fact, unnecessary expense for businesses and residents alike.
I am therefore indebted to Commissioner Reding for her very emphatic intervention in recent months and also today, but a voluntary solution between businesses in the border regions for this problem of roaming, of which one is hardly aware, where one is moved from one network to another several times a day, is a major problem; I therefore fear that things will not get solved sufficiently promptly if they are done on a voluntary basis.
So I would ask the Commissioner, and the whole of the Commission, whether it is prepared to draft progress report on this subject.
I think that we need to step up our efforts, for I know that the border regions would like to have a say too.
Unfortunately the national regulators do not have explicit powers to prevent or reduce the possibility of inadvertent roaming.
As the international roaming problem has shown, we do not yet have an internal market in this area.
That is why we have to follow this very closely in order to find good examples and underline them.
In Ireland, for instance, Comreg and Ofcom have agreed to set up a joint working group to investigate the extent of the problem of inadvertent roaming by mobile users and we welcome and encourage that approach.
But it is not yet possible to address the problem on a wider scale through the normal regulatory process.
(DE) Commissioner, the foreign surcharges on the new UMTS technology are even more pricey than on conventional mobiles; if you surf abroad, even if only over a partner network, you lose a lot of money fast, and the bill does not generally show whether it has been calculated by the minute or by volume.
Is the Commission planning to ensure greater transparency in this area by way of the Roaming Regulation?
Member of the Commission. I was asked specifically by Parliament, among others, to address the question of international roaming charges for mobile phones.
At the time I examined this matter, there was no specific demand for action on data services, such as SMS, and when the national regulatory authorities called on the Commission to do something, they were only concerned about the high level of international roaming charges for voice telephony.
I know from the many discussions I have held, particularly with Members of Parliament and with citizens, that there is also a problem with data.
Parliament, which is examining the regulation, now has the opportunity to go a step further than the Commission did.
Let me also appeal to businesses, since industry is always complaining that we intervene in price regulation.
Operators now have a chance to show that they themselves are capable of bringing prices down, so that the regulators or politicians do not need to intervene.
Commissioner, you have given convincing examples of the absurd situation as regards roaming prices in different countries, but you did not mention the new Member States of the EU, where the situation is even worse.
Will the Commission pay special attention to the new Member States of the European Union with a view to eliminating the very big differences in general mobile telephone and roaming charges?
Member of the Commission. The honourable Member is correct: the Greek electronic communications market has unfortunately suffered from a very long delay in the transposition of the regulatory framework.
It should have been in force in 2003. It was only completed in Greece in June 2006.
We have seen very clearly that where the framework is not in place there is no competition.
Where there is no competition there is less investment.
That is one of the problems in Greece.
On a more positive note, EU structural assistance in Greece provides substantial co-funding for investments aimed at promoting speedier adoption of ICT in Greece and, in particular, for broadband internet in schools and public organisations in remote, island or mountainous areas.
Cohesion funds in Greece also permit projects for the acquisition of informatics equipment in schools or public organisations in the regions, including remote, island or mountainous areas.
As you also know, Greece has started the implementation of a major project aimed at extending broadband access to those Greek regions outside Athens and Thessaloniki which do not yet have that connection and, under normal commercial circumstances, would not get it.
The Greek Government has also launched the DIODOS project, which established a high-capacity Greek internet educational network through which a number of internet providers are offering advanced internet services to research, academic and education communities at prices that are expected to be 50% below current retail prices.
You will also be aware that the Commission is working very hard on bridging the digital divide.
That is why the Commission recently published a communication on bridging the broadband gap, which gives a strong commitment to achieve broadband for all Europeans through policy, budget aid and regulatory instruments.
Included in that are the structural funds, but also - and this is new - the rural funds, in full respect of state aid rules.
The communication proposes action that aims at strengthening current policies, national broadband strategies and reinforcing the exchange of best practices through a website.
We believe it is very important for the regions to understand what other regions have done and to see what they might be able to copy or adapt to their specific needs.
In that sense we hope that the many problems that persist in some regions, and especially in Greece, can gradually be overcome.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply, which fully satisfied me.
I should also like to extend my special thanks to her for visiting Cyprus and for visiting the ENISA, thereby helping to resolve numerous problems for the benefit of this organisation.
We extend our special thanks to you, both Greece and Cyprus, for your visit to Heraklion.
Member of the Commission. Besides being a beautiful island, Crete is also a region striving to overcome the broadband gap it faces and I know that the honourable Member is helping to pursue that goal in his capacity as a representative of Crete.
Any help we can give, of course, must come through the Greek Government, because, in the case of structural or rural development funds, it is the government which must take the initiative.
The Commission is willing to provide help, so that the large gap which still exists in the non-urban areas of Greece can be narrowed.
I should like to thank the Commissioner.
In Ireland the schools fare better and students are fine while they are at school.
When they are at home, however, the situation is very poor; 25% of the population cannot get broadband.
Has the Commission given serious consideration to filling the gap by new technologies, such as WiMAX, although these need spectrum and frequency access?
Have you considered this and do you have a response to it?
Many of my constituents cannot get access to broadband and students are deprived of the technology when they go home.
Member of the Commission. It is clear that there are many techniques and technologies that can bridge the broadband gap.
The Commission has always been very consistent in saying that we need technological neutrality.
We cannot favour one technology over another and sometimes a mix of technologies is the right approach.
Fibre is not always the answer; sometimes satellites can be more efficient.
In the Nordic states, for example, where there are a lot of geographical problems and problems of distance, this mix of technologies has provided a solution.
I know from the statistics for schools with broadband internet access that Ireland is not doing wonderfully well.
That is astonishing, because I know that education on the new technologies in Ireland is very advanced.
I therefore hope that the broadband gap in Ireland can be filled and that in future all schools will be able to reach the world through the new technologies.
I was glad that the Commissioner, in her first answer, reinforced the importance of sustaining competition and the access obligations in the framework of broadband delivery.
I wonder if she would like to confirm to the House that she will be resisting the calls from certain operators and even regulators for a regulatory holiday for certain levels of investment in broadband?
Secondly, bearing in mind that she and I will be at the global forum on internet governance next week, can she confirm that she will be joining us in promoting the virtues of competition on a global scale, in order to raise the level of broadband connection globally and reduce costs?
Member of the Commission. My answer to the honourable Member is that, according to information from the registry, the number of applications submitted during the sunrise period was 346 218, of which 181 306 were filed during the first phase and 164 912 during the second.
The current rate of rejection for applications from Ireland is 46%, compared to an overall EU rejection rate of 34%.
The complete table with a breakdown of all applications per prior right and country of applicant can be found on the registry's website.
The kind of documentary evidence to be provided by an applicant depends on the national law of the Member State in which the prior right is established.
There are huge differences between the legal systems of the Member States, which are reflected in the more or less complicated means needed to prove the existence of a prior right.
This results in a higher or lower rate of rejection of applications in certain countries, such as Ireland.
As to the question of whether the registry provided Irish registrars with the necessary means to comply fully with the application process, the Commission is not aware of any specific discrimination in this respect.
From October 2005 - that is, two months before the launch of the sunrise period - the registry published on its website and in all the official languages a detailed description of all technical and administrative measures concerning the registration procedures.
This information, by the way, is still available online to any interested party.
During that same period, the registry also set up a call centre, where applicants could obtain quick responses to their questions in 20 official languages.
As to the alternative dispute resolution procedure, its purpose is promptly to resolve disputes between domain name holders on matters such as cyber-squatting or intellectual property rights, as well as in relation to individual decisions by the registry.
Should an Irish applicant consider that he or she falls within either of these two categories, the Commission is of the opinion that the alternative dispute resolution procedure is indeed a fair method for remedying the problem.
In conclusion, the Commission considers that the information made available by the public registry is sufficient for applicants and for registrars to proceed with the registration of domain names during the registration period and afterwards.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
Despite our performance on broadband, it is nice to hear the Commission acknowledge what has happened in Northern Ireland and Ireland as regards roaming, which I hope will serve as a model for other countries.
In her answer, the Commissioner firmly placed the blame on national governments for their inadequate legislation.
This is true not only of Ireland but also of the United Kingdom.
Mr Patrik LindÃ©n, the communications manager of EURid, has put it very bluntly indeed.
I will take your message back and will certainly point out that at national and local level much of the responsibility for the fact that we are way behind the rest of Europe effectively rests with our own government and our own legislation.
Fair Trade has made enormous progress in getting labelled products onto supermarket shelves and into mainstream buying habits and practices.
The same cannot yet be claimed for crafts and garments.
The Commission will consider, as part of the follow-up to Parliament's report, whether there is scope for action in this area.
When I said in Parliament in July that 'what is required to tackle poverty and to enhance development is a fair and coherent policy framework', this was not limited to Fair Trade - though I acknowledged the helpful role that the report on Fair Trade and development would play.
So whilst the Commission is considering how to capitalise further on the role of the Fair Trade movement, there are a number of other wider actions that it can undertake.
In cooperation with developing countries, we can promote decent work and international labour standards, as well as the interaction between decent work and other policies.
The new thematic programme on investing in people, which comprises awareness-raising, training, information-sharing and the development of a set of indicators to monitor progress, will be an important tool.
The close link between decent work and poverty reduction is increasingly well understood in the EU.
In the 'European Consensus on Development' - a document published in 2005 - employment and social cohesion are recognised as one of the nine areas of Community action.
Employment, decent work and social cohesion are also central in the EU-Africa strategy.
In May 2006, the Commission adopted a communication on decent work for all, which will be presented at the Commission Conference on Decent Work and Globalisation in December, where the issues will be tackled in a comprehensive framework.
We are also contributing to the adoption of international norms and standards for all products, including textiles, through ongoing trade-related activities at bilateral and regional level.
One example is a quality support programme in Bangladesh, which focuses on the improvement of the quality standards, metrology and accreditation systems in the country to help national laboratories ensure regional and multilateral recognition and acceptability of the conformity assessment certificates.
The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute will also be strengthened in its basic capacity as a standards-setting body and in the area of metrology.
The programme will help to enable Bangladesh to address multilateral requirements, as well as to increase the competitiveness of its export industry.
The project aims to create public-private partnerships and promote in particular awareness of quality and environmental managements systems and social standards - ISO 14000 and SA 8000 certified companies have increased in number - as well as strengthening the Consumer Association, through which pressure for change and control will be built up.
Thank you for that answer, Commissioner.
I entirely accept that there are wider issues in trade and development than Fair Trade alone.
However, I should still like to hear from the Commission that you will give specific support to developing clear criteria for assessing Fair Trade assurance schemes.
I should also like you to reflect on ways to boost transparency in pricing, so that consumers can see if the Fair Trade premium is passed back by supermarkets, as well as seeing that if they buy their ten-pound or fifteen-euro dress, their bargain may be at the expense of a decent living for textile workers.
Member of the Commission. I sympathise with what the honourable Member is suggesting.
I think that consumer information, consumer power in this context, is indeed the key.
Fair Trade relies on consumers who have heard about the difficulties faced by poor producers and want to do something about it.
We can help mainly by helping consumers to be clear about what is on offer, but we are looking for opportunities to support the Fair Trade movement when it comes up with targeted requests.
I look forward to considering those as we reflect on what further action to take to support the Fair Trade movement in the weeks and months ahead.
(DE) Mr President, fair trade is an issue not only in textiles, but also in energy.
Russia's energy-intensive industries are currently being supplied with oil at 8 dollars per barrel, and gas is available at a very competitive price.
With this in mind, how do you rate the chances for survival of our own energy-intensive industries, and what effect do you think this will have on Russia's accession to the WTO?
Member of the Commission. That is an intriguing question, one which certainly goes far wider than, and indeed probably almost entirely steps outside, the scope of the original question put to me.
Nonetheless it is fascinating.
I believe that the best way of improving, strengthening, deepening, making more satisfactory the energy demand and supply relationship between Europe and Russia is, first of all, to press Russia to adopt other, more transparent policies of free transit that are governed by global trade rules.
I see no reason why energy goods should not be subject to global trade rules like any other good.
But I also believe that the best way to strengthen the energy relationship between Russia and the EU is by anchoring that energy relationship in a wider set of trade negotiations and agreements, the object of which would be to bring about integration of the Russian and European economies governed by fair and transparent market rules and agreed norms and standards.
It is in that context that I look forward to pursuing this subject as part of the wider trade negotiations that I hope will open up following Russia's accession to the WTO.
Commissioner, one of the many obstacles to the development of Fair Trade is the occasional attempt by other countries to dump products within Europe on a below-cost basis, of which shoes was but the latest example.
My question is not about how right or wrong the shoes decision is; it is about the process by which that decision is taken.
I understand that 12 countries voted against, 9 voted in favour and there were 4 abstentions.
Could you please comment on the logic of that process, Commissioner?
Member of the Commission. On 5 September 2006, I gave a full and comprehensive statement to Parliament on the state of play of the Doha Development Agenda.
I am sorry to say that no major progress has been achieved since then; the negotiations remain suspended.
However, it is important to note that since then, be it at the G-20 meeting in Rio, which I attended, or the Cairns Group meeting in Australia, where I was represented - both in September - all key players in the talks have reiterated their commitment to the Round and their willingness to resume negotiations as soon as the political circumstances allow.
However, it will take more than that to get the DDA back on track.
All sides will have to show flexibility and realism and make offers that represent real efforts in all areas of the negotiations.
There is a narrow window of opportunity for resuming the talks between the United States mid-term elections on 7 November and early in the spring of 2007, when the US Congress starts working on a new farm bill.
I visited Washington at the end of September to explore the US position on the DDA, to probe US congressional politics on the subject and to explain our position.
I met with policymakers in the Administration, with a number of key law-makers on the Hill, and with constituencies like the National Farm Bureau and the National Association of Manufacturers.
The political situation in the United States is difficult.
However, I was encouraged by my contacts with the Administration, where I sensed a genuine willingness to conclude the Round during President Bush's tenure, although this will require the use of considerable political capital, even to get Congressional extension of the President's Trade Promotion Authority.
So in the coming weeks our strategy must be to clarify the political conditions for renewing the talks and prepare the ground for movement - short of new offers.
Our sights also remain firmly set on preserving the development issues, at this stage in the context of the Single Undertaking.
If the DDA fails, or if the suspension is extended for too long a period of time, my firm judgement is that we run serious economic and political risks.
There remains a lot on offer in the DDA in terms of agricultural subsidy reduction, tariff reductions for agricultural and industrial products, improved rules and development; and hence a great deal to lose if the talks fail.
We should not underestimate the broader systemic implications of failure for the multilateral system at large.
The DDA should therefore remain our main focus of attention - as it will - and the EU is willing and prepared to go back to the WTO negotiating table as soon as realistically possible.
I have often said to you in this House that 5% of world trade is agricultural trade and the 95% is being blocked by the 5% at fair trade talks.
Is it not time to remove the blockage?
Is it not time, Commissioner, to get on with the vast bulk of world trade and deal with agriculture on a separate level?
If you concede more on European agriculture, you will have broken the agreement that the Member States have made on agricultural subsidies and agricultural support.
So is it not time to deal with the vast bulk of world trade and leave agriculture aside?
Member of the Commission. I do not accept that point of view, because I believe that we have a clear obligation, for objective reasons and because it was in the original Doha mandate, to bring about a negotiated and agreed restructuring of agricultural trade.
We are obliged to do that because reform of agriculture has lagged behind the progressive changes that have swept through the rest of the international trading system, with that benign and beneficial impact on industrial tariffs.
But in the case of agriculture you have, exceptionally, a system of agricultural support and in some cases export subsidies which has been very trade-distorting.
As a result of our reforms in Europe we are curing ourselves of the trade-distorting impact of our agricultural support mechanisms.
That is not the case, notably, in the United States.
I believe it is important that we do not say goodbye to this round without exhausting every possibility of bringing about the progressive reform in agricultural support and trade that will be of great benefit to developing countries.
Commissioner, are you concerned that the plethora of bilateral trade agreements - and I do not just mean EU bilateral trade agreements - that is growing up at the moment is a threat to getting the WTO talks back on track?
Member of the Commission. I do not think it is a threat, but I acknowledge the risk of a diversion of energy and negotiating capacity.
There are always choices to be made by different countries and negotiators as to what form of negotiation they prioritise - the multilateral or the bilateral.
But I am entirely satisfied that, given the long-term nature of the negotiations we are entering into and the clear sequencing of the initiatives we intend to take, there are no circumstances in which I would permit our own negotiating effort and commitment to the WTO to be diminished or jeopardised by any pursuit of bilateral free trade agreements.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to make a comment and ask a question.
The insistence of third trading partners on agricultural negotiations continues to cause surprise, given the small volume of agricultural products traded globally.
Does the Commissioner think that the emerging economies are truly prepared to contribute to this round of negotiations with fundamental commitments to industrial products and services or do they simply envisage unilateral disarmament on the part of the developed countries?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Sweden is currently one of the eleven Member States with derogations in relation to adopting the single currency.
The Member States with derogations are obliged to adopt the euro as their currency, and to that end they must work towards meeting the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty.
Nevertheless, the Treaty does not set explicit time limits for the Member States to comply with that obligation.
In the 2004 convergence report, the Commission concluded that Sweden met the price stability criterion, the criterion relating to the public budget situation and the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates.
Nevertheless, in that same convergence report, the Commission concluded that Sweden did not meet the exchange rate criterion, which requires the country in question to have remained within the normal margins of fluctuation laid down in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System without any serious tensions and for at least two years prior to the assessment.
Furthermore, in the 2004 convergence report, the Commission pointed out that the Swedish legislation was not fully compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty.
In view of this assessment, the Commission concluded that there was no need to modify Sweden's status as a Member State with a derogation in this area.
In accordance with the Treaty, the Commission and the European Central Bank will publish the next convergence report before the end of this year.
The new Member States have committed themselves to adopting the euro as soon as they comply with the criteria laid down in the Treaty.
In this regard, Slovenia will enter the euro zone on 1 January 2007.
Cyprus and Malta wish to join on 1 January 2008 and Slovakia on 1 January 2009, and other Member States, which had previously set specific targets, are in the process of revising them.
In any event, as I said again at the beginning of my reply, with the exception of the two States with an opt-out clause - the United Kingdom and Denmark - the other Members of the European Union that have yet to adopt the single currency, and for which the derogation is in place, are obliged to adopt it and to work towards complying with the criteria, but there is no date by which they are obliged to have complied with them.
(DE) Mr President, there are two more, and quite specific, items of information that I would welcome.
The first is that I should like to know whether the Commission, when a Member State such as Sweden, without any arrangement being made for it in the Treaties, fails, for a period of years, to introduce the euro, will take legal action against it by, for example, taking it to the ECJ, or whether it will let the matter rest for another twenty years.
Secondly, I would like to know what is happening about Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.
Is there any sign of any of them - Hungary in particular - actually doing anything?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr Posselt, we must not confuse the Member States' obligation to prepare for adoption of the single currency with the actions that the Commission and the Council may take - and are taking in fact - in relation to Member States that are not complying with the provisions of the Treaty, in the field of budgetary discipline, for example, as in the case of Hungary and other Member States.
Preparations for adoption of the single currency relate to budgetary discipline, but also the stability of exchange rates and the development of interest rates, which is something decided upon by the markets according to the economic situation of the Member States.
They also involve legal reforms, bringing the status of the Central Bank of the Member State in question into line with the rules laid down in the Treaty for the European System of Central Banks, and they also relate to the development of inflation.
The factors for complying with the criteria for adoption of the single currency therefore depend partly on political decisions to be directly adopted by the governments or parliaments of the Member States, and partly on factors that are not always under the Member States' control.
Consequently, although it will theoretically be possible in the future to apply infringement procedures to States that are not making preparations, we do not currently believe it to be necessary or even desirable.
- (LT) Commissioner, if a wealthy and economically stable nation such as Sweden is unable to introduce the euro, I cannot but question the future of the euro zone project.
It is evident that most of the current euro zone members are failing to meet one or more of the Maastricht criteria.
For example, Lithuania has failed to meet the inflation criterion by 0.07%.
How do you think the euro zone will develop in the future?
According to some forecasts, the euro will disappear in 15 years.
What preventive measures should be taken?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mrs BudreikaitÄ, I do not believe that the future of the euro is in question.
Not at all.
A few years after its launch, in 1999, and five years after more than 300 million were able to carry it in their pockets for the first time in the form of coins and notes, the euro is now a reality which those who use it consider to be a success.
In my view, therefore, the issue is not whether the euro has a future; the question is whether the countries that are not preparing properly for the adoption of the euro are going to suffer the consequences in the future.
That is the real question.
Each time I have contact with the authorities of the countries that are to adopt the euro in the future but which do not yet comply with the criteria laid down in the Treaty, I urge them to adopt a credible and effective strategy for complying with those criteria and adopting the single currency.
For some years we have been enjoying abundant liquidity in the financial markets, interest rates are low and memories of monetary crises and volatile exchange rates are fading in Europe.
There is no guarantee, however, that those situations that we saw in the past, before the existence of the euro, are not going to re-emerge in the future.
Let us pray that they do not, but it could happen.
We have seen 311 million Europeans enjoy the advantages of having a common currency, and we have also seen all of the Member States of the European Union enjoy the advantages of the fact that twelve of them have adopted the single currency.
There are therefore more than enough reasons for the Member States that have yet to adopt the euro to be convinced that they must prepare and adopt economic policy decisions aimed at fulfilling these criteria and strengthening a currency which, seven years after its birth, is already the world's second largest currency.
(SV) In a referendum, the people of Sweden rejected participation in economic and monetary union by a broad majority.
Mr Posselt wants to ride roughshod over the result of a referendum.
To do so is incompatible with a democratic view of the world.
The Swedish economy has not been harmed by the fact that we are outside the single currency.
I call on the Commissioner to state that he fully supports the result of the Swedish referendum and to distance himself from Mr Posselt's deplorable and undemocratic view of the world.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr Paleckis, on signing the Accession Treaty, the ten Member States that joined the Union in May 2004 agreed to adopt the euro as soon as they complied with the necessary conditions.
These countries, and Sweden - which we have just discussed - are expected to implement policies in order to ensure compliance with those conditions.
Nevertheless, as I said in my previous reply, the Accession Treaty does not set any time limit for achieving this.
Many of the new Member States have adopted target dates and strategies for adopting the euro, thereby giving concrete form to their political commitment through firm convergence policies.
Responsibility for implementing those policies lies with the Member States, for which the application of stability policies contributes to a broader objective than simply compliance with the convergence criteria for adoption of the single currency.
Those policies are also necessary in order to guarantee high and sustained growth, as well as medium-term financial stability.
Although the Commission supports the efforts of the Member States with derogations with regard to joining the euro zone, it is not possible to predict the pace at which that enlargement of that zone will take place.
The Commission believes that achieving a high degree of sustainable convergence, in accordance with the Treaty, is a necessary condition in order to make the adoption of the euro a success, both for the current members of the zone, and for future members.
I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive answer.
You have recently been to Lithuania, which had an unhappy experience in its attempt to introduce the euro because its inflation was 0.07% above the target level.
In your opinion, would it be better for Lithuania in future to think about joining the euro alone or in the company of the two other Baltic States - Latvia and Estonia?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr Paleckis, when, during the first half of this year, Lithuania, at the same time as Slovenia, asked the Commission and the European Central Bank to issue an opinion on their degree of compliance with the criteria laid down in the Treaty for membership of the Monetary Union, the Commission's response, which was subsequently backed by the Council, was unfortunately negative in the case of Lithuania and positive in the case of Slovenia.
It was negative in the case of Lithuania because, at that time, that country did not comply with the inflation criterion.
You have talked about the difference that existed at a particular time between Lithuania's average inflation over the last twelve months and the reference value, calculated in accordance with the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, with regard to the maximum inflation permissible for acceptance as a new member of the eurozone.
It is true that the difference at that time was very small, less than 0.1%.
Now, unfortunately, a few months later, with the latest data available, which has been published by Eurostat for September's inflation, Lithuania's average inflation over the last twelve months differs from the reference value by 0.7%; over just a few months it has multiplied by seven.
As I was able to say to the Italian authorities on my recent visit to that country, the important thing now is not to discuss the small difference in the past; in my view, it is not even important to discuss firstly the date or conditions for entry.
The important thing at the moment for Lithuania, and for the other Member States that wish to join the euro as soon as possible, is to decide what economic strategy and what measures, within a coherent economic policy strategy, must be adopted and implemented in order to comply with the Treaty's criteria.
In view of the fact that average inflation in Lithuania has increasingly diverged from the maximum reference value, which currently stands at 2.8%, I urged the Lithuanian authorities to define that strategy and I once again offered the European Commission's cooperation in working jointly with the authorities of that Member State in the search for the best strategy, the most effective strategy, for bringing inflation under control without jeopardising Lithuania's excellent economic growth or the wonderful results that the Lithuanian economy has been achieving in many other respects.
I believe that that is not just the attitude of the European Commission, but also of all of the Member States that want Lithuania to comply with the conditions as soon as possible and become a new member of the euro zone, as Slovenia will on 1 January.
If Lithuania is accompanied by other Member States, the other Baltic States, then all the better.
We cannot change the conditions for assessing whether or not the Treaty's conditions are met, however, regardless of how much we want our assessment of compliance with those criteria to be positive.
Commissioner, you mentioned that Slovenia will be joining the eurozone on 1 January 2007, Malta and Cyprus in 2008, and Slovakia in 2009.
During your recent visit to Lithuania, did you propose a clear date when Lithuania might join the eurozone?
And have you already received an action plan from the Government, including the fight against corruption?
Member of the Commission. (ES) The only definite date is 1 January 2007 for Slovenia, although it is the case that, in June, the European Council supported the Commission's proposal and the Ecofin Council confirmed that Lithuania complies with almost all of the conditions for joining the euro zone.
I said in my reply that Cyprus and Malta want to be members of the euro zone from 1 January 2008, but the analysis and assessment of compliance with the criteria has yet to be made.
I also said in my reply that Slovakia wants to be a member of the euro zone from 1 January 2009, and at the appropriate time we will have to assess whether or not it meets the conditions.
In our next convergence report, which will be adopted by the Commission and presented to this Parliament in December, we shall assess the extent to which, at this precise moment, the derogation countries comply with the conditions.
Nevertheless, the Member State in question must comply with the conditions prior to the date on which it wishes to join the euro zone.
The Lithuanian authorities had a target date and they must now set a new date.
When I visited Lithuania in September, that date had not been decided upon.
As far as I know, they have not set a date since my visit.
I have insisted to the Lithuanian authorities, and to the authorities of other States in a similar position, that they have the strategy before the date, because, without a strategy, the dates decided upon will have to be modified over time, since the decision on the date, in itself, is not sufficient to satisfy the criteria that are going to be required.
Commissioner, I fully support what you say about candidate countries meeting the convergence criteria.
But do you accept that it is very frustrating for them to be struggling to meet those criteria and, at the same time, to see existing Member States of the eurozone systematically breaching their obligations?
I know you have raised this issue with the Council. But what efforts will you continue to make to ensure that existing eurozone Member States meet their legal requirements?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr Mitchell, the Commission does not expect the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union to have immediate effects on the composition of the euro zone.
Following their accession, on 1 January, both countries will take part in the Economic and Monetary Union as Member States, with derogations, and they will participate fully in the multilateral supervision of economic policies, as laid down in the Treaty, just like the Member States of the Union that do not belong to the euro zone.
From the date of their accession to the European Union, and since they will not be members of the euro zone and will not have an opt-out clause, Bulgaria and Romania will have to work towards complying with the convergence criteria with a view to being able to adopt the euro in the future.
For the other Member States of the euro zone, however, I cannot see any immediate effect whatsoever apart from the very positive fact that the Union will have two new Member States.
Thank you for taking the question.
I agree with the Commissioner that the euro has guaranteed transparency in pricing and facilitated travel and above all, having one currency has created a greater unity of purpose for Europeans than anything else we have done together.
All that is to be welcomed.
I understand that the European economy seems to be cooling, but is still expected to grow by 2.5% in 2006, its biggest growth since 2000.
That is to be applauded, but slowing global growth and increased interest rates mean that European economic growth might be hindered.
Can the Commissioner tell the House if he anticipates any more changes in economic growth after the impending enlargement and indicate what effect that will have?
Member of the Commission. (ES) Mr Mitchell, it is true that the euro zone, and the European Union as a whole, is also showing growth in 2006, and we are seeing the beginning of clear economic recovery.
Despite this economic recovery, however, we are still seeing growth figures that are lower than those expected when the economic and monetary union entered the third phase and, to a certain degree, some people are trying to establish a relationship between that low growth, compared to other areas of the world economy, and the existence of the single currency or the existence of the economic and monetary union itself.
I believe that the most rigorous analyses, not just those by the Commission, but also those by other institutions outside of the European Union, come to the conclusion, like us, that the obstacles to growth in Europe and, in particular, in the most significant economies of the eurozone, are basically, fundamentally, of a structural nature.
Hence, we must place the emphasis not only on respect for the operating rules and the rules on budgetary discipline or on the independence of the European Central Bank in the shaping of the economic and monetary union, but also on growth policies of a structural nature, which are what we call, in our jargon, the Lisbon Strategy policies.
It appears that what our economies need is a combination of healthy macroeconomic policies, geared toward stability, and ambitious structural reform policies.
From that point of view, enlargement, the arrival of ten new Members in May 2004, has been a spur, an incentive and a positive stimulus for the European economies as a whole.
A few months ago, in May 2006, coinciding with the second anniversary of the arrival of ten new Member States, the Commission published, under my responsibility, a communication on the economic consequences of enlargement.
Our assessment of the economic consequences of enlargement has been very positive; very positive for the new Member States and also for the old ones, for the European Union of fifteen, because, amongst other things, the new Member States are, generally speaking, showing a greater capacity for implementing structural reforms and making the necessary structural changes.
It is true that they are starting from a less advanced situation.
They have also introduced dynamism, positive pressure, which is also encouraging economies of the former European Union of fifteen to speed up the implementation of structural policies.
In fact, I believe that some of the positive impacts of structural reforms aimed at greater growth may be coming to light during this recovery phase.
It is still too soon to judge the extent to which the improvements in productivity being recorded during the first two quarters of this year are exclusively due to factors linked to the economic cycle.
The European Central Bank tends to put practically all of the increase in productivity recorded over recent quarters down to the economic cycle, but I believe that there are certain indications that the structural reforms that have been adopted over recent years and whose pace is beginning to speed up as a result of the positive impact of enlargement are also beginning to play a positive role in this improvement in productivity.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
"Youth in Action" programme (2007-2013) (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Council common position (06236/3/2006 C6-0273/2006 for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council creating the 'Youth in Action' programme for the period 2007-2013 (Rapporteur: Mrs GrÃ¶ner).
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the number of Members present in this plenary is certainly no indication of the importance of this issue, and the 'Youth in Action' programme for the period from 2007 to 2013 is certainly a milestone for our young European fellow-citizens.
I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their very constructive cooperation.
At first reading stage, we worked through 58 amendments, most of which found their way into the draft, and it is through this result of informal negotiations that we now arrive at the Common Position, which we are able to accept and on which we are able to agree at second reading.
Working both with and for young people aged between 15 and 18, the perhaps some 170 million citizens who are the European Union's primary concern, all three institutions have endeavoured to find a solution that makes Europe real for them, that helps to make the programme less bureaucratic and makes access to it easier for disadvantaged young people.
We have, with this programme, had a number of general objectives in mind.
First among them is the fostering of citizenship.
We want to make it easier for young people to work together as members of society while also offering them the opportunity to cooperate at European level, thereby, among other things, overcoming voter apathy and awakening in them an interest in politics.
Secondly, we want to promote solidarity and tolerance among young people, particularly as a means towards greater social cohesion in the EU.
In this way, it will be possible for young people, together, to develop new lifestyles and models of coexistence.
We want to promote mutual understanding between young people and the multicultural diversity that we in Europe treasure.
We also want to promote systems for supporting youth organisations and young people's civil society organisations and cohesion among young people even beyond Europe's borders.
It is with those purposes in mind that we have negotiated a budget of EUR 885 million.
In my capacity as rapporteur, I have proposed the submission of minimum budgets for the following five headings.
Of the funding available, 30% is to go to the traditional youth exchange 'Youth for Europe'.
The object of 'European Voluntary Service' is involvement, for a period of between two and twelve months, in non-profit-making activity for the common good in a country other than one's own, and this project is to receive 23% of the funds.
'Youth for the World' is a new project intended to awaken understanding of other peoples in a spirit of openness, which is very important at various levels, and to which 6% of overall resources are to be allocated.
The 'support systems for youth' are to receive at least 15%; by this is meant the European Youth Forum and the network of youth organisations and persons active in this field whom it supports.
It is intended that 4% of the funds should go to support European cooperation among young people, which would amount to the dividing up of 76% of the sectors, and that would offer the Commission sufficient flexibility to become more actively involved where necessary.
Facing up to challenges is the right approach.
We have the funds to support the special project 'European Youth Week', and we want the Pact for European Youth, concluded by the Council in 2005, to come alive.
It cannot be acceptable that we should look on and do nothing while disorder breaks out among young people and while young people in the European Union lack jobs and prospects.
We must ensure that young people have something to look forward to, and we want the Member States to give these projects their wholehearted support, for we cannot deal with the problem on our own.
I am therefore appealing to the Member States to get stuck in.
I recommend that this House agree to the compromise we have arrived at and adopt the Common Position unamended.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, it is not very often that we feel such a strong consensus as we do now.
I should like to express my gratitude to those who made it possible, as it is not automatic.
I am sure that this consensus makes it probable that in the coming weeks we will be able to adopt, in the full sense of the legal term, the Youth in Action Programme.
I should especially like to thank Mrs GrÃ¶ner, the rapporteur for the programme, as well as the Committee on Culture and Education, which dealt with matters in a very constructive manner during the procedure.
I extend my thanks to the committee and its chairman, Mr Sifunakis, for their support.
This consensus and progress in the work will allow full continuity between the current Youth Programme and the next one, so that there will be no interruption.
This is a very different case from the previous one seven years ago, when there was a significant suspension in the Youth Programme for several months.
The new programme is a partial but important response to the Union's priorities: citizenship, growth and peace.
Firstly, in terms of citizenship, it will enable young Europeans to affirm themselves as supportive, responsible, active and tolerant citizens in pluralist societies.
Getting young people more involved in the field and the life of local, national and European communities and fostering active citizenship represents an important challenge for our societies.
There is also a need to enhance young people's awareness of the fact that they belong to Europe and to develop their sense of European citizenship.
Secondly, it is equally necessary to respond to the aspirations of young people by providing them with the opportunity to enrich their education and training on a less formal level.
Non-formal educational activities deserve to be supported and recognised at European level because they contribute to European growth.
That is why I am very happy that we will have more space for voluntary service in Europe.
Lastly, young people's willingness to develop new relations between young Europeans and young people all over the world, their concern for mutual understanding, a spirit of tolerance and openness are important contributions towards world peace.
Progress in the negotiations on this programme was subject to the agreement on the financial perspectives last May.
Following the adoption of this budgetary framework and the decision to allocate EUR 885 million, at current prices, to the Youth in Action Programme, the institutions have shown their capacity to react quickly and constructively to have a new programme adopted without any further delay.
I believe that is a very strong message to young people sent by the European institutions today.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation in relation to the Common Position incorporates numerous amendments made by this House at first reading.
Although, as Mrs GrÃ¶ner has just said, the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 provides EUR 885 million for the 'Youth in Action' programme on the basis of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Financial Perspective for the same period, I would nevertheless like to remind the House that the amount envisaged in the Commission's original proposal was EUR 913 million, and, this House having demanded an increase to EUR 1.1 billion, we have now, in the Common Position, ended up with EUR 885 million.
While that may well not reflect what we aspired to, it does give us the security to plan ahead for the coming years, and it is good that we can adopt it in this form today or tomorrow.
'Youth in Action' is primarily aimed at young people between the ages of 15 and 28, although some projects are open to 13-year olds and 30-year olds.
My group is glad that this House has been able to take the initiative in highlighting such important aspects of the Common Position as, for example, young people's participation in democratic life, the promotion of such fundamental values as human dignity, human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, protection for participants by means of proper insurance - which is a very important consideration - the European Youth Weeks, seminars and structured dialogues involving young people, exchange schemes for young people in Europe and the neighbouring countries and, not least, EUR 2 million in financial support for the European Youth Forum.
While thanking Mrs GrÃ¶ner, I would also like to say that we hope that the unamended Common Position of the Council will meet with widespread support from this House tomorrow.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at times when we find ourselves debating the demographic challenges of the twenty-first century, the young people rioting in France and more and more people supporting nationalist parties, it is enormously important that young people be involved in working towards an understanding of other cultures and outlooks and thereby creating the conditions for greater solidarity in Europe.
In particular, young people who do not or cannot become mobile through programmes such as Erasmus, Comenius or Leonardo within the context of formal education need a change to gain useful experience of intercultural dialogue, and there needs to be more recognition of the role and importance of informal education in this respect.
I am convinced of the rightness of prioritising, within the programme, the 'Youth for Europe' project, which campaigns for youth exchanges and young people's initiatives.
We should also invite the European Youth Forum to make regular presentations on its work to the committee, so that all Members may learn from its valuable work and benefit from it.
A very wide variety of problems were raised in discussions with youth organisations, including the different procedures for the issue of visas and the failure to reflect on why those differences are there; my request is that young people be more involved in these.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to welcome Mrs GrÃ¶ner's report and the common position on which we have been able to agree.
I am glad that young people in the countries bordering the European Union - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the countries of the North Caucasus - will be able to benefit from the new programme as soon as next year.
European Union membership has a positive influence on many aspects of life in the Member States.
Young people, with their present and future challenges and problems, are no exception to this.
The 75 million young people who live in the European Union are lucky in many ways.
They have freedom of movement, opportunities to study and work in various European Union countries, to improve their foreign language skills, participate in intercultural exchange, and so on.
Nevertheless, the above advantages are at the same time also the challenges and tasks that are faced and need to be resolved by the increasingly ageing population of today's Europe.
My reference to an ageing Europe is not just incidental; it is a reference to the fact that we must be clearly aware and not underestimate the importance of young people; we must make every effort to actively involve them in the political and developmental processes of the European Union.
Implementation of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy is overemphasised as a factor of great importance to young people; we, nevertheless, must not forget that young people themselves play a very significant role in implementing these objectives.
Investing in young people is one of the cornerstones of pursuing more rapid development and increasing the level of employment in Europe.
It is, of course, very important for the Member States themselves to give the Council's recommendations proper support and take specific actions.
We know a great many examples of good programmes, and yet many of them have not been fully implemented.
This requires closer dialogue and cooperation between young people and politicians at both the national and European level.
We must treat young people as a source of positive energy, and not as a burden.
Our objective is to strengthen the trust of young people in the objectives of this important European institution and the Member States in order to eliminate any doubt as regards the broadly declared role of young people in the growth, development and stability of the European Union.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs GrÃ¶ner for the work she has done on this report.
All of us are convinced that Europe is meant to be an opportunity for young people to be able to move around freely within it, broadening their horizons and learning several languages, improving their education and training and, all in all, becoming trustworthy and responsible people in an open European society.
It is, of course, also important that Europe should gain acceptance among young people.
We need to remind ourselves that it will be the young people who will build Europe up and ensure its future development, in other words that what matters above all is that they should find out for themselves what they want Europe to become in future.
This task of improving opportunities for young people will not be capable of being performed in isolation from other policy areas, among which economic policy is quite central, as also are educational and social policy, together with the Lisbon Strategy issues to which reference has just been made.
I would very much like to see us taking this policy area seriously rather than neglecting it, for young people are the key to Europe's future.
- (SL) The 'Youth in Action' report is very important in strengthening European awareness and European citizenship amongst young people.
We all know that our citizens sometimes find it difficult to identify with the European dimension, and that European institutions far away in Brussels seem rather remote to them.
Through this report we have sought ways of making European citizenship more tangible by promoting solidarity, initiative and creativity.
Because young people are most receptive to new ideas, we have focused on young people between 13 and 30 years of age.
Young people are increasingly taking responsible positions in politics, and it is right that we should secure for them the tools and conditions which will also direct their attention towards Europe's common objective.
Of the five actions envisaged by this programme, let me highlight the second: 'European Voluntary Service'.
Voluntary work is of great importance for the development and future of society.
It contributes to the development of existing systems, cohesive values, social progress and other developments in society, and therefore needs to be promoted and given due recognition.
Young people active in this area set a shining example thereby, especially to a consumer society which is far too preoccupied with money and personal fulfilment, yet all too little concerned about people around us whose lives could be vastly improved with just a little bit of effort.
Politics is also a kind of voluntary work, at least when you are starting out.
When most of us were young, voluntary work was the quickest route into politics.
I support this report and I hope that young people will be able to benefit as much as possible from aspiring to and meeting the ideals contained within it, for the sake of their own personal growth and the benefit of society.
Mr President, firstly, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs GrÃ¶ner, for her excellent work on this report.
I am sure we all agree that young people are vital to shaping the future of Europe.
I do not believe that we should concentrate on debating whether young people should be supported through EU programmes.
There is clear evidence that programmes for young people and students are the best path of EU action for true integration at the citizen level.
Nevertheless I should like to raise a few points.
First of all, the budget allocated for the programme still seems to be insufficient.
I know the hard work the Commissioner has done, but I still hope that in the final budget for the future years we could see improved numbers.
Secondly, I strongly support lowering the age to 13.
Providing opportunities at a young age encourages initiative in later years.
I do not think that 13 is too young to participate in 'Youth in Action'.
Something else that would enhance the programme is the expansion of the list of countries with which youth organisations can cooperate, to include as many countries as possible.
Countries such as China and Russia are key players in world politics and economics.
Forming close ties with those countries at an early age can only be beneficial.
Another factor to consider is the importance of enhanced mobility.
It would be a vital step to ease the current visa regulations in countries outside the Schengen Agreement.
Far too often student exchanges, 'work abroad' programmes and school trips have to be cancelled because of the difficulty in obtaining visas.
Sometimes the complicated procedures and high prices even discourage starting a project.
To ease that situation I call for standardised documentation in all EU countries for obtaining visas.
We should also try to support the 'Get Visible' campaign, which suggests a separate visa type for NGO representatives.
That would significantly enhance the possibility of young people participating in volunteer work programmes, exchange programmes and youth organisation work.
The Youth in Action Programme will end in 2013.
It would be short-sighted of me to say that that will be time enough.
However, it is a good start.
I truly thank you, Commissioner, for all your hard work on this issue.
Member of the Commission. (SK) I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate, which will continue, in a somewhat different way, during subsequent phases, especially when it comes to implementing the programme.
I think the consensus is evident.
I do not want to speak or respond at length, but I consider it very important that the intensity and level of cooperation and commitment regarding young people in the EU is growing, not only in response to demographic issues but also in response to the overall prospects for European cooperation, solidarity and integration.
The European Pact for Youth was adopted recently, several years after the White Paper.
We now have a chance to launch a new programme for young people that would provide improvements in terms of both quantity and quality.
This is very important because, among other things, the age bracket has been widened and the budget has grown significantly.
Naturally, we have proposed more, but this issue should also be viewed in terms of the limits and scope of the financial perspective.
In addition, the programme of life-long learning and the programme of citizenship or civic cooperation, along with certain external programmes and actions of the Community, clearly offer increasing opportunities for young people.
For example, I have been in Canada, working on a bilateral agreement between the EU and Canada that will cover not only university cooperation but also the area of young people.
These specific lines of cooperation with partnership countries in the area of young people are multiplying and growing.
I firmly believe that they will bear fruit.
Thirdly, it is very important not just to formulate policies for young people, but to do it together with young people, as this will be more effective, more successful and more mature in terms of civil society in the common Europe of the future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Annex - Commission statement
The Commission should like to draw the legislative authority's attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act to be expressed at current prices, and for this to be done no later than its final publication in the OJ.
This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure, with all due transparency, that the legislative authority's decision is complied with.
For the Youth in Action programme, the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 885 million.
Action programme in the field of lifelong learning (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Council common position (06237/3/2006 C6-0274/2006 establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning. (Rapporteur: Mrs Pack).
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the new 'lifelong learning' programme was intended to be a sufficient response, within the framework of the Lisbon process, to the challenges of the present day, for education - as we all, together with everyone else, constantly affirm - is the be-all and end-all of our countries' joint efforts at coming out top in globalised competition.
The Council's cuts in the general budget have also had the unfortunate effect of cutting this multi-annual programme back.
The Commissioner has had no hand in these cutbacks.
He was on our side, fighting for more.
It is regrettable that the Member States did not want that.
The final figure we arrived at was EUR 14.37 billion over seven years, but, following negotiations, we have been left with no more and no less than EUR 6.97 billion in the Financial Perspective.
Even so, I want to thank all those Members who fought successfully and made it possible for us, together, to achieve a EUR 800 million increase in the funds originally allocated to this programme in the Financial Perspective.
So much for the lofty goals and the bumpy return to earth.
The 'lifelong learning' programme is founded on the two programmes 'Socrates' and 'Leonardo', develops them further and enables working in synergy.
We have learned from the latest programmes; our countries' various national agencies have acquainted us with the problems that they had with the programmes, and their views have all, in fact, been taken into account.
The 'lifelong learning' programme includes the 'Comenius' programme for schools, its university counterpart 'Erasmus', the 'Leonardo' programme for vocational education and the 'Grundvigh' for adults, the 'Jean Monnet' schemes for promoting European integration and horizontal measures.
I have pushed for more funds than originally planned by the Commission to be allocated to the Comenius programme on the grounds that it is, in my view, the basis for all the other educational programmes, and I have also emphasised the need for more cooperation in the border regions through a new 'Comenius Regio'.
The programme puts new emphasis on student mobility between the ages of 11 and 16, with the invaluable experience of a school year spent at a school elsewhere in the EU.
We have also taken account in it of the needs of the children of migratory workers.
The Leonardo programme promotes workers' mobility and partnerships in ways that were formerly possible only through Erasmus.
Grants payable under Erasmus to university students are being increased to EUR 200 per month, since the former grant was scarcely enough to live on; we had originally proposed EUR 300, but that could have been sustained only by a drastic reduction in the number of participants, and so we had to abandon the idea.
Erasmus also covers preparatory language courses and travel grants.
Better financial provision than before has been made for the Grundvigh programme, under which individual exchanges are now available.
The programme is conceived as a response to the current state of the labour market and to population trends.
Whilst continuing to make grants to the College of Europe in Bruges, the European University Institute in Florence, the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht and the European Law Academy in Trier, Parliament has also made provision for special grants to the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education, Middelfart, and the Centre Internationale de la Formation EuropÃ©enne in Nice.
I am absolutely delighted that participation in these programmes is still open to all members of the EEA and to Switzerland and Turkey, and that the countries of the Western Balkans have recently been invited to join in; that leads me to highlight the fact that it is now high time, to say the least, that the easier visa arrangement for South-Eastern Europe took tangible form.
I would like to sum up by saying that the 'lifelong learning' programme will help improve the EU's educational and training programmes, make people more mobile, support partnerships and cooperative efforts between regions, structure the sharing of best practice and encourage the learning of foreign languages.
This is a programme that will help people gain a better understanding of the European Union, make it easier for them to live together in it and practice intercultural dialogue and tolerance; it is, in fact the best communications strategy in the EU.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, as our German friends say, Bildung ist mehr - education is more.
It is a key to many more answers in life than are possible without education, and it empowers individuals and societies to seek a better economic, social, cultural and political future; and that is why I am sure that an integrated lifelong learning programme could provide many new opportunities in quantitative and qualitative terms, because when we see it in combination with what we are doing in Europe all together, it means much more than just a programme.
We are agreeing to create the lifelong learning strategies in Member States by the end of this year.
We have a programme from January 2007, and we have a benchmark in our cooperation, in order to increase the participation of adults in the lifelong learning systems in Member States.
As Mrs Pack said, lifelong learning is not a luxury, it is a necessity; and I am sure that it gives individuals experiences which enrich their lives and improve their employability.
Learning helps institutions to transfer knowledge from one to another across Europe, to innovate, to improve and to modernise.
It increases the transparency of Member States' systems, because when cooperation is open, we see how systems are moving and becoming more and more compatible.
In short, it is a valuable European instrument at the direct service of our citizens.
The new programme will expand opportunities and will, I am sure, bring even more benefits.
So I am delighted that Parliament, the Council and the Commission were able, almost as soon as the financial framework was finalised earlier this year, to reach agreement on the text of the programme decision.
I know it was not easy, but if Parliament adopts it without amendment, as your rapporteur proposes, then the programme can be implemented on time from the start of 2007.
Given the complexity of the programme, that is a major achievement.
If we compare the past with the current complex programme, we can see the hard work that has been done.
I would like to extend particular thanks to Mrs Pack, the rapporteur, for using her great expertise and experience in the field to make it possible to reach an agreement so rapidly at second reading.
On the text itself, the Commission is fully in agreement that it should not be amended.
The financial envelope will be close to EUR 7 billion for seven years at current prices.
But we should also see it in broader terms, where opportunities are growing.
I do not want to go into details, but I frequently encourage ministers to look into structural funds to see how they could serve the mobility of students; how other programmes like Erasmus Mundus could also help to build a more attractive European educational space.
Our services have been working at full speed to have the implementation arrangements in place so that we can publish the first call for proposals under the lifelong learning programme before the end of this year, and to ensure that the programme is more accessible and simpler for the end user.
Thank you for providing the possibility of enabling us to be so advanced at this moment.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, it is, of course, a good thing that we can give the green light to these important learning programmes, for, as you so rightly say, Bildung ist mehr, education is more.
Nevertheless, I, like the rapporteur, have mixed feelings.
As Mrs Pack said before me, I would argue that the Member States should never have cut back on these programmes - not as drastically, at any rate, as has now been the case.
These are programmes that can help us make young people into European citizens, the Europeans of the future.
Why ever have we been so brutal in the cutbacks for those programmes?
That is extremely short-sighted and in any event a missed opportunity for the EU's future.
I think that the Member States have given a perfect illustration of how to queer one's own pitch.
I am sure that the Commissioner will agree with me when I say that every Erasmus student, every Comenius student - and I have met a huge number over the years - every student ends up having a life-forming experience.
It broadens their horizons, improves their chances of employment, brings them into contact with others, they experience diversity and learn how to deal with it.
In that way, these programmes also contribute to tolerance and, needless to say, to European citizenship.
This House should, in actual fact, have thrown out this limited budget, but that is a different matter, of course.
It should have done that not least with social reasons in mind, for quite a few students who come from more socially vulnerable environments and backgrounds will now find it much more difficult to take part in Erasmus.
There is no point, though, as somebody already said, in regretting past actions.
It is too late for that.
We now have to pull out all the stops to make the most of what we have.
I think that schools are sufficiently creative in seeking, and finding, additional sources of income to fund those programmes.
Industry, possibly backed by the European Union or national governments, may be able to help.
Why could businesses not sponsor exchange projects?
A factory that is local to me - Ford - could, for example, invite final-year pupils or students for visits to their sister factories in different countries across the border.
It is just a thought, but there may be some scope there.
It is crucially important that we promote the exchange of students and schools to the best of our ability.
I would, at this early stage, express the hope that the Council and the Member States will realise that cutbacks on the forthcoming multi-annual programme are bound to leave their mark on programmes like these, and I wish you, Commissioner, the very best in your endeavours to implement the next programme 2007-2013.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that we are making today a really big day for culture, with five very major programmes for us to debate and also vote on, which is not the sort of thing that happens very often in this House.
It does, however, highlight the importance and necessity of getting programmes of this kind up and running.
Taken all together, little more than one per cent of the total European Budget for 2007 to 2013 is available to us for all five programmes - education, youth, culture, media and active citizenship - and that puts everything back into perspective and also brings us down to earth a bit.
I would like to say that these are ambitious programmes, and we certainly could have done with more financial support for them; as has already been said, we had all planned something bigger, and it is the Member States that are standing in the way.
In general terms, though, I do believe that the 'lifelong learning' programme is aimed in the right direction, with simplification, lump sums and more decentralisation in line with what we demanded.
Expenditure must be proportionate to financial support, and building in the other EU support programmes on a horizontal basis would have been something else worth aiming for, but I would also appeal to the Commission for things to be made simpler for the national agencies and for the applicants too.
The national agencies are in the course of being restructured, and this process will certainly take up more time yet, but here, too, dialogue and support from the Commission are called for.
We, too, should apply ourselves more to dialogue, for there are still a number of problems left to be resolved.
It is to be hoped that the trend towards increasing mobility will continue, for we have set ourselves the target of three million students by 2012, and so we must make further strenuous efforts and demand many improvements.
The school systems also need to be analysed in terms of quality, which needs to be guaranteed not only by the EU, but also by the Member States, and we have to demand that they do that.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Pack for an excellent report.
Lifelong learning is an integral part of any modern and developing society, since the wellbeing of the nation is based on the education, experience and skill that its population acquires.
In many cases the level of literacy and education determines a person's health and wellbeing, as well as being a source of income and providing better opportunities for participation in social, political and cultural life.
At the moment, adult education, training and the professional development of working people are becoming increasingly important in Lithuania, just as they are in the European Union as a whole, although it has not yet become a hard and fast rule.
Unfortunately, according to 2004 data, our country is lagging far behind the EU average in terms of continuing education of people in the age range of 24-65 years - 28% in Lithuania as opposed to 42% in the European Union.
Many of the residents of our country agree that the main reasons motivating people to study are constantly growing labour market requirements and better self-improvement and self-expression opportunities; however, for half of our citizens their age has become a barrier, as they believe they are too old to study.
Lithuania still holds on to a negative attitude towards older people pursuing knowledge.
In some cases, in fact, particular social groups are being discriminated against.
In fact, the attitude that only a competent employee is able to achieve good results, contribute to the competitive advantage of the company and, most importantly, to gain a feeling of personal value and self-confidence, is already becoming dominant.
However, it is generally public institutions rather than private employers, who pay most attention to the training of their employees.
This is a huge problem, since private companies employ almost 70% of all workers.
Constantly developing technologies and competitive challenges call for qualified employees, and this must be an on-going process.
Consequently, funding becomes an extremely important issue.
I believe that this programme and the aid from the European Union Structural Funds will help in reducing the present differences between the various Member States and the lifelong learning strategy will actually be implemented.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I, too, will start by thanking Mrs Pack for the superb job she has done with this report.
That she is one of this House's really experienced experts on educational policy has already been mentioned, and that is evident from the priorities and emphases that she has added to this report.
Europe is lacking in raw materials - that much is a fact - and so it is all the more important that we should develop the potential in the people who live here.
The growth achieved by both China and India is extraordinary, and so is the number of graduates they produce.
If Europe is to stand a chance in the globalised economy, we have to do more for education, research and development.
I do not actually think that the European budget is focussed on the future; we are still investing too much in traditional agricultural polices and too little in education, development and research.
Previous speakers have already lamented the fact that we are, in this area, budgeting for too little overall, with the derisory figure of one per cent over the next seven years.
I find that very disappointing; I really would have liked to see more.
We should be aiming at enabling every student in Europe to participate in the Erasmus programme, which represents the big opportunity for young people, for the experience of studying in different Member States will make real Europeans of them; they will derive lifelong benefit from what they learn there and, of course, carry it over into their circles of friends and acquaintances and into working life.
That is what makes these experiences so very valuable, not only to them as individuals, but also to society.
EUR 200 is, of course, preferable to EUR 150, but it is not exactly what we could do with if we are to have a pro-active education policy.
I do, though, think Mrs Pack was right to say that we should start with the young and invest more in them.
All the studies show that to be the case.
That is why spending more on Comenius, within the context of lifelong learning, is the right thing to do.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome Mrs Pack's multi-layered approach to drawing up this report.
I should like to highlight just a few aspects of the issue.
One of the dangers of the modern world is that people are unable to adapt dynamically because of the narrowly focused and overly specialised nature of education, which gives them a limited worldview and stops them from achieving their potential in the labour market.
The world has changed such a great deal that the traditional ideas of getting an education once and once only, guaranteeing long-term employment and continuous progress until retirement, has gone for good.
