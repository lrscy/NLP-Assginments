There is no getting around that fact.
Â Â  Mr President, listening to this debate I am reminded of Bertolt Brechtâs lines:
â â - Would it not be easier for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?
The peoples of two core founding States have thrown your projects out, my friends.
I know it is hard to accept rejection, but look at the figures: 55% of French voters; 62% of Dutch voters.
You might try to argue that the voters have got it wrong; that they are suffering from what Marxists used to call false consciousness; that they need better propaganda; that it is up to us â the Euro-elite â to point them in the right direction. To which I say, âDo your damnedestâ.
Current polls in the Netherlands show that 82% of Dutch voters would now vote ânoâ â a tribute to the level-headedness of that brave people.
But if you think you can turn them around, dear colleagues, be my guests.
Doing so would at least prove your commitment to the democratic ideals you so frequently invoke.
Far more outrageous would be to push ahead with the implementation of the Constitution â or, at least, of its contents â without popular consent.
Yet this is precisely what you are doing.
Look at the number of policies and institutions envisaged by the Constitution that have been or are being enacted regardless: the European External Action Service, the European Human Rights Agency, the European Defence Agency, the European Space Programme, the European External Borders Agency, a justiciable Charter of Fundamental Rights: none of these has any proper legal basis outside the Constitution.
By adopting them anyway, you demonstrate that you will allow no force â internal or external, neither your own rule book nor the expressed opposition of your peoples in the ballot box â to arrest the rush to political assimilation.
In doing so, you vindicate the severest of your opponentsâ criticisms.
In the words of my countryman Oliver Cromwell âI beseech you in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistakenâ.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the resolution we are currently debating is a sound and appropriately balanced compromise document.
In addition, it was dealt with in record time.
It links in very well with the Austrian Presidencyâs priorities presented to us today and also with the Finnish Presidency and the future German Presidency.
This means that despite the doubts and reluctance expressed, the Constitution has certainly not been discarded.
It is not a thing of the past.
On the contrary, it continues to feature prominently on our agendas.
As a result of the French and Dutch ânoâ votes, the Constitution remains very much alive because we are continuing to debate it.
All Europeans need to find an answer to the question as to the kind of Europe they want.
By way of this resolution, Parliament is calling on all European citizens to engage in a far-reaching discussion of the question to which I just referred.
It is also calling on all national parliaments and governments to state what their expectations are.
We should be saying to the governments of the nine Member States which have not yet ratified the Constitution that since their Prime Ministers signed the document, they ought to commence ratification proceedings because it is their right and duty to do so under international law.
It is a duty pursuant to the Convention on the Law of Treaties.
I should like to add one final comment.
A countryâs approach to the European Constitution is not simply a test of its will to help build a common Europe.
It is also a test of that countryâs credibility as a partner in international relations.
Â Â  â Mr President, Parliament has today kicked off a major debate.
Political institutions and social actors, along with the media, will take on the responsibility of addressing the following question: does Europe want to secure the future?
The constitution issue is not a simple matter of the architecture of the institutions.
It is more about the way in which Europe ensures that its institutions act in accordance with a moral awareness of the world.
All of us, citizens of Europe, in the corridors of power, on the Unionâs front line, feel the weight of this challenge.
How can we govern such a huge and open cosmopolitan area?
How can we realise a project of justice that lies both inside and outside Europeâs boundaries?
How can we build a way of life not based on tradition?
How can we turn Europe into a democratic power and founder of a new world order?
How, as a union of different communities, can we be a role model?
How can we find a way, together, of protecting human rights around the world?
How can we find a way, together, of influencing the world?
How can we return to politics its legislative power over a globalised and deregulated economy?
How can we connect justice with efficiency?
How can we open the doors to new political models?
The future allows us no room for fear.
We have an urgent need to discuss political integration, to discuss the introduction of a cosmopolitan and more human way of life, to discuss the extent to which the Constitution itself represents and constructs our European identity.
After all, our European identity was not born out of tradition, but out of morality, desire and reason.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a real risk that the European project may collapse, and we have the evidence for it.
To build or rebuild the peopleâs trust we need vision, effective policies and means, and the means include financial resources and the institutions.
I believe that we, as Parliament, must not abandon the prospect of the Constitutional Treaty.
As for the diatribe about the current text, I think Parliament must defend everything that has been gained through it.
Will the debate be able to move on?
I do not think it will be easy but, quite frankly, I am not going to rule out that path, either.
Moreover, as has already been emphasised, I should like us to take that path in close collaboration with the national parliaments, since the way the debate on the subject has been conducted, particularly by European governments, has, in my view, been neither thorough nor correct.
I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having at last partly resurrected the debate.
Let us hope that from now on the various institutions can be more in tune with each other.
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall not repeat the arguments heard today from the rapporteurs and other speakers about the Constitution.
Nor shall I refer to the detailed, extensive and exhaustive discussions held last year; I shall refer to the dialogue to which they refer.
I wish to express the opinion that the dialogue which we need to hold must revolve not around the Constitution but around the existential problems of the European Union, which are: firstly, the degree to which the European Union is still necessary; secondly, if the European Union is necessary, what type of European Union do we want and, thirdly, how enlarged a European Union do we want.
If there is no common answer to these existential questions at the level of both policies and citizens, I greatly fear that no form of Constitution for Europe will ever be acceptable to the citizens of Europe.
If and insofar as we in the European Union believe that it needs to be unified and strengthened, then our challenge is to convince the citizens also of the correctness of this way forward.
Confidence and faith in the European vision are the basis of the universal consent of states and citizens to constitutional arrangements for the functioning of the European Union.
If the citizens of the European states do not realise the importance to mankind of the existence and further unification and strengthening of the European Union, then I predict that no constitutional proposal will be accepted in future.
That is why I believe that we should not waste any more time.
We need to build on what we have and what we have today is the Constitution.
That is what we need to work on and that is what we need to build on, because I greatly fear that any other effort we make to create an alternative will fail and will be a final failure which will be at the expense of the unification and progress of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, eight months after the rejection of the text of the Constitutional Treaty in the referenda held in France and the Netherlands, we are still in an interminable period of reflection on how to word it.
It is time we got to work.
What is this work?
In my opinion, it is not analysing ourselves in interminable discussions about the precise definition of the new social state, EU financing and so on.
If we believe that we shall find common ground between us on all these questions as a precondition to trying the Constitution again, I believe that we shall never have a European constitution.
On the contrary, in my opinion there should only be one final objective to this period of reflection.
Irrespective of each person's political convictions, we need to persuade ourselves that, for all these major European wagers, we can, as Europeans, address them better jointly than separately.
This is perhaps also the most important context which is missing for any text if it is to be acceptable to everyone.
Â Â  Mr President, I have no sympathy whatsoever with the idea of democracy espoused by certain critics of the EU, who usually dig themselves in behind their national flags and try to enlist other European citizens in their cause.
We are now hearing it said, over and over again, that 70Â % of Austrians do not want this constitution â an obvious reference to the latest Eurobarometer surveys and no more revealing than they are, combined with a flagrant disregard for the democratic rules and procedures that apply in Austria, my own country, where both houses of the countryâs Parliament have ratified the Constitution by massive majorities.
Some, however, attach greater weight to percentages in surveys than to the procedures required by constitutional law.
Nor do I have any sympathy with the adopted by those who already want to discuss alternatives, even before the ongoing ratification process is completed.
Those who are now calling for new alternatives are treating as worthless the decisions democratically reached in most of the Member States of the European Union.
More to the point, where are these alternatives?
In the Convention on the Future of Europe, we had long discussions on all of them; discussions about a more democratic Europe, a more social Union and so on. Over and over again, we came up with the same results.
Desirable though they might be, every improvement of that kind would end up producing more Europe, and a stronger Europe, and hence the very thing that most of the Member States and the people who live in them do not at present want â a continuing loss of power on the part of the nation states.
Let us then do what the majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed; let us try to inform the European public about what really is, and is not, in the 2004 Constitutional Treaty, and let us have a second run at getting a consensus in support of the best constitution currently on the market.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I found it a very interesting experience to take part in this debate and to follow the exchange of opinions.
A whole range of them have been expressed, but one thing that has been said does strike me as corresponding to the majority view in the Council, and that is that the European Union, at this present time, before we get a clearer view of the situation, should keep every realistic and reasonable option open, for what we have learned from our experiences over the past year is that quick, perhaps even premature or precipitate estimates of the situation get us nowhere in this debate.
I agree with Mr Leinen that the Presidency of the Council, at this stage of debate, would be ill-advised to try to pre-empt results, and would indeed risk doing damage were it to do that.
What we need now is a discussion.
Let me reiterate my gratitude to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to the rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, for initiating this debate.
The Presidency will respond to it.
We too believe that all the opinions voiced in this debate have to be respected.
As the Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m so aptly said, âwhat we want is a Europe for everyoneâ.
Building that Europe is a task that the Austrian Presidency of the Council, too, has set itself.
Together with the other Member States and in consultation with the other institutions, we will work on the road map to which reference was made earlier.
To the statement made today to the effect that the public are not interested in any debate about institutions, I would counter that this Europe of ours does, however, need the institutions and institutional structures that will enable it to do what its citizens expect of it.
I very much hope that what the President of the Council has said today will have made it plain that the Austrian Presidency of the Council is very definitely in earnest about addressing the problems that affect the European public and are of interest to them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I really have only two brief things to say.
The first is to quote MrÂ Brok who, at the beginning of the debate, said that the citizens are the stakeholders.
It is Europeâs citizens who are the most important target group and who have the most to gain or to lose from how we handle the issue of a new Constitutional Treaty for Europe.
The second is to say that democracy is no spectator sport.
It requires us to engage in debates and in a dialogue with people, to involve our political leaders and our citizens in every possible way and to help each other play our different roles in this connection.
Having so many times heard wry comments along the lines of âwhat is it in the ânoâ vote that you do not understandâ, I want to add that, in actual fact, opinion polls and interviews have told us precisely why people have come out in favour of, or voted against, the Constitutional Treaty.
It is not something we have invented.
We know that every referendum, the scope of which includes constitutional issues, involves a risk of oneâs in actual fact obtaining answers to questions that have not been asked.
That is something of which politicians in all our Member States are aware.
Nor is there anything particularly odd about the fact that 25 Member States engaging in a debate about how we are to rise to the constitutional challenge posed by a Europe whose membership has grown from 15 to 25 countries should, in actual fact, wonder how we are to extricate ourselves from a situation in which two Member States have rejected the Constitutional Treaty while 14 have approved it.
How do we deal with that situation?
Are we now simply to bring the process to an end, or is there a way out of the situation?
There is nothing odd about these reflections.
You are making things rather too easy for yourselves.
What is most interesting is that those who represent UKIP (the UK Independence Party) and call this Assembly a sham parliament appear to be all too happy not to contribute a single constructive idea of their own and to let European taxpayers pay their salaries as Members of that sham parliament.
I think we need, in actual fact, to buck up our ideas and conduct an intellectually honest debate about the issues concerning Europe.
We know a very great deal, and there is no short cut.
However much you may laugh, all we can do is engage in debate and dialogue with people and to discuss factual matters before linking them to the constitutional solutions that are necessary if we are to obtain a more open, more democratic and more efficient Europe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12Â noon.
Â Â  It is easy to see the speck in your brother's eye, but not so easy to see the plank in your own.
The same people who yesterday denounced the unbelievable denial of parliamentary democracy that led the Commission in Brussels to re-present its directive on port services when it had been rejected, are today prepared to adopt a report which, even more seriously, is a denial of popular democracy.
The European Constitution has been rejected by two of the founding members of the European Union, the Netherlands and France.
In the opinion of all the independent observers, the people's decision was a well-informed one.
They did not just vote according to a context, they voted against the text.
Ten Member States have not yet expressed an opinion and several of their leaders do not think they will do so.
This is because the Constitution, according to the law and according to the text itself, cannot enter into force, because several of the signatory states have refused to ratify it.
It is dead.
All this Parliament proposes to do, though, is to consider the best way to serve the same dishes, in the same words, to the citizens, and to brainwash them with propaganda campaigns, with the connivance of the media.
This is scandalous and unacceptable.
Â Â  I cannot support this report.
The text fails to recognise that the Constitutional Treaty has been rejected by electors in two Member States.
Undoubtedly if given the opportunity of a referendum, other rejections would also be delivered.
The two rapporteurs want to somehow revive the core of the current, rejected, text.
This does not seem to me to be credible.
How can French and Dutch voters be expected to accept such arrogance.
We are in a so-called period of reflection, let us make it a period in which to rethink, replace, and not just regurgitate a document which has already been resoundingly rejected.
Â Â  On behalf of Parliament, I would like to welcome Paavo Lipponen, President of the Finnish Parliament, and his delegation.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Chechnya after the elections and civil society in Russia.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the conflict in Chechnya is still a source of instability in the northern Caucasus.
The political, economic, social and human rights situation in this Caucasus republic continues to be extremely unsatisfactory and a real cause for concern.
All of the European Union's institutions are well aware of how important this matter is in our relations with the Russian Federation.
As you know, Chechnya held parliamentary elections on 28 November last year, its first legislative elections in eight years.
Unfortunately, the European Union and the OSCE were unable to send observers to these elections for security reasons.
However, the simple fact that, for the first time in eight years, it was possible to hold parliamentary elections in Chechnya was viewed by the then Presidency as a positive step, even though, it must be emphasised, there were some serious problems.
The European Union helped to train local observers for these elections, and the Commission provided aid amounting to EURÂ 60Â 000 to support objective and professional local election observers from various civil society organisations.
Immediately after the elections, the then EU Presidency issued a statement noting that the elections had not been problem-free and that some observers had raised concerns.
It strongly urged the Russian authorities to investigate reports of irregularities or intimidation.
The statement concluded that the further strengthening of democratic institutions, as part of an inclusive political process, is essential for the sustainable and peaceful long-term development of Chechnya as well as for peace and stability in the northern Caucasus as a whole.
The European Union has frequently raised serious concerns regarding the political process in Chechnya and continues to strongly urge the Russian authorities to give this political process greater transparency and legitimacy.
Issues of human rights and democracy are regularly and repeatedly raised in the context of relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation.
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, in laying the basis for relations between the EU and Russia, refers to respect for shared values such as democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
Chechnya is an important topic in the twice-yearly human rights consultations with Russia, which were officially launched in MarchÂ 2005 under the Luxembourg Presidency.
The EU makes a particular point of using these consultations to express its concerns regarding the disappearance of people and the general failure to punish violations of human rights.
The most recent round of these extremely important consultations was held in Brussels on 8 September 2005 and they will be continued this year under the Austrian Presidency.
We need the European Union and its Member States to make a sustained commitment here, as these consultations provide a forum where such issues can be discussed very openly and constructively.
Following the outbreak of the second Chechnya conflict in September 1999, the European Union has taken and maintained a clear position on the issue of respect for human rights.
The EU continues to advocate a political solution to the conflict, and has called on the Russian Federation to work closely with international human rights mechanisms, in particular with the United Nations and its special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and also with the Council of Europe, particularly the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and of course with the OSCE.
A resumption of the permanent presence of the OSCE, in the form of a field mission in Chechnya, would in any case be welcomed.
The OSCE has already played an extremely important role in the efforts to find a solution to the first conflict in Chechnya, and a comparable role would also be of great significance this time.
At the EU-Russia Summit in November 2004, Russia agreed to the European Commission's EURÂ 20Â million aid programme to support socio-economic recovery in the northern Caucasus, in addition to continuing humanitarian aid.
This programme is intended to contribute to promoting an open and democratic political process in Chechnya.
With regard to civil society, the situations of non-governmental organisations and human rights activists, judicial reform and freedom of the media in Russia are areas that give particular cause for concern and that are regularly raised in discussions between the EU and Russian representatives.
The EU is firmly convinced that it is in Russia's interest to have a strong and independent civil society.
At the end of December 2005, the Duma and the Federation Council adopted the draft law on non-governmental organisations.
The EU has repeatedly expressed its concern at this draft, notably in its letter of 22Â NovemberÂ 2005 to the Speaker of the Duma, MrÂ Gryzlov, and at a troika dÃ©marche on 2Â DecemberÂ 2005.
I also expect that we will make our feelings known once again on this matter now that the law has been signed.
According to the draft as it stands, foreign NGOs must provide the Russian authorities with reports on their programmes, funding and organisation.
Russian NGOs may be prohibited from working in restricted areas, which of course severely limits their activities in sensitive areas and regions, or even makes them impossible.
Russia's Presidency of the G8, since 1Â JanuaryÂ 2006, was expected not only to give the country an incentive to improve its image on the international stage, but also to help it make more active and sustained efforts than previously to resolve the conflict in Chechnya and thus to improve the situation in the southern Caucasus, where the three conflicts in South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh, although frozen, urgently need to be resolved.
The EU has announced that it will closely monitor Russia's actions during the G8 Presidency.
The issue of civil society will also be raised repeatedly at the twice-yearly human rights consultations with Russia.
MrÂ President, we must remain determined to continue the dialogue with the Russian Federation with regard to Chechnya and other human rights matters, regardless of all the difficulties and resistance, and to press for an improvement in the situation.
Â Â  . Mr President, President-in-Office, honourable Members, I am most grateful for this opportunity to give the Commissionâs view on the future of Chechnya after the elections.
It is positive, as the Presidency mentioned, that the elections took place without violence, even if one cannot ignore the deficiencies in the process.
Three parties received sufficient support to be represented in the new parliament, with the pro-Kremlin United Russia far outweighing the others.
We hope that this constitutes a step towards greater political representation, greater stability and eventually peaceful democracy.
Neither the OSCE nor the Council of Europe sent a fully fledged observer mission, since the conditions on the ground did not permit it, but the latter did send an eight-member fact-finding mission.
We therefore have no official reports, but we are aware of statements by members of the latter mission and by other organisations drawing attention, in particular, to deficiencies in the process, and we expect such allegations to be properly investigated.
While we welcome the Russian Federal authoritiesâ commitment to allocate significant funds for reconstruction, a number of other actions need to be taken if these elections are to be a step towards more peace and democracy.
Although there appears to have been an improvement in the security situation in Chechnya, unfortunately a culture of impunity remains.
Reported cases of disappearances and torture should be fully investigated and the perpetrators, including members of the law enforcement authorities, brought to justice.
We note that Russia has expressed its willingness to cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms including, for instance, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Louise Arbour.
These assurances should be put into practice and there should be cooperation with the UN Special Rapporteurs.
It is also important that the local ombudsman in Chechnya be seen to be carrying out his duties impartially, as well as effectively.
As has already been mentioned, I would like to emphasise that the European Commission is playing its part in the region.
We have agreed a EURÂ 20Â million programme for socio-economic recovery in the North Caucasus, because we believe that to be one of the root causes of that conflict.
This is in addition to humanitarian assistance, for which we are already the biggest donor through ECHO.
This gives a clear indication of our willingness to be actively involved in the process of strengthening democracy and stability in the region.
Our programme will help support the much-needed rehabilitation of the health and education sectors and assist in job-creation and income-generation activities.
In my former capacity as Austrian Foreign Minister I visited Chechnya as chairwoman of the OSCE.
I remember my visit very well.
We saw health establishments at first hand and a lot of improvement is indeed necessary.
It is also our intention to open an office in the North Caucasus region, possibly in Vladikavkaz, which would help us to monitor the implementation of our programme and keep us better informed on the situation on the ground.
I should, however, express our concern at the continuing difficulties that NGOs have to face â as the Presidency mentioned â including those receiving support from the European Commission, such as the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society in Nizhny Novgorod.
This also affects NGOs delivering humanitarian assistance under the ECHO programme.
In that context I should like to draw your attention to the recent amendments to Russian legislation on NGOs.
We expressed our concerns about the effect of that legislation on NGOs financed under ECHO in the North Caucasus through the EIDHR and TACIS programmes to the chairwoman of the Presidential Council on the development of social society and human rights.
I also discussed the matter with the Foreign Minister, MrÂ Lavrov, who assured me that there would be changes to the proposal at second reading in the Duma.
The text of the legislation finally approved by the Duma does indeed take some account of concerns expressed by the European Union and the Council of Europe, which we welcome.
However, we remain concerned that some of the provisions remain too far-reaching â for example the scope for denying registration to local NGOs and the controls exerted on both local and foreign NGOs.
We are taking careful note of the way in which these provisions are implemented.
That is our task now.
And we shall also be taking every available opportunity to make the Russian authorities aware of any concerns that arise with regard to that implementation.
Our regular political dialogue with Russia and the next round of EU-Russia human rights consultations set for March are an excellent chance to do this.
Â Â  . Mr President, Russia clearly faces a serious criminal and terrorist threat in Chechnya, and the surrounding northern Caucasus remain unstable, with daily killings of both the security forces and criminals.
There are also frequent civilian kidnappings that go unpunished and are carried out by unaccountable ugly paramilitary units.
Everyone remains conscious of the tragedy of Beslan.
And I still have had no satisfactory reply from my Government, the British Government, as to why it grants refugee status to AhmedÂ Zakayev, who is part of the same so-called Chechen Government-in-Exile as the wanted terrorist Shamil Basayev, who was behind Beslan.
There is nevertheless still also a westward flow of genuine innocent Chechen refugees caught up in this brutal war.
So, the EU has every interest in calling for human rights to be respected, as well as becoming more critical of the democratic standards of the elections in November 2005.
There is current concern, for instance, at the decision of a local court to shut down the operations in Ingushetia of the Centre for Peacemaking and Community Development, a Russian-British humanitarian group.
It is also considering a request to ban another charity, the United States-based International Medical Corps.
This shows the degree of hostility to foreign presence of humanitarian NGOs operating in the region.
It illustrates the phenomenon of increasing authoritarianism across the whole of Russia, as has been well documented recently by Freedom House, and as we have seen over the recent Duma bill on foreign NGOs, where even the final version still permits refusal of registration to any foreign group that threatens Russian sovereignty, cultural heritage and national interests â grounds which are vague and open to local administrative interpretation.
Our resolution today aims to keep the pressure up on the Russian Federation for higher standards of human rights in this tragic region which has been so besieged by conflict for so long.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been passing resolutions on Chechnya for about fifteen years now, and they have always been critical.
Parliament also sent a delegation to Chechnya the year before last, and I was its chairman.
That of course has already been forgotten about in todayâs resolution.
There are many critical issues regarding this conflict in todayâs common position.
It suggests that the Duma should establish a research committee of enquiry to investigate the action of the authorities in Chechnya.
Another proposal is to set up a temporary international tribunal to investigate these crimes. There are other proposals.
Our proposals have not led to any significant results during all this time.
I asked the country holding the Presidency whether we could deal with the entire conflict jointly, and not just those parts which vex Russia, putting the whole issue on the table with Russia.
We, of course, can provide assistance for that, as MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner said.
We all have an interest in mollifying Russia and the Russian leadership has asked for some good advice, so surely we should be seeking a way out of this together.
The head of the country holding the Presidency would have good means of contact with President Putin in this respect; he could speak to him directly.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Chechnya is a running sore on our continent, with hundreds of thousands of dead and maimed and with thousands of children traumatised and orphaned.
With the appalling refugee crisis, this is a human tragedy in every respect.
Atrocities are being committed by both military and paramilitary forces, and no one has been brought to justice or called to account.
Both sides are responsible for the excesses, but Chechen civilians have suffered out of all proportion.
This means that the international community and we in the EU have an obligation, indeed a duty, to intervene.
We cannot remain indifferent.
We must condemn the outrages and demand that Russia step up its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problem.
In addition to the very constructive things we are already doing, we in the EU may also in time be able to offer help in the form of mediation, reconstruction and further rehabilitation.
In a way, the election was a success, in spite of everything.
The situation is very uncertain, however, and an enormous amount remains to be done.
The democratic forces in Chechnya need to be identified and an attempt made to initiate a dialogue, because negotiation is the only possible way forward.
Naturally, we condemn the terrorist acts committed by the Chechen separatists, and the abominable events in, for example, Beslan and in the Moscow theatre can never be condemned enough.
With such negotiations in prospect, developments in Russia are very worrying. Both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council have said as much.
As a result not only of the legislation that puts obstacles in the way of the voluntary organisationsâ work but also of the successive restrictions on the media, it is difficult to initiate a dialogue.
It is difficult both to make criticisms and to make any progress.
It is gratifying that the President-in-Office of the Council is so clear in his criticism of Russia.
Here in Parliament, we have for a long time sought a more coherent strategy on Russia.
Unfortunately, we well know how, for example, the need for energy means that too many of the individual Member States continue to be hypocritical when it comes to our large neighbourâs human rights record and its violations of the rule of law.
Chechnya must always be there on the agenda.
That is something we owe both the Chechen and Russian peoples, and it is something we owe ourselves if we are to remain credible.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Winkler, Commissioner, when I hear you talking, then I am delighted that we are MEPs, that we are fortunate enough not to be diplomats and that we have not lost touch with reality.
Luckily, we are still entitled to express our surprise or indignation.
It is for that reason that the European Parliament has, in recent years, taken the lead in condemning what has been going wrong in Russia and Chechnya.
There is a definite sense of lawlessness that pervades Chechnya and the whole of the northern Caucasus.
There are a growing number of abductions, abuses and random killings.
It is fair to say that the Russian Federation has no control over the situation.
Indeed, the contrary is the case; the conflict is spreading from Chechnya across Ingushetia to the whole of the northern Caucasus.
For the Council or Commission to claim that elections organised while this sort of thing is going on went reasonably well is a real disgrace, and so I would urge the Commission, the Council, Foreign Affairs Ministers and particularly the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister who is currently Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, to say it as it really is.
In conclusion, I would like to make an appeal for help for Russia at this point to âŠ
Â Â  MrÂ President, as has been pointed out in this Chamber, the elections in Chechnya did have significant deficiencies and shortcomings.
There is no doubt about that.
At the same time, they are a step forward.
There is now an opportunity for building political institutions in Chechnya and for doing so with a little more credibility.
What is quite obvious after all these years of atrocities and war is that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Chechnya.
The idea that it will, as the Russian Government believes, be possible to crush all opposition in Chechnya is a myth.
Ultimately, a political process and negotiations are required.
It is a fact obvious to us all that the loathsome acts of terrorism committed by Chechen separatists have to be condemned.
It is also important to see that Russia has, in actual fact, also conducted a policy of terrorism against parts of the Chechen population.
It has committed huge acts of cruelty without anyone being held to account.
This is something that plays directly into the hands of the most extreme forces in Chechnya.
Only when acts of this kind cease will there presumably be an opportunity for dialogue and for a peaceful solution.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, todayâs debate in the House exemplifies the democratic nature of this Parliament.
I should like to thank previous speakers for their accurate and reliable assessment of the situation in Chechnya.
Nonetheless, it must be stated quite clearly that although such a debate can be held here in the European Parliament, it cannot be held in Russia, because democracy as we in the West understand it does not currently exist in Russia.
Moscow and Saint Petersburg are not on a war footing.
If there is no democracy in those areas there will certainly be none in Grozny or the rest of Chechnya, where there is a war on.
MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner stated today that the European Union had been unable to send observers to monitor the elections in Chechnya because the conditions on the ground did not permit it.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for her honesty.
Nonetheless, I am bound to point out that if the conditions on the ground were such that it was impossible to guarantee the safety of any observers, how can we accept that the conditions were right for elections to be held in the first place?
They simply were not. One of the reasons for this was that in terms of international law, Chechnya is an independent state under foreign occupation.
I must emphasise this most strongly.
The Chechen people have never freely expressed a desire to form part of the Russian Federation.
Chechnya declared its independence and the whole world saw how Russian tanks rolled into the country in response to that declaration.
Regardless of the political party we represent in this House, if we truly share the fundamental values such as democracy and the right to self-determination upon which our Community is based, we must send out an urgent appeal from Parliament calling for freedom for the Chechen people.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the European Union and Parliament do not miss a chance, often on scant objective evidence, to criticise and oppose the authorities and governments of countries with which it would be in their interests to cultivate good relations instead.
That is what they should be doing with Russia, rather than wasting millions of euros of European taxpayersâ money on doubtful initiatives to support so-called âdemocratic monitoringâ organisations.
In order to create a Europe for everybody, it is essential to think rationally and objectively when assessing security and antiterrorism measures that have influenced, or may influence, the peace and stability of our Union as well.
I do not think I have to remind this House of certain terrible crimes committed against the civilian population in Chechnya and in Russia by those who claim to be fighting for the self-determination of the Chechen people.
I have to say, however, that some people insist on interfering and criticising, and that double standards are often used in assessing similar situations in different parts of the world.
The resolution on Chechnya is the umpteenth example of this, and yet again I will not endorse hypocritical resolutions that also go against the interests of stability on the Unionâs south-eastern borders, interests that should consider the needâŠ
Â Â  Mr President, according to Russian human rights groups, these so-called elections took place only on paper.
Participation by the local population was very low â almost non-existent.
Instead, and scandalously, thousands of Russian army soldiers took part in the vote, together with an armed faction of the Kremlin-appointed leader Kadyrov.
These elections must therefore be seen as a masquerade to cover up the continuing violence and oppression.
In 2000, during the attack by Russian forces on Grozny, human rights defender Lida Yusupova sat in the cellar of a half-ruined house.
The people there felt defenceless and abandoned.
Somehow they had information that at the same time in Strasbourg the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was discussing the situation in Russia.
Listening to a radio set the elderly inhabitants asked Mrs Yusupova: âAre they going to help us?
Strasbourg is our only hope.â
Six years later this question has still not been answered.
Yesterdayâs meeting of the representatives of the Russian civil rights organisations confirmed the concerns we have been expressing for a long time.
The last major expression of this concern was the MalmstrÃ¶m report.
Todayâs resolution sadly states that both the Council and the Commission have not adequately addressed these concerns and human rights violations.
One could even say that they have failed to do so.
Therefore, it is now high time to take a principled and united stand on these issues, because massive human rights violations in Chechnya, which remain unpunished, are spreading throughout the Russian federation like a virus.
Lastly, todayâs resolution ...
Â Â  Mr President, I shall begin by expressing my deep regret that President Putin reportedly signed a new bill yesterday to control non-governmental organisations, coinciding with the decision by the Ingush Supreme Court to deny authorisation to the UK charity , whose Moscow representative I spoke to this morning.
This is an organisation that had been providing humanitarian aid to about 1Â 000 Chechen refugee children and shows what a crackdown that bill represents.
It is clearly incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and it is essential that the European Union does not simply protest but takes action, including insisting that non-governmental organisations take part in the EUâs human rights consultation with Russia.
Instead, what we see appears to be an attempt at a military solution by Mr Putin, accompanied by flagrant abuses of human rights, including arbitrary detention, forced confessions and torture, and some 2Â 500 disappearances since 1999.
President Putin calls neighbouring Dagestan a âmini Iraq on Russiaâs doorstepâ.
We cannot allow things to progress in that way.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the law on NGOs was signed in secret by PresidentÂ Putin.
The first three aid organisations in Ingushetia have already been banned, including one that provided humanitarian aid to refugees.
The attitude of authoritarian regimes towards civil society reflects the undesirability, in their eyes, of independent, accurate information on such subjects as the tragic war in Chechnya.
NGOs such as Memorial provide us with information on infringements and violations of human rights in Chechnya, where free elections are impossible.
In the same way that ChancellorÂ Merkel had brought up the subject of Guantanamo in Washington,Â she brought up the sore point of Chechnya on her visit to Russia,Â and the Russian President's response to her was to say that there were deficiencies in democracy and human rights in the West, in other words in the EU, too.
All I can say to that is: in the EU we do not have such massive restrictions on freedom of opinion, as terrible a war as in Chechnya, a judiciary that disregards the rule of law as completely as in the Yukos case, or prison conditions as inhumane as those experienced by MrÂ Khodorkovsky and MrÂ Lebedev.
Human rights are universal and indivisible and must not be disregarded.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to note that the proposed resolution is much more substantial than any of the previous ones, in which the massacre of the innocent Chechen people was judged depending on who was doing it â the separatists or the Russian army units.
The first case was referred to as terrorism, while the latter one was referred to as a violation of human rights.
The conclusion may be drawn that our judgments are not dependent on the fact itself, but rather on whether the violator is powerful and has oil and gas resources.
However, I would like to say that our resolutions will never be effective unless the foreign policy of the EU Member States is adjusted with regard to the content of such resolutions.
And, as a matter of fact, why should President Putin react to our sobbing, when he is further warmly welcomed in our states and is even entrusted with some very honourable and responsible duties, such as chairing the G8 meetings.
Therefore, while proposing that we approve the draft resolution, I would like to see it supported by the appropriate diplomatic actions, so it does not become just another resolution that does not change anything in essence.
Â Â  (MrÂ President, as the European Parliament is debating Russia, the trial of Stanislav Dmitrijewski, senior editor of the newspaper and head of the Russia-Chechnya Friendship Association, is continuing in Nijni Novgorod.
MrÂ Dmitrijewski is one of the most distinguished human rightsâ defenders in the Russian Federation.
The Russia-Chechnya Friendship Associationâs web site is the main platform presenting the situation concerning human rights and political freedoms in the Southern Caucasus, notably in Chechnya.
The next hearing in MrÂ Dmitrijewskiâs case is set for 3Â FebruaryÂ 2006.
When discussing Russian we tend to express concern about the state of democracy and also about the restriction of human rights and the activities of non-governmental organisations.
It is only right to remember, however, that a different kind of Russia exists as well. The latter is a country of human rightsâ defenders and of politicians ready to face up to the authoritarian political system.
It is also a Russia with a flourishing culture and a sensitive civil society that constitutes a genuine link between contemporary Russia and the European Union.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, honourable Members, we take the concerns and worries expressed during this debate regarding the situation in Chechnya and human rights in Russia very seriously.
This morning, the President of the European Council, ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel, said something that I would like to reiterate here: for us, human rights and basic freedoms are indivisible.
They are European values, and I would stress that that obviously also applies to Russia.
The European UnionÂ âÂ and I am particularly referring here to the activities of the CouncilÂ âÂ repeatedly discusses these human rights violations in Chechnya with Russia at all levels.
Whether or not the language of those discussions is too diplomatic for your taste, it is the language we use with our Russian partners.
It is particularly important to maintain dialogue, because it is the only way that we can raise our concerns about these violations of human rights.
That is why the human rights consultations that have been initiated, and which we will be holding on a regular basis, are particularly important.
They will be taking place again in March, and the Council is preparing for these consultations very conscientiously.
We also share, of course, the concerns raised here regarding the law on non-governmental organisations.
We find it regrettable that this law has been signed.
Rest assured, the Council will raise those concerns and we will be monitoring the position of non-governmental organisations in Russia very closely.
I also agree, naturally, with the honourable Member who said that we must strengthen those forces in Russia that are committed to democracy and human rights.
I can assure you that we are doing exactly that.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like first to come back to the election.
It was the Council of Europe which sent an eight-member fact-finding mission; we did not send an election observation mission.
The elections were not free or fair, there were deficiencies, but at the same time progress was made, because for the first time they took place without violence in such a difficult environment.
A local service, financed by the Commission, said that there were some irregularities, but, generally, voter participation was higher than ever before: there was a 55% turnout.
We see that there is some progress, but we know that the situation on the whole certainly is not satisfactory.
Having said that, let me also say what the reasons are for it.
There is a political conflict that needs a political solution, but there is also much poverty and therefore the root causes of poverty also have to be addressed.
That is what we in the Commission are trying to do currently with our Tacis Programme in three areas: health, education â especially job-creation â and income-generation.
We know that the main reason for many people breaking out is because they do not have jobs.
Thirdly, as I mentioned very clearly, as regards the NGOs we will now be taking very careful note of the way the provisions are being implemented, since it was only yesterday or today that President Putin signed this law.
We now have to look at it.
I agree with the Presidency that it has to be in regular political dialogue with Russia.
You can be sure that we always mention things.
As I said before, I have been speaking with Foreign Minister Lavrov on this issue and at least a few amendments have been taken into consideration, but on the whole I agree with those who say that, as regards Russia, we need a coherent policy that encompasses energy security.
We know that Russia is an important supplier for us, it is a strategic partner for us, but it is also a partner with whom we sometimes have dialogue where critical remarks are made.
Â Â  I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0676/2005), with questions to the Council.
Before we begin Question Time, I would like first of all to make an announcement and secondly to inform you that, after it, MrÂ Winkler will be addressing you.
In agreement with the Council, we are introducing a new system for Question Time as of today.
Details of this system were given to all Members in a Notice to Members dated 9Â DecemberÂ 2005. Question Time will now be divided into two parts.
During the first part, the Minister responsible for General Affairs will deal with four high-priority questions, to be selected by the President. During the second part, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on this occasion, will deal with nine questions, specifically questions 5 to 14, which are all topics within his specific area of competence.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have my first opportunity today to be here to take your questions.
I would like to take this opportunity to talk about something that you have already mentioned.
We in the Presidency are well aware that Question Time is an important democratic tool, because it enables MEPs to get answers from the Council to questions that are important for their political work.
We have therefore been reflecting, together with your Houseâs Bureau, on how we can make best and most effective use of Question Time as a tool.
As MrsÂ Kaufmann has already said, this has resulted in some ideas for reforms that we would like to try out together for the first time today.
This new type of Question Time aims to deal first with current topics of general interest and then to spend the rest of the time discussing a particular specialist field, in other words to raise questions to be answered in person by the President-in-Office responsible for that field.
This, I believe, will help us to deal with the issues that interest you in a more targeted manner.
We hope that this new procedure will provide your House with a better service and also contribute to more successful and better founded interinstitutional dialogue, to which the Austrian Presidency is particularly committed.
We are doing this even though Austria is a country with a relatively small government and therefore with relatively few ministers who are available for this new style of dialogue, but we want to make this effort in the common interest.
It was also not particularly easy to convince the other members of the Council to agree to these changes, but we managed it.
I hope, Madam President, that as many Members as possible will take us up on this offer, and that their presence will in future make Question Time a more lively occasion.
Â Â  We now come to Question Time.
Can the European Council make a statement as to the success or otherwise of the UN Convention on Climate Change which was held in Montreal in Canada the week commencing 5 December last?
Â Â  . Madam President, as MrÂ Aylward will be aware, the European Council recently welcomed the positive results of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which took place in Montreal from 28Â November to 10Â December 2005.
Under the Montreal Action Plan, future climate change discussions should now follow two parallel paths.
Firstly, the parties that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol will launch negotiations on the legally binding emissions targets for the developed countries in the second commitment period.
Secondly, all parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the United States and the largest developing countries, have agreed to enter global discussions regarding long-term coordinated measures in relation to climate change.
All in all, the Kyoto Protocol has now achieved full functionality, and we believe that the path has been smoothed for progress within the United Nations framework.
Â Â  May I begin by welcoming Minister Winkler on his first official occasion at Parliament, wishing him and his Government colleagues well during their term of Presidency, and thanking him for his comprehensive reply.
I welcome the outcome of the Montreal negotiations, which were relatively successful in the end.
However, I would like to address a question to both the Council and the Commission, in relation to the decision which was made in Sydney on 12Â January 2006 by the AP6 countries, namely, China, India, South Korea, Japan, the United States and Australia, when they decided that they represent 45% of the worldâs population and account for almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions.
I wonder, because they are going it alone and there is no mandatory mechanism whereby they must adhere to certain principles, how we will provide leadership in the Council and the Commission to deal with that.
Â Â  MrÂ Aylward, although I have been very indulgent towards you on account of your friendly welcome to the Presidency of the Council, I must remind all Members that they have only 30 seconds for supplementary questions.
If we all overrun, we will unfortunately be able to deal with very few questions, so please be so kind as to stick to the time limit for supplementary questions.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is clearÂ âÂ and has also been demonstrated by the negotiations in MontrealÂ âÂ that the biggest producers of greenhouse gases are now getting more involved in the dialogue regarding a future climate protection mechanism, and it is important that nobody goes it alone.
The future mechanism may well entail structural changes, which should make it considerably easier for Europe to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the efforts made so far.
There have also been some significant developments outside the international climate process, and various regions have established a number of initiatives.
The Gleneagles Action Plan, if I may bring that up on this occasion, places the emphasis of the EU's most important trading partners on technology transfer and on managing the effects of climate change, and involves a commitment to dialogue and technological cooperation with India, China and Russia.
It is in the interests of the European Union to work with all countries within and outside the international climate dialogue to ensure that our common goals of reducing emissions are not undermined by the actions of groups or States.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, industry reports show that the emissions trading system distorts the energy market and unnecessarily increases electricity prices, and has a negative impact on national climate strategies.
Does the Council take the view that the EU Emissions Trading Directive is meeting its original goals, and do you believe that a carbon dioxide tax could provide funds for the European Union?
Â Â  . Madam President, the EU's emissions trading system is one of the cornerstones of the fight against climate change.
It is the first international CO2 emissions trading system in the world, and covers around 12Â 000 plants, or getting on for half of all Europe's CO2 emissions.
It helps the Member States to reach their emissions targets.
No other system allows emissions to be reduced so cost-effectively.
The Council is well aware of the problems to which you alluded in implementing the EU emissions trading system during the pilot phase.
This initial period provided some valuable experience, which should help us with the future development of the system.
Building on these initial experiences, the directive already provides for a full review in 2006.
This review will enable us to examine all the possible improvements and to implement them for the period post-2012.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Winkler, I would like to thank you for your very detailed comments on this subject.
We are aware that this climate change agreement also entails costs for industry.
Despite that, what do you see as our options for improving the competitiveness of European industry so that it can continue to be successful on the international market?
Do we have any options?
If so, what are they?
Â Â  . Madam President, the European Union has always endeavoured to achieve global cooperation on climate protection.
The European Union and its representatives have also made this clear in every international forum as well as in the Council's conclusions.
Our implementation of the Kyoto Protocol provides credible proof of our commitment and shows that climate protection is feasible and compatible with economic growth.
In our opinion, economic interests and climate protection are not contradictory.
For example, the EU's chosen option of an emissions trading system is the most cost-efficient way to reduce emissions.
Furthermore, international studies have repeatedly shown that failure to act would result in much higher costs than funding climate protection measures right now.
The sooner measures are taken to protect the climate, the lower the consequent costs will be for the economy.
It therefore makes economic sense for the European Union to take climate protection measures on the grounds of energy efficiencyÂ âÂ and your House frequently debates energy issues âÂ that also create new jobs.
Â Â  Question No 2 has been withdrawn by the author.
Human rights questions are playing an ever greater role in an EU context, too, and proper coordination with other organisations in this area, in particular the Council of Europe, is therefore necessary in order to prevent duplication of effort.
Compliance with human rights in the fight against terrorism, as repeatedly demanded by Parliament, is equally of major importance.
How, firstly, does Austria propose to strengthen cooperation during its presidency between the EU and the Council of Europe, but also the OSCE, and, secondly, what is Austriaâs stance on the question of safeguarding human rights in connection with combating terrorism?
Â Â  .
Madam President, let me say, in response to MrsÂ Stenzel's question on coordination between the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE and on human rights compliance in the fight against terrorism, that we have excellent relations with the Council of Europe, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs, and I would add that it was only today that I had my first opportunity to speak to its Committee of Ministers regarding the Austrian Presidency's priorities, and I made very particular reference there to the shared interests and cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Union regarding respect for human rights.
I would like to take this opportunity to mention that we attach a great deal of importance to the meetings that every Presidency since 1997 has held with the troika of the Council of Europe.
The agenda for the most recent meeting with the Council of Europe on 7Â December 2005 particularly included the Council of Europe's guidelines on human rights and the fight against terrorism.
With regard to foreign affairs, the Council's working party on the international aspects of terrorism is also in regular contact with the Council of Europe.
The Council working party on human rights is also closely following the international efforts being made in other arenas such as the OECD, the Council of Europe and the United Nations with regard to respecting human rights in the fight against terrorism.
We want to ensure that the EU can play an active role in all these efforts.
The Austrian Presidency is happy to confirm that it intends to continue with this form of cooperation with the Council of Europe.
The Council of Europe summit in Warsaw in 2004 decided to conclude an agreement with the European Union, regulating every aspect of cooperation between the organisations in the aim of structuring, improving and intensifying that cooperation.
Under the UK Presidency, a draft was drawn up, which has already been sent to the Council of Europe and is now being examined by them according to their procedures.
In this regard, the Austrian Presidency, in close cooperation with the Commission, will hold intensive talks with the Presidency of the Council of Europe, which, as you know, will be held by Romania for the next six months, so that this important document can be finalised in the next few months.
When I spoke to the ministers' deputies today, I made a commitment to do everything possible on the European Union side, so that, if at all possible, this memorandum can be finalised before the end of the Romanian Presidency, in other words by the end of May this year.
With regard to the OSCE, the two organisations are in close contact both and at institutional level, and these links will be strengthened further in future.
I would like to point out that, over the next few years, three EU Member States in succession, namely Belgium, Spain and Finland, will hold the chairmanship of the OSCE.
Almost 50% of the OSCE participating States are now also Member States of the European Union, and their common positions and actions are generally shared by another 10 States.
In the decisive debates within the OSCE on improving its efficiency, particularly regarding the activities of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which works to protect human rights, the European Union has in the past systematically and successfully argued that the organisation should be fully autonomous, so that it can continue to perform its important activities in promoting democracy and human rights in all OSCE participating states without discrimination or restrictions.
The Austrian Presidency will continue to pursue this policy, which is, of course, endorsed by all Member States.
Â Â  Madam President, many thanks for this very detailed answer to my question on coordination on human rights and the fight against terrorism.
I have one supplementary question: what is the Presidency's position on the Council of Europe's investigations into suspicions of illegal CIA flights and secret detention centres?
Â Â  . Madam President, the Austrian Presidency supportsÂ âÂ as Chancellor SchÃŒssel made very clear in his comments todayÂ âÂ the efforts undertaken by the Parliamentary Assembly and Secretary-General of the Council of Europe to shed light on this matter and to put the facts clearly on the table.
Any doubts as to the commitment of all Council of Europe Member States to the rule of law and human rights as defined in the European Convention on Human Rights must be dispelled.
With the same end in view, we will also support the European Parliamentâs investigations into this matter.
Â Â  My supplementary is on the exact point that Mrs Stenzel has just made: will the President-in-Office speak to each of the other 24Â Member States, in his capacity as President-in-Office, to encourage them to cooperate fully with the European Parliamentâs temporary committee of inquiry into CIA flights?
Â Â  . We will certainly make this the subject of consultations among all members in the Council.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Winkler, I would like to raise a more general point, as it has become clear during today's debate that the issue of strengthening human rights in the framework of the EU as a whole is one of the Austrian Presidency's top priorities.
The EU intends to develop the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, currently based in Vienna, into a Human Rights Agency.
Do you consider there to be opportunities for coordination and useful services in the context of the problem being discussed here?
Â Â  . Madam President, we regard the establishment of a European Human Rights Agency as a major contribution to strengthening the hand of all the EU institutions.
We are endeavouring, in dialogue with the European Parliament and also with the Council of Europe and other institutions, to make this Human Rights Agency an effective instrument with the ability of making a real contribution to discussions on the matters you have raised, namely the issue of defending human rights in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
This agency, which we hope will come into being during the Austrian Presidency, and which we envisage being able to start work on 1Â January 2007, is not intended to compete with any other existing institutions.
We have no desire to compete with the valuable and important institutions of the Council of Europe, the Court of Justice or the Commission Against Discrimination, or with other institutions.
We want an efficient agency that will have the Monitoring Centre on Racism in Vienna as its core and foundation, but will have broader competencies and will thus increase the credibility of the European Union in the domain of human rights.
Â Â  . Madam President, on MrsÂ Manolakou's question on the abduction and arrest of Pakistanis living in Greece, I would like to say the following: the Council has always emphasised that the war against terrorism must be fought in complete compliance with the general principles of international law and with the provisions on human rights laid down in national and international legislation.
The Council would stress once again that it categorically condemns torture and other illegal practices, and it would underline the necessity of complying with the general legal principles at all times.
However, the Council cannot and will not comment on the details mentioned by the honourable Member.
These specific cases of what the question describes as abduction are currently being investigated by several international bodies, in particular by the Council of Europe.
Until we have the results of these investigations, it would be premature to take a position.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Minister has just said two contradictory things to us: on the one hand, he made a general pronouncement that the infringement of human rights is condemnable and, on the other hand, he said that he refuses to take a position on the specific events which have caused an outcry in Greece and which relate to action by the British secret services.
This is not action by the CIA; it is action by a service in a Member State of the European Union.
That is why we consider that the pronouncement about protecting human rights is hypocritical.
What we want to point out is simply that all these incidents are the result of the application of the âanti-terroristâ measures, the ultimate objective of which is not to combat so-called terrorism, but to terrorise the peoples as a whole.
Â Â  . Madam President, if the European Parliament wants to investigate these accusations, it does of course have the option of adopting a resolution to that effect.
From our point of view, as I said, a whole array of international bodies are engaged in investigating these accusations, and I think we must wait to see what results they come up with.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the highly reliable BBC referred to the incidents which you too wish to learn about.
The British parliament has set up a committee and is investigating the matter.
The Hellenic parliament has also spent hours debating the matter.
Do you, as President-in-Office of the Council, intend to communicate with the authorities in these two Member States, so that they can tell the Council what happened?
Â Â  . Madam President, if the European Parliament wants to investigate these accusations, it does of course have the option of adopting a resolution to that effect.
From our point of view, as I said, a whole array of international bodies are engaged in investigating these accusations, and I think we must wait to see what results they come up with.
Â Â  . Madam President, in response to MrÂ MedinaÂ Ortega's question regarding the Barcelona Conference, I would like to say that, at the Euro-Mediterranean summit marking the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Process, agreement was reached on a joint five-year work programme to reinforce the partnership and on a code of conduct for countering terrorism, which clearly shows our shared commitment to fighting all forms of terrorism.
The five-year work programme sets medium-term goals with regard to the political and security partnership, sustainable socio-economic development and reform, and education and socio-cultural exchanges.
It also deals with issues related to migration, social integration, justice and security.
The Presidency thinks it is important for every Presidency to submit a report to the Council, setting out in detail its plans for implementing this work programme, and it calls on the Commission to keep the Council regularly informed on the progress with implementation.
The agreements reached in Barcelona will enable us to make progress in our regional cooperation with our partners in the Mediterranean region and at the same time to push the European neighbourhood policy forward by negotiating additional bilateral action plans.
A number of important results were achieved at the summit: a governance facility to support and strengthen political reform was approved, the liberalisation of trade in services and agricultural products was confirmed as a common goal, and there was a willingness to combat illegal immigrationÂ â including through the conclusion of readmission agreementsÂ â while the EU has agreed to make legal migration easier; in this connection a future ministerial meeting is expected to deal with all immigration-related issues.
Other results included an increase in funds for education via a university scholarship programme and the promotion of gender equality.
Finally, the conclusion of a code of conduct on countering terrorism is a major political success and proves that, despite the sensitivities in the region, the partners in the process are willing to act together to combat this scourge that affects us all.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for the information you have given us.
I believe that it is quite complete and, above all, that it has focused to a great extent on the fight against terrorism, which is the immediate objective.
As you know, however, and as you have also mentioned, behind terrorism there is a more serious problem: the whole southern flank of the Mediterranean is suffering from great under-development and there is immense migratory pressure in the direction of the European Union.
The figures I have seen in the financial perspectives approved recently by the Council talk of a total sum of EUR 800 million over a period of seven years.
The European Parliament is currently being highly critical about this.
Does the President-in-Office of the Council believe that the figures included in the financial perspectives are sufficient to resolve these problems facing the southern flank of the Mediterranean?
Â Â  . Madam President, I would first of all like to confirm that the Council agrees that, in parallel with the measures we are taking to counter terrorism and illegal immigration, it is also important that we develop programmes â as the European Union has been doing for some time â to improve conditions in the countries of origin.
We are committed to that, and it is also part of the agreement that the governments have reached on the financial perspectives.
We think that the funding is adequate.
It is now up to the Commission to put forward concrete proposals on how to fund the individual programmes from these overall figures that have been agreed.
Then the negotiations with the European Parliament must result in agreement on the financial perspectives.
Â Â  Madam President, when the Environment Ministers of the Mediterranean region met in November, they painted a very bleak picture of the management of water resources in the area and said that in years to come there are going to be significant water shortages.
This is not just an environmental issue, but a security issue.
If there is a dispute over water supply it can affect the stability of the region.
Will the Minister consider urging that this be put on the agenda of the next Euro-Mediterranean summit?
Â Â  . I thank the honourable Member for his contribution and for his suggestions.
We will take them to the Council and consult with other Council members to see whether we can or should take them to the next conference.
Nonetheless, I thank you for these very interesting suggestions.
Â Â  As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
What steps is the Council planning to take to help bring about a definitive clarification of the question of the status of Kosovo before the end of 2006?
Talks on the future status of the region have begun with a meeting between Martti Ahtisaari, head of the UN team which will take part in the talks on the final status of Kosovo, and the President of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova.
Does the Council continue to share the view that implementation of the eight criteria laid down by the UN in respect of Kosovo must precede the final settlement of status?
Will it raise with the Kosovan authorities the question of the existence of a Guantanamo-type prison at the American base of Camp Bondsteel?
2006 is a crucially important year for the development of the West Balkans.
One pending challenge is to resolve the future status of Kosovo.
Regardless of the outcome of the status negotiations, Kosovo must be incorporated into a European vision.
What tangible form should that European vision take?
What are Austriaâs European Neighbourhood Policy plans, especially in connection with Ukraine?
Â Â  . Madam President, I will start with the questions by MrÂ Posselt, MrÂ Papadimoulis and MrÂ Karas on Kosovo.
According to the Thessaloniki Declaration, which the EU and the western Balkan states issued at their summit in June 2003, the future of the western Balkans, including Kosovo, is within the European Union.
The Council's attitude to Kosovo is based on a set of principles that the European Council adopted at its meeting on 16 and 17Â June 2005 as part of its declaration on Kosovo.
Any solution for the status of Kosovo must be fully compatible with European values and norms, comply with international legal instruments and obligations and the United Nations Charter, and contribute to realising the European prospects of Kosovo and the region.
Any agreement on status must ensure that Kosovo does not return to the pre-March 1999 situation.
The determination of the future status of Kosovo must be based on multi-ethnicity, and on full respect for human rights, including the right for all to return home.
The status must also offer, and this is very important, effective constitutional guarantees to ensure that minorities are protected, including mechanisms to ensure their participation in central government and local administrative structures.
It should also include specific safeguards to protect the cultural heritage and religious sites and to promote effective mechanisms to combat organised crime, corruption and terrorism.
The status of Kosovo must also reinforce the security and stability of the region.
Thus any solution which was unilateral or resulted from the use of force, as well as any changes to the current territory of Kosovo, would be unacceptable, and there will be no partition of Kosovo, nor any union of Kosovo with another country or with part of another country.
The territorial integrity of neighbouring countries must be fully respected.
The Council is also of the opinion that further implementation of both current and future standards is of particular importance, especially with regard to the protection of minorities.
In this connection, the Council has repeatedly emphasised that it values and supports the work of the UN's Special Representative for Kosovo, MrÂ Jessen-Petersen.
The Council is determined to work extensively to determine the status of Kosovo and to contribute to the related negotiation process led by the United Nations.
To this end, in November 2005 the High Representative, MrÂ Solana, appointed Stefan Lehne as the EU's representative, to work closely with the UN's Special Envoy for the future status process for Kosovo, MrÂ Ahtisaari.
The Council endorsed this appointment.
The EU's representative provides the UN Special Envoy with contributions for the negotiations and also helps the EU to prepare for its future role in Kosovo in the follow-up period to Resolution 1244.
He also works closely with the Member States and the Commission.
The European Commission will also be represented in Vienna, where the UN Special Envoy for the future status process for Kosovo has his headquarters.
Areas such as respect for human rights, minorities, cultural and religious sites, the rule of law and economic development will be of particular interest for the European Union.
The UN Special Envoy has indicated his willingness to work closely with the EU on these and other issues.
At the same time, in connection with the restructuring of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission In Kosovo (UNMIK), the EU has held informal consultations with the UNMIK together with other international organisations and partners.
The aim is to assess the options for a future international presence in Kosovo without pre-empting the outcome of the discussion on Kosovo's status.
Against this background, MrÂ Solana and Commissioner Rehn presented their second report on how the EU can prepare for the coming challenges to the Council in December.
The new international formation for the follow-up period to Resolution 1244 will involve everybody and have a strong EU presence.
The EU should play a vital role in the areas related to the rule of law, including a police mission, capacity building and in the economy.
The body responsible for all issues regarding the international military presence in Kosovo led by the UN is KFOR.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Winkler, many thanks for your excellent responseÂ âÂ I would not have expected anything else.
This January, it is 100 years since the Moravian Compromise came into force, which was quite exemplary; the only problem was that it only applied in Moravia.
We are now making the same mistake: we are seeking specific settlements and setting varying standards.
While provisions regarding minorities are being carefully drawn up in Kosovo, there is nothing similar in the PreÅ¡evo valley or in Vojvodina.
I would just like to ask you to develop uniform or comparable standards for the region objectively: it is the only way we will be able to reach a peace agreement.
Â Â  . Madam President, MrÂ Posselt and I already know each other from elsewhere.
I am, of course, very pleased to take on board your opinion and your suggestion.
I also take the viewÂ âÂ as I have already said once todayÂ âÂ that human rights and minority rights are indivisible.
Â Â  â Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke for six minutes, but you spoke in very general, very 'round' terms.
I therefore ask you, is UN Resolution 1244 still an axis for the Council's policy?
What will happen, not only with the right to return, but also with the ability to return of the Serbs and Roma forced to leave Kosovo?
As you said that Kosovo's place is in Europe, do you intend to bring to the attention of the authorities the accusations about a Guantanamo-type prison at the US base in Kosovo?
Â Â  . Madam President, I can confirm that the Council continues and will continue to take the view that implementation of the eight criteria laid down by the UN in respect of Kosovo must precede the final settlement of status.
The resolution is binding, it is applicable, and it is the axis on which the solution will be based.
Discussions have now commenced on the status of Kosovo, and we will follow them attentively.
According to the Thessaloniki Declaration, to which I have already referred, the future of KosovoÂ âÂ and I would like to emphasise this again, because you mentioned the European Union's principles and valuesÂ âÂ is within the European Union, and that of course means that the EU's values must be accepted.
With regard to your question about the camp, that is a question that cannot be answered by Kosovo.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, in my question I also referred to the European neighbourhood policy.
I would just like to ask you about the Austrian Presidency's programme for strengthening the neighbourhood policy, particularly with regard to Ukraine.
I would like to know whether the EU has provided sufficient resources to ensure that it can play an equivalent role in Kosovo during and after the status process.
Â Â  . Madam President, to start with the second part of the question, it is the case that the European Union is required to provide adequate resources, and it will indeed do so.
The CFSP budget has recently been increased considerably for the current year.
Since, however, the scope of our future activities is not yet certain â we cannot yet tell what sort of presence the European Union will have in Kosovo â it is currently not possible to say precisely what funds will be needed for this.
It would also be possible to raise the gas budget rapidly during the budget year with the agreement of the European Parliament, in accordance with Article 39 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
If the duties assigned to the European Union make this necessary, it will happen.
With regard to the European neighbourhood policy, it has already, in its first year, made a valuable contribution to the EUâs committed involvement in its neighbourhood, and we also support the Commission's related proposals.
The gradual, systematic and nevertheless individual introduction of EU standards and rules should and will be pursued.
The neighbourhood policy's declared aim is and will continue to be to offer and enable a significant level of integration.
This is achievedÂ âÂ as you mentionedÂ âÂ by means of European neighbourhood policy action plans, and both we and the Commission feel that those with Ukraine and Moldova have been a success.
An initial review of the first year of the action plans for Ukraine and Moldova will be carried out in 2006, during the Austrian Presidency.
As of next year, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) will also provide us with a new financial instrument enabling even more targeted support.
We also feel it is important to negotiate and conclude action plans as soon as possible with all states under the European neighbourhood policy. This includes in particular the three Caucasus republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, and this, too, is a task that will fall on the Austrian Presidency.
Political consultations with these three countries were launched just last December.
In this context, the Commission declared firmly that negotiations on action plans with these three countries in particular should be pushed forward rapidly.
The Austrian Presidency very much supports this.
With regard to Ukraine, we are very supportive of its connection to the European Union within the framework of the ENP.
Now that Ukraine has met the technical criteria for market economy status, we assume that that status will soon be formally granted.
In that connection, we consider it to be particularly important for Ukraine to join the WTO in the near future, as this would smooth the path for the creation of a free trade area with the European Union.
A feasibility study on this is currently being finalised by the European Commission.
We think that implementation of this proposal constitutes another important step in relations with Ukraine, and we will work hard to make further progress in this direction.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, regarding MrÂ Bowis's question on the persecution and harassment of Christians, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion is enshrined in international legislation on the protection of human rights.
I would refer you in particular to Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which applies worldwide and in which freedom of thought, conscience and religion is laid down as an individual right.
This right, according to that article, includes freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of one's choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one's religion or belief in worship, observance, practice or teaching.
This human right is extremely important to the European Union, and it therefore regularly holds discussions with third countries on this subject, most recently in New York, where the EU Member States successfully proposed, in the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, a resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief.
The Council has repeatedly condemned all forms of intolerance based on religion and also pays close attention to developments in the field of human rights.
The Council uses the opportunities offered by its dialogue with third countries to make clear its concerns regarding intolerance towards religious and other minorities.
Â Â  Does the Minister agree with me that there is an ever-increasing list of countries: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Nigeria, Vietnam, and China â the list goes on and on â where Christians are being persecuted and the Governments either connive at it, or take ineffective action to stop it?
These are countries with which we do business.
Will Austria now give a lead to the Council and the European Union to stand up for the religious rights of Christians in those countries with whom we deal, just as we rightly stand up for religious freedom and tolerance within the European Union?
Â Â  . As I have said, the European Union raises the question regularly in all dialogues as well as in international fora, which is very important.
We have raised it at the United Nations.
We do not name and shame, but we are very clear when we speak to the countries concerned if we believe, or have reason to believe, that there is persecution or restriction of the right to religious freedom.
To give you an example: we very much emphasise the question of religious freedom in our human rights discussions with China, because we believe this to be an issue that must be raised in the context of our dialogue with China.
The same is true in other areas.
The adoption of a resolution, which was adopted by a large majority of members of the United Nations, is a step in the right direction.
This will give us even more leverage in the future to raise this question in our relations with those countries.
The fact that we do business with those countries does not prevent us from speaking out clearly when it comes to violations of human rights.
Â Â  I now have three supplementary questions before me. They are permitted under our new system.
We are now in the second part of questions to the Council, so MrÂ RÃŒbig has the floor first for his supplementary question.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, Christians in Turkey still have to deal with many difficulties.
What does the Presidency propose to do to improve their situation?
Â Â  . Madam President, the European Union is monitoring the situation of the non-Muslim minorities extremely closely.
According to the EU-Turkey Accession Partnership, it is vital to the success of the accession negotiations that the Turkish Government undertake further reforms with respect to freedom of religion, particularly regarding the training of clerics and granting legal personality to non-Muslim minorities, in order to come more into line with the standards within the European Union in these areas too.
We will monitor this very closely in the process of the accession negotiations, but we will also support Turkey in implementing the necessary reforms.
Â Â  Minister, raising these issues with the countries is all well and good, but surely we need an ethical policy that produces results.
Is it not time to make a very direct link between trade with these countries and respect for human rights?
When we liberalise trade with such countries who persecute Christians and others, should we not make it conditional upon them liberalising their human rights regime so that minorities within those countries have the rights that we take for granted?
Â Â  . There are cases where we link certain things that the European Union does for those countries with respect for human rights.
In some countries where there are violations of human rights certain sanctions are in force, for example in Myanmar/Burma.
In other cases we also have to bear in mind that we need to support the people who live there.
We must be very careful about applying sanctions, because very often it is the people and not the government who are hurt.
We believe that each case should be considered individually.
We believe in a frank, open and direct dialogue.
If such a dialogue does not lead to the desired results, then we have to discuss in the Council other methods we might wish to pursue.
Â Â  Thank you for having the courage to talk to China.
I would just like to mention the position of the underground church and the detention of bishops and other religious figures, and also to echo MrÂ RÃŒbig: have there been any new developments in Turkey regarding the law on religion?
Â Â  . Madam President, MrÂ Posselt, I do not really think it took any courage to talk to China.
Our dialogue with China âÂ in which I have taken part myselfÂ â is very open and direct.
The issue you raised is, of course, being pursued not only in relation to China, but also to Turkey.
We have raised our concerns on the matter in our discussions with Turkey and will obviously continue to insist in future that the legal and administrative measures being established by Turkey in this respect are in line with our expectations in this domain, which of course correspond to international standards.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 10 lapses.
Sweden has been active in the democratisation process in Colombia.
Yet we all know that problems persist with regard to democracy and that human rights violations are on the increase.
One concrete example is the rapidly increasing production of palm oil.
There is a rising tide of opinion against the expansion of large-scale oil plantations.
It is a question of recognising the land rights of local and indigenous populations.
Many EU countries use palm kernel meal as animal feed, and many of us use cosmetic products which contain palm oil.
What will the Council do to ensure that EU Member States continue to support the democratisation process in Colombia and continue to seek a halt to human rights violations in Colombia?
Â Â  . Madam President, with regard to MrsÂ SegelstrÃ¶m's question on Colombia, although it has been reported by several sources that violations of human rights in Colombia are decreasing, any violation of human rights is a cause for concern.
The continuing internal armed conflict in Colombia is at the root of most of those violations, which are predominantly committed by illegal armed groups.
The EU is therefore constantly appealing to the parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law, and it is also in regular contact with, in particular, the Colombian authorities and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota.
I would also add that the Colombian vice-president was in Austria just before ChristmasÂ âÂ I spoke to him myself, and in particular we had some very intensive discussions on the issue of human rights.
In its conclusions of 3Â October 2005 the Council reaffirmed its full support for the Colombian Government, in particular in its efforts to impose the rule of law throughout the country and in the fight against terrorism and the production of and trade in illegal drugs.
The Council also reaffirmed its long-held policy of supporting the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including direct talks with the illegal armed groups that are willing to engage in a negotiated peace process.
We therefore welcome the fact that there has recently been contact between the illegal armed groups and the Colombian authorities, and we call on all those involved to do everything in their power to reach a peaceful resolution and thus to put an end to the internal armed conflict, which has now lasted for more than a generation, as the primary cause of human rights violations.
Â Â  Thank you, Secretary of State, for your answer.
I am delighted that you have an established contact of that kind.
I believe it is needed, because Colombia is in the process of becoming one of the worldâs largest refugee disaster areas where, it is said, up to three million people have been displaced and forced to leave their homes.
That is why I wonder whether what we are doing now in the EU is enough or whether there is more we can do to bring pressure to bear.
The problems involving drugs and corruption are, as you say, also part of the picture, but so too are the changes going on that affect the land and the fact that people will want to exploit the palm-oil, which is so valuable.
Â Â  . Madam President, MrsÂ SegelstrÃ¶m, you have asked a question to which there is really no answer.
Are we in the European Union doing enough for the suffering in many countries?
This is a question that cannot really be answered in abstract terms.
We are doing our best.
However, I would like to point to some concrete initiatives connected with the Council's conclusions of last October, to which I have already referred, although I would add that most of these initiatives fall within the competency of the Commission.
For example, the Commission decided in December 2005 to provide EURÂ 1.5Â million as part of the rapid reaction mechanism.
It remains to be seen whether that is enough or whether we can still do more.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, what is your view on the proposal to hold a G24 conference to support the peace process during the first half of 2006?
Â Â  . Madam President, I cannot say at the moment whether such a conference will be held in the first half of 2006: it will depend on the troika of the G24 groupÂ âÂ led by MexicoÂ âÂ reaching agreement with the Colombian government.
Any such conference would certainly take place very close to the EU-Latin America summit in mid-May 2006 and to the presidential elections in Colombia at the end of May.
The EU-Latin America summit, by the way, takes place exactly in the middle of the two stages of the election, and it is therefore not certain whether the Colombian President will be present at this conference in Vienna.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 12 lapses.
Despite an international outcry and expressions of intense disapproval, a draft which is distinctly anti-Communist in tone has once more been put to the vote in the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly following a change in title from 'condemnation of communist Ideology' to 'The Need for International Condemnation of Crimes committed by communist Regimes'.
What stance does the Council intend to adopt in response to these growing attempts to rewrite history and to justify the crimes committed in the name of fascism and imperialism?
Will it seek to ensure the freedom of all political parties and an end to measures penalising the communist movement and banning communist parties?
Â Â  . Madam President, with regard to MrÂ Pafilis's question, I would refer to ArticleÂ 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
Although I am sure he is familiar with this document, I would nevertheless like to quote an extract from it: 'The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States'.
These rights include freedom of expression, and it is not up to the Council of the European Union to interfere in the decision-making process of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly.
The question relates to the activities of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, on which I cannot comment.
Â Â  â Madam President, I could never have imagined that the Council would avoid answering directly on the question of the anti-communist memorandum.
It is known in every country in Europe, thousands of people from all political areas have condemned it, it is a new fascist text which equates Nazism with communism, it is disrespectful to millions of communist victims who sacrificed their lives to conquer fascism, it criminalises the political action and ideology of communists and, precisely â as you referred to Article 6 â it infringes fundamental democratic rights.
We demand that the Council take a position on this memorandum.
Â Â  . Madam President, I can only repeat what I have already said: the European Union cannot comment on the activities, discussions and decisions of a body of another international organisation.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Winkler, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly is located very close to us here, and it naturally has a much better overview of political circumstances.
Do you think it would be possible for them, too, to initiate a debate on the European Constitutional Treaty, because the Treaty could, of course, also support the future stability of those countries?
Â Â  . Madam President, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly can discuss any subject.
It is up to the Assembly to decide for itself which topics it wants to discuss.
However, it is of course also possible to put forward such proposals in discussions with national Members of the Parliamentary Assembly.
The European Union itself and the Council itself certainly cannot make this proposal to the body of another institution.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by Charles Tannock, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the European neighbourhood policy (2004/2166(INI) (A6-0399/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, first I should like to pay special tribute to my predecessor, Mr Laschet, from whom I inherited this report after his departure from the House.
I was initially sceptical when the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) concept was first floated in the 2003 communication on a wider Europe.
The chief conceptual problem was how to coordinate a policy on countries that appear to have different and contradictory aims, such as Libya wanting to host the African Union at the time, and Ukraine wanting to join the European Union.
Political leadership is about turning concepts into reality and the ENP is now an established political reality accepted by the partner states.
My report seeks to review its workings, bring additional recommendations from Parliament and clarify some of the misunderstandings surrounding it.
The ENP offers a privileged relationship between the EU and all its current non-Member State neighbours to the south and east.
It excludes the current EU candidates for membership and the potential candidate countries of the western Balkans which have separate special arrangements.
But what does the privilege bring?
In short, two things: firstly, the greater sharing of democratic values, and secondly, aid and trade for promoting those values.
The ENP is therefore two-tracked: one lane promotes the values that underpin the European Union, namely, a commitment to common values regarding the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, the promotion of good-neighbourly relations and the principles of market economy and sustainable development; the other entails sanctions for failing them by restricting aid or trade privileges.
The aim ultimately is to establish a circle of friends around the European Union in which the essential task of promoting and enhancing prosperity, stability and security is carried out in partnership and to mutual advantage.
There will be increased financial assistance through a single dedicated European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), also applicable to Russia, which from 2007 onwards will replace the current TACIS and MEDA programmes.
However, I am concerned that the Commission might decouple the ENP from the ENPI budget, which will entail a substantial erosion of Parliament's powers of oversight and scrutiny.
The Commission has already presented a strategy paper and country reports on a series of ENP countries, followed by action plans.
A regular reviewing process will monitor the implementation of those, for which I seek more parliamentary involvement.
Seven action plans have been adopted with Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, the Palestinian Authority, Ukraine and Moldova.
Five more are in preparation with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia and Lebanon.
I strongly support improved access for ENP countries to the single market and, in some cases, the eventual conclusion of neighbourhood agreements and the establishment of fully-fledged free trade agreements with the European Union.
I also support participation in the ESDP/CFSP, including the various Council working groups, and membership, where appropriate, of the EU devolved agencies.
We also need better focus on drugs, weapons and people-trafficking and enhanced exchanges of criminal intelligence between national agencies in the fight against international terrorism and organised crime, as well as renewed efforts for the peaceful resolution of outstanding territorial disputes, including the frozen conflicts.
By coincidence, today in London, Armenia and Azerbaijan are meeting to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh question.
Several ENP partner countries, such as Azerbaijan and Algeria, are rich in energy resources, as are the producers or transporters of oil and gas.
Therefore, energy policy and EU energy security will be a key pillar of the ENP.
The recent Russia/Ukraine gas crisis illustrates how energy policy and foreign policy now interface.
Lastly, I do not consider the ENP a fixed, long-term alternative to full EU membership for those democratic European countries entitled to apply which have expressed a desire to do so, such as Ukraine and Moldova.
The report goes some way towards recognising their European aspirations.
In contrast, as for other former Central Asian Soviet states, such as Kazakhstan â although currently not a part of the ENP â the EU should give serious consideration, in my view, when their PCA agreements eventually expire, to extending their right to participate in this ambitious project if they so wish.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for this very good report on the European neighbourhood policy, which will give me the opportunity to come back to the priorities for the next several months on this important issue.
As we have reiterated on several occasions since its inception in 2003, the neighbourhood policy is an ambitious policy.
It remains the number one issue â at least in my own portfolio â in EU external relations, because it is so important to promote prosperity, stability and security.
The stakes for our neighbouring countries are very high.
It is clearly in the interests of the European Union to have well-governed and democratic partners in our neighbourhood which can finally join in the positive dynamics of sustainable social and economic development.
As you mentioned, it is also in our interests that conflicts in our vicinity are peacefully resolved and that issues like migration, border control, organised crime and terrorism are tackled in a more effective way through closer cooperation.
The year 2005 has been the first year of delivery for the ENP, with the beginning of the implementation of the first seven ENP action plans.
What do we want to do in the future?
The Commission has been active on a broad front, including, for example, progress on market economy status; visa facilitation and energy issues for Ukraine; the border assistance mission on the Moldovan/Ukrainian border; creating new fora in which to discuss issues such as democracy, human rights and governance, for instance with our Mediterranean partners â I need only recall the Euromed Conference in Barcelona in November; the preparations to pursue our educational cooperation and in particular to extend twinning and technical assistance and information exchange programmes to TAIEX programmes to our partners; and our proposal for a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument â the ENPI â that will not be decoupled from the neighbourhood policy.

It must be said that for 2006 and 2007 it will be crucial for the further development of ENP to deliver, and there is a considerable onus on our partners regarding implementation, because we will continue to deliver on our own commitments, but how the partner countries react is very important.
We will continue the implementation of the ENP action plans in close cooperation with our partners.
At the end of 2006 we will issue a full progress report covering the implementation.
We will also open certain programmes and agencies to ENP partners.
For instance, we will start negotiations on agricultural and fishery products with our Mediterranean partners.
We will work on visa facilitation issues with Ukraine and Moldova.
For Ukraine the mandate is already there.
We will also adopt the ENPI as soon as possible and hopefully provide it with adequate resources so that it can be fully operational from January 2007.
We are convinced that the ENPI will give us a better, more flexible and more focused instrument with which we can support reforms and cross-border cooperation.
Both we and our partners are facing a major challenge to turn the commitments contained in the action plans into real concrete action.
Implementation is always the most important test and will depend very much on the partner countriesâ political will and on our capacity, but also their capacity, to implement the commitments taken in the action plans.
Let me assure you that we will do everything in our power to do so.
Let me also briefly say that the gas dispute of 1Â January has shown how important the energy question has become.
Let me also say that we must urgently draw the consequences of this gas dispute and the energy question for our external policy.
I intend to give the highest priority to developing an effective foreign energy policy which will aim at the most effective guarantee possible of the security of the EU energy supply.
We are not starting from scratch, as many instruments already exist, but they need further exploitation and an energy dialogue with Russia that has already covered much ground and provided us with a good basis to address bilateral aspects is there, but we have to make it really profound and we have to go on.
We recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Ukraine on energy and, in addition, we will provide expertise to Ukraine and Moldova.
Therefore, there is a multidimensional aspect and we shall address that through institutions such as G8, the International Energy Agency, the OSCE and others.
We have the Energy Charter Treaty, which Russia has not yet joined, but we also have the South-East Europe Energy Community Treaty as instruments on which we will build.
That means the neighbourhood policy will certainly also have to tackle these questions in the right format.
But, again, as I said today in another context, we will also need coherence from the Member States.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank both the rapporteur for his work and his predecessor MrÂ Laschet for what he did by way of preparation for it; I am also grateful to MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner for her contribution to the fact that the neighbourhood policy is taking us into an extremely important area.
This not only helps these countries, but is also a policy for stability and peace in our own interests.
I think that the action programmes must be based on an adequately funded financial instrument, and also that, in cooperation with the European ParliamentÂ âÂ in line with the division of roles we have to respectÂ âÂ important areas must be included.
Involving our neighbours in several policy areas increases the bonds between us in terms of economic policy, including aid for their political development, respect for human rights and much more. The example of energy policy has already been mentioned, which involves, for example, providing aid to Ukraine.
Helping Ukraine to keep hold of its own gas pipelines, and prevent them falling into other hands, is in our own interests too.
I would like to emphasise that this is equally important for Eastern Europe and for the Mediterranean. In individual cases, however, we may use different methods and arenas to achieve the goals of the neighbourhood policy.
For the countries of Eastern Europe, there is a European perspective that is important in legitimising domestic reform efforts and in supporting the government so that they can do this.
This does not, however, mean that every country automatically has the prospect of accession, as the French Prime Minister, MrÂ DeÂ Villepin, said today in his speech in Berlin.
We may also have to find methods that do not necessarily result in accession at the end of the road.
We should therefore also consider whether the development of this policy should also lead to a 'European Economic Area plus'.
I am using that just as a working title and as a multilateral offer that, in principle, leaves the door open for EU membership if the countries are capable of it and the European Union is willing and able to accept them.
We in Parliament are currently debating whether this could be a possibility.
However, that is not the purpose of this report, which acts as an intermediate step for some of the Balkan states with which accession negotiations have not yet been started, without calling into question the Thessaloniki accession commitment.
We have a lot to do here, Commissioner, and I would like, on behalf of my group, to offer you the support necessary to make progress in close cooperation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ Tannock, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to invite the Commission to take the report before us into serious consideration, since it did not do so with the resolution adopted by this Parliament in 2003.
That resolution, in fact, contains a series of useful suggestions for enhancing the neighbourhood policy, which is one of the most important challenges facing Europe.
The constructive relations that we shall be able to develop with our neighbours in fact represent the only prospect for creating peace and security around our borders.
There are two main reasons why this will not be an easy task.
The first is that we are surrounded by areas of great instability and conflict: from Chechnya to Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, Afghanistan, Iraq and the Middle East.
Secondly, the aim of this policy is not accession to the Union, which makes it more difficult to succeed in influencing both internal reform in the various countries and relations among those countries and between them and the Union.
Some of the countries currently involved in the neighbourhood policy look forward to achieving full EU membership â the rapporteur has already mentioned the cases of Ukraine and Moldova.
Even if we do not rule out that prospect, we should at least be honest and say that membership is not currently feasible, both because of the Unionâs internal situation and because of the progress that those countries themselves still need to make.
All that, however, provides further support for this policy.
The aspect that I have chosen to emphasise is the enhancement of the overall vision of the neighbourhood policy, even though it covers diverse areas in the east, south-east and south, as well as countries that differ greatly among themselves.
Security, energy, immigration, the environment and human rights require vision and political dialogue, as well as specific institutions in order to be able to make progress together.
Together with the action plans that the Commission is negotiating, this is the dimension that needs to be enhanced, including by means of specific policies, such as the energy policy, which the Commissioner singled out.
Back in 2003, Parliament pointed out that energy was an area that required attention in relations with neighbouring countries; today we reiterate that need for attention and call for a communication to be drawn up on those aspects of energy policy that concern our foreign and neighbourhood policy.
I shall conclude, therefore, with my initial appeal to the Commission and the Commissioner, who has an excellent relationship with us: do not undervalue the European Parliamentâs contribution.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is very happy with the content of MrÂ Tannockâs report, but we would have liked to see a few conceptual improvements to it.
The Commission originally used the expression âneighbourhood policyâ alongside the concept of a âWider Europeâ. That has generally referred to the whole of Europe in both scientific and political debate.
MrÂ Tannockâs report contains a lot of views on how to develop pan-European cooperation, including that within the framework of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, but this is not taken into account in its subheadings.
We would therefore propose replacing the unfortunately worded subheading after point 30 with the words âWider Europeâ.
The Liberal Group also proposed that the concept of the âSouthern Dimensionâ should have a place in the report.
It would be a more apt description of the Unionâs external relations with the south, the Mediterranean region, the wider Middle East and the countries east of that.
It would be logical to speak of the Northern and Southern Dimension of Union policy at the same time.
Our third conceptual suggestion was that the report ought to have contained the idea of Europe developing as a system of concentric circles, consisting on the one hand of flexible differentiation within the Union and, on the other, of the creation of functional circles of cooperation around it.
This notion provides an opportunity for seeking a solution to the conflict between the Unionâs consolidation and expansion.
The idea received support in discussions between the groups but no one wanted to include it in this report.
I wonder why not.
As we did not receive sufficient support from the other groups for the realisation of this or any of our other proposals for conceptual improvements, we will not be including them in the voting sessions.
We will wait until a more appropriate time to adopt them.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Tannock, for his excellent levels of cooperation, and especially for having adopted our proposal to endorse the Northern Dimension in the report, and also the proposals relating to pan-European cooperation, even though this important Wider Europe concept was omitted.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I am grateful to MrÂ Tannock, who took up the torch on this report, for his availability and his willingness to listen with regard to the very complex issues that arise when defining the neighbourhood policy.
The neighbourhood policy became a necessity with the arrival of the new Member States and, in involving all the bordering countries to the East around the Mediterranean, it has become one of the key elements and strong points in the EU's external policy.
For this action, the Union has taken on a considerable responsibility and it will have a tough job to avoid dashing the hopes of our neighbours.
Indeed, a new dynamism has been born in these countries, which now expect that the Union will support them in the process of democratisation, stabilisation and sustainable development that they have launched.
In some countries, it is even a prerequisite for future accession.
We therefore have to avoid a number of pitfalls if we are to make a success of the neighbourhood policy.
It must include a multilateral dimension and provide an institutional framework within which the partner countries are fully involved in defining European policy.
It must not be limited simply to a free trade area but be based on a real sharing of common values, democracy and human rights.
The neighbourhood policy must work to consolidate civil society by setting up a civil forum where NGOs can follow the action plans, which, Commissioner, will not be cooperation plans Mark 2 but specific and effective plans, with a Union determined to monitor them and implement them according to specific criteria.
It is with a certain amount of pride, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that I will support the action plans for the countries of the southern Caucasus, because the fact that Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are part of this neighbourhood policy is thanks to us in the European Parliament and not to the Commission and the Council.
Today, these three former Soviet republics bear a heavy burden of history.
The neighbourhood policy should help them to find an answer to their frozen conflicts.
The issue of Nagorno-Karabakh must be dealt with; the refugeesÂ âÂ particularly the AzerbaijanisÂ âÂ must be able to go home; the destruction of historic Armenian monuments in Nakhichevan is unacceptable; Turkey must reopen its border with Armenia; Russia cannot, on the one hand, have a privileged partnership with the EU and, on the other hand, issue passports to Georgian separatists; and the EU must support the peace plan in Georgia for South Ossetia and help to draw up a plan for Abkhazia.
As you can see, strong involvement from the EU, via the drafting of a stability pact in the southern Caucasus to achieve a peaceful resolution to these conflicts, is absolutely vital and will be a win-win strategy.
It will help these countries to find the path to development and lasting peace and it will bring the EU considerable credit in a region dominated by the influence of Russia and the United States.
Let us make the neighbourhood policy the spearhead of a successful common global security policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, neighbourhood policy can take two forms, and they are both very different.
The first is based on pure self-interest, on attempts to make the environment subservient to the economic and military demands developed within the European Union.
Countries pursuing this model are happy to have as neighbours countries that supply them with oil and gas, that keep refugees from their territory and that subject their own people to dictatorial measures designed to stop the interests of the countries adhering to this model from being adversely affected.
In a model of that kind, neighbourhood policy is also a means of keeping those countries that experience a lower standard of living, less democracy and fewer human rights out of the rich Fortress Europe once and for all.
All that those countries are needed for is to provide cheap labour.
Neighbourhood policy of that kind is very reminiscent of the way in which the United States treated Latin America for two centuries.
There is also a totally different form of neighbourhood policy possible, namely one that recognises that we in this part of Europe have organised many things better than in other countries and that we have something to offer them.
Promoting democracy and human rights in Belarus, Tunisia, Algeria and those Palestinian regions that are still occupied is in keeping with this type of policy.
It also means that we contribute to economic development which should raise the level of prosperity in those countries to our level.
In a number of cases, namely the Western Balkans, but possibly also in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Turkey, it could also represent a transitional phase to full EU membership.
Whilst my group emphatically denounces the first form of neighbourhood policy, it wholeheartedly embraces the second.
Fortunately, it is this second variant that dominates Mr Tannockâs report.
Also, most amendments put democracy, human rights and solidarity above economic and military advantage.
If the Council and the Commission follow this line, then our neighbourhood policy is bound to move in the right direction.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Tannock is right to devote some of his interesting report to the current situation in one of the EUâs neighbouring countries, namely Belarus.
Particularly in Paragraph 56, he calls on all European institutions to increase their support for Belarusâs civil society activities and of its political opposition.
With that in mind, I should like to ask the Commissioner how the Brussels plans to post a delegation to Minsk are coming along.
That delegation should be able to actually operate on the basis of its own objectives, on the basis of the shared commitment of the Unionâs Member States to the democratic rule of law.
An ideal channel for communication between the Commission and Belarusian civil society, it could, eventually, also be a for adopting an active neighbourhood policy with Belarus.
I am afraid that President Lukashenkoâs current authoritarian regime would not be very keen on this.
It would probably prefer a toothless European delegation on its own territory as a means of legitimising itself in the eyes of the international community.
I would ask the Commissioner if this attitude from Minsk might hinder the European delegation being posted to the Belarusian capital.
Mr Tannock also calls on all parties involved to come to a political settlement of the long-standing Transnistria issue.
Ominously for Moldova, two of the parties involved, namely Russia and Ukraine, issued a joint declaration about the Transnistria conflict, without involving Chisinau, just a month ago, in mid-December 2005.
In fact, Presidents Putin and Yushchenko did not involve the United States, the European Union or Romania either for that matter.
Between the two of them, they appointed themselves as âguarantee powersâ in Moldova and Transnistria.
Could this be a repeat of previous action taken by Yevgeni Primakov in 1997, which, in fact, received no international backing whatsoever and was emphatically rejected by Moldova?
In passing, Putin and Yushchenko have now also appointed themselves as being responsible for âpeace, stability and the well-being of the people of Moldova, Russians and Ukrainians on both banks of the Dniesterâ.
That is simply tantamount to a Russian-Ukrainian condominium.
At the same time, on 15 December 2005, Kiev and Moscow accepted each otherâs solutions for the Transnistria conflict as being âcomplementaryâ.
These are transparent proposals which, in my view, amount to the confirmation of a geographical division of Moldova, of an international legitimacy of Russiaâs military presence in Transnistria and of a âdemocratic, neutral state of Moldovaâ.
I would ask the Commissioner how he interprets this bilateral agreement between Putin and Yushchenko on Moldovaâs future in the context of the European neighbourhood policy.
I am looking forward to your response to my two questions.
Â Â  . Â MrÂ President, I would like to highlight a number of key principles that should feature in any sound and effective neighbourhood policy.
Firstly, such a policy must not be presented as something diametrically opposed to membership of the European Union.
On the contrary, in the case of a European country, a successful neighbourhood policy should bring membership closer.
Clearly, neighbourhood does not automatically entail membership, but it can result in membership.
Secondly, it should be emphasised that the level of aid must be conditional on the willingness to comply with democratic standards demonstrated by the neighbouring or partner country.
This applies especially to the case of Belarus, where it is not possible for us to cooperate with the government.
It also ought to apply to Russia, however, because there has been a notable drop in compliance with democratic standards in that country during the actual period of implementation of partnership agreements.
It is my impression that what we are doing in Russia is helping to build roads that are subsequently used to transport people sentenced unfairly, or oil pipelines from which we are subsequently denied oil.
The third principle is as follows.
Wherever an inadequate level of democracy is noted, we ought to make a particular effort to support civil society and democratic forces.
To be able to do this effectively, we need to be able to rely on a special instrument for human rights.
Such an instrument should be sufficiently flexible to serve as an effective tool in a hostile legal and political environment.
These principles are contained in the Tannock report and endorsed by it.
My group is therefore pleased to vote in favour of the report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European neighbourhood policy, todayâs debate, and the resolution before us prove that although the Union is experiencing a crisis, we have not yet lost the ability to think strategically.
We recognise the importance of opening up to our neighbours.
The economic problems of the enlarged Union and the difficulties over the adoption of the Constitution must not deter us from developing a vision of the future beyond the next elections in our individual countries.
Relations with our neighbours to the east and south-east are particularly important aspects of our neighbourhood policy.
The draft resolution quite rightly refers to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and the countries of the Southern Caucasus in general.
It is also right that we should recognise the mistake we made by not exerting appropriate influence on Russia to ensure the latter played its part in stabilising rather than destabilising the situation in the former Soviet republics.
I should like to make an observation to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
We cannot expect anyone to conduct Europeâs neighbourhood policy on our behalf.
It should not be foisted onto the G8 or the OECD or become a political football.
We need to keep a fundamental principle in mind too. This is that financial aid within the framework of the newly created European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument must be controlled, as MrÂ SzymaÅski mentioned earlier.
We must not further the interests of undemocratic governments.
The latter must be required to support democracy in those societies and governmental structures, and to promote human rights standards.
In conclusion, the European neighbourhood policy is an opportunity for the Union, not an onerous duty.
We would do well to remember this.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, we all firmly believe that the European neighbourhood policy is a key element in the development of a common foreign and security policy for the European Union.
We are also aware that our neighbourhood policy needs to be such that it can be adapted to the needs of individual countries.
After all, it will affect countries that are very different from each other, such as Morocco and Ukraine.
We are also aware that whilst retaining the flexibility of this instrument we should not forget that we are dealing with two kinds of situations.
It is worth highlighting this fact.
There are situations where what is involved is deepening and broadening cooperation in areas such as energy and security, and moving on into other appropriate areas.
The North African countries are a good example.
We also have to deal with the situation in quite different countries such as Belarus and Syria, where we are confronted by dictatorships and undemocratic scenarios.
The European neighbourhood policy should serve as an instrument through which we can press for the democratisation of those countries.
We are pleased to note that the Tannock report responds to these challenges and it is therefore worthy of support.
A very good point of departure is that this neighbourhood policy should not be perceived as an alternative to the future accession of these countries to the European Union.
Nobody seriously believes countries like Moldova, Belarus or Ukraine will soon join the European Union.
What is important, however, is to leave the door open to enable European countries to apply for membership pursuant to the treaties.
We also call for AmendmentÂ 55 and AmendmentÂ 52 tabled by MrÂ Klich to be supported.
Amongst other things, they entail referring to the Belarussian regime as what it is, namely an undemocratic regime.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this resolution on the European neighbourhood policy.
It comprehensively covers all the priorities set by Parliament for this policy: human rights, democracy, immigration, the environment and free trade.
However, one vital subject is completely missing: development cooperation.
Let me remind you that, of the 17 countries covered by the neighbourhood policy, 12 are developing countries, and a third of those are regarded as low-income countries.
The current reform of the external action instruments means that these 12 developing countries will not be covered by the future cooperation and development instrument.
As a result, if the neighbourhood policy does not include a development policy, these 12 countries will no longer get any development assistance from us.
I find it regrettable, however, that a text with as general and broad a political focus as this one makes no reference to cooperation.
We cannot reasonably talk about increasing the prosperity of a region without, at the same time, making a commitment to eradicating poverty.
Are the basic needs of the people of Azerbaijan, Moldova or Palestine currently being met?
How can these countries fight dictatorship and be competitive in the market economy when some of their people do not even have access to drinking water, social services, healthcare and basic education?
How do we expect to achieve the Millennium Development Goals if we cannot even combat poverty on our own doorstep?
As I see it, adopting a resolution on the neighbourhood policy that chooses to overlook the objective of eradicating poverty would be a serious error of judgment for which, unfortunately, we would have to bear responsibility in the future.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to speak as Chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and of the Delegation to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee.
I was sorry to see paragraph 43 of the report, which rather churlishly lumps these countries in with the rest of our neighbours and/or puts them on a par with Andorra and the Vatican State.
Sadly, it is not the first time that has happened in this Parliament.
By my amendment I wanted at the very least to refer to EEA-EFTA.
Indeed, we should appreciate that our own Member States are members of the EEA.
This is a close and deep relationship which already entails full participation in the internal market and other EU programmes.
Further, the EEA-EFTA countries are in fact already our partners and fellow contributors in building democracy and other activities within our new neighbours.
I think Mr Tannock will understand a British footballing analogy.
Whilst these countries do not currently aspire to the Premiership, to be full members, they are currently in the Championship and certainly not down at the bottom somewhere in the Conference League.
I believe we hope to repeat a meeting with the EEA-EFTA Foreign Ministers and our Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I hope my amendment will save some embarrassment about the way we perceive our oldest and closest partners and neighbours and also about our understanding of EEA-EFTA.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, we too welcome MrÂ Tannock's report, and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank MrÂ Laschet quite particularly for his previous work.
An important point in this report is undoubtedly point 4, which once again states that it must be ensured that there are stimuli for democratic reform and that economic development is promoted.
The EU must pay closer attention than in the past to ensuring that the democracy clauses in our agreements with third countries are taken seriously, and that they have consequencesÂ âÂ both positive and negative.
The report refers in this connection to an effective monitoring mechanism.
It would be a major step forward if we could establish the Fundamental Rights Agency that we are going to discuss here on another occasion, as it would give us an instrument with which we could effectively assess the situation in the partner countries.
However, it is also the case that the bilateral approach that the European neighbourhood policy has been following since 2003, which we expressly support, can do justice to the variety of countries.
We must not forget, though, that there is another approach: the Barcelona Process with its regional approach.
We would be well advised to treat them as complementary andÂ âÂ in order to forge a homogeneous policy for the European UnionÂ âÂ to combine the strengths of both approaches.
I would also like to refer particularly to the field of migration policy, which unfortunately currently plays no part in the Barcelona Process.
We would be well advised to discuss this matter with the southern Mediterranean countries.
We all remember the terrible images from Ceuta and Melilla, which affected us in the European Union.
We obviously need to discuss issues of borders, readmission agreements and asylum procedures.
At the same time, though, we also need to talk about the humane treatment of refugees and to improve the overall situation in these countries.
I am delighted that the European Union is strengthening its activities regarding education.
We must do a lot more in this field.
I am thinking in particular of the young people in the countries to the south of the Mediterranean, who must be given a chance for future participation in their countries.
Only if young people have opportunities in their own countries will they stay there and use their knowledge to improve the welfare and democratic organisation of their societies.
Finally, I would like to remind you of the situation in Egypt.
We are all aware of the detention of the opposition politician Aiman Nur, and I think that I speak for all of us when I express our solidarity with him, and with everybody else campaigning for democracy and human rights there, at times under difficult conditions.
Â Â  Mr President, the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs drafted by MrÂ Tannock is thorough in many respects.
It contains many views in politically delicate areas for which nobody needs to take responsibility.
The report has been produced on the committeeâs own initiative in an area in which the European Parliament has no competence.
The report reflects the trend where hope of help and support has to be given to countries not in the Union.
That way there is a desire to bind the countries included in the neighbourhood policy, many of which are not neighbours of the EU, to the Union politically.
The reportâs position on which countries may accede to the European Union is not clear.
One does not want to tell Ukraine, for example, that it is not eligible or that is eligible, even though Ukraine is a much more European country than Turkey.
In actual fact, Ukrainian membership in the long term is such a long way off that it is not in sight at all.
For what are very flimsy reasons, the report includes mentions of the EU Constitution instead of reflecting on how membership of the Union might be approached via, and from the point of view of, a structure such as the European Economic Area.
A corrupt administration is part of daily life in many neighbouring countries.
It would, for example, be interesting to know who owns Ros-Ukr-Energo, which administers the gas agreement between Russia and Ukraine.
Can even the President of Ukraine be innocent regarding that issue?
Since the âorange revolutionâ Ukraine has been an example of corrupt government.
Azerbaijan, for example, or Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, which are where the original sources of gas and oil are located further east, should also be assessed from this standpoint of state abuse, just as Belarus is, and not just from the viewpoint of gas and oil deliveries.
Â Â  Mr President, the European neighbourhood policy calls for the consolidating of democracy and the rule of law in the EU's neighbouring countries.
How can the EU seriously consolidate democracy in non-EU countries when the central driving force of EU membership is itself the inexorable removal of any real, meaningful, democratic accountability in its Member States?
How can the EU seriously call for the extension of the rule of law in non-member countries when the EU itself ignores its own laws?
I speak, of course, of the proposed EU Constitution which should be dead under Treaty law because of the 'no' votes in the French and Dutch referendums.
Instead, however, the Constitution is being kept on a life-support machine until the inconvenience of democratic rejection can be overcome by some underhand means.
Mr Tannock would do better to concern himself with the interests of those he was elected to represent rather than those who did not elect him.
Â Â  Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the report by MrÂ Tannock provides excellent testimony to the problem and to the European Unionâs capacities to enforce its own interests and policies in the geopolitical area surrounding the European Union.
Of course, a democratic, stable and prosperous neighbouring country is the best guarantee of development and security.
As the author of the report states with good reason, however, the EU neighbourhood policy ought to be made more effective through increased precision in the criteria for its objectives, priorities and evaluation.
In implementing the European neighbourhood policy, the experience of the new EU Member States ought to be utilised in encouraging reforms in the Caucasus, Ukraine and Moldova.
The report states, with good reason, that the success of the neighbourhood policy in individual countries is dependent on relations between the European Union and Russia.
However, it is difficult to believe that a Russia thinking in terms of the old geopolitical categories will prove a trustworthy ally.
In fact, the invitation to achieve the democratisation of Belarus together with Russia seems comical even.
It is a well-known fact that with every day that passes the Putin regime is moving further and further away from being a democratic administration and is becoming authoritarian.
MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, the bilateral dialogues between MrÂ Putin and MrÂ SchrÃ¶der, MrÂ Putin and MrÂ Blair and MrÂ Putin and MrÂ Chirac are unfortunately fulfilling Russiaâs desire to negotiate with a fragmented European Union.
This is bringing about a retreat from the principles and requirements of the EU neighbourhood policy.
Balancing Russiaâs and Ukraineâs gas prices in line with Turkmenistanâs so-called cheap gas is a monopolistic provision, and not the action of the market.
I am worried.
It is difficult to understand why, at a time when Russiaâs economy is growing, the cofinancing share contributed by Russia itself within the framework of the European Union, the Northern Dimension, the Global Partnership and the programmes for decommissioning weapons of mass destruction is not increasing.
The report, however, mentions the judicious and effective use of the neighbourhood policyâs resources.
It really is worth taking the greatest pains in the development of regional and sub-regional dimensions. It is worth reflecting upon the significance of the geographical, historical and political aspects of Eastern Europe in creating a reliable European Union neighbourhood policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not think it detracts in any way from Mr Tannockâs work when we conclude that this European neighbourhood policy, in fact, represents an enormous missed opportunity for the Commission, namely to ensure, as a matter of priority indeed, that our neighbouring country Turkey is included in that policy, occupying, as it should, first place and a very privileged one at that.
It should be clear by now that the majority of our European citizens are categorically opposed to Turkeyâs fully-fledged EU accession, and that it would therefore be very undemocratic to simply ignore this emphatic non-approval.
I would like to remind you again that Turkey is not a European country, not in a geographical, historical, religious or in any other way.
Turkey is a neighbouring country, though, with which we want the best relations and which could have easily played an important, and most prominent, part in the European neighbourhood policy.
That is, therefore, a missed opportunity, and a mistake which will sooner or later cost us dearly.
I should like to add one more observation to the reportâs considerations about our relations with the Maghreb countries.
I regret the omission of one very important aspect, that being the recent statement by the Moroccan Government calling for a re-immigration policy, for a return of a large section of the 2.5 million Moroccans who are currently based in Europe, the young people of whom, as you know, either face 40% unemployment or else end up being looked after by the state in another way.
That is an extremely important about-turn on the part of the Moroccan Government, and one that we Europeans should actively support, not least by our neighbourhood policy.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, links with neighbours are extremely important to both people and countries.
Relations with neighbouring countries are also important to the European Union.
They must be positive relations framed within the objective of creating a circle of countries around the Union that are peaceful, prosperous, respectful of human rights and stable and that share our principles of democracy and the rule of law.
Achieving that circle is necessary to the Unionâs interests, as the Commissioner has just acknowledged.
With globalisation and interdependence, it is clear that no wall can isolate the European Union from its closest neighbour countries; hence the importance of an active and generous neighbourhood policy.
As the report by Mr Tannock indicates â and I thank him warmly for his work â I believe that specific neighbourhood policies must be differentiated essentially according to the neighbouring country in question.
The difference must not depend on the continent to which the country belongs; if that were the case, we would be giving the impression that we have one first-class neighbourhood policy and another second-class one for the non-European neighbouring Mediterranean countries.
That would be a mistake, since many of these Mediterranean countries have very close and long-standing relations with the Union, closer and more long-standing than those that the Union has with several European countries which are also subject to the neighbourhood policy.
In accordance with our commitments, these Mediterranean countries hope to achieve the closest possible relations with the Union.
Furthermore, they need greater cooperation from us in order to remedy their backwardness in the fields of institutional democratic development, economic and social growth and so forth.
A closer European neighbourhood policy, however, also involves promoting reforms geared towards democracy, respect for human rights and the market economy.
There must also be progress in fields such as economic openness, border control, and cooperation in the fight against terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.
It is clear that progress in these fields will benefit the neighbouring countries in question as well as the whole of the region.
Mr President, I would like to make an additional comment.
I very much regret that, at the Barcelona Summit of last November, the level of attendance by our neighbours from the South of the Mediterranean was so disappointing.
I believe that they have squandered a perfect opportunity to demonstrate their interest in enhancing their relations with the Union.
Despite this disappointment, however, we must look to the future and to the Unionâs strategic imperatives.
This means that we must prioritise our relations with our neighbours, not just for their benefit, but for our own as well.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too wish for my part to thank Commissioner Ferrero Waldner and to highlight the particularly positive contribution by my honourable friend Mr Tannock to the wording of the final text.
I should like to mention certain matters, on developments in which the implementation of the ambitious objectives of the European Neighbourhood Policy will depend.
Firstly, there can be no reliable European Neighbourhood Policy without a balanced geographical approach.
We must do everything we can to prevent the Member States from taking a customer-orientated approach on the basis of their individual national interests.
The basic precondition for the efficacy of the neighbourhood policy is the political will of the Member States to make use of the mechanisms for which provision is made for the protection of human rights and democratic freedoms.
The negative experience in this sector from the Barcelona process should make us all wiser.
The neighbourhood policy needs to be combined with the implementation of the European security strategy, especially in the sectors of combating international terrorism, organised crime, energy security and environmental challenges.
The European Neighbourhood Policy should not produce overlaps or create confusion as to the European prospects and the future integration into the European Union of the Balkan countries.
Relations with the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation process also need to be defined with greater clarity.
Greater coordination and better cooperation are needed with the international financing organisations for the implementation of action programmes.
More reliable financial planning in 2006 is needed for the adoption of the relevant regulation on the new financing mechanism.
The European Neighbourhood Policy needs to develop in a process with the participation of the citizens and of third country communities.
Regional cooperation and the integration and strengthening of regional customs union also need to be developed and extended.
The crucial international energy situation is such that the European Union needs to harmonise and integrate its energy markets with those of the neighbourhood policy countries.
To close, I wish to emphasise the need for negotiations on the adoption of action programmes with the countries of the South Caucasus to be speeded up, especially negotiations with Georgia.
Particular account should be taken of the human rights situation and the situation of the Greek ethnic group in the Tsalka area of Georgia, where there are serious problems with both the human rights and property rights of the Greek community.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is a very constructive and important report on one of the most important issues concerning the future of the EU.
What kind of relations are we to have with neighbouring countries?
How are we to step up cooperation on issues in respect of which we have to cooperate, such as the fight against terrorism, environmental problems, security and energy?
How are we to help strengthen democracy and the rule of law in the countries in our vicinity?
My view is that, in the present situation, we should not define Europeâs borders.
Those European countries that are able and willing to fulfil all the criteria should be given clear prospects of membership.
We have seen what this has meant for the transformation of our new Member States.
For them, EU membership has operated as a carrot and stick, and it has been extremely important to their transformation.
Membership is also incredibly important to democratisation and the process of reform in the Balkans and Turkey.
My view is, therefore, that we should give Ukraine the prospect of membership.
Naturally, the EU cannot expand to just any size, which is why the neighbourhood policy may offer an alternative to membership.
In that case, it must, however, offer an attractive alternative.
Parliamentâs message is clear on this point.
We need further to specify and define what we are to do with the policy.
What are our priorities to be?
Can we resolve the institutional issues that will arise in connection with these countries?
Common values and common policy areas are needed.
Furthermore, the cooperation agreements must be tailored to individual needs because, as has been pointed out, there are incredible differences from one country to the next.
The focus must be on the issues relating to democracy.
The transitional or democracy fund proposed by MrÂ Tannock is a very good idea.
Again, I wish to thank my fellow Member, MrÂ Tannock, for a very constructive report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, if we want the neighbourhood policy to be a real success, we must have full cooperation from our neighbours.
From this point of view, I would like to draw your attention, a few weeks after the Barcelona summit, to the fact that most of the Mediterranean heads of state or government boycotted that summit, even those who are our partners under the neighbourhood policy.
I feel it is important for the Commission and the Council to draw their own conclusions from the attitude of the partner countries and to take care not to produce the same results in the context of the neighbourhood policy.
This boycott was in part a demonstration of the disapproval of the partner countries of, firstly, the considerable pressure placed on them by the Commission and the Member States to conclude cooperation agreements on migration policies and on the fight against terrorism and, secondly, the lack of budgetary prospects for the implementation of a true cooperation and development policy.
Can we be sure that the European Union has learnt all its lessons from that?
