Holding democratic elections in a country is not enough to justify the award of European aid.
The European Union certainly does refuse to allow expenditure of its taxpayers' money in a number of democratic countries.
I believe there are two fundamental reasons for disallowing expenditure.
The first is if the country concerned simply does not require our aid.
The second is if the country concerned does not recognise or does not implement fundamental principles that are crucial for the European Union.
It is this second reason that applies to Palestine.
Essentially, the disagreement over financing does not centre on Israel or Palestine; it centres on our own principles.
The potential beneficiary is refusing to recognise the donor's right to implement certain basic principles.
We should not be spending time debating when to use the terms terrorism or fight for freedom.
What we should instead be debating is whether it is possible to support an organisation whose programme centres on promoting the use of force against others.
Can we support those who really do not want peace?
The answer to the question as to whether we should finance authorities that do not want peace is obvious, or so it would seem.
We should not.
The reasons why we should deny support have nothing to do with the chaos in the Palestinian Authority, or with the uncertainty about how long the national unity government is likely to be able to govern.
They have nothing to do with how long that government will be able to exercise genuine power.
They have nothing to do either with the fact that 50 Palestinians were killed last week in clashes between Hamas and Fatah, nor do they have anything to do with the fact that children's television broadcasts by the Al-Aksa station call on Palestinian children to help destroy Israel and take part in the war.
The main reason why we should deny aid is that we must be true to our own principles, values and past.
It should be clearly stated that the choice between victory and martyrdom offered by Prime Minister Hanieh is flawed and detrimental to the national interests of the Palestinian people.
Mr President, I was mildly encouraged by what the Commissioner had to say and, frankly, thoroughly depressed by what the Council had to say.
It seems incredible that the Council fails to recognise that the creation of a government of national unity in Palestine was a major political risk both for Fatah and Hamas.
The platform of unity government is a platform of negotiations and trying to reach peace, something the Council failed to acknowledge.
I believe - and I think the majority in this House now believes - that the time has come to stop all restrictions on our dealings with the Palestinian Authority.
The Commissioner has said today that the conditions for renewing direct aid have almost been met.
Commissioner, let us not wait for protection.
I plead with you to go to the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting and ask them to recognise the Palestinian Authority's government of national unity.
If the Palestinian Government fails to keep its promise, of course we can then end our negotiations and our involvement with them, but let us give them a chance.
Failure to cooperate with the Palestinian Government does nothing to end the cycle of violence or tackle the grave humanitarian crisis that so many of my colleagues have spoken eloquently about this afternoon.
Failure to cooperate with the Palestinian Government also does nothing to encourage Israel to end its financial and military assaults on Palestine.
Even today, the Deputy Defence Minister of Israel warned that his country could single out the leader of Hamas, the current Palestinian Prime Minister, for extrajudicial killing.
Does anyone really believe that actions such as this would help the peace process?
Mr President, after the tragic failure of the Bush administration to push for an Israel/Palestine peace deal in the last five years, the Arab peace initiative is a rare bright spot.
The release of Corporal Shalit and Alan Johnston and the 40 Palestinian legislators would create much-needed goodwill.
The fact that the EU and the US are maintaining links with Palestinian Foreign and Finance Ministers shows that there is no boycott, no failure to engage and the hundreds of millions of euros of humanitarian aid mean our back is not turned to the peoples' plight.
However, it is very difficult to conceive of resuming budgetary support to the PA when the unity government has not, despite some claims to the contrary, fulfilled the Quartet demands.
Even if we do not attribute to Prime Minister Haniyeh the continuing statements of Hamas spokesmen vowing to destroy Israel, we cannot ignore his invocation of God or martyrdom to rally Palestinians just last night.
Colleagues who wished to argue pragmatically that the unity government is the best deal on offer should stick to that justification for supping with them and not try to persuade us that something has happened which has not.
Mr President, our message to every Israeli, every Palestinian, every member of Hamas or Fatah must be: In the name of your god and for the sake of your children, pull back!
Today we have the Israeli spokesman threatening to kill the elected Prime Minister of Palestine; we have the Hamas threats to seek vengeance; we have Fatah and Hamas in and out of conflict with each other; the killing of a Palestinian family on a Gaza beach leading to the capturing of the soldier Shalit, which led to attack and counterattack, tit for tat and on it goes.
Stop; think; talk.
Release soldier Shalit, release Alan Johnston and release the speaker and the 40 members of the elected Palestinian Parliament.
And to the EU I say, engage with both the Palestinian Government and with the Israeli Government.
Secondly, one says, let us find ways of ending the causes of violence, and the biggest cause is poverty.
Palestinian poverty has rocketed and poverty comes from withheld taxes, from unpaid employees, from trade and banking embargoes.
It is time for all that to end before it ends in more violence.
It is time to stop and remove illegal settlements.
It is time to stop and remove that gruesome, cruel, immoral wall, and it is time, Commissioner, to publish the document compiled by the heads of mission in Jerusalem and Ramallah, who reported on East Jerusalem and whose summary was that Israel's activities in Jerusalem are in violation both of its roadmap obligations and of international law.
Let us have that out in the open; let us talk, and let us then persuade everybody to think about their children's future, stop the violence and work for peace.
(Applause)
(CS) Violence and unrest continue in the Palestinian territories.
The world's press agencies bring daily news of the numbers of injured and dead.
Despite repeated ceasefire declarations between Fatah and Hamas, the armed conflict between the two factions goes on.
The shelling of the town of Sderot from the Gaza Strip and retaliation from the Israeli side also continues.
Palestinian health workers and teachers have gone on strike, and Palestinian policemen and other public service workers have not been paid.
As has been said on a number of occasions, poverty is rising fast.
Over 80% of Palestinians on the Gaza Strip live on less than USD 2 per day.
The bottom line is that Palestine and Israel need our help because they will not be able to escape the cycle of violence on their own.
I count myself among those MEPs who are calling for broader and deeper EU support.
I should therefore like to call on the Commission, once again, to do all it can to mobilise international assistance as rapidly and as effectively as possible.
I feel that if this does not happen, the probability will increase of Palestinian self-rule collapsing completely and of all-out civil war being unleashed, with incalculable consequences not only for Palestine but also for the whole of the Middle East. The same can be said, too, of Lebanon.
Mr President, it has been a very passionate discussion and I completely understand why because, as I said before, we all feel a great frustration.
But you have to understand that, over the last 10 years, the European Union has really tried to play an important role for the peace process - not in order to enhance the conflict but in order to make peace, or help to make peace.
In the end it is always the two parties that have to be ready, but we try to push them.
We were then quite happy to be an important and influential member of the Quartet.
However, we can only be a facilitator of this peace.
That means we have to look to both sides.
We cannot just go to one side, and therefore we feel that we embraced the three Quartet principles as important basic principles.
It really is the Council, not the Commission, that can recognise the Government - there are 27 Member States.
I understand if you ask me to do so, but it is not me who can take this decision.
I know there is one instrument which you have indirectly mentioned: the cancellation or suspension of the association agreement with Israel; but do you really think this would make a difference?
I do not think it would.
We would no longer be a facilitator of this process, so it would be the wrong instrument at this moment.
What we have as an instrument is a continuous political dialogue where all the parties work with all the parties, but it is true that there are other members of the Quartet too, for instance the United States of America, as has been mentioned.
It is very important that we feel that there is also a push from that side too.
Over the last months, we have seen a much greater effort on the part of the USA, particularly from Condoleezza Rice.
We have all welcomed that and have tried to move forward.
The German Presidency, in particular Mrs Merkel, but also Foreign Minister Steinmeier, have really tried to move forward.
A political solution can never be brought about by violence.
Unfortunately, we now have violence again.
I can promise - and this is within the Commission's competence - that we will further engage with the National Unity Government, as we have started to do.
But as we have said our policy is a gradual engagement and we cannot do everything.
Even Salam Fayad said to me when I first met him after the formation of the Government that I would need some time to clean up the mess in the Finance Ministry - and this is still not completely done.
Therefore, we are nearly there, the technical conditions would be ready, but you also know that the Council has to give us some political backing.
I want you to understand these things.
I think the situation is very dramatic, and I hope that the Council understands that we have to engage in order to help this National Unity Government achieve the right platform to continue with the peace process and with the talks on the political horizon.
We know that it is a complicated situation, and that is why I said that I see at least some positive hope in the fact that Foreign Minister Livni will attend the next Council meeting after the very positive meeting we had with the Arab League, but on the ground I agree that the situation is very difficult, and, besides all this, it is also those factions and those different radical groups that are outside the Government that would like to jeopardise the whole process.
It is a vicious circle and I agree that we have to try to break it up.
An honourable Member mentioned that we have extended our mission monitoring the Rafah border crossing.
We did that because we think that opening up freedom of movement of goods and people is so important.
I myself have been working on that with Prime Minister Olmert.
I remember my last visit there when I took it up in order really to go into the details.
But there are security concerns.
Unfortunately, there are suicide bombers coming over the borders, a lot of funds are being smuggled, so you always have the two sides of this conflict, but we think that it is important to have prolonged this mission at the Rafah crossing because only with the European Union is there a chance of there being an opening.
We are engaging. We are also working with the Finance Minister, not only on the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM), but also on institution building and technical assistance, helping them particularly on the question of customs, revenue collection and on auditing.
This has been asked for by Salam Fayad, so we are working with them.
I said we will also look at what we can then perhaps fund through the TIM as regards their particular desires, so not only those things that we have been funding up till now in order to help the population to survive, but to go further.
This is what I can offer you in this delicate and difficult situation.
We have to go on pushing and bringing the different parties together.
I hope that the time window is still open.
Commission Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0018/2007).
The following questions have been submitted to the Commission.
Part One
The Commission fully shares the Honourable Member's concern about deforestation and peat land draining in South-East Asia.
It is aware of the link with the fast-growing demand for palm oil.
Production of palm oil is growing at about 9 % per year; more than 80 % of the production comes from Malaysia and Indonesia.
In deciding how to tackle this problem, it is essential to have a clear picture of the supply of and demand for palm oil.
About 1% of the world's biofuels came from Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil in 2006.
The main use of palm oil today is in food and other non-energy sectors.
Only 1% of palm oil production from Indonesia and Malaysia was used for biofuel production in 2006.
However, demand for bioenergy is likely to rise in the future, and not only in the European Union, and that leads to increased production of palm oil for biofuels.
Having said that, the Commission is aware that, if nothing is done, the increasing demand for biofuel, linked to the proposed Community biofuel target for 2020, could create additional environmental pressures, which would be contrary to the sustainable approach supported by Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Today, no mandatory certification exists that will guarantee that tropical rainforests or peat lands in South East Asia are not suffering from the production of palm oil, regardless of its use.
Within the framework of its legislative proposal, the Commission will therefore include a biofuel sustainability scheme designed to ensure that the biofuel sector plays its part in tackling this issue.
The Commission is currently working on the design of this scheme.
It aims to include measures to deter the conversion of both tropical forests and peat lands for biofuel production, as well as measures to deter the use of production methods that are inefficient in greenhouse gas terms.
These measures will apply to domestically produced biofuels as well as imported biofuels.
In view of the above, any attempt to deal comprehensively with the impact of oil palm cultivation on the environment would need to take into account oil palm production for all end users.
The Commission, the Council and Parliament have all expressed support for a balanced approach to biofuels in which domestic production and imports will both contribute to meeting the huge requirement, but production will be carried out on a sustainable basis.
Thank you, Commissioner, for that reply.
Do you accept that the objective of the biofuels policy of the European Union is to reduce global emissions, not just European Union emissions?
My concern and the concern that lies behind this question is that if we only measure the emissions from biofuels in Europe and not the emissions involved in the production and shipping of those biofuels, we might not actually be contributing to the reduction in global emissions.
I am pleased to hear what the Commissioner said about the sustainability scheme.
Will the Commission look at how we can distinguish between good and bad biofuels from the point of view of emissions?
I definitely agree that our global scheme is to fight global emissions of CO2 and for this reason we are certainly looking at the carbon footprint of biofuels use.
At the same time, if the biofuels produced in one region would have to be transported to another region, we cannot artificially forbid this.
For this reason, our scheme should include that the best biofuels are the more rewarded with the support and in this way it is a part of the scheme that will not encourage transporting palm oil to supply our market.
Additionally, I believe it is extremely important to understand that we need to work in parallel towards a way of protecting peat lands and rainforests.
Because, whatever we do, we perhaps will be sustainable.
There will be other regions that will just go for palm oil.
So, in the negotiations which are to start in Bali, we need to work towards a scheme for protecting the rainforests, as well as looking at how to encourage the planting of more forests on the Earth, not for palm oil for our transport, but for less CO2 emissions from transport as a whole.
(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to ask how an increase in the production of biofuel might affect the food market.
The American maize used to produce biofuel is significantly more expensive than grain.
In the long term, as we transit to such renewable energy sources, will we then have crises in the food production market?
It is a justified question.
There is a lot of land in the European Union that is not being used. Therefore much of this land could be used for producing biomass, not only for biofuels but also for producing heat, for cooling or for producing electricity.
A number of countries have a situation that is sustainable; they produce 12 % of their electricity from biomass.
At the same time, they also produce biofuels.
So there is potential for using that land.
If I look at the second generation of biofuels, there is land that could be used for producing biofuels.
The Commission has calculated that the European Union could cover 14% of its needs, even if we do not import biofuels from other parts of the world.
Concerning the increase in the price of food products, this is influenced by many elements.
You mentioned the example of maize.
The price of corn is decided on the global market and it has been highly affected by the severe drought in Australia and the potential growth in the United States.
There is some correlation if the farmer is given the choice of using his land for producing either biofuels or basic foodstuffs.
But I believe the market will respond appropriately and, if our sustainability scheme that will encourage the production of biofuels with fewer CO2 emissions is put in place, there will be a balance in this market.
I have never said that we will be able to replace all the oil we use with biofuels.
There is potential both in the European Union and globally, but it will never replace all the oil we use.
At this stage I would say that it is not a question of food prices or the use of biofuels, because globally biofuels are used on a very small scale and they definitely have not had any impact at this stage on the price of foodstuffs.
(DE) Commissioner, you quite rightly said that it makes perfectly good sense to now use fallow land for the cultivation of plants from which fuel can be produced.
This currently makes for a problem as regards the production of barley for brewing purposes, since the subsidies for the production of biofuels make the cultivation of other crops a more attractive proposition for farmers, so, back home, we have had problems that affect our own economy, in cultivating the crops necessary for the brewing of beer, which is not the least important of economic sectors.
One might well ask which is the more important - food or energy?
In the days when we still had our own supplies of crude oil and natural gas, the situation was quite different; now we have to import everything.
Even though we know that global demand for crude oil and natural gas is on the rise, we still aspire to maintain the same standard of comfort, and consequently, some of our efforts have to be devoted to the production of energy.
As I have said, we currently have so much in the way of reserves and options, that we have to make the fullest possible use of the latter.
We must, however, also be smart enough not to do something for which we will have to pay a high price later on.
The schemes we are devising constitute a first step.
We have every chance of organising them in such a way that no great problems ensue for the food industry.
These are issues that we have discussed previously: how to supply the European Union with sufficient energy resources.
As you know today 50% of our energy supplies are covered by imports and we know that in the future the percentage will be even higher.
It could be 65%, with more than 80% of gas being imported and even more oil, with over 90% being imported.
For this reason we will continue to work with all traditional suppliers.
For gas it is Russia which today provides 27.5% of our supplies.
Oil is supplied by Norway at 14% and Algeria at 12.5%.
For this reason, we are interested in strengthening ties with traditional suppliers and obtaining more supply routes.
Supply routes that deliver gas and oil are exposed to danger.
I would mention a recent explosion in the Ukrainian gas pipeline system.
That certainly had an impact on transport but, because there were other ways of delivering gas, it did not affect the EU internal market.
However, it is very clear that having more supply routes is more beneficial for consumers.
EU dependency on Russia should not be over-emphasised because it is clear that, with Russia having the biggest gas resources as well as being one of the countries with the biggest oil resources, it is natural that supplies from Russia are topping our import list.
The Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline is in my opinion a very important project because it bypasses the Turkish Straits.
In this way, it reduces first of all the possibility of an environmental disaster and secondly it is an additional supply route to channel oil that is produced north of the Caspian to European markets.
So, for this reason, this project also got support from the Commission because it is an additional supply route and it does not increase our dependence on Russia.
At the same time it is very important to diversify; first because relying on one supplier gives the monopoly supplier a chance to dictate the price but also because it gives an opportunity to influence consumer choices.
For this reason the European Union has actively diversified its supply.
One of the areas where we have been getting supplies this year is the Caspian Sea and Shah-Deniz in Azerbaijan, where we have established very good cooperation from the countries surrounding Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.
Nabucco will be the next project that will be implemented.
Nabucco is a more ambitious project.
It will take a bit more time but we are well on track to obtaining supplies from this source through the fourth potential gas supply corridor.
At the same time we are also diversifying oil supplies because a project has also been announced from Samsun to Ceyhan, an additional oil supply project that again will bring oil from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea region towards the European Union.
We are encouraging cooperation with these countries around the world because, even if there are three big suppliers to the gas market - Russia, Iran and Qatar - there are other suppliers who could increase supplies.
Norway will increase supplies to the European Union in the next few years by close to 50%.
The same is happening with Algeria, which will provide additional supplies and more and more LNG terminals are coming on-stream.
For this reason, I believe that we should continue to work with Russia.
We should continue to buy energy resources because, for Russia, the EU is the best possible market because it is the closest market and mutual ties have existed for some time, but for security of supply it is important to diversify.
Additionally, I would like to stress two further elements because it is never the case that you can rely only on imports.
It is important to develop energy sources inside the European Union, to be extremely energy-efficient and to build internal energy infrastructure whether it be pipelines or electricity transmission lines.
The European Union is very active in all these areas, even if we always recognise that each country decides on its own energy mix.
But, through the instruments of the internal market and through the instruments given us by European legislation, we are encouraging the use of local resources and being very energy-efficient.
(LT) I thank our Commission colleague for the answer and the hopes expressed that we will nevertheless find other, alternative sources of energy.
As I said in my question, and in regard to the current situation, it is evident that no matter what agreements are in place, at the other end of the pipeline, be it a petroleum pipeline or a gas pipeline, there is Russia.
Russia has stopped delivering petroleum to Lithuania, and it is doing the same to Latvia.
Therefore, we cannot put much trust in this source of supply.
Nevertheless, I would ask that we all make a united effort in seeking to quickly implement projects for other, alternative sources of energy.
Well, I always advise Member States to be active.
I hope that they hear what you are saying and what I am saying because it is always important for Member States to cooperate among themselves and look for alternatives.
Theoretically, if there is a need, the Baltic States could use one additional energy terminal.
But it is the governments that should decide how to diversify and how to cooperate and how to get interconnection.
I am very glad that we have managed to interconnect the Baltic countries' market with Finland.
Now the big task is to achieve interconnection with Poland and in the future with the other Nordic countries. This would also eliminate the risk of a possible disruption of supply from one direction affecting the whole country.
(DE) Commissioner, I would be interested to know how the financial support for the Trans-European Networks (TENs) is to be secured; is there a planned date for when money will actually be forthcoming for these TEN pipelines - Nabucco or Bluestream, for example - and could you envisage a timetable being prepared in time for the 2008 review?
The Commission can offer only partial support in this area, since there are fewer resources available to us for it in the Budget.
We do, of course, support those companies and enterprises that are able to invest money in it, for investment in energy transport is economically of very considerable interest.
What I can say right now is that the timetable for Nabucco has been decided on and that the date of 2012 has been set.
The Commission has already given financial support to a limited extent, but political support is important too.
Over the coming months, the coordinator of the project will be announced, and this will of course be done in collaboration with your House.
It is my belief that the adoption of the energy package will enable us to get back to this issue when the Budget perspective is debated; I also take the view that it is necessary to set aside more funds for the trans-European energy networks in views of the directions involved that may well be strategically important, but are not as profitable for the business sector.
It is for that reason that we need more money, but we still have time to analyse all these things and prepare a proposal.
Thank you for your answers, Commissioner, they are really impressive.
I would like to ask you whether the Commission has noticed that Russia has never created difficulties as regards supplying 'old' EU Member States with oil and gas, whereas with Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary and other new EU Member States, there have been many difficulties.
What do you think about these first- and second-class forms of treatment?
Racist and xenophobic violence and hate speech are a very sad reality all around Europe.
According to the 2006 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the majority of Member States have recorded an increase in racist violence and other racist crimes over the past few years.
The Commission has always rejected and condemned in the strongest possible terms all manifestations and expressions of racism, regardless of their source and form of manifestation.
A measure to fight racist speech is perfectly compatible with freedom of expression if - and only if - it respects Article 10(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights.
I would be the first to admit that defining the border between safeguarding freedom of expression and defining racist speech as a penal crime is not an easy task and that it requires careful consideration.
However, I am convinced that there is no contradiction in simultaneously protecting people against racist speech and making sure that freedom of expression remains one of the key pillars upon which our societies are founded.
This is the spirit in which the Council reached a political agreement on 20 April 2007 on a framework decision aimed at ensuring that racism and xenophobia are punishable in all Member States by effective, proportionate criminal penalties.
This framework decision requires Member States to criminalise intentional conduct, such as public incitement to violence or hate towards a group of people or persons belonging to a group defined on the basis of race.
Incitement to violence or hatred will also have to be made punishable throughout the EU if committed by public dissemination or distribution of pictures.
Distribution in this context means disseminating action by any means of transmission, including through websites.
I am not aware of any parliamentary action in the UK or in other Member States to tackle those websites.
However, the framework decision is expected to lead to the adoption of new legislation, at least in certain Member States, to address racist crimes, including those committed via the internet.
Commissioner, your answer clearly reflects the efforts that you put into the framework decision on racist crimes and you are clearly saying that that this kind of cybercrime has hit websites which, if they were in the printed word, would be deeply offensive to everyone in this House.
Now that they are on the web they are equally as offensive.
Do you feel the framework decision will do the job adequately or do you feel that the cybercrime communication, which again is current, may be a way forward or do you believe it is just a question of asking Member States to implement adequate laws which will cope with an accelerating rise in the most offensive sites which excite racial hatred and violence based on difference?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view this framework decision is adequate.
We have adopted it after five years of political debate and in my view we now need to be vigilant with regard to the Member States to see that they transpose it fully and swiftly, and, above all, that these rules are successfully applied in practice.
Today the Commission has adopted a general communication on cybercrime which stresses the need for a European network linking all the police authorities to ascertain whether the Internet, that extraordinary and positive revolution, is being used by criminals, as unfortunately does happen.
We have, in fact, seen that racist crimes and incitement to violence are on the increase in Europe.
(DE) Commissioner, another aspect of this issue - and one that I think must not be overlooked - is the plethora of websites run by fundamentalist Muslims for the purposes of anti-Western propaganda, which incite people to fight against the Western world and its ideals.
Is the Commission aware of these activities, and are measures in place to counteract them?
This aspect will be at the heart of the discussion that will take place in two days' time, this very week, within the G8, where the European Union and the other partners will precisely deal with this issue of incitement to violence and terrorism on the Internet.
The approach that I am proposing to explore is to criminalise the behaviour of people who are guilty specifically of incitement to carry out criminal terrorist activities and who exploit the Internet for that purpose.
My proposal will be presented to the Council of Ministers in a few months' time.
(DE) Mr Vice-President of the Commission, my question has to do with the Internet and, indirectly, with terrorism, against which the directive on data retention was intended to be a measure.
Is it the case that it cannot apply to pay-as-you-go mobile phones, to webmail operators such as Hotmail, or to private servers?
That amounts to quite a lot of cover of which terrorist networks, among others, can avail themselves in order to avoid detection.
What, then, does the directive on the retention of data actually provide by way of added value?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the added value of this directive is that it permits the recording of a telephone call: not its content, but just the fact that a telephone call was made from a certain place, at a certain time, from a certain telephone.
This, as we all know, has been useful in detecting the specific movements of certain criminals and certain terrorism suspects.
Obviously, with the use of technology we ought to succeed in detecting even those using more advanced technologies, such as private providers or SIM cards that have not been officially registered.
This, however, is a technological issue.
In today's communication on cybercrime I am proposing a European conference with the private sector and with industry to be held in November in Brussels, at which we will see how things stand on this very point of security technology to protect the proper use of the Internet.
As you know the Commission and I personally are committed to fully implementing the European action plan against trafficking in human beings which I proposed here at the beginning of 2006 and which this Parliament endorsed.
This action covers the protection of victims of trafficking.
Its implementation requires close cooperation between Member States, institutions and civil society organisations.
The action plan should be regarded as a long-term programme which will guide continuous EU action in the near future and in any case far beyond summer 2007.
I consider free telephone helplines as a valuable mechanism, offering advice to victims in need.
They are particularly useful to spread confidence.
I am committed to setting up without any delay a hotline for victims and those vulnerable to trafficking, covering all Member States in the European Union.
You may know perhaps that on 15 February 2007 we adopted, as a Commission, a decision which requires Member States to reserve a range of six-digit national telephone numbers for single freephone numbers all beginning with 116 for services with social values.
One of the many subjects to be covered could be telephone hotlines for victims of trafficking in human beings.
The above decision has already reserved the number 116000 for hotlines to report missing children.
I will discuss the latter project in more detail at a Conference on an International Day for Missing Children which will be held in Brussels on 25 May, and at the Conference on the Rights of the Child, to be held in Berlin on 4 June 2007.
'116' numbers can be compared with the emergency number 112 in that they will give access to national or local organisations providing the service in question in the Member State in which the call was placed.
We have launched a public consultation for identifying other services which would benefit from single European freephone numbers.
This consultation was open for proposals until 20 May.
This is expected to lead to other numbers being reserved for other services later in the year.
Making them operational, allowing for citizens to be able to call these numbers, will then be the task of Member States, their telecom regulatory authorities and telephone operators.
The reservation of a common number and the creation of a network of hotlines is the first practical step to support victims.
In addition to setting up a network of hotlines we seek to improve the assistance to victims of trafficking by other means too.
My firm commitment to the issue is confirmed by the fact that the 2007 budget establishing a specific programme to fight against crime foresees four projects in the field of prevention and fight against crime in specific areas, including trafficking.
We are also supporting the creation of a European anti-trafficking day, which aims to increase the visibility of the problem connected with trafficking.
The initiative will take place on 18 October this year.
We are highly committed to raising awareness and reinforcing policy means in order to provide quality services for those in need of assistance.
Thank you for that very comprehensive answer, Commissioner, but you give your opinion on whether you feel that the EU's efforts to tackle forced prostitution during the World Cup in Germany were successful, and what lessons can be learnt from this experience for future international sporting events held in Europe, such as the 2012 Olympic Games which are to be held in London?
I can tell you that we have carried out an assessment of the results of police cooperation during the football world cup in Germany, the conclusions of which we will publish, and there will then be a debate in which, in my view, the European Parliament should be fully involved.
We believe the experience of the world cup in Germany was a case of positive education.
We probably succeeded in preventing the transportation to European territory of thousands of young girls destined for prostitution.
There was cooperation between 12 European Union Member States.
Germany and the German police did an excellent job.
We have offered the conclusions which we are going to make public as a contribution to other future sporting events in Europe.
I can tell you that there is an interesting amount of attention from the Chinese People's Republic in relation to the conduct of the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008.
In other words, it is an experiment that has been judged useful as a model.
(DE) Commissioner, I think that is an excellent initiative to take, but how are the victims to be made aware that they can use this number?
Has the Commission made provision for the funds needed to disseminate this information?
How do you propose to ensure that it actually works in practice?
The victims, who may, for example, be young women from Russia, are, in the main, young women from Russia who do not speak any of the EU's languages.
How will you ensure in practice that these hotlines actually work, for there are generally very considerable timelags, and that people do not get put into a queue and perhaps have to wait all of half an hour before their call is answered?
We have certainly tackled and examined this operational problem: the first number, which is 116000, will be for children.
We will advertise it everywhere: in schools, airports, stations, and through publications that will explain in very simple terms that there is a number and that the person answering the number will not speak just the language of the country where the telephone call is made.
We are gradually extending the possibility, laid down in the contract with the contractors that will provide the service, that as a minimum all the official languages of the European Union will be spoken.
Obviously we must also think about languages such as Russian.
For now, as a first stage, the contract will be awarded before the summer holidays, so that this telephone number can actually be used, and we will launch a massive publicity campaign.
We will do the same thing when the other numbers, apart from 116000, are allocated with specified priorities, which will certainly include victims of forced prostitution.
(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, you have truly presented a thorough crime-fighting programme, and you mentioned some special telephone hotlines.
I would like to ask whether the abundance of those lines might cause some confusion.
For example, will the victims of illegal trafficking in humans be able to dial 112 and ask for help?
This special number, 116000 for example, will replace all the national hotlines, so there will be only one number.
In my country there is now one number and in France there is another one.
In the near future there will be only the number 116000 for missing children, and so on. All these special European numbers will replace national numbers, of course.
Mr President, on a point of order, I have to object to the way the questions are being handled.
Members take the time to draft questions, submit them six to eight weeks in advance, and then you do not take those questions because you give the floor to other Members who wander in, look at the list and may have a fleeting interest in the question.
You have taken up time with two questioners or people who have not taken the time to question the Commissioner properly.
I object to that on the basis that I have taken the time to draft proper questions and I would like an answer from the Commissioner so that I can also follow up with the press on those issues.
In future Members will not want to table questions if this is the way you intend to conduct Question Time.
Mrs McCarthy, your question is relevant, but I am merely complying with the Rules of Procedure.
As Mr Tarabella is not present, Question No 38 lapses.
In answer to the Honourable Member's question, I should like to say that the European Union's strategy in terms of people with disabilities has been laid down in the Disability Action Plan of 2003-2010, where access to ICT is a priority.
You might also know that one of the pillars of the i2010 Action Plan is inclusion.
On that basis, the Commission adopted a communication on e-accessibility in 2005 and a communication on e-inclusion is in preparation for the end of 2007 and in this text there will be a proposal for new actions when appropriate.
We are not only working on concrete actions in that way, we are also encouraging our research efforts in the direction of developing new methodologies and new services for the disabled.
We also have the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme - the CIP - which supports our ICT policy with pilot projects and so on and so forth. Several actions are proposed on e-accessibility and on something that will become very important in the future - ICT for the elderly.
Very often they are the people, because there are people with disabilities and very often the elderly have those disabilities too and they represent a very high future percentage of our population.
That is why ICT for the elderly for ambient living will become one of the strong elements of our future policies, not only in theory but also in research and in practical implementation.
We are also supporting standardisation on e-accessibility.
For instance, we have taken an initiative to harmonise at EU level the accessibility requirements for public procurement in the ICT domain through an EU standard, because we believe that common standards can facilitate the development of accessible ICT products by the industry, leading to more uptake which also means to lower prices.
Therefore the one is linked to the other.
There are also some vertical issues.
In June 2006 we will propose strengthening the right of disabled users to access emergency services and introducing a Community mechanism to address e-accessibility issues.
We will have an opportunity to discuss those problems with Parliament when together we will try to find a solution for the universal service.
There will be a public consultation on the scope by the end of 2007 or the beginning of 2008 - I do not know yet exactly when - but that will be the time for Parliament and our main stakeholders to come forward with proposals to see what we are going to do with the universal service.
A very concrete problem should be solved the day after tomorrow, because then the Council is going to accept the European Parliament's amendment at its meeting concerning the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.
Parliament introduced an amendment on subtitling, improving accessibility for people with disabilities to audiovisual media services.
I hope the Council will accept this and then the new policy will go also in this direction.
The question of digital signatures will gain in importance as secure electronic communications are developing between commercial and public service providers and users.
The Commission will look at this issue in the follow-up to the European Electronic Signatures Directive and the e-government Action Plan, also bearing in mind people with disabilities.
I can just tell you in a very personal way that the various presidencies of the European Union have all held a congress or an exhibition - something official and public - to show how the results of the research have been put into practice.
I have always thought that this was a very good example to be taken up in our e-government activities, which are there to be proposed by the Commission and the European Union, but they have to be implemented by local governments most of all and by regional and national governments.
I have seen the enthusiasm with which regional and local governments in particular have taken up the results of our work to provide practical help for the disabled people living in their region.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Reding for her very detailed and systematic reply regarding the policies in force.
I would particularly like to thank her for the connection she made, in the terms that I myself intended to use, regarding the close link between technologies to help disabled persons and those that can help the elderly.
In view of the European demographic trend, with a population that is, on average, growing increasingly older, the technological revolution can provide answers of huge social significance.
The last point that I wanted to make to you is that, for persons who are completely immobile and only able to speak perhaps by moving their eyes, technologies such as these are not merely a concern or an aid, but are a means of achieving a fundamental civil right, that of freedom of expression.
There are many technologies and many techniques that can be utilised in order to help in this respect.
I really believe that the ageing of the population will first need a response from us on the societal level, but this response on the societal level is also an opportunity for the European industry, because if our industry gets the societal response from the policymakers, from those who are responsible in areas, in regions, in countries and at European level, then they can start to market systems, services and items for the elderly.
I believe that this will not only help our society but also our economy.
So this is a turning point.
It is also a question of growth and jobs, because, if we get it right, we can export systems on the societal level, as well as commercial items and services, outside of Europe.
So I really believe that all those elements are working closely together for the betterment of our society and of our economy.
The honourable Member asked me what I mean by the expression 'our European way of separation'.
We currently have a framework for telecoms that provide regulatory tools or remedies to the NRAs in cases where markets are not competitive, and in its review of the framework the Commission will be looking at ways of strengthening the single market for telecom services.
One possible innovation is to work more closely on remedies, because remedies are sometimes either not applied or not applied swiftly, which is the same problem.
We have also analysed that one possible tool as a remedy could be functional separation, which means separating the network business of a dominant market player from the part of the business that provides a service to the end customers.
This functional separation can provide the right incentive to providers of network services not to discriminate between customers for wholesale services. This can in turn mean that the conditions for real competition in the telecom markets are improved.
So we are not speaking here about forcing dominant players to sell off part of their businesses, as has happened in other parts of the world - for example in the United States with AT[amp]T. We would not like to go in that direction, and that is why I am talking about 'the European way'.
It would then be for each national regulator to assess the condition in its own Member State before considering such a remedy.
This has already been done in Britain with Openreach, so that is one example which we have in that case.
The honourable Member also asked about Greece.
In the case of Greece it would then be the Greek regulator, on the basis of national law in line with the updated EU framework, to take account of competitive conditions and all other relevant factors in the Greek market, and then to propose - or not - such a remedy if he thought it to be necessary and in the interests of the Greek market.
(EL) I thank the Commissioner for her reply.
However, I have a feeling that in practice, we have 27 different regulatory systems in the European Union.
As far as electronic communications are concerned, we are a long way from talking about a real internal market.
You are certainly making a huge effort in this sector.
This regulatory uncertainty or, to put it another way, the high level of fragmentation is causing uncertainty for investment, it is causing uncertainty in competition, uncertainty in innovation and, of course, it is creating few jobs.
My question is: can we talk about a European telecommunications industry without pan-European regulatory cohesion?
The honourable Member is absolutely right.
For the time being we do not have a European market for telecoms.
I think that has to be changed, because the only way for Europe to stay strong in matters of telecommunications - and Europe is strong, we are really one of the leading forces on the world market in this - is to get rid of 27 sometimes conflicting regulatory systems and come to one system which makes sense and which will also permit cross-border services and investments to take place, and enable us to have big European players which will work across several countries.
So we are now working towards opening the market for international roaming.
Parliament is going to decide on that tomorrow, and that is always a sign to show where we want to go in the future.
I will certainly come forward with a proposal for the reform of the e-communications package in order to get this European market to function, not to get rid of the national regulators - I think that we still need them because they know their market best - but in order to get not harmonisation, but logic in the remedies which they propose and which have to be applied swiftly so that there is a level playing field between the different markets and so that the cross-border activities of the industries can take place without being blocked by a lack of market opening in other markets.
I think that, if I have heard correctly, this question has already been partially answered by my colleague Mr Frattini who also spoke on this subject.
The fact that he partially answered this question clearly shows that it is the Commission as a whole that is worried about the development of our society and the Commission as a whole that takes measures to move ahead in this area.
On 6 February this year, 15 leading European mobile operators and content providers united to sign a European framework for safer mobile use by younger teenagers.
That is a voluntary agreement; it is a memorandum of understanding whereby the mobile industry, together with the GSM Association of Europe, agrees to monitor, publish and translate codes on their website, both those which already exist and those which will be adopted.
These self-regulatory codes will then, for instance, help parents or grandparents or educators to understand what the problems for children using third-generation mobile phones might be.
This agreement came out of the discussion in a high-level group that I convened, which included children's organisations, consumer organisations and bodies for content classification, as well as regulatory bodies.
The memorandum of understanding sets out a number of principles and requires signatories to work towards implementation through self-regulation at national level.
When we signed this together and we held a press conference, I said that I had confidence in the signatories.
I will give them one year, until February or March next year, in order to implement that.
Then we will come back to the subject and we will see if they have implemented it.
If they implement it - fine - then maybe we will have discussions about possible corrections or future projects.
If our expectations are not met, the Commission will then consider the introduction of specific measures.
(EL) I thank the Commissioner for her reply.
No one here doubts the Commission's role on this important issue.
I should like to ask the Commissioner two questions, rather to facilitate the debate.
I think that this is a voluntary memorandum, as she herself said, and that the sector is expected to self-regulate.
I would therefore say that the Commission should in essence know what it will be evaluating after February 2008.
In other words, will it urge the Member States to proceed with certain common codes so that they can monitor this issue?
Will the best practices of each Member State be codified and analysed?
Finally, what is the communications policy vis-Ã -vis parents who have no knowledge of this sector and what Community programmes can be used to inform them?
Thanks to the preparatory work it has done, the Commission has brought the mobile operators to take this initiative because the mobile operators understood very well that the Commission would not stand still and not do anything.
We had seen in our recent surveys that there are many children who use mobile phones - in fact the majority of children over 12 years old.
Most of all, camera phones and the location services can be a problem; for instance in the UK 10% of respondents say they had an unpleasant image taken of them, 17% of the kids feared that the image was posted online and forwarded to others, and 14% had experienced cyber-bulling.
In Save the Children Finland's survey, 30% of 7 to 15 year olds had experienced bullying through their mobile phones.
So we know that there is a problem, but this does not mean that we have to push the parents now into saying 'no more mobile phones for our kids'.
That would be the wrong reaction.
That is why it is so important that for instance the access for control for adult content should be available and that there be awareness-raising campaigns for parents and grandparents - who often buy mobile phones for their grandchildren - and for the children themselves.
It is important that the classification of commercial content according to national standards of decency and appropriateness is taking place, and that, as Commissioner Frattini has explained, the fight against illegal content on mobiles is really carried out.
We decided no later than today in the Commission to establish this fight against illegal content.
What we are speaking about here is not the illegal content as such, it is the dangers which can occur for children, and here the awareness-raising campaigns are the most important.
We will monitor what is happening in that field, and we will monitor what the signatories of this memorandum of understanding have agreed upon.
I have the European framework for safer mobile use by younger teenagers and children with me; I can hand it over to the Member and then she can see if this is taking place in her country, for instance, and I would be very grateful if she would inform me about that.
The Commission has been monitoring the situation in Vojvodina very closely.
We have urged the authorities to tackle inter-ethnic incidents promptly.
We have encouraged the authorities to promote good inter-ethnic relations and to preserve Vojvodina's multi-ethnic and multicultural model.
As noted in the November 2006 progress report on Serbia, the inter-ethnic situation in Vojvodina has improved.
There has been a decrease in the number of incidents.
No significant incident has been reported in the first few months of 2007.
The authorities have taken a number of measures concerning the official use of minority languages and scripts as well as the representation of minorities in the judiciary and police.
Improvements have also been recorded concerning education.
The importation of Albanian- and Hungarian-language text books for use in Vojvodina has been approved.
A Hungarian-language teacher-training faculty has been set up in Subotica, which has been operational since October last year.
These measures obviously need to be further developed and complemented.
We have noted, however, that there has been no progress in the adoption of new legislation on the national councils for the minority groups, and problems persist in the area of information in minority languages.
Therefore, we have requested that the Serbian authorities take further effective action on these matters.
(DE) There are two questions I should like to put to you, Commissioner.
The first is to ascertain how things stand as regards the systematic resettlements of Serbian refugees from Bosnia and Kosovo, which, regrettably, are altering the ethnic composition of areas such as the Hungarian community of Temerin in the vicinity of Novi Sad.
Secondly, I should like to know what is happening as regards the teacher training establishments that are supposed to be being set up, with EU funds, for the Romanians, Slovaks and Ruthenes, but which process seems to have come to a standstill.
Have they now been set up?
As regards Mr Posselt's supplementary question concerning EU assistance to Vojvodina and its relation to minority rights, while it is not possible to extrapolate exactly the total amount of aid given to the autonomous province of Vojvodina, the territory has received significant EU assistance, which has been directed to those needs to which Mr Posselt referred.
We have based our economic assistance on the following considerations: history, i.e. post-war reconstruction, notably as regards the Sloboda Bridge; geography, through integrated border management; and the economy.
Vojvodina is a relatively wealthy area compared with other areas of Serbia.
Therefore, even though it occupies 25 % of the area of the republic and has 20 % of the population, Vojvodina has absorbed 36 % of the credit line that the EU has earmarked for SMEs.
All in all, it is clear that we are using this economic assistance for the purposes to which Mr Posselt referred, and I can assure him that this money is well used for the protection of minorities and their rights.
(DE) You rightly pointed out, Commissioner, that a great deal of EU grant money is spent on protecting minorities and on matters of special concern to the EU.
Might it not also be possible - or is it perhaps not necessary - to ensure that political pressure is also brought to bear on Serbia to get it to prevent certain abuses from being committed in accordance with its policies or to change those policies in such a way that we do not need to spend EU money on repairing the damage later on?
I agree with the Honourable Member that we have to use political methods in parallel with economic assistance.
That is what we have been doing as regards Vojvodina.
We have raised these issues with the Serbian Government.
Now, as the country has a new democratic government which is reform- and Europe-oriented, I expect that we have an even better chance of making our voice heard and ensuring that our concerns are taken into account in Serbia as regards Vojvodina's position.
The new Constitution of Serbia contains detailed provisions concerning human rights and the protection of minorities.
However, it contains some ambiguities in relation to the scope of territorial decentralisation.
The new Serbian Parliament will have a key role in implementing the Constitution soundly, especially in enhancing the protection of minorities, as well as establishing forms of local self-government that are in line with European standards.
In this respect it is certainly positive that, thanks to the revision of the electoral law, ethnic minority parties now have several seats in the new Serbian Parliament.
(HU) Since I was born right next to Vojvodina, I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner to certain aspects of the real situation.
One of these is the question whether or not it is a problem that the indigenous Hungarian minority in Vojvodina are in practice still considered war criminals.
The law of Antigone is not honoured there, that is, they are not allowed to bury their dead or even to remember them.
Or is it not a problem that there is no equity anywhere in the areas of employment, in privatisation, in state institutions, or education?
And it would be good if he would once again respond to Mr Bernd Posselt's question about where things stand with regard to forced settlements.
In fact, I would be pleased to offer Mr Olli Rehn a complete list of all the latest incidents which occurred only recently.
Concerning the position of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, we have, as I said in our progress reports, analysed its situation very carefully.
We have also discussed the issue with the Serbian authorities, who have underlined that they are committed to increasing the participation of people from national minorities in the police and judiciary, but they claim that there is often a lack of interest from qualified candidates.
In my view, it is important that we continue this political pressure or political encouragement.
At the same time, once we solve the problems that have caused internally displaced persons to migrate, then we have better chances of avoiding the kinds of problems to which you referred.
I am of course referring in particular to the issue of the Kosovo status talks.
There must be a well-managed status settlement, and I am confident that, once we have that, there will be no destabilising effects on ethnically mixed areas such as Vojvodina.
That is why we urge all those concerned to show a sense of responsibility.
The Commission's firm view is that no parallel can be drawn between Kosovo and Vojvodina.
The Commission has not changed its position at all as regards Turkey's acquis communautaire obligations.
There is no contradiction between the two answers the honourable Member refers to, which, on the contrary, reflect the very same approach.
Like all other candidate countries, Turkey is expected to implement and enforce the acquis communautaire by the time of accession, that is, at the latest at the time it joins the European Union.
(EL) Commissioner, there have been numerous unfortunate occurrences with Turkey recently.
The Turkish army openly interferes in political developments.
The Republic of Cyprus receives threats because, in application of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, it and neighbouring countries are promoting the exploitation of its exclusive economic zone.
160 Kurdish candidates, including Leila Zana, have been excluded from the forthcoming elections.
Do these actions respect the acquis communautaire?
Perhaps the time has come for the Commission to speak a clearer and stricter language to the Turkish leadership?
The questions raised by the Honourable Member are extremely important, but they are somewhat beyond the scope of this particular question.
Unfortunately, time will not allow me to respond in detail.
However, I would like to underline that it is important that we are both fair and firm with Turkey in order to break the negative spiral in relations between the European Union and Turkey.
By 'fair and firm' I mean that we have to be fair by keeping our word, sticking to the commitment that, if Turkey meets all the conditions of EU accession, it can join the Union.
At the same time as being fair and credible we can be firm and rigorous, and we can expect Turkey to carry out reforms and respect citizens' rights so that, for instance, the Kurdish question can be addressed or women's rights, trade union rights and freedom of expression can be enhanced in Turkey thanks to the credible prospect of EU accession.
So we have to be fair and firm at the same time with Turkey.
The Turkish Government respected the ruling of the Constitutional Court and took the measures to implement it.
This was important for the political stability of the country, regardless of the events that led to the ruling.
To this end of political stability, the majority party submitted to the Grand National Assembly a proposal to hold early general elections.
Subsequently, the Grand National Assembly agreed by a broad majority that the early parliamentary elections would be held on 22 July 2007.
The Commission expects that the parliamentary, and subsequent presidential, elections will be carried out democratically in an atmosphere of responsible debate and political stability.
As regards the role of the military, I have often said that I have a high regard for the Turkish armed forces in the fulfilment of their duties of defending their country and contributing to international peace, but, as I stated after the statement by the Chief of Staff at the end of April, the military must leave the remit of democratic decision-making to the democratically-elected bodies of Turkey.
It should be self-evident that if any country wants to join the European Union it should respect all democratic principles, including ensuring democratic leadership of civil military relations, and, in my view, this is fully compatible with secular democracy, or democratic secularism, which is anchored in the Turkish Constitution.
Once the new Parliament is elected and a new government takes office, it will be crucial for Turkey to revitalise and relaunch fully the legislative work and implementation of the reforms that enhance the rule of law and fundamental freedoms in the country.
(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
You have indeed been forced yet again to repeat what you have said to Turkey on numerous occasions, as you yourself remarked, about the stand it must maintain as a candidate member of the European Union.
I wanted to ask if this crisis has not revealed something more, if it has not revealed a weakness.
Did you not use other means to approach the political and military players?
Because I assume that your admonitions have been directed repeatedly and publicly during your contacts.
I wanted in my question to clarify if you have intervened to a greater degree given the seriousness of the crisis and of the information that it has brought to light.
Thank you for this very important question, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou.
In fact, I talk a lot with the Turkish Government - some people in Europe think that it is too much!
But in times of the political or constitutional crises which Turkey has undergone and, to my mind, is going through during this crisis phase, it is particularly important that we maintain a channel of communication and discuss intensively with the Turkish Government and with all the relevant players in Turkish society in order to make clear what the expectations of the European Union are, if and when Turkey wants to become a member of the European Union.
Of course, democratic leadership of civil and military relations is one of these cornerstones.
As the Commission stated very clearly in early May - after my statement concerning the political intervention of the Turkish military in the tense situation - that the European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the supremacy of democratic, civilian power over the military.
If a country wants to become a member of the Union, it needs to respect these principles.
This is the core of the Copenhagen criteria for EU accession.
This has been made very clear to the Turkish Government and those involved in politics in Turkey, as well as through the Turkish media to the Turkish citizens.
I do not think that a higher volume helps.
Instead we need clarity and precision and, concerning our statement, it cannot get any clearer than our statement of 2 May.
(EL) Commissioner, I am not one of those who want Turkey to be an uncontrolled force in the area.
On the other hand, I wonder what constitutional court in a democratic country, not just in Europe but anywhere in the world, would have ruled that a quorum of two-thirds is needed in order to elect the president of the republic.
This would allow the opposition in any country to control the election of the president of the republic.
The Commission said in its statement that it respects the rule of law and its rules and does not wish to intervene in Turkey.
But is there rule of law?
I do not think that the Commission's statement was balanced.
Thank you for this follow-up question, Mr Hatzidakis, and for your own question, in which you called the Commission statement 'excessively indulgent'.
You also called for a more explicit message.
I must say that, as a Commissioner, as I said before, I do not believe in high-volume or megaphone diplomacy.
I believe in clarity, precision and consistency.
In this regard I think we do not disagree with the honourable Member, because, as I said before, we have repeatedly underlined the importance of the supremacy of democratic civilian power over the military.
At the same time it is also important that we keep the accession negotiations alive and we make practical progress with them, because what the nationalists really want in Turkey is to cut the accession negotiations.
I do not want to give this present to the nationalists of Turkey.
It is much better to strive towards the EU accession of Turkey, keep the accession process alive and move towards the shared objective, because that is the way for Turkey to become a more European, more democratic country, where the rule of law and fundamental freedoms are respected.
As regards your reference to the Constitutional Court, I understand the reasoning of your question and we have also taken note of the ruling which was issued by the Constitutional Court.
I would like to quote what was said on 2 May by the College of Commissioners when we discussed this matter and we made our position clear to the Turkish Government and Turkish public.
We said, 'regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling, this legal decision by the Constitutional Court should now be respected by all parties, because the respect of state institutions is essential to ensure political stability'.
That is rather clear language.
We also stated that, 'under these circumstances, the European Commission welcomes the announcement of holding new parliamentary elections soon in order to ensure political stability and democratic development in Turkey'.
Again, it cannot get any clearer than that.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Estonia (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statement on Estonia.
Mr President, I welcome this discussion on the recent dispute between Russia and Estonia.
Let me state right away that this is not a human rights issue.
The moving of the bronze soldier statue in Tallinn and the exhumation of the soldiers' graves were carried out with full respect for Estonia's international obligations, notably under the Geneva Convention with regard to war graves.
However, I am aware of the sensitivity of this matter, which touches on the interpretation of history.
While there have been concerns in Russia about this, we made it clear to Russia at the last summit that these concerns should be addressed through dialogue rather than through 'megaphone diplomacy'.
We regret that the demonstrations that took place in Estonia turned into looting and riots.
There is the right to demonstrate, which emanates clearly from freedom of expression.
However, the fact that it led to a siege in front of the Estonian Embassy in Moscow was unacceptable.
We have made clear our views about this and a demarche was conducted in Moscow immediately to remind Russia of its obligations under the Vienna Conventions.
We are concerned about cyber-attacks against official Estonian internet sites.
These need to be properly investigated and the perpetrators must be brought to justice.
We remind Russia of our joint commitment to cooperate in fighting cybercrime both in the context of the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice and by acceding to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.
Today the Commission adopted a communication on cybercrimes and we will certainly work on its implementation.
We are also following closely the situation regarding trade between Russia and Estonia.
There have been calls in Russia for trade boycotts of Estonian goods and services and restrictions on transport operations.
At one point restrictions were imposed on trucks crossing the bridge over the Narva River and oil shipments through Estonia were reduced.
Our latest information is that expert talks took place today concerning the bridge and that oil shipments through Estonia have resumed.
We shall continue to monitor the situation.
I hope that this issue has now passed its climax and that emotions will subside.
We discussed it at the EU-Russia summit in Samara and it was also raised at the press conference.
President Putin even acknowledged that there might have been some overreaction on the Russian side and he regretted that the Estonian Ambassador had to leave Moscow.
I fully support the Presidency in calling for a 'dispassionate dialogue on the matter', addressing the problems 'in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect'.
The Samara summit took place at a critical time in EU-Russia relations.
The discussions were open and frank and the media reports have, of course, highlighted the areas of disagreement between us.
I think it was highly important that we had this frank discussion: we have to talk to each other because Russia is and remains a strategic partner and an important neighbour.
At the same time, we also have to talk frankly to them.
The EU side placed considerable emphasis, as Mr Barroso in particular knows, on the importance of the respect for democracy and human rights, notably in the run-up to elections.
The detention of Garry Kasparov at Moscow airport, preventing him from attending a demonstration in Samara to coincide with the summit, was particularly regrettable and was very clearly addressed.
However, let me stress that there are also a number of positive issues to note from the summit.
I would say that the picture of the summit was mixed.
First and most importantly, Russia was left in no doubt of the importance we attach to EU solidarity in our relations with Russia.
Secondly, the summit confirmed that the EU and Russia see eye-to-eye on the underlying necessity of constructing a strong EU-Russia strategic partnership in the future.
Thirdly, both the EU and Russia recognise that our economic and trading links in particular are larger and more intense than ever.
Indeed, Russia is our third trading partner and we are their number one trading partner.
We are working together for Russia's accession to the WTO this year, which will also see the signature of the Siberian overflight agreement, most probably in November.
Fourthly, the summit also registered that, despite our difficulties, cooperation is proceeding well in many areas covered by the four common space roadmaps agreed in 2005.
For instance the agreement on facilitation of visas and readmission will come into force on 1 June 2007.
In the field of education, we have the European studies centre in Moscow, where there are hundreds of students who study European law.
Europe attracts great attention from the students.
There are questions such as the early alert system for energy, which Russia agreed to in principle and which we now have to work on, and finally a sort of dialogue on the investment climate and on investment in general.
Therefore, as I have said, I do not think the picture is black and white: there is a full spectrum of different colours, from warm to cold shades.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I fully agree with the Commissioner's statement that we do not have to look at the picture in black and white, but unfortunately the black and white situation was forced on us and was forced on one Member State by its big neighbour.
However, I would like to congratulate both the Commission and the Presidency for their convincing demonstration of solidarity in Samara.
I think the clear statement by the President of the Commission to the Russian President that Estonia or Poland are considered as equally important members of the Union as Portugal or Germany should be considered a key message.
I think the most important thing in the current situation was to make our counterparts understand what solidarity means for the Union, which is based on common values.
As the motion for a resolution on Estonia states, attacks targeted at one of the smallest Member States are considered a test case for the solidarity of the EU as a whole, and all the major political groups have agreed on the text of the joint motion for a resolution on Estonia.
I think there are some issues which you need to address collectively in future.
It is inadmissible to interfere brutally in the internal affairs of any State, especially a small one.
There is a crucial difference between two former totalitarian states.
New democratic Germany made it the basic principle of its foreign policy never to threaten any of its neighbours, and this has contributed to a very significant extent to a positive change in post-war Europe.
I think we need to act together to help Russia take a similar stand regarding its past imperialist deeds and help it to come to similar conclusions.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to make two preliminary observations.
I agree entirely with the Commissioner when he talks about a strategic partnership and the value of one, and states that we must continue the dialogue with Russia and must see what we can get out of it on the basis of our own principles and values.
Secondly, I am a Dutchman. I was not born in Eastern Europe.
I grew up in freedom and have always lived in it.
I think it is extremely important for me as a representative of what we could call an 'old' Member State to comment on what has happened to Estonia and the way in which Russia has treated it.
It is also important to note that things related to the past are always sensitive, for us as much as for others.
One has to tread carefully.
I am a historian myself, and I know how dangerous it is if too much history is injected in politics.
Although I always counsel in favour of exercising a certain level of self-restraint, my group has still expressed its solidarity with Estonia, and this must also be the basis for the European attitude in the conflict that has come about between Estonia and Russia.
The fact that this conflict affects not only Russia, but the entire European Union was hammered home by the Commission President, Mr Barroso, in Samara.
The European Union has not attempted to trivialise the conflict.
Russia's reaction was inappropriate and unacceptable.
European governments and members of parliament have tried to interfere in the domestic affairs of an EU Member State, and this is outrageous.
Add to this the fact that the Russian authorities have done nothing to protect the functioning of the Estonian embassy in Moscow, as a result of which the conflict ended up, to all intents and purposes, being a diplomatic crisis.
As I see it - and this is also worded well in the resolution - the Russian authorities, but perhaps we too, would do well to replace the hostile rhetoric by an attempt to contribute to a dialogue, not least between the communities in the countries in question, namely Estonia and Latvia, and not to drive things to a head, because this dialogue is also needed to create relations within those countries that match European values.
I hope that the message of dialogue, the message of talking about the future, not only about the past, will also be put across in Moscow.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to touch on two topics in recent Estonian-Russian relations, firstly the cyber war and secondly the disinformation that has been engaged in by President Putin.
Firstly, even after all of the declarations of support Estonia has received, Russia has not taken any steps to end the systematic cyber attacks on Estonia's official information and communication channels and on the web pages of the Estonian Government.
The propaganda attacks on the Internet and via mobile messages include calls to violence and armed resistance.
These messages are even distributed on television and through other media.
Estonia is particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks, since it has an e-cabinet and e-government and this year had the first e-elections.
The cyber attacks taking place in Estonia should serve as a warning to the whole of Europe.
In the 21st century this danger threatens all countries.
We must seriously consider how to protect ourselves, and we must do this together.
This is the first 'cyber war' in history, and it is clearly aimed at hindering the functioning of a sovereign state of the European Union.
Secondly, at an official press conference in Samara, at which the press of the whole world was represented, the Russian President said the following words, and I quote: 'It was not just that demonstrators were dispersed in Tallinn. A demonstrator was killed there.
Moreover, it is not even the fact that an accident happened that is the issue,' Putin claimed, 'We are concerned by something else, by the fact that the person in question did not receive any help when he was injured.'
According to Putin, Ganin died in the presence of the police.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is intentional disinformation.
Indeed, 20-year-old Dmitri Ganin was fatally injured in the course of the rioting, but criminal proceedings were initiated in connection with Dmitri's death, and these showed that his death was not connected with the police activity in keeping the peace in Tallinn.
At approximately midnight on 27 April, the police found Dmitri, who had suffered a stab wound, and called an ambulance for him at 12.26 a.m.
The ambulance set off one minute later and reached the scene at 12.32 a.m., that is to say five minutes later.
Dmitri was hospitalised at 12.51 a.m.
He was operated on, and he died in the hospital at 2.00 a.m.
I emphasise once again: the ambulance arrived five minutes after being called by the police, and thus Dmitri did not die in the presence of the police, but instead in hospital.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the recent tensions with Russia over trade discrimination against Poland and Russia's interference in the internal affairs of independent Estonia provided what is probably the best possible demonstration of the actual mechanisms and forces underpinning European cooperation in the area of foreign policy.
It was our moral duty to show solidarity with Estonia, but such solidarity is also in our best political interests.
Recent incidents between the Union and Russia amounted to a substantial investment in the future of the European Union, one that is far more significant than further institutional changes.
The European Union has come into its own, as a result of the far-sighted attitude adopted by the President of the Commission and the President of the Council.
I am sure I speak for many citizens of Poland and Central Europe when I say to Mr Barroso and Mrs Merkel: thank you from the bottom of our hearts!
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to distinguish between the Russian-speaking people in Estonia and Russian policy.
The Russian-speaking people in Estonia have the same civil and human rights as us, but the problems and differences of opinion do not entitle Russia to interfere in Estonia's affairs, such as demanding that the Estonian Government should resign.
No one believes that the authorities in Moscow could not have prevented the disruption and the violence against the Estonian Ambassador and the embassy staff there when, just as the Commissioner said, opposition activists were stopped from travelling to the demonstration at Samara.
The row over the statue has brought to light two different interpretations of history.
It is true that the Red Army had a major role in liberating Europe from Nazism, but it is also true that the same army after the war became an army of occupation in Estonia and in many other countries.
The events have shown clearly how poorly the Russian-speaking population has integrated into Estonian society.
It is the Estonian Government's and society's job, and I know that it is not always an easy one, to find a constructive way to resolve these problems.
The police have an obligation to keep order, but accusations that the police have acted disproportionately harshly need to be investigated impartially and openly.
Russia seems to find it hard to understand that Estonia and the other Baltic countries are actually sovereign states.
We have to show Estonia solidarity.
The Member States of the European Union must help Estonia to find out who or what started the attacks on Estonian authority websites.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left naturally regrets the disproportionate reactions in Russia, and we naturally demand that Russia fulfil its international commitments under the Vienna Convention.
That being said, the following must also be stated: no party is served by an escalation of the conflict, as may result from certain actions or simplistic resolutions and statements.
Bridge-building and dialogue between parties is better than the setting up of walls and barriers.
It is also indisputable that the discrimination and restriction of civil rights to which the Russian-speaking population of Estonia is exposed constitute the biggest breeding ground for conflicts.
Responsibility for the conflict we are now discussing also resides with the Estonian Government, which does not respect the Russian-speaking population's civil rights.
It is responsible for the fact that, before the monument was moved, no dialogue was conducted with the residents of Tallinn and for the fact that no account was taken of the monument's significance for a huge number of people as an important memorial to all those who lost their lives in the fight against Nazism and Fascism.
Other regrettable factors are the escalation of the conflict, which was a reaction to the Estonian authorities not allowing peaceful demonstrations, and the further escalation, which was a consequence of the action taken by the Estonian police against the demonstrators.
The Estonian action of removing an anti-Nazi memorial and the remains of soldiers who died in the war against Hitler's troops is seen as a provocation against all those who think that the fight against Nazism should be remembered in the future.
No one is entitled to re-write history, and political views should not prevent serious analysis, and understanding, of how conflicts arise.
It is only through such analysis and understanding that we shall be able to resolve conflicts in the future.
Mr President, I cannot agree with the last speaker in her interpretation of moving a war memorial to a military cemetery.
It seems to me that this is entirely the correct procedure.
It is the right of the Estonian Government to make that decision, and this was used as a pretext, not, Commissioner, as you said, for a dispute between Russia and Estonia, but for a dispute between Russia and the EU.
Commission President Barroso made the point extremely eloquently at Samara that we express our total solidarity with Estonia - as well as with Poland, with the Czech Republic and, indeed, with my own country, whose Ambassador has also been harassed by Nashi, an organisation from which President Putin does very little to dissociate himself.
We are told constantly that we have to de-escalate the situation, which we did not create.
In your reply, Commissioner, I wonder whether you can dwell on the WTO negotiations to which you referred.
Is it possible that we can continue to negotiate entry with a country which apparently appears to be implicated in the disruption of electronic communications - as Mr Savi has just explained - with the banking system, with our own security?
Surely a very clear message has to be sent to President Putin that of course we want to continue these negotiations, but we cannot do so until the cyber-attacks cease.
Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention the historical background of the recent riots and violent demonstrations in Estonia.
The European Union should understand that during the 50 years of Soviet occupation the Communist regime committed multiple crimes against the populations of the Baltic States.
It moved hundreds of thousands of working migrants to the territories of these occupied, former sovereign states, which were members of the League of Nations, and created a real threat that Estonians and Latvians might become minorities in their own countries.
Following immense pressure from the international community, including the European institutions, Estonia and Latvia agreed to integrate those hundreds of thousands of non-citizens into their societies.
However, integration is a two-way process, and the recent developments in Estonia show that there are reverse tendencies.
The sentiments of Soviet times have been replaced by Russia's new imperialistic approach.
Especially alarming is the fact that the younger generation, on which the most hopes for integration and loyalty have been placed, was at the centre of the recent violent events in Estonia, and this must give us some food for thought.
(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, events in Estonia have starkly illuminated various issues that are important for Europe:
1) Russia has not given up its designs on the Baltic States, but is attempting to use the 'divide and rule' principle.
2) We must remind Russia of the need to acknowledge the fact of the occupation of the Baltic States, since a different interpretation of history will lead inevitably to similar conflicts in the future.
3) Like Finland in 1939, the little country of Estonia did not quail in the face of attacks from the 'bear next door', retained its dignity, succeeded and gained the support of the countries of Europe.
4) Russia only understands a strong and determined stance.
Making concessions is seen as a sign of weakness, and so I would like to thank the Commission and Chancellor Merkel of Germany, the state with the Presidency, for their understanding of events and their solidarity in speaking to Russia with one European voice, and I would also like to express my conviction that this tactic will bring us all success in the future.
Mr President, I have listened with great attention to the Commissioner's contribution, but I do not agree that the issue is just a dispute between Russia and Estonia.
Moreover, I wonder how the inter-ethnic conflict, the relations between minorities and majorities, one of the crucial points of which is a different approach to history, now becomes a matter of relations between the European Union and Russia.
I represent the Russian-speaking minority in Latvia and I have said on many occasions that we do not want to be hostages to geo-political games.
Unfortunately, Russian speakers in Estonia as well as in Latvia were so-called prisoners of the first Cold War by being denied their citizens' rights - by being denied their language as an official language in the countries where they were a substantial minority.
Now, unfortunately, we might be the hostages of the new Cold War and we see appeals in this House to the behaviour which is very like the Cold War.
There cannot be solidarity when there is violation of human rights.
A number of international organisations just report on violations of human rights during the recent events in Estonia.
(EL) The conflict between Estonia and Russia is not a bronze statue; it has to do with the insulting rewriting of history.
It is an insult to the memory of the million of unknown soldiers who gave their lives in order to crush fascism.
The debate in the European Parliament during the last part-session in Brussels and the approval of the resolution expressing solidarity with the Estonian Government is a conscious policy to support the rewriting of history and the revival of fascism in the Baltic and other states.
We have repeatedly condemned with facts known to everyone that a methodical effort was made in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania after 1991 to restore the collaborators of the SS and German fascism.
At the same time, they started demolishing monuments to the Red Army.
In July 2004, the monument to the Estonian anti-fascist Lembit PÃ€rn was demolished and a monument was erected to the Waffen-SS commander Alfons Rebane.
In Latvia, the Salaspils concentration camp, where 100 000 adults and 4 000 children were murdered, was named a 'reformatory and labour camp' by the government.
In Romania, the collaborator with Nazi Germany, Prime Minister Ion Antonescu, was acquitted on charges of war crimes.
Waffen-SS murderers and torturers are given pensions and looked on as freedom fighters in the Baltic States.
The Council is silent in the face of all these accusations and questions by the members of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament.
It does not surprise us.
Fascism is the pure child of capitalism.
We do not agree with Putin. However, we do wonder, when you wipe out over 20 million dead, why you are so insulting and call for respect for international conventions.
You are rewriting history, but the facts do not change.
It is an historic truth that it was the Red Army, with the communists, the Soviet Union, at the vanguard that crushed fascism in eastern and central Europe and raised the red flag with the hammer and sickle on the Reichstag.
It was and still is the permanent nightmare that will always mark the defeat for those who dreamed of global sovereignty ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, Russia regrettably will not wake up to the new geopolitical reality that the so-called 'near-abroad', where it exercised total power for most of the last century, from the Caucuses to Ukraine, is no longer a reality.
The Baltic States are now also proud, independent EU Member States and it is right and proper that the EU and NATO, which they have joined, should show total solidarity when Russia attempts to bully the smallest of them - Estonia - over what is entirely a sovereign internal matter of that newly independent republic.
Many might question the political wisdom of moving the statue of a so-called Soviet liberator.
However, I, fortunately, come from a country that has never experienced the brutal Stalinist invasion and annexation that these countries have.
One must appreciate that most Estonians do not see the Soviets as liberators but as tyrants, who extinguished the independence and freedom they enjoyed in the inter-war period.
The relocation of the statue and fallen Russian soldiers was conducted according to international law and it in no way justified the Duma resolutions calling for the resignation of the Estonian Government; the subsequent violent demonstrations; the cyber-attacks on Estonia's sophisticated system of e-government; the outrageous use of Nashi, an extreme nationalist organisation, to harass the Estonian Embassy - in violation of the Vienna Conventions, and on the back of a similar strategy adopted against the British Ambassador, Anthony Brenton, who attended the Kasparov rally last year.
If it wants good relations after the summit with the EU as a whole and if it wants to negotiate a new PCA, Russia must appreciate that it has to respect all the EU Member States equally.
The cosy bilateral days of former Chancellor SchrÃ¶der, now richly rewarded by President Putin with a cushy job after his retirement, are well and truly over.
The new EU leaders, such as Sarkozy and Merkel, are going to get much tougher with Russia in future.
(Applause)
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your clear message that Russia must not treat Estonia as its province or constituent republic.
The Bronze Soldier was just a pretext.
If there had not been that, something else would have been found, possibly elsewhere.
This was an attempt to create a rift not only within Estonia, but also within the European Union; an attempt by Russia to create instability that would justify greater interference and help direct attention away from its own removed monuments.
As former Minister of Population and Ethnic Affairs, I confirm that this was not an ethnic conflict, that is to say one between Estonians and Russians.
Although in many respects we have different views of history and its symbols, I confirm to you that those few thousand youths who rioted do not represent the Russian minority in Estonia.
Those who came onto the streets shouted 'Rossiya, Rossiya'.
We are proud of our Russians who see Estonia as their home, and we will try to do everything we can to restore peace.
We cannot change the past, and it is unlikely that we could change the attitude towards it, but we can shape a common vision of the future.
A large part of the population has today adopted the position 'different past, common future'.
(SV) The riots following the removal of the bronze soldier in Tallinn were a shock for all those who have made efforts to integrate the Russian-speaking population into Estonian society and to strengthen the bonds between the population groups in Estonia.
Estonia now needs the maximum amount of support and solidarity from the EU and its Member States in order to move on from this setback, harmonise the relationship between the country's language groups and stabilise the whole society.
Estonia must not be exposed to undue pressure and interference from Russia.
That is important for the whole of the European Union.
Estonia has proud traditions and all the prerequisites of success.
As long ago as 1920, the Russian-speaking minority was given a strong position by Estonia's first constitution.
An important step now would be to set up an Estonian TV channel broadcasting in Russian.
At present, too many Russian-speaking Estonians are exposed to one-sided information from Russia.
(PL) Mr President, let us take a broader view of this issue.
The recent EU-Russia summit in Samara resulted in a change in our mutual relationship, as the existence of solidarity within the Union became apparent to the new Member States.
Thanks are due to the President of the Council and the President of the Commission for this.
It may be deemed disappointing that no progress was achieved in the talks. Nonetheless, the Samara summit should be regarded in a positive light.
This is because the development of relations between the Union and Russia is conditional on Russia's respect for the sovereignty of individual Member States of the Union and on Russia abandoning tactics that involve exerting political pressure through economic instruments or the use of information technology.
Unfortunately, the Russian authorities have failed to take this on board.
The cyber-attacks on Estonia have not ceased, and the embargo on Polish meat is still in place.
The trail left by Alexander Litvinienko's murderers leads to Moscow.
All the Union can do is to maintain pressure.
We cannot attempt to understand contemporary Russia without considering its attitude to the past.
As a prerequisite for long-lasting and constructive relationship with Russia, the Union needs to develop a common vision of that past.
With that in mind, it would be helpful to create some kind of 'Truth and Reconciliation Charter'.
(SV) I think that what has happened in Tallinn since April of this year is eminently clear to everyone. I am uncertain, however, as to whether everyone understands its significance.
The previous debates in Parliament on this subject indicate that not everyone understands why certain people have reacted so violently.
Allow me, therefore, to explain.
As early as at the time of his appointment as President, Mr Putin indicated that he would do everything he could to restore to Russia its former military strength and the power that he believes is Russia's due.
If I remember correctly, only one newspaper - a French one - directly picked up on the signals from Russia.
Other media remained unaware of them.
Those of us who speak Russian and who have experience of living close to, or under the thumb of, Russia did, however, understand.
Over the years, it has, however, become ever clearer that Russia is developing in the wrong direction when it comes to human rights, media independence and political freedom.
Otto von Habsburg, one of Europe's most respected political figures, described it as the route back to the time of Stalin.
He is now 95 years old.
He has a perspective on things, and he remembers.
Others appear to have forgotten, however.
In the European Parliament, too, there are Members who appear to have forgotten the trials that had to be endured by the Eastern European countries on their way to freedom, independence and autonomy.
All the threats and boycotts, the interference in other countries' internal affairs and the blackmail involving withheld energy supplies appear to have been forgotten.
A number of these events took place quite recently and are happening right now in some of the countries I would designate as the new Europe.
Some people from the old Europe appear, however, to have forgotten their historic lesson: that it is only through conducting a common foreign policy, showing solidarity and speaking with one voice that we can preserve peace.
This is not about the monument in Tallinn.
The debate is not about Estonia.
It is about Europe and about Europe's sovereignty and independence.
(LV) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, first of all I would like to thank Mr Barroso for saying in Samara that a problem that any Member State has with Russia, even the very smallest state, is also a problem that the European Union has with Russia.
That was fine support for the Member States, the new Member States, and especially Estonia, but even for those politicians who have now lost their rose-coloured spectacles regarding relations with Russia it is vital to understand that attempts will continue to take place to demonstrate that for Russia there still exists the real old Europe and the territories close to its borderland, which, in Russia's view, have temporarily, under the influence of various events, accidentally become part of the European Union.
At the same time there will be new tests of the strength of the European Union's unity, and tests of new virtual weapons, which in modern society can do enormous harm.
So the question is whether the European Union will wait until it runs into more problems with one of the European Union's ex-Soviet bloc Member States, or whether it will be able to urge upon Russia the requirements that any state must fulfil if it wants to become a democratic and prospective member of a partnership.
Thank you.
. - (LV) Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, it is particularly important for Europe not only to display solidarity but also to acknowledge the true reasons for the conflicts that occurred in Estonia.
Europe absolutely must understand that in Estonia there was a clash between Western democracy and the old Soviet totalitarian ideologies.
In recognising this, Europe must unfalteringly reject the historical interpretations of the totalitarian USSR era.
Europe must promote the removal of USSR symbols that offend the inhabitants of nations that were enslaved by the USSR.
Europe must participate in the renewal of historical truth in the occupied Baltic States and elsewhere in eastern Europe.
This might be a precondition for the reconciliation of representatives of differing ideologies and for future integration in the former Soviet-occupied territories.
This is also a joint problem for the whole of Europe.
I would like in particular to stress that the European Parliament ought from now on to be an active participant in achieving these goals of truth and the rule of law.
Thank you.
Mr President, this discussion has clearly shown that the key word is 'solidarity'.
I should like to thank a number of Members for their words of thanks.
Mr Barroso in particular could not have been clearer on this issue.
Many of you know what he said.
His meaning was that aggression against one Member State - in this case Estonia - represents aggression against the whole European Union.
This was a very strong statement and it also showed that divide et impera politics cannot work if Europe speaks with one voice.
These were the main issues and main lessons of these proceedings.
These questions took some considerable time in the discussions in our meeting.
We emphasised again and again that we are working as an EU of 27 Member States and that solidarity will be maintained.
On WTO accession, both sides at Samara recognised that our economic and trading links are larger and more intensive than ever and it was encouraging to hear from the Russian side that they intend to accelerate the process of their accession to the WTO.
It is encouraging because it is in our interests to bind Russia into a rules-based system where it can then be held to account.
This is very important.
On cyber-attacks, it is now up to the Council to work on the Commission communication where we have added a specific paragraph on cyber-terrorism.
I can see there is generally much agreement in this House on how important it is to work on this question of solidarity.
(Applause)
Pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received seven motions for resolution.

Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks (vote)
- Report: Mauro
2.
Roaming on public mobile networks (vote)
- Report: RÃŒbig
- Before the vote:
Mr President, on a point of order, in line with the Rules of Procedure, I would like to declare a pecuniary interest in the RÃŒbig report.
I will not be taking part in the voting on the items in question.
That is very proper.
Most of us have mobile phones!
Mr President, I also rise under Rule 166 to declare a pecuniary interest.
As a Member of the European Parliament and a frequent user of mobile phones, I stand to gain a great deal from this legislation.
Therefore I disqualify myself from voting.
I trust many of my colleagues will join me!
(Laughter)
Well that is noted!
Mr President, following the logic of the last two speakers, will you enquire whether there may perhaps be a solitary Member of the European Parliament who does not possess a mobile phone?
Then that Member can determine whether or not we adopt this legislation!
(Laughter and applause)
I think we can move on now.
- After the adoption of the legislative resolution:
President. Congratulations to Mr RÃŒbig and to the mobile phone users of Europe!
(Applause)
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, my thanks go to the House for its assent and in particular to the Council for having agreed that the Regulation will be put into effect on 27 June at the latest, while what I have to say to those Members who abstained is that we are reducing the cost to the taxpayer.

EC-Mexico: Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement (vote)
- Report: Markov
4.
Excise duty on alcohol (vote)
- Report: Lulling
- After the rejection of the Commission proposal:
I should like to request that the document be referred back to committee, because now we have contradictory voting outcomes.
Because the Commission has not made any proposals, it will automatically be referred back to committee.
That will happen anyway.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I proposed to my group and to many of my fellow Members who supported me that they reject the report, because the line that I had proposed has not been followed and because I have the impression that, in view of the close outcome of the vote, certain Members of this House did not know what they were voting for.
(Protests)
Sorry, were unaware of the significance of their votes.
Furthermore, Mr President, given that the Commission is keeping quiet - even though Commissioner KovÃ¡cs spoke twice last night while I, the rapporteur, was not allowed to respond to him - I really must highlight its powerlessness.
We made a proposal in order to break the deadlock.
Unfortunately, we have not been supported, Mr President.
Therefore, there is no report by Parliament on this proposal, and the Commission and the Council can persist in maintaining the status quo and persevere in their state of deadlock.
(Applause)
There will of course be a debate when the matter comes back before the House.

Composition of the delegation to EUROLAT (vote)
6.
The exclusion of health services from the Services Directive (vote)
- Report: Vergnaud
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am taking the floor simply to point out to the House that there has been an error.
Indeed, as the same sentence appears in three different paragraphs, Parliament's services have rightly deleted paragraphs 47 and 53 from the report, since this sentence appears in its entirety in paragraph 51.
I simply wished to inform my fellow Members of this matter.
7.
Structural policies and EU cohesion (vote)
- Report: Pleguezuelos Aguilar
8.
The EU's Aid for trade (vote)
- Report: David Martin
9.
The economic partnership agreements (vote)
- Report: Sturdy
- Before the vote on Amendment 23:
(NL) Mr President, the last sentence of Amendment 23 now reads 'calls on the EU to set up the compensation mechanisms required to avert consequences of this sort'.
This has met with opposition, for it seems to imply that we, the EU, should carry all financial consequences.
In order to avoid this misinterpretation, I would suggest an oral amendment according to which it would read 'calls on the EU to help to set up the compensation mechanisms required to avert consequences of this sort'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
10.
Common Foreign and Security Policy 2005 (vote)

- After the vote:
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when paragraph 10 was voted on, the Italian translation stated paragraph 11, meaning that I voted differently than I would otherwise have done.

That concludes the vote.

The next item is the vote.
(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
(DE) Mr President, while I do endorse Mr Mauro's report, I do regret the absence from it, as also from the Commission draft, of any reference to Community grants being tied to measures for protection against noise from rail and road traffic.
However much development work might need to be done, the people living nearby also need to be considered, and not only their health but also their acceptance of the work.
I therefore urge that the rules on protection against noise for rail vehicles be amended as soon as possible to make reference to lower maximum levels and to promote noise abatement measures in exactly the same way as they promote the extension of trans-European networks.
(DE) Mr President, I have voted against the Mauro report on the grounds that the amount of traffic in Europe is increasing enormously and that overcrowded roads and permanent traffic jams presage the collapse of the transport system.
Although it was many years ago that we decided what projects would form the Trans-European Transport networks, we are lagging far behind when it comes to putting them in place, so that what should be Europe's masterpiece is still more like a piece of patchwork.
We must also do something about making rail travel more appealing, and I believe that should be done not only for transnational traffic, but also, and to an increasing extent, for local travel.
Although the proposal for a regulation on the granting of Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport and energy networks provides for an increase in the current level of Community cofinancing, it falls short of what the original proposal as regards both the transport and energy networks, due to the detrimental agreement on the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
There is a further fundamental issue at stake here.
The 'trans-European networks' are implemented with Community and Member State funding - in other words, clearly public funding - with the aim of completing the internal market, as explained in point 1 of the Council common position: 'strong and integrated energy and transport networks are the cornerstone of the European internal market and that better use of the existing networks and the completion of missing links will make it possible to increase effectiveness and competitiveness.'
In other words, the completion of the internal market lies at the heart of these projects, with the opening up of the markets and with key sectors in the economy of a country being handed over to private interests, once, of course, public investment has been made.
Given the importance of these sectors to the development of any country, we argue that they should be kept in the public sector and are thus opposed to its privatisation.
in writing. Mr President, my group wanted to see our amendments incorporated to this report which would have increased the powers of Parliament over future budgets on trans-European Energy and Transport networks, though they were unsuccessful.
However, it remains important that this area of investment remain under close parliamentary scrutiny as it represents such a clear instance of 'EU added value'.
The EU has broken down barriers across Europe for many years, yet so many infrastructural barriers remain in energy and must be addressed.
Scotland in particular has much to contribute to Europe's energy needs but we need the necessary connections to do so, and I will be exploring all ways to lever EU funding into connections to maximise Scotland's green energy potential.
(HU) I believe this has been one of the most important votes, at least from our citizens' point of view.
Ordinary citizens know little about EU legalities.
They are more interested in finding out what EU membership means in their daily life.
When borders crumble, when one can cross from one country to another without a passport, the question arises: why must we pay extra punitive charges for getting in touch by telephone across borders?
I think the best thing would have been for Parliament to decide to abolish completely all roaming charges and declare that all mobile rates within the European Union shall be identical.
However, I admit this would have been difficult to implement as a first step, and therefore welcome the fact that at least we have come to the gradual reduction of roaming fees.
10 million people live in Hungary and 9.5 million of them use mobile telephones.
In my opinion, it was extremely important to vote for this.
(CS) I voted against the proposals on roaming calls, for the following reasons.
Firstly, these measures are not economic but rather political in nature.
They are an expression of protectionism and the new form of European commercialism.
Secondly, they go against the principle of supply and demand.
Thirdly, although I do not expect the mobile operators to make up for the shortfall by raising prices on the domestic market, they will presumably cut investment in development and almost certainly break the cycle of falling domestic prices.
The most worrying aspect for the EU is that investors will lose confidence, as they will see that the regulatory body is moving the goalposts in the middle of the game.
in writing. It makes a pleasant change to welcome a piece of EU legislation.
The enforced reduction in mobile roaming charges is good for consumers across Europe.
Though still high at 35p per minute to make a call and 17p per minute to receive a call, they are set to fall further over the next three years.
Now reductions must be obtained on texting and email connections.
in writing. UKIP MEPs, like all MEPs in Parliament, have a vested interest in reduced mobile roaming charges.
Therefore, UKIP MEPs will not vote on the RÃŒbig report.
UKIP believes it is morally wrong for MEPs to vote on an issue which could lead to personal enrichment.
Moreover, we never approve of EU regulation.
in writing. I warmly welcome the new deal on mobile roaming charges.
Labour MEPs have been campaigning for two years to introduce these measures which represent a genuine triumph for European consumers and could not have been achieved without the EU.
For too long mobile phone companies have been charging outrageous sums to people using their phones elsewhere in the EU.
It is a shame that Conservative MEPs sided with the mobile phone industry to oppose consumer protection, making the case for higher charges to be levied.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the RÃŒbig report on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community because the positions upheld in this report are going to make it possible significantly to improve the situation of European consumers.
Many European citizens, including the inhabitants of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais border area, frequently travel abroad, for professional and personal reasons, and the tariffs currently in force when they make or receive calls on their mobiles are excessive and unjustifiable.
The RÃŒbig report remedies a situation that penalises mobility.
I am therefore in favour of the fixed tariffs in this report: the costs per minute that have been adopted are totally satisfactory and much lower than those currently applied.
We would, however, have preferred even lower tariffs, which could have provided a better incentive for people to move about Europe.
In addition to significantly reduced tariffs, the requirement for transparency that has been requested is an important principle.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament also sought greater transparency concerning the cost of calls and secured a result whereby, from now on, European citizens will be able to know how much a call received or sent from abroad will cost them.
I voted in favour of the RÃŒbig report on roaming on public mobile networks in the Community.
I feel that the preliminary agreement between Parliament and the Presidency of the Council on the text of the regulation, which MEPs from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament played a key role in formulating, represents a significant victory for the consumer.
I feel that these measures will prove vital for the future of the information society.
They will enable us to save billions of euros and better to serve the consumers' interests.
The reduction in roaming rates will make it possible to break down the remaining barriers in the internal market, thereby strengthening European competitiveness.
This regulation states that its ultimate aim is to 'create a smooth-running European internal market in telecommunications.'
This, as the report says, is because 'self-regulation does not work'.
It is interesting to note, in this case, the acknowledgement that the market does not work.
Hence the need to regulate prices.
They therefore propose both wholesale and retail price regulation, including the creation of a regulated retail price - Eurotariff - which all operators will be obliged to offer, in order to achieve a significant reduction in the price of roaming.
Even so, the possibility remains of huge profit margins for the large operators in the sector.
That being said, there are advantages for consumers: cheaper international calls, without this cost being transferred to national markets, and the freedom to choose the most favourable operator and tariff.
This is another example of the 'market' clearly not protecting users and consumers, and this is why regulation is needed.
It is high time the Commission and the Member States acknowledged this in other areas and brought benefit to consumers.
There are times - extremely rare times in this House - when the Members are asked to vote on a text that is genuinely useful for Europeans and when, for once, Europe provides real added value.
Such was the case a few years ago for cross-border credit transfers in the euro zone: European legislation stipulated that the cost of cross-border transfers be the same as that of national transfers.
This was merely very logical and very normal, since the single currency had just been brought in.
It is the case today for the regulation on mobile telephone roaming charges.
Though imperfect, like all compromises, this text will nevertheless make it possible to monitor more effectively the prohibitive tariffs set by operators on Community international communications.
Furthermore, the revision clause, which will be laid down in 18 months' time, will, we hope, be an opportunity to go further in terms of protecting consumers.
in writing. (SV) The report contains many practical proposals with a view to improving the situation for consumers.
The June List welcomes these proposals which, when it comes to consumer information and easily accessible price information, are to people's advantage.
Roaming fees certainly seem absurdly high at present.
Before a decision is made on political measures, however, it must be made clear what market failure is behind this unsatisfactory state of affairs.
Is it a question of insufficient competition through what is known as implicit collusion?
In that case, it would be quite wrong to introduce price regulation, as this would do nothing at all to solve the problem.
To propose treatment without a prior diagnosis would be absurd.
Researchers in this area should investigate what market failure we are facing before populist measures are taken.
In the long run it is free competition rather than price regulation that will most benefit consumers.
To allow politicians to set prices instead of the market is almost never a constructive long-term solution.
In my opinion, the proposal will also hit that part of the population that, for economic or other reasons, seldom travels abroad.
in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of the report on the proposal relating to the Regulation of the European Parliament and Council concerning roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community and amending Directive 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications - C6-02442006 -
Mr RÃŒbig correctly pointed out the need to find solutions that would allow EU citizens to use mobile phones to contact home while abroad.
There is no single market for mobile telephony at the moment, and this is a barrier to the daily use of telephones abroad.
I agree with the formula which sets maximum wholesale and retail rates.
It is very important to reduce the unreasonably high levels of roaming tariffs, to explain to users how to activate new tariffs and to inform them of the date the above legislation takes effect.
Another positive initiative is that any customer who does not choose any particular tariff within three months of the Regulation becoming effective will automatically enjoy the regulated EU tariff, and the fact that mobile phone operators will have to inform their customers of the roaming charges for outgoing and incoming calls for their particular tariffs.
in writing. - (FR) It was with a heavy heart that I voted in favour of the report on roaming on public mobile networks because it goes against my most important political convictions.
Indeed, I regard any tariff-fixing by the legislator as undue intervention in the market economy and as a vestige of another era that ought not to be revived.
The application of the Eurotariff thus set will create big problems for operators from the small Member States, who will have difficulty in funding the investments needed to apply the new roaming conditions.
The long-term effects of this regulation could even end in an increase in national communications tariffs, which would be counterproductive and disastrous for the proper functioning of the national economies.
I support transparent price setting and a reduction in roaming charges in a spirit of free competition, but this reduction must not be achieved by means of retail price fixing and at the expense of national communications tariffs.
I am also pleased that the 'opt-in' principle has been safeguarded in this compromise, even though an 'opt-in' with no conditions or time limits would have been preferable.
This regulation has a mere three-year lifespan: what a consolation!

in writing. I supported this first-reading compromise agreement.
This is an important victory which will benefit consumers, who will be able to enjoy cheaper roaming costs by this summer.
in writing. I voted for the report on the proposal for a regulation on roaming on public mobile networks, which will lead to a reduction in prices for millions of roaming customers.
The initiative will help an enormous number of consumers who are affected by the roaming charges that are unjustifiably high.
The regulation will ensure that prices paid for international roaming when travelling within the European Union will not be unjustifiably higher than the charges for calls paid within the user's country.
Consumers will benefit from lower prices for making calls in the visited country, back home or to any other EU Member State.
Consumers will also make considerable savings when receiving calls.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left voted in favour of the RÃŒbig report on roaming because, following pressure from the European Parliament, a satisfactory compromise was achieved for the benefit of European consumers.
Of course a great many steps still need to be taken in the direction of transparent charges and extending the scope of and further reducing the uncontrolled charges made by mobile telephone companies.
The procedure also needs to be speeded up before the Telecommunications Council, so that the regulation can be adopted as quickly as possible and consumers can benefit from the regulations already introduced this summer.
This regulation must set an example.
Regulatory frameworks need to be created in other sectors where the rules of the free market have proven to be inadequate and cartels reign supreme.
Current roaming prices penalise users travelling between different Member States and constitute an obstacle to a genuine single market.
In view of the cross-border nature of the contractual relations involved in these services, the Member States have shown they are scarcely capable of tackling this issue.
Although the solution ought ideally to lie in the sector regulating itself, this again has proved impossible.
Europe's consumers deserve fairer, more transparent treatment.
A Europe-wide regulatory amendment is therefore called for, one that stops abuse, creates transparency, ensures balance in the market, enables greater ease of movement and communication, and fosters greater economic dynamism.
Although the limits on the price of calls fall well short of what Parliament initially called for, I feel this is a first step in the right direction.
It also introduces the kind of clarity and predictability that the market has been missing.
I hope that the operators do not react to the loss of revenue with an unjustified increase in the price of national calls, but instead take the opportunity to raise revenue by increasing the number of customers and by improving the services they provide both nationally and internationally.
in writing. - (FR) By endorsing the regulation on mobile telephone roaming charges this lunchtime, the European Parliament has just adopted legislation that was awaited by millions of consumers: workers or tourists, exasperated by the exorbitant costs of cross-border calls made or received on the GSM and who have gained the support of the European Commission, as the author of this legislative proposal.
Furthermore, although my liberal philosophy does not sit well with interventionism on market prices, I am above all opposed to the laissez-faire, lax approach and to cartels being formed in a given economic sector.
This European law is a significant advance when it comes to protecting consumers, who are going to see their bills slashed by as much as 70%.
A further advance is the freedom of choice given to operators to offer clients an option between the regulated tariff and a fixed tariff that will also cover SMSs and MMSs.
I have one regret, however: this reduction in roaming charges will not be operational for the summer season.
Europeans will find consolation in this desire clearly expressed by the three European institutions to try to win them back and to fulfil the first task: to make laws that change their everyday lives for the better.
in writing. (SV) I abstained from voting on the roaming issue today.
Anyone who has ever been abroad knows how expensive it is to make and receive calls, but there are dangers in the EU setting price ceilings.
I would have been able to accept regulation at wholesaler level governing, for example, the relationship between Telia and a company in Spain, but I do not approve of setting a ceiling on prices for the consumer.
It would not be a ceiling but a floor.
If the ceiling is set at 49%, it is obviously that percentage that the companies will deduct.
Companies' profits would decline as they would previously have had revenue that could be used for competing in the national arena.
If profits disappeared, this might lead to companies having to increase their national prices.
The EU would then, instead, have weakened the vulnerable consumer whom it had always maintained it wanted to protect.
The mobile market is a relatively new market.
In Sweden, the market adjusted gradually and prices have fallen significantly.
If only the system had been made more transparent, better technical solutions sought and the information systems spoken of in the proposal introduced, these measures would presumably have been enough to force prices down.
Roaming prices have fallen substantially, and although this has certainly happened unevenly throughout Europe, it is still a sign that the market is regulating itself.
in writing. I voted in favour of this measure as so many European citizens are affected by higher than necessary roaming charges.
The reduction of costs for so many people and businesses is a very useful contribution to peoples' private pockets, as well as business costs.
The function of the mobile telephony market is to allow the maximum efficiency of the industry, while striking the right balance in consumer interests.
in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of the report on the proposal relating to the Regulation of the European Parliament and Council concerning roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community and amending Directive 2002/21/EC on the common regulatory framework for electronic communications.
When we adopted the Lisbon Agenda, our aim was to turn the European Union into the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy.
For that reason we must ensure that the market for mobile phone technology within the European Union is a dynamic market with no internal barriers.
Currently about 80% of EU citizens have a mobile phone, but mobile phone roaming charges are so high that they limit demand for this service.
However, mobile telephony is not restricted to voice communication, but also includes other types of new-generation communication such as GPS, Wi-Fi and remote Internet access.
These are very advanced technologies, which are a particularly important element in helping to promote a knowledge-based economy.
For this reason we cannot afford to allow their usage and their development to be stifled by exorbitant price barriers.
in writing. UKIP MEPs, like all MEP's in the Parliament, have a vested interest in reduced mobile roaming charges.
Therefore, UKIP MEPs will not vote on the Rubig report.
UKIP believes it is morally wrong for MEPs to vote on an issue which could lead to personal enrichment.
Moreover, we never approve of EU regulation.
(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the introduction of excise duties on alcohol and alcoholic beverages in 1992 was the start of attempts to coordinate taxes in the creation of a common market.
This was and is a complex process.
So far there has been partial success in managing to coordinate indirect taxes, setting a minimal level for alcohol, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fuel.
However, in reality, taxation policy has remained under the jurisdiction of the Member States.
Increasing excise duty based on EU inflation indices for 1993-2006 is not logical.
Why does this rate of inflation have to be applied to countries that joined the EU after 2004?
Complete abolition of excises based on the fact that these are small incomes for Member States is also not justified.
Following the aim of the introduction of excise duties, analogically one ought also to abolish tobacco and fuel excise duties.
I support maintaining the status quo, not changing excises and allowing Member States, based on the principle of subsidiarity, to further set their own tax levels. All the more so, because among the Member States themselves there is no common agreement on the abolition of excises.
(DE) Mr President, I have done what the rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, actually wanted people to do, and voted against her report on the grounds that it seeks the increase of more taxes, this time reheating the old familiar argument that this is needed to prevent distortions of competition, although it now turns out that - as the experts had predicted - the minimum rates brought in in 1992 did no more than widen the gulf between the rates in the Member States, some of which increased their rates repeatedly and now want the others to be compelled to do likewise.
To act on this proposal would, I believe, be seen by the public as another outrage by Brussels.
in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats should ideally have liked to have seen Parliament being able to support the Commission's original proposal for an increase in minimum taxes that took account of inflation since 1993.
Since the vote was predicted to be very close, we chose to support the amendments aimed at increasing minimum taxes so that they took account of inflation since the 2004 enlargement.
