We do not therefore share the view that it is to be deplored that the flag and the anthem were taken out of the treaty.
Unlike the majority in Parliament, we believe that it is good that an 'emergency accelerator' has been introduced into the decision-making procedure in areas that are sensitive in terms of national sovereignty.
We are advocates of the subsidiarity principle and therefore reject the call made by the European Parliament for referendums in the Member States.
It is a matter which each Member State must itself decide.
Lastly, we would like to comment on the vote on Amendment 36 concerning the Laval case.
We chose to vote against the first part because we consider that there are differences between the old treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, for example in the Charter of Rights, which lays down among other things the right to take strike action in accordance with national practice.
We support the provisions of the Charter of Rights and we also support the second part of the amendment which safeguards the right to industrial disputes.
We wish to point out that this view is shared by our political group in Parliament which chose to vote against the proposal because the report concerns the treaty and not the Laval case.
in writing. - Although UKIP rejects the Lisbon Treaty, we abstained on amendment 31 because we do not agree with the justification for the amendment.
I still firmly believe that, as President Sarkozy was not going to organise a referendum, abstention was the position the Socialists had to take in the French parliament.
However, just because the French President did a poor job of negotiating this Treaty and ignored the vote of the French people, that does not mean we should not respond to the question being put before us today.
The Treaty is far from perfect, but it enables us to bring the institutional debate to a close and equip Europe with rules that allow it to function.
Today, the Socialists should make themselves heard on policy changes, the main issue in the revision of the financial perspective, on the French Presidency of the European Union, and on the PSE's commitment in drawing up its manifesto for the next European elections.
A 'no' would have made it possible to remove the policies from the text of what should have been a Constitution, as it forced Europe to focus on the issue of what the European project was all about.
This is very important.
However, because I want this text to be passed so I can get fully involved in the forthcoming negotiations on policies, because my 'no' more than two years ago was pro-European, I am shouldering my responsibilities and approving the Treaty of Lisbon.
in writing. - (PL) I abstained in the final vote on the report on the Lisbon Treaty, because the report has gone well beyond the agreements reached at the EU summits in Brussels and Lisbon.
The Lisbon Treaty was a very difficult compromise for all parties involved.
Going beyond this compromise - as evidenced by the mentions of an absence of EU symbols, agreements on the Council voting system relating to opt-in and opt-out clauses and the Charter of Fundamental Rights - is politically damaging to the process of ratification.
Moreover, I cannot support the points that prepare the ground for campaigns aimed at constitutionalising the Union.
in writing. - (PT) The Treaty of Lisbon is the best compromise for overcoming the institutional crisis and bringing greater flexibility to the decision-making mechanisms that are essential for an enlarged European Union of 27 Members to function in today's globalised and constantly changing world.
I applaud the fact that the EU is given legal personality, that the three-pillar structure is abolished in favour of a single institutional framework and across-the-board application of the Community method.
I applaud the measures to improve transparency and accountability, and to strengthen the participation and rights of European citizens both at the information level and through the people's legislative initiative.
I welcome the changes in the area of freedom, security and justice, where action will have more ambitious goals and more effective procedures, no longer using intergovernmental instruments and procedures.
I applaud greater involvement of the national parliaments, in particular in monitoring respect for the principle of subsidiarity.
I am sorry that various concessions had to be made, for example postponing the implementation of important elements, such as the new voting system in the Council, and the British and Irish opt-outs/opt-ins on matters previously covered by the third pillar; I fear that establishing an elected President of the European Council will mean losing the advantages of the rotating Presidencies without bringing any added value for the functioning of the EU, creating problems in relations between the different institutions.
The European Parliament has just approved the Treaty of Lisbon, though nobody was asking it to do so.
The Mouvement pour la France delegation in the European Parliament obviously voted against this report, aware of the purely symbolic nature of doing so.
It is significant that French and Dutch elected representatives sitting in Strasbourg are voting in favour of a Treaty while clearly admitting that it is a clone of the defunct European Constitution, even though their people formally rejected that text.
It is also significant that the European Parliament is voting on a Treaty even though none of its Members has been able to read a consolidated version.
After the Hungarian Parliament ratified it in the dark, the European Parliament is approving a text it has not read.
The MPF delegation in the European Parliament now wishes all the freedom-loving Irish luck: their referendum will not be theirs alone, they will be voting on behalf of everyone who has not been given the chance to do so, particularly the French, whose vote was cast aside.
I voted in favour of this report and support the respective resolution.
However, at the last moment, there was a problem with the voting machine, so I was not physically able to express my total approval.
To place that appropriately on record, I am submitting this explanation of vote.
This is a lamentable European Parliament resolution aimed solely at confusing citizens and putting pressure on Member States to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, since the European Parliament does not have competence for such approval.
Only the Member States can ratify it.
Even so, during the debate and the vote, we supported democratic actions aimed at introducing an element of pluralism into the debate and we stressed the need for greater democracy, demanding referendums.
That is why our group tabled some motions for resolutions which were, unfortunately, rejected, specifically motions expressing our opposition to the Treaty of Lisbon, underlining some of its more worrying aspects, such as the trend towards the militarisation of the European Union in close liaison with NATO, imposing an increase in military spending and providing for the conducting of military operations in order to protect the Union's values and serve its interests.
We also condemn the fact that the provisions of the current Treaties, on which the European Court of Justice recently based its judgments (Judgments in the Laval/Vaxholm and Viking Line cases) to justify social dumping and subordinate the rights of workers to take collective action to respect for the freedom to provide services, have been included in their entirety in the Treaty of Lisbon, requiring that the right to take collective action shall remain under the exclusive competence of the Member States.
in writing. - I welcome this report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Corbett, which both emphasises the fact that the Reform Treaty is not the Constitution, while also enabling Europe to pursue the new global role it will have to play in the coming decades.
It strengthens the institutional power of the Union.
It enhances democracy by empowering the European Parliament.
It enables the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy to develop to ensure that Europe's economic and industrial power is reflected in global politics, and in particular will allow the EU to play a key role in tackling global warming.
I voted 'yes' to the Treaty of Lisbon because there is - unfortunately - no alternative.
However, we must be clear.
It is not with a 300-page mini-treaty that is as unintelligible as it is obscure that the EU will win the trust of its citizens, particularly as the multiple opt-outs will lead to a Europe of constant deadlocks, or even a 'variable-geometry' Europe.
This new Treaty is just a last resort.
We need very quickly to draw up a treaty of radical reform, to be ratified by a single referendum of the European people.
All countries where the voters say 'no' will be free to leave the EU or else submit to the common rules.
That is the price to be paid for a truly integrated European Union with more cohesive policies.
We have rarely come across such a Stalinist report here in this House: it is pure, mendacious propaganda!
It is only here and in 'Sarkozia' that it can be said that the Treaty of Lisbon is fundamentally different from the European Constitution, when the vast majority of EU heads of state and government and the father of the Constitution itself, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, state the exact opposite.
The rapporteurs have indulged in a bit of culture at the start of the explanatory statement, quoting a few lines from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
This quotation explains in substance that you need to follow the underlying forces that lead to the great changes in society, otherwise you will end in ruin and failure.
The problem is that, for them, these forces are the Treaty of Lisbon and the artificial, forced creation of a centralised European superstate, when the real forces, in this affair, are the increasing rejection of this project by the people.
The people aspire to rediscover their roots and their identity, and to find protection against changes they reject but that others want to impose on them: the political constructions that take away their freedoms and the financial globalisation that ruins them.
in writing. - (SV) The majority of this Parliament is showing once again how divorced from reality it is.
The results of referendums clearly have no value if they go against the will of the political establishment.
We in the June List advocate a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon in Sweden.
It is first and foremost for each Member State to decide whether it holds a referendum.
The entire process surrounding a new EU treaty has been a disgrace.
A Convention whose working method was heavily criticised put forward a proposal for an EU constitution.
Then debate was avoided, things were tinkered with and tweaked in order to push through an even more federalist treaty despite a 'no' from the French and Dutch peoples.
We want to see a new treaty that is based on the EU being a forum primarily for intergovernmental cooperation.
We have therefore voted against Parliament's report on the Treaty of Lisbon.
in writing. - (PT) Well might the majority of the European Parliament - which includes members of the Portuguese socialist (PS), social democrat (PSD) and popular right (CDS/PP) parties - proclaim their 'approval' of the proposed EU Treaty which, as many well know, has no value or legal consequence.
They have a different objective: pressure, specifically to ensure that the proposed Treaty is ratified so that it can enter into force on 1 January 2009, and propaganda.
That is why the report deals in obfuscations and omissions, in an attempt to conceal the real content and consequences of the proposed EU Treaty.
To give just a few examples:
On the one hand it describes as 'greater effectiveness' the increased domination of the decision-making process by the great powers of the EU and as 'an increased role for the national parliaments' the transfer of the national parliaments' competences to the supranational institutions of the EU.
On the other hand, it omits: the militarisation of the EU within the framework of NATO; the liberalised single market with its free movement of goods, capital and services in which competition is paramount; Economic and Monetary Union with its euro, its European Central Bank and its Stability Pact; and the liberalisation of international trade as EU policies and objectives.
That is why we voted against it.
in writing. - I am voting plus for this amendment, even though the Lisbon Treaty can only come into force after it is ratified by all Member States - it therefore automatically respects the outcome of Ireland's referendum.
However, I am voting for this amendment, even though it adds nothing to the Report.
in writing. - (SV) As before in matters in relation to the EU's new treaty, I chose to differ from my group and voted against the report on the Treaty of Lisbon.
There are certainly plenty of improvements in the proposal, but I am opposed to the Union's current move towards greater supranationalism.
I want European cooperation at intergovernmental level.
I firmly support the idea of international cooperation to resolve common problems.
There are important tasks that we must carry out together, not least in relation to the environment, human trafficking and social dumping.
However, I believe that the proposal strengthens the primacy of EU law over national law, that more power is taken from the Member States, and that the larger countries are given more power than the small countries.
This is something I am opposed to.
I chose to vote against the amendment proposing that the EU decide on referendums throughout the Union because I believe that it is for each Member State to decide this itself.
in writing. - (PL) In the final vote on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo on the Treaty of Lisbon, I abstained.
The reason I did so was that the conclusions that arise from this report go significantly beyond the framework adopted during the talks at the summits in Lisbon and Brussels (13 and 14 December 2007).
The compromise reached at that time was the result of certain concessions on the part of all the interested parties.
I therefore think that the express criticism of these settlements that is to be found in some of the points of the report in question is not helpful to the process of finding solutions that are capable of being accepted by all parties to the compromises.
This concerns, for example, opt-in and opt-out clauses, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Council voting system and EU symbols, and it also relates to the formulations that lead to a return of the idea that was, after all, rejected, that of a European constitution.
in writing. - British Conservatives voted against this report.
From the start, we have made it clear that this Treaty (Constitution) is not the way forward for Europe.
Conservatives support a Europe of independent states working together to meet the challenges of globalisation, global poverty and global warming - as our priorities - in a cooperative fashion, and we have been clear and consistent in our approach, in full knowledge of the likely effect of the Treaty on our aims and ambitions for Europe.
These things are not achieved by this text or by the aspirations of those who want an integrated European State.
in writing. - I voted for this report, not because I consider that the Lisbon Treaty amendments offer the way to a European Union which is firmly based on a commitment to sustainable development, peace and human rights rather than the market and competition, but because I consider it does have factors which are more positive than our current Treaty arrangements.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is an important addition.
All EU legislation and its implementation at Member State level will now have to be checked against the Charter and can be challenged if it falls short.
Greater codecision will mean more scrutiny and more daylight in the decision-making process.
The Citizens' Initiative is an important step forward.
I have grave concerns about greater military cooperation, which is already under way, and want our national and European Parliament to closely scrutinise this development.
It is crucial that the EU builds on its strengths as a diplomatic and peace-building power.
I believe it is important that EU citizens are involved in the ratification process through referendums and that those results should be respected.
It is the task of governments and the Council to respond practically to that general principle, not this Parliament.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the report on a European Parliament resolution on the Treaty of Lisbon because this Treaty is vital to Europe's further development, and that is absolutely necessary for the further blossoming of the Austrian welfare model and the security of our citizens.
I share the view that, overall, the Treaty represents a major improvement on previous treaties and that it will ensure increased democratic scrutiny in the Union.
I see the growth in democratic value of the European Union firstly in the extension of the co-determination procedure, secondly in the double majority voting mechanism and thirdly in the election of the Commission President by a majority decision of the European Parliament and, last but not least, in the stronger representation of national parliaments through the opportunity to object to violations in relation to the distribution of competences and the opportunity for national parliaments to comment on all of the EU's legislative initiatives.
in writing. - I voted against this report in order to register my objection to the arrogance and disregard shown by political leaders throughout the EU towards the wishes of EU citizens, and to state very clearly that I believe the people of the EU should be given a referendum on this issue.
The Treaty of Lisbon is essentially a repackaging of the old Constitution, which was rejected by France and the Netherlands - two countries where referenda had been allowed.
As a key architect of the original text, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, himself has said that 'The proposals in the original Constitutional Treaty are practically unchanged.
They have simply been dispersed through the old Treaties in the form of amendments.'
I do not oppose the principle of a constitution.
But I oppose this particular one (and the Treaty which reproduces it) because EU citizens deserve better.
While the Treaty includes some positive measures, these are outweighed by negative ones - the further militarisation of the EU, for example, as well as measures to promote greater liberalisation and privatisation.
Worse, it squanders a perfect opportunity to put sustainability and climate security genuinely at the heart of the Union, and fails to bring the EU institutions closer to European citizens.
If there was a competition for the best doctoral thesis on the Treaty of Lisbon, the text of the report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs would deserve first prize and the highest praise.
The resolution is an excellent analysis and critique of the content of this completely incomprehensible Treaty.
Anyone who dreaded the emergence of a centralised, almighty 'superstate' should be more than reassured.
No substantial advances have been made compared with the contents of the Constitutional Treaty, but many things have been abandoned or withdrawn.
The co-rapporteurs note a lack of vision and ambition shown by national leaders in the European arena, and even downright mistrust of the EU and its institutions.
The eurosceptics should be pleased with the concessions: the delay of its entry into force, the retention of unanimity in 72 cases including taxation and the adoption of the multiannual financial framework, derogations, opt-ins and opt-outs, particularly for the UK, and the possibility of 'voluntary withdrawal' from the EU.
Those who deplore the 'concessions which are difficult for Parliament to accept' should take comfort on the one hand from the enhancement of the European Parliament's role as co-legislator and the sharing of its budgetary powers to give parity with the Council, and on the other from the fact that the principle of a double majority will make decision-making in the Council easier.
in writing. - In this report on the Treaty of Lisbon we clearly see that the Treaty will bolster the democratic credentials of the EU.
With greater involvement from both National and European Parliaments in decision-making procedures, we are giving the European people what they have always asked of the EU: a greater voice.
The Treaty's focus on efficient and coherent policy-making, highlighted in the report, will give us the ability to face ever tougher global challenges.
I voted in favour of this report and would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on what is an excellent report on a very sensitive and pivotal issue for the future of the Union.
The hallmark of the draft Constitution voted down by two Member States in 2005 was that it responded to the desires of big business, national governments and the majority in national parliaments, but had little support among voters.
The referendums in the few countries that held one revealed that intense public debate and high turnout lead to many dissenting votes.
People do not want Europe imposing decisions on them that they themselves would never have wanted to take.
They do see Europe as useful in resolving cross-border problems peacefully and in tackling large-scale problems that individual Member States cannot solve alone, but they do not see the use of a Europe that increasingly takes the place of the country in which they live.
The Constitution was a case of tied selling of good and bad things, without the opportunity to edit out the bad points in the fields of the economy and armament.
The new Treaty still bears a strong resemblance to the Constitution.
Rejection of referendums reflects fear of the electorate.
The adoption of the amended Constitution by a clear majority today conveys a clear message: 'People keep out; this Europe is for professional politicians only'.
in writing. - (EL) The EU and its deeply unpopular Treaty cannot hide behind its demagogic claims to be more democratic and social.
Imperialist infighting has been temporarily covered up in order to launch an even greater onslaught on workers' rights and freedoms, and to stage an increase in monopoly profits.
The report on the Lisbon Treaty and the renamed European Constitution is a call for EC legislation to combat the opposition of workers in the Member States.
The alliance of EU political supporters, including the New Democracy and PASOK parties, do not want referendums because they are aware of the opposition of the workers who suffer barbarous capitalism and imperialist aggression.
The Lisbon Treaty and the European Constitution strengthen the EU so that it can operate more efficiently and benefit European monopolies.
As a result, the Lisbon Convention and the European Constitution:
strengthen the unpopular arming of the EU,
promote capitalist restructuring,
develop new policies for exploiting workers and infringing their social rights,
intensify the militarisation of the EU,
adopt the dogma of preventive war,
ratify imperialist interventions, even in Member States,
restrict the sovereign rights of Member States,
abolish the right of veto to the benefit of the stronger countries,
boost and create new mechanisms of repression,
further restrict individual rights and people's freedoms.
The workers of the EU have the power to condemn the European Treaty and the EU itself.
in writing. - (EL) The Lisbon Treaty is a step backwards compared with the European Constitution.
The former has jettisoned none of its neo-liberal cargo: there is absolutely no concept of democratic accountability at the European Central Bank, the Stability and Growth Pact is one-sided and the free market is championed.
At the request of Mr Brown and the KaczyÅski brothers, the Lisbon Treaty has rejected certain positive symbols freely available to each state, such as flags and anthems.
The binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been distorted by an opt-out clause.
We have called for referendums to strengthen public dialogue and citizen participation.
Refusing to hold referendums shows how much of a gap there is between the European elite and the hopes and needs of European citizens, and Euro-indifference and Euro-scepticism are strengthened.
We, the SYN (Coalition of the Left) and the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left, say no to this Treaty: in our daily struggles we are clearing a different path for the EU.
We want to be more part of Europe.
The Europe we crave is politically more united; it has a stronger social and environmental policy, with a substantially increased Community budget, without relinquishing control over the ECB.
Such a Europe is active and independent in its handling of the problems of world peace; it is not at the beck and call of President Bush.
in writing. - (DE) The Lisbon Treaty will make a militaristic Europe possible.
Previous EC and EU treaties do not allow a permanent EU military budget, but the 'start-up fund' (Article 28 paragraph 3) now pays for operational EU military spending.
In addition to the individual states' military budgets, it provides for the EU to have a military budget of its own.
Article 28c paragraph 3 contains the much-criticised mutual aid and assistance obligation to be implemented via a European Defence Agency (Article 28).
Institutional collaboration between the EU and NATO is stipulated in the Treaty (Article 28a paragraph 7).
The right of the Bundestag to decide whether the German Federal Army will be deployed in other countries is significantly undermined.
The Reform Treaty allows for the formation of a military core Europe via 'permanent structured cooperation'.
This creates a primary legislation framework for increased deployment of EU battle groups (Article 28, Protocol 4).
The European Court of Justice is explicitly not competent (Article 11, 240a).
Nor is the European Parliament competent; it is merely kept up to date (Article 21).
This releases future military intervention from democratic control.
This enabling of a militaristic Europe is accompanied by repressive partitioning off of the external borders.
The new Article 62 of the Reform Treaty is designed to effect 'the gradual introduction of an integrated management system for external borders'.
Thanks to the undemocratic enforcement of the Lisbon Treaty by circumventing referendums, the codifying of neoliberal economic policies and the militaristic parts of the document, Europe is developing in completely the wrong direction.
in writing. - (PL) I voted with profound conviction against the Lisbon Treaty, as it violates the principles of democracy.
It is a treaty full of lies and contempt for the voice of the peoples of Europe.
It is a treaty of euphemisms.
Despite the rejection of the Constitution by the French and the Dutch, an expanded version is being introduced in a camouflaged fashion, playing with words and ignoring their votes.
The word 'Constitution' has been replaced by the word 'Treaty'.
The EU President (Prezydent) is called the 'PrzewodniczÄcy', the Minister of Foreign Affairs the High Representative for Foreign Affairs.
This is pure hypocrisy and is aimed at ushering in a new 'superstate' over the heads of the peoples.
At its inception, the EU was about deep economic cooperation.
I also voted against the report because this Parliament has rejected the potential to appeal to the supreme form of democracy: a referendum.
Such an important legal act, of constitutional rank, should be adopted in this particular form.
The scandal is that this Parliament has rejected Amendment 32, obliging the result of a referendum in Ireland to be respected.
Moreover, we have voted in a document that we are not yet familiar with, since there is still no printed consolidated text of the Treaty in the languages of the Member States.
This is controlled democracy, which ignores citizens and refuses to give them a right to vote.
I do not wish to have anything to do with such a democracy, and President PÃ¶ttering's derisive comments after the vote show that democracy in this Parliament, as in Europe, too, is dying.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I strongly oppose this report.
From the outset I have expressed my opposition to the way the Treaty of Lisbon has been devised and ratified.
In fact, I believe that a Treaty cannot simply be ratified by the national parliaments, but it needs a referendum.
Then, looking at the merits of the text itself, I totally disagree with some sections.
In particular, in the third indent of paragraph 6, I utterly deplore the reference to Italy, though implicit.
In fact, the text expresses regret about 'the extra parliamentary seat attributed to a Member State in derogation of the principle of degressive proportionality'.
The truth is, this is all completely false.
With this attribution, even if it comes in the form of an extra seat, discrimination orchestrated to harm Italy has been partially revived.
in writing. - (SV) The Treaty of Lisbon is a crucial step in ensuring a more effective and better-functioning European Union.
I therefore welcome the fact that, together in the European Parliament, we adopted the report on the Treaty of Lisbon.
This means a clearer decision-making structure and more power for the EU's only popularly elected assembly, the European Parliament, a strengthened common foreign policy and new posts, such as the High Representative for Foreign Policy and the President of the European Council.
The treaty means sweeping changes and I therefore support the proposal for a pan-European referendum, an interesting alternative to a Swedish referendum which I think is necessary to give the citizens the opportunity to express their opinion on matters which are of crucial importance for them.
in writing. - This is a very historic moment, the moment when the European Union attempts to drag itself into the 21st century.
Many on the far right of this Parliament fear an effective European Union because it will diminish their ability to stoke up fear at a national level.
Hence their almost hysterical demands on the one hand and total unacceptable behaviour on the other.
I congratulate our twin rapporteurs on their work.
We must all remember that what we have here is a reform treaty and an amending treaty that will ensure that an EU of 27 can work effectively and, more importantly, work closely with the citizens of the European Union.
I will support this report in the hope that this will send a message not only to our citizens but to our member state Governments that this Parliament is serious in its desire to see a more accountable and more effective European Union.
in writing. - I would like to add my support to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m's point on ensuring that women are represented in the four senior posts in the EU.
For too long these top EU posts have been seen as 'male, pale and stale'.
We must move away from the perception of an 'all boys club' to a more representative grouping running the EU.
Women deserve to be represented.
in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of the report by Mr Corbett and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo on the Treaty of Lisbon.
The report correctly points out that the changes introduced by the new Treaty will make the principles by which the EU acts more democratic and more appropriate to the future development of the Community.
One important element is the strengthening of the role of both the European Parliament and national parliaments, as well as the introduction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It should also be pointed out that a more effective decision-making process has been introduced for EU institutions.
in writing. - (SV) The constitution should be rejected.
We need a new constitution, not just a new name.
A fundamental revision is needed which, like a constitution in the normal sense, limits and clarifies the powers of the European Court of Justice and the role of the EU.
It is important to define which matters are of a supranational nature, i.e. matters such as free trade, climate change, the fight against international crime, terrorism, and integration.
It is notable that in all these areas Britain has been a driving force throughout the development of the EU.
My view is that Sweden should demand the same exceptions Britain was given, both its opt-in and its opt-out clauses.
There is no reason to treat Sweden any differently.
Sweden's citizens have voted 'no' to the euro and it would only be reasonable for the next treaty to make clear that Sweden is not required to participate in monetary cooperation.
None of this can be found in the current proposal, which is why I have chosen to vote against the report.
In the first place, we think it should be up to each country, in accordance with its practices, traditions and specific needs, to decide how to organise, collect and compile the relevant data, although we would acknowledge that sometimes it is necessary to have agreements in order to have comparable data and carry out comparable studies for various countries.
In our opinion, however, the proposal for a regulation presented by the European Commission did not seem to us to offer due protection of confidentiality or to respect the various aspects entailed in the whole complex process of collecting such data.
In the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs it was strongly argued that the proposal should be adopted at first reading, reflecting there too an eagerness to see all the conditions in place for the possible entry into force of the new Treaty.
Although we supported some of the proposals introduced during the parliamentary stage of work, we have our doubts about the results achieved on the basis of the agreement between Parliament's main political groups.
That is why we abstained.
in writing. - (SV) This report recommends that Member States' population and housing censuses be harmonised to a degree that is slightly absurd.
In our view the Member States must decide independently whether they wish to register everything from the generational composition of private households to the distance from the place of usual residence to green spaces and recreation grounds.
We consider that both the Council regulation and Parliament's report make excessively detailed and intrusive proposals.
We have therefore voted against both on Parliament's amended proposal and in the final vote.
in writing. - (SV) Today we voted on Ona JukneviÄienÄ's report on population and housing censuses.
We chose to vote against it in the final vote.
The Member States are capable themselves of dealing with matters relating to population and housing censuses and this is an area in which the EU does not need to interfere.
in writing. - The accuracy and reliability of information on population and housing is essential for effective policies to be implemented at EU and national level.
In the past, the inconsistencies arising between different Member States have rendered international comparisons difficult and so I welcome moves to clarify the issues involved.
I have also been aware, however, that these issues raise questions regarding data protection and I acknowledge the hard work done in committee to address these concerns.
I was accordingly able to support Amendment 71 and the report as a whole.
in writing. - I welcome this proposal for a regulation on population and housing censuses.
In formulating a common set of European guidelines that allow for Europe-wide comparison of statistics, we will improve the EU's ability to formulate legislation that is consistent with the changing needs of people around Europe.
I voted in favour of the report.
in writing. - I understand the need for adequate reliable statistics to be gathered for planning purposes.
I also recognise that this report is a significant improvement on the Commission proposal.
However, I have a number of problems with the idea of the EU gathering statistics at this level of detail.
Some questions are frankly not the concern of the EU.
What possible relevance is people's marital status to the EU?
Also, while there are some guarantees concerning anonymity and data protection, I am concerned that they may not be strong enough, particularly in the light of recent very large-scale failures in data protection.
For these reasons I voted against the legislative resolution.
As we have experienced, cultural differences can escalate at any time.
In this respect, we in Europe, especially in the larger urban agglomerations, are sitting on a powder keg that cannot be underestimated.
In respect of the ethnically determined conflicts that flare up from time to time, it is therefore a good thing that the EU apparently wants to ask questions about ethnic background and religion at last, in an EU-wide census in 2011.
Statistical data on the ethnic and cultural make-up of the resident population could assist the prevention of violence.
It is very important to have reliable data on population and housing in the European Union, since those data are of paramount importance for planning, administering and monitoring various policies, which frequently contain a European component.
High quality annual population estimates are needed because they have implications for two fundamental axes of the European Union: the Union's democratic process, where the annual population estimates are used for the strict calculation of qualified majority voting in the Council, and also for the purposes of convergence of the Structural Funds, the main priority of the EU's cohesion policy, specifically in determining which regions are eligible.
I therefore think that this proposal is of considerable political importance insofar as it helps us to meet more precisely the criteria for democracy, development and cohesion in the European Union.
It is a success for the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance that the Commission proposal for this regulation was not simply passed through Parliament as a routine matter.
With our tenacity, we Greens have managed to ensure that this regulation guarantees protection where sensitive information is collected in the area of population and living situations.
The voluntary annex, which provided for the collection of microdata and questions on extremely sensitive topics such as sexual behaviour and literacy, has been deleted entirely.
In addition, thanks to pressure from the Greens, the European Data Protection Supervisor was called in on two occasions.
From his point of view, data protection has been taken into account sufficiently in the amended draft that is now before Parliament.
For example, the regulation contains our amendment referring to the observation of data protection provisions both in the Member States and at EU level.
Furthermore, there are now clear references to data protection provisions for data transmission and processing.
With this extra support to bolster it, the regulation now delivers what it was meant to - that is, not the collection of new data, but simply the standardisation of the collection of statistical data on the most important social and economic characteristics of regions that is already taking place at national level, in order to be able to make comparisons across Europe.
The standardisation of European data will ensure that regional funding is effectively applied to those areas that are most in need of it.
in writing. - (SV) Explanation of vote concerning the proposal on population and housing censuses.
Today the European Parliament decided at first reading on the Commission proposal for a new regulation on population and housing censuses.
Good intentions lie behind the proposal, with a view to making it easier to compare population and housing census statistics.
However, the final result is extremely far-reaching in terms of the information that is required.
In its proposal the Commission stated that each Member State should collect information on its citizens, such as sexual orientation, dates of women's first marriage and current marriage, ethnicity, religion and number of children born alive.
It is very startling that our Commission is presenting a proposal that includes such intrusive questions and which in practice amounts to registration of citizens.
Today Parliament weeded out some of the most far-reaching questions.
However, I chose to vote against the proposal in its entirety as it still goes too far.
in writing. - British Conservatives have consistently supported the aims and the core policies of the Lisbon Strategy.
In particular, we have highlighted the importance of a fully functioning single market in goods and services, creating a better business environment (especially for SMEs), stimulating innovation and introducing labour market reforms that focus on skills, flexibility and encouragement to create new jobs.
We have voted in favour, once again, of this annual motion for a resolution on the Lisbon Strategy to show our continued support for the underlying reform agenda.
However, this does not imply that we support all of the detailed recommendations that have been included.
In particular, we are absolutely against the additional social measures (except for pension portability) set out in the original version of Article 41.
We also reject the integration of transport into the Lisbon Treaty, as set out in Article 27, and we take the opportunity of reaffirming our strong view that, in the UK, this Treaty must be subject to ratification by the electorate through a referendum.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the resolution on the Lisbon Strategy and the input to the Spring 2008 European Council, since I think that the renewed Lisbon Strategy enhances the ambitious objectives relating to European society as a whole, which seem essential for facing the opportunities and challenges of globalisation, demographic change, social imbalances, climate change, energy security, food security, economic growth and the integration of immigrants.
Strict implementation of the Lisbon Strategy will therefore be decisive for buttressing Europe's competitive position in the global market through job creation, poverty reduction and social inclusion.
in writing. - (PT) First of all, we regret that the motion for a resolution which we presented on the Lisbon Strategy was rejected, which is all the more serious just as we are embarking upon the final cycle of the Lisbon Strategy.
Once more the majority of the European Parliament is rejecting a change of policy and expressing its full support for and involvement in the policies followed to date: deregulation of markets and labour relations, liberalisation of goods and essential services (postal service, transport, telecommunications, energy, etc.) and handing them over to private operators, to the detriment of taxpayers, workers and the people.
As may be seen in Portugal, this distinctly neoliberal policy is increasingly spreading to other sectors.
We are witnessing the growing commercialisation of health, education and training, exacerbating social inequalities and increasing poverty and social exclusion in the European Union.
Pressure is now also being applied to strengthen the external component of the Lisbon Strategy, that is, to impose on third countries, many of which are less developed, economic and political conditions requiring the opening up of those markets in the interests of the large European multinationals.
in writing. - (PL) The resolution on the Lisbon Strategy contains many important provisions for business people and consumers.
One initiative that is particularly worthy of note and support is the Small Business Act initiative, which presents the philosophy of the 'think small first' principle.
I hope that this initiative will be implemented effectively and promptly, with the active involvement of interested parties.
There is no need for me to remind you here of the significance of the role of small and medium-sized businesses in economic life, or how important it is for the future of Europe that they are granted a special and privileged status.
I would also like to draw attention to the protection of intellectual rights.
We are all aware that, in comparison with the United States, Europe's patent system with its exceptional lack of cohesion is a big headache for some European countries clearly holding back innovation and research on a wide front, and that is harming the whole continent.
It is therefore important to draw up joint proposals and solutions for the current situation so that all EU consumers might have the benefit of new and modern products at a price that matches the purchasing powers of the average consumer.
I abstained from the vote on the resolution on the Lisbon agenda.
I was somewhat surprised to read paragraph 3 in particular.
From it we learn that in order to guarantee the success of this agenda, we also need to strengthen economic growth in Europe.
It is about that one little word: also.
Up to now I was living in the conviction that growth was the main aim, and that the point was to catch up with certain countries and not let others catch up with us.
Careful reading of the draft resolution indicates that unfortunately this is not just a routine oversight, but a confirmation of a rule.
In this text we find statements that might successfully be placed in dozens of other resolutions.
Often these are matters that undoubtedly put the brakes on such growth.
What we have in effect is a wish list that we could draw up for ourselves on many other occasions, and not just when discussing the Lisbon agenda.
There is one exception, however: progress in the introduction of the Lisbon agenda.
This fragment of the resolution is very important, but sadly the conclusions are not optimistic.
We do not know how to measure this progress, if indeed there has been any.
There is no appropriate monitoring.
This means that our work lacks points of reference.
We have problems with evaluation.
We do not know whether we are forging ahead or standing on the spot.
I think that we as a Parliament should be working on this above all.
in writing. - (DE) On Monday, the European Parliament Committee on Industry, Research and Energy gave the green light to the final acceptance of the statutory foundations for the EIT.
That means that all the questions about financing and the EIT's internal organisation have been dealt with, and it is ready for launch.
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology is a central component in achieving more for our economy, more for science and more for sustainable jobs in Europe.
Therefore, it is essential that a decision on the location of the EIT be made quickly.
I call upon the EU Heads of State or Government to agree on a defined time frame for this decision at the Spring European Council.
The decision must be made by the EU summit in June, at the latest.
The Austrian Federal Chancellor, Mr Gusenbauer, must also be involved in setting the time frame, since Austria submitted a very appropriate application.
The time frame for this decision must be determined at the spring summit and form part of the summit outcome document.
Given Vienna's excellent application to host the EIT, Chancellor Gusenbauer has considerable responsibility to ensure that the decision is made quickly and a precise time frame is set.
in writing. - With the renewal of the Lisbon strategy I stress the need for a real update of the Integrated Policy Guidelines, along with a greater role for the European Parliament in monitoring how the strategy is followed up.
The focus should be on achieving a socially sensitive Europe that deals with the current economic problems we face without isolating those most vulnerable.
The need for enforcement of a minimum wage in all Member States is one of the key ways that we can ensure that all European citizens enjoy a decent basic standard of living.
I am satisfied with the resolution and have voted in favour of it.
in writing. - (EL) The centre-right and centre-left political groupings are competing with each other over which can lend more support to the interests and choices of big business.
They are even surpassing the Commission in promoting the anti-worker, anti-popular Lisbon Strategy.
This disgraceful resolution does not even shed crocodile tears over poverty or social exclusion.
On the contrary, it demands that reforms be carried out in labour markets and social insurance systems; it emphasises the Commission's guidelines by requesting that the directives on the organization of working time and working conditions for temporary workers be adopted; it asks Member States to place EU competitiveness at the core of their policies and to make the completion of the single market their most important economic and political priority.
According to the resolution, the most suitable tool for promoting these and other anti-worker measures and policies is class cooperation, which will succeed through a widening of social dialogue and the establishment of a climate of trust between enterprises and employees.
Employees have endured seven years of implementation of this strategy.
As a result, their living standards, employment, pension and social rights have worsened.
This is why they are rejecting the Lisbon Strategy and opposing the interests of capital.
We feel the same about the EU, which is serving those interests.
Although I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by the majority of the parliamentary groups, since I agree with the constructive approach and the essence of the recommendations, in particular with regard to the need to boost investment in research, innovation and development and policies to promote knowledge, in the opening of markets and greater flexibility, with security, in labour markets, I still cannot help thinking that some of the data presented in the alternative resolution give cause for concern.
That is precisely why I could not support the resolution of the Communist Group.
Two years away from the expiry of the Lisbon Agenda, we must acknowledge that the objectives outlined - ambitious objectives - are far from having been achieved (and our comparative speeding up in the face of the slow-down in the American economy is not a matter for celebration).
I believe that it would therefore be better to finally acknowledge the need to follow the path outlined but not followed, rather than to try to make a final effort to achieve in two years what we did not manage to achieve in eight.
The causes and circumstances that justified the measures contained in the Lisbon Agenda are still with us - if not more marked - so the correct route is outlined and we need actually to follow it.
in writing. - (SV) A resolution on the Lisbon Strategy will inevitably be sprawling if all the matters of the heart are involved.
This can also be seen in the final result.
However, the report contains much that is important and necessary, which I was pleased to be able to support.
Above all, this is true of the more adventurous parts which show that Parliament is moving with the times, such as environmental issues and the link to growth.
The discussion on flexicurity which is now gathering speed also identifies the important - perhaps most important of all - question of how competition and security can be combined.
As the report states, we are not building the future on protectionism and bureaucracy but on openness, access and good conditions for both workers and businesses.
However, I want to make clear that my vote in favour of Amendment 12 should not be interpreted in any way as support for establishing minimum wages in the EU.
In contrast, it was a clarification that collective agreements have a place in the European model.
I also made this clear today in Amendment 32 in the report on the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs, which dealt specifically with that issue.
in writing. - The Lisbon Strategy is essential for the future success of the EU.
It is vital that all Member States fulfil their commitment to make the EU the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
in writing. - (RO) The resolution regarding the Lisbon Strategy expresses the European Parliament's wish to ensure a decent living for all European citizens by creating new, better paid jobs and by increasing the investments in research, innovation and an information society.
Point 37 of the resolution emphasizes the importance of the transport policy for combating climate changes and requests that the Trans-European networks should be subject to an adequate assessment regarding their environmental impact.
I voted for amendment No. 12, as verbally amended by the Group of European Socialists, because in this way "Member States are invited to ensure the preconditions for the social and economic participation of all of them and, especially, to adopt regulations regarding the minimum wage, for instance, and other legal and mandatory arrangements for all or by collective contracts concluded according to national traditions, which would allow full-time workers to live decently from their income".
I voted for the resolution proposal with the conviction that the European Union is not only a common market, based on competition, but it should also be a social Europe in which every citizen is integrated into the economic and social activity and has a decent standard of living.
in writing. - (SV) The Lisbon Strategy has now been in operation since 2000 and the Member States have not yet seen any clear results.
The current proposal puts forward a new plan that extends to 2013.
I believe in institutional competition.
There are aims in the Lisbon Strategy that are good and worth developing, such as the proposal for greater investment in research and development.
The parts that address the 'social Europe', on the other hand, do not belong at EU level and it should be for the individual Member State to decide on these.
A further problem with the resolution is that it contains many vague provisions that allow the Commission to interpret and explain measures which we did not ask for.
My basic view is that the countries themselves should formulate a growth strategy as they choose in a democratic system.
Some opt for a social democratic direction, others an extremely liberal, market-oriented approach.
We must respect both.
The main thing is that the decision must be taken at national level.
I have therefore chosen to reject the proposal in its entirety.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to vote in favour of report 29/2008 in its entirety.
However, we voted against Amendment 32 tabled by the Green Group on the subject of minimum wages as a part of the European model.
We understand that the issue of minimum wages is important in many EU Member States.
However, we consider that each Member State must decide how the issue is dealt with.
In Sweden we deal with it best through collective agreements negotiated by the social partners.
in writing. - (PT) Giving voice to the interests, aspirations and demands of major employers' organisations, the majority of this European Parliament is insisting on the Lisbon Strategy being fulfilled, in line with the European Commission's economic guidelines and with the deepening of the associated neoliberal policies.
Thus, even amid the threat of financial crisis and a halt to economic growth, they insist on wage restraint, limiting public spending and modernising public administration as the main axes to develop, together with removing obstacles to competition and to market access, in other words, the liberalisation of public services.
All this accompanied by greater job insecurity, an insistence upon flexicurity and the modernisation of pension schemes, in other words, the devaluation and dismantling of the universal public social security system in the interests of private insurers.
To ensure that the Member States achieve such objectives, they are recommending greater control and pressure on those States, as if they had no share in the responsibility for adopting those guidelines.
Whilst pretending not to realise what a profound effect such policies will have on the economic and social situation of the Member States, they continue to propound more of the same, which we roundly reject.
We voted against this report that dictates to the Member States the content of their economic and social policies for the next three years.
This is the right moment to restate the extent to which everything, absolutely everything, beyond the single currency and the diktats it imposes on the Member States, is now decided in Brussels.
It is no longer a matter simply of setting objectives for the Member States (reducing debt or public spending deficits, combating unemployment, reviving growth, and so on), but of explaining to them in detail what they should be doing, how to do it, and with what instruments.
The problem is that these guidelines have been the same for the last 15 years: employment flexibility, immigration to renew the population and provide cheap labour, deregulation of public services, wage restraint, Malthusian budgetary policies, liberalisation of external trade, competition, etc.
This array is well known and so are its results: unemployment, lower spending power and increased poverty, de-industrialisation, social disintegration, etc.
It is time for us to ask: is it because the Member States are not diligent enough in obeying orders that things are going badly, or rather because they are too diligent and the orders are not the right ones?
We believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that the second explanation is the correct one.
in writing. - (SV) This own-initiative report addresses several challenges faced by the future Europe, such as increased globalisation, an ageing population, and climate change.
Many of the proposed measures appear reasonable and could be a possible path for a Member State to take.
The June List is opposed to complicated tax systems, social exclusion and environmental degradation.
However, it is for each Member State itself to decide how to formulate its policy in order to meet the future challenges.
The most successful solutions emerge through institutional competition, examples that can inspire and stimulate voluntary measures in other Member States.
We have chosen to vote against this report because it deals with areas for which the Member States have political responsibility.
in writing. - My group tabled a number of amendments on important issues such as climate change, fairer wealth distribution and fair pay, which I voted for.
In the seventh year of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, the European Parliament's evaluation of the current situation in the European Union, takes into account the new conditions characterising the years 2007-2008.
In the light of last year's and this year's experience, namely uncertainty and increased risk in financial markets, it makes sense to devote particular attention to the macro-economic stability of the Community.
Discipline in the euro area, and especially maintaining this discipline, is of major importance.
Nonetheless, under the conditions of a deregulated, global financial system, the main responsibility falls upon the nation states, in the form of taking care to keep public finances in balance.
This area leaves much to be desired, even in countries that think of themselves as the 'engines' of integration, particularly when they can count on a lenient tariff from the European Commission.
One demand that has gone unmet for some years is genuine liberalisation of the EU market, especially the services market, which would create a more genuine competitive pressure and would finally eliminate protective barriers, which no longer consist in regulations of statutory ranking, as more concealed ways have been found of making life difficult for foreign competitors.
The unfinished business of building an EU internal market means that the potential for enterprise and creativity in a Community of 27 countries is not being fully utilised.
The costs of this shortfall are estimated at EUR 150 billion.
These are sufficient reasons for the question of liberalisation of the common market to occupy a prominent position in reports evaluating the state of and growth prospects for the European economy.
in writing. - I welcome the report on the broad economic policy guidelines for 2008-2010.
In the current economic climate, we must give the EU the necessary tools to help us weather the storm.
In doing this, Europe must remain a social Europe that has well coordinated mechanisms for high-quality public spending, research and innovation and education.
Climate change must also feature highly in the formation of Europe's economic priorities if we are to meet the ambitious targets that we have set ourselves.
in writing. - (PT) Since the point at issue in this report is, specifically, the national implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, I really must present a more detailed assessment here of my concerns, as a Portuguese MEP, about my country's failure to achieve the Lisbon Strategy - either in terms of results or measures.
I realise that in many respects, the criticisms that could be levelled at Portugal are just the same as those that could and should be levelled at Europe as a whole.
We are, however, a long way away from achieving - and according to certain criteria, such as employment, moving even further away from achieving - the Lisbon objectives, and we are nowhere near adopting the appropriate policies for obtaining those results.
Balancing national public finances is a priority but that balance must be achieved by reducing waste and rejecting non-productive spending and by the fair distribution of income received.
It is not appropriate to achieve that by overburdening household budgets and reducing the effective obligations of the State.
Just as in the private sector, competitiveness and success are obtained by providing better services at lower costs, but without cancelling either side of the equation.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs StarkeviÄiÅ«tÄ's report.
The current formulation of the guidelines constitutes a sufficiently broad and still valid framework to accommodate recent economic and political developments.
Therefore, we agree with the proposal not to change the text of the broad guidelines for the economic policies in the next three-year cycle, in line with the Council's conclusions.
Stability is indeed important for the effectiveness of the Lisbon Strategy and the integrated guidelines.
This new cycle should therefore hinge on the implementation of reform and the achievement of concrete results.
We also support the proposals for amendments to the explanatory text that accompanies the broad guidelines for the economic policies because they give a better focus to the content of the guidelines, to meet the challenges Europe is facing (globalisation, strengthening the bases for economic growth in the medium and long term, rapid demographic and social change, etc.).
in writing. - (SV) Today I voted in favour of a report which sets out the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs for 2008-2010.
On the one hand, I was pleased to find amendments from the Socialist Group which noted the need to create a Europe that is favourable to business, not least to small enterprises.
On the other hand, the same group also proposed much stricter rules in the financial field, rules which are supposed to protect consumers, but which increasingly mean that earnings are reduced for them.
This attitude is more likely to hinder than help and I have therefore voted against this proposal.
If the European vision of being the leading global competitive force is ever to become reality, much more aggressive investments must also be made in modernising the labour market, in encouraging research and education, and in taking advantage of the possibilities offered by a 'greener' economy.
I have therefore voted with the Greens, for environmental taxes at EU level, even though as usual I defended the independence of the European Central Bank against their recurrent attacks.
If there is anything that the recent financial turbulence has shown us, it is the benefit of a strong central bank that can withstand short-term solutions, not to mention the stabilising effect of participating in a large currency zone.
in writing. - The British Labour delegation supports the main thrust of this report, as it attends to promoting generally-acceptable policies for the EU economy.
However, the EPLP has severe reservations over paragraph 26, which calls for fiscal harmonisation/coordination, which is a national competence only.
Therefore, the EPLP decided to abstain on this particular paragraph.
in writing. - On paragraph 26, the amendment refers to a common consolidated corporate tax base.
I disagree with this point as I believe this should be decided by the Member State.
I abstained on this point.
in writing - (RO) The European Parliament's Report on the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs examines the general lines proposed by the European Commission for the economic policies of the Member States and of the Community for the period of 2008-2010.
I voted for recital 26, as proposed by the Commission, because it emphasizes the need for a "coordinated fiscal framework, which should include a tax system favourable to companies, in particular to small and medium-sized companies, and geared to renewing economic growth and generating employmentâ.
I also voted for amendment 23, because it "requests that the income and the way in which wealth is distributed should ensure the equitable distribution of the benefits generated by economic growth.â
The amendment states that the minimum wage in every country, according to the GDP per inhabitant, could be a way to guarantee the fact that the full-time workers can provide their subsistence from their work, which should be considered an element of the European social model.
Consequently, I voted for this report with the conviction that the economic security of all the European citizens, social inclusion, gender equality and the creation of a market economy will make the Union become an economic and social model in a global context.
I supported Mr Ãzdemir's report because one of the most pressing political problems facing Europe is ensuring energy security for the EU.
Diversification of supplies of energy raw materials to the EU is one way of making ourselves independent of Russia, and the key move in this is a common EU policy with regard to Central Asia.
The lack of a common EU policy in this sphere is being aggressively exploited by Russia, with most EU Member States taking a passive stance.
Projects such as the extension of the Odessa-Brody pipeline to GdaÅsk, or the Nabucco pipeline, are no longer very realistic as a result of the actions taken by Russian companies dominated by the special services.
I would like to congratulate Mr Ãzdemir on his own-initiative report on an EU strategy for Central Asia.
In my view, he has clarified perfectly the objectives and priorities for the European Union's relations with each of the five Central Asian countries.
He has correctly pointed out the need for a more coherent regional approach to this strategic region, while highlighting the differences between the countries.
I approve of the opinion of the Committee on Development, particularly on the need to eradicate poverty, improve public health and primary school education, and eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and minorities.
It is also important that this report underlines the need for progress on democracy, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in the region, and this point is key, as far as I am concerned.
The report considers that cooperation on energy is of prime importance in Europe's strategy.
Despite this, the European institutions need to be vigilant and ensure that neither human rights in the region, nor the environment, are sacrificed to energy needs and trade agreements.
I welcome the adoption by a large majority today of the report on an EU strategy for Central Asia.
It is essential for the European Union to take a closer interest in these five countries: Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.
The report quite rightly calls for differentiation in the EU's policy towards each country and I cannot but approve the fact that criteria such as the human rights situation in the countries in question and their respect for OSCE commitments are highlighted.
The text is also keen to stress the importance of these countries for the EU, both now and in the future, particularly as regards trade and energy.
The geopolitical situation of Central Asia is such that cooperation with these countries must be increased, both bilaterally and at EU level.
The report calls for reforms of social sectors, health, food security and the fight against corruption to ensure long-term stability, security and prosperity in the region.
This is therefore a comprehensive text, defining the spheres of action in which the EU can be of assistance, to give it as much visibility and credibility in the region as possible.
in writing. - (PT) In line with what has been approved by the majority of the European Parliament on the EU's external relations, we have yet another report consisting essentially of a collection of measures for interfering in third countries, without concealing - quite the reverse - the clear objective of obtaining, within the economies of those countries, conditions favourable to the interests of the large economic and financial groups.
Look how the report stands up for respecting international standards for foreign investment and the provision of better protection for foreign direct investment in these countries.
It is clear that such statements mean nothing more or less than to privatise state banks(!) and create national financial markets that are truly competitive and open to foreign banks(!)
In other words, these countries are simply being put up for sale...
Moreover, in line with the objective mentioned above, the EU's primordial interests emerge as regards the significant energy resources of the countries in this region, and there is mention of the need to secure its energy supplies, without disturbing the transportation routes and with the maximum possible regularity.
Basically, it reflects the real significance of the much-proclaimed role of the EU in the world, in particular in the current proposed Treaty: its ambition to achieve political and economic domination.
in writing. - I wish to congratulate my colleague Mr Ãzdemir on his report on Central Asia, to which I gave my full backing.
Democracy and human rights are founding principles of the EU, and they should be at the heart of the EU's policy in relation to other regions.
The nations of Central Asia have attracted attention from the world's economic powers primarily on account of their natural resources.
The EU must rise above this and seek to invest in their human resources too, by advocating democracy and human rights.
in writing. - (CS) What was the legacy of the Soviet Union in the countries of Central Asia?
Equality for women, abolition of child labour and illiteracy, monoculture farming.
In none of these countries have religious elements succeeded in establishing supremacy.
The EU's first priority is the use of the natural resources of those countries, namely oil, natural gas and uranium.
Another priority is blocking one of the main channels of opium smuggling from Afghanistan.
This brings us to the direct responsibility of the EU and the US for supporting the establishment of authoritarian regimes in the countries in that region.
The individual countries try to limit the proliferation of terrorist groups and the spread of militant Islamic ideas, but such a situation has a negative effect on the development of civil society and participative democracy and tends to support the rule of force.
Notwithstanding all the criticism of the countries of the region in the report, we must always remember the difficult historical conditions faced by these countries in the course of their development.
The EU must help them to overcome the results of many years of negativity created by the presence of the large EU states and the US in neighbouring Afghanistan.
There is no reason to favour Turkey as the main potential mediator for a positive influence in the region.
The present situation as regards respect for the rights of minorities in Turkey certainly does not justify that approach.
In contrast, much more attention should be paid to the traditional ties to Russia.
When it comes to our fight against the spread of terrorism and drugs throughout the countries of that region, Russia is our closest ally.
In spite of the above-mentioned reservations, I support the adoption of the report.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the proposal for an EU strategy for Central Asia, since the five republics there receive Official Development Assistance and the European Union has a particular responsibility to support these countries.
I would like to highlight the role of the European Union as a mediator between the countries of Central Asia, balancing out the significant differences between the five republics in terms of political, economic and social conditions.
In particular, I would like to point out the dire situation in the area of health, which is attributable to the minimal medical care system.
Providing access to clean drinking water and connecting all residents to the national grid present a problem of huge magnitude in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic.
It is important to me that my vote for an EU strategy for Central Asia is also a vote to improve living conditions for the people of Central Asia with regard to social, health and legal aspects.
in writing. - Mr Ãzdemir's report on the EU's strategy for Central Asia deals with a key issue on the EU's foreign policy agenda.
I welcome its emphasis on attending to human rights in the Central Asian region; an emphasis that the EU should apply to its external relations more generally.
There exists little evidence of democratic advancement in the region, notably Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, and any EU strategy for cooperation should attempt to engage these states in a drive towards the concept of democracy.
As the report clearly outlines, Central Asia requires active EU energy cooperation in a bid to find mutually beneficial solutions to the current state of play in the energy market.
I agree with Mr Ozdemir's recommendations and voted in favour of the report.
With the exception of the Kyrgyz Republic, developments in the Central Asia region are alarming for more than one reason.
Firstly, in terms of human rights and democracy, the abuse of many women (forced marriages, sexual exploitation, rape, etc.) and child labour in the region are totally unacceptable.
Next, in terms of health, the increase in infectious diseases (particularly HIV) remains worrying.
Finally, Central Asia will not benefit from effective integration into the world economic system until all five countries in the area have joined the WTO (the Kyrgyz Republic has been a member since 1998).
The EU's strategy for Central Asia can make an effective contribution to the economic and human development of this region of the world.
The European Union must not neglect Central Asia, which is a strategic crossroads between Europe and Asia and a traditional partner in trade relations and energy cooperation.
I strongly support this text in its desire to see the EU's priorities in Central Asia clarified, the European projects launched in the region strengthened and their implementation accelerated.
That is why I voted for the report.
Strategic planning for Central Asia is certainly a good idea, and is indeed necessary, especially for economic cooperation and the opening up of the markets.
It would also make sense to speed this up in order to keep abreast of developments.
However, the situation where certain standards that apply at European level become minimal in Central Asia cannot be allowed to continue.
On the other hand, applying the same yardstick there as in Europe would be to show considerable arrogance towards the people groups named in the report and their rights to self-determination.
As regards the role of women, there is sufficient need for action in other regions of the world, not least the entire Arab world, where the need is far more urgent.
However, child labour, which is widespread, especially in China, is covered by the standards I have already mentioned, which trading partners are required to observe.
Combating terrorism and the drug trade, which are linked to some extent, must be at the very top of the agenda.
These must be fought relentlessly.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the document presented by the European Commission for a new partnership with the countries of Central Asia, but I would like to highlight the following aspects.
Firstly, the growing importance in international trade of Central Asia, which now constitutes an important alternative for the supply of energy resources.
Secondly, the fact that Europe must, as a result, keep a watchful eye on this part of the world, and encourage its integration into world trade and the international economic system by supporting the candidacy of those countries in the area that are not yet members of the WTO.
Strengthening trade relations with the whole area should therefore be seen as part of a strategy to achieve greater cooperation and integration among the countries themselves and to increase Europe's influence, including political, in a region where progress has been made towards democracy.
Thirdly, in the overall approach towards Central Asia, account must be taken of the major political and economic differences between the countries of the region.
Particular stress has been placed on the role played by a country such as Kazakhstan, which has an advanced economy, and therefore on the potential benefits of strengthening links with that country, not least in terms of the overall development of the whole region.
in writing. - (PT) The European Union has tried to establish close relations and dialogue through its neighbourhood policy.
In the case of Central Asia, the drawing up of the new strategy and partnership with five new States is helping to promote greater stability, socio-economic and democratic development and security throughout that part of Asia.
We note that there is a global interest in stability in Central Asia, since serious and prolonged crises in that region could have disastrous consequences and affect the EU and its Member States.
In addition, the geopolitical situation of Central Asia has been attracting growing interest from economic powers such as Russia, the USA, China and Turkey.
I think that the future of those relations aiming at greater stability and security and increased political, economic and social cooperation, must also take into account the human rights situation in each country and the strengthening of trade relations and energy cooperation, as well as paying attention to development needs and the commitments undertaken as regards improving the living conditions of the citizens of the region.

Monitoring the application of Community law (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the Commission's 23rd Annual report on monitoring the application of Community law (2005) .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the application of Community law is a key part of the 'better lawmaking' agenda launched by the Barroso Commission.
For some time it has been a kind of Cinderella, lost amidst the fashion for impact assessments and cutting costs.
Today the Commission has started to rectify this, partly due to the pressure applied by Parliament.
This is a procedure that, for years, has in many cases just been a kind of bureaucratic grind, where one infringement follows another without much ado, but it remains an absolutely essential procedure.
The numbers speak very clearly.
To date, around 2 518 infringement procedures have been initiated in the most diverse sectors, particularly the environment and the internal market.
In addition to this there are the hundreds, thousands even, of petitions that the Parliament receives each year and that often refer to specific infringements of Community law, against which citizens feel helpless and therefore turn to Parliament.
The question is: what chance do they have of receiving satisfaction?
The infringement procedure is described by Articles 226 and 228 of the Treaty, and therefore there is not much scope for creativity.
The rules in force condemn us to slow, muddled procedures where the most effective measure - a fine - is rarely applied and only after a very long time, decades even.
However, a great deal, a very great deal, can be done and I thank the Commission for proposing in the last two years, and then last September in a specific communication, a series of measures that are analysed and evaluated in my report, and on which I would like to make a few comments.
First, however, allow me to make a point that I believe is crucial in this debate, because enforcing laws can be a very political matter and can be a wonderful tool for improving the credibility and visibility of the Community institutions.
I would like to mention two specific examples of somewhat different behaviour by the Commission: the waste crisis in Naples and the Via Baltica motorway in the Rospuda Valley in Poland.
The waste crisis in Naples was a direct consequence of infringements, occurring year after year, of practically all the Community rules on waste.
Indeed, very many infringement procedures had been initiated against Italy over the years and the Court had ruled against Italy on many occasions.
However, only now, years later, when the situation has become intolerable for everyone and impossible to hide, has the Commission decided to bang its fists on the table.
The Commission's visits are being followed with great interest, and citizens crying out against illegal tipping are announcing on television that petitions are being sent to the European Parliament.
I wonder: could this not have been done before?
Could we really not have taken a different attitude to prevent this situation arising?
Yes, we could!
This is actually what Commissioner Dimas did in the case of the Rospuda Valley in Poland, which was in danger of being spoiled by infrastructure for the Via Baltica.
For the first time, the Commissioner asked for a suspension order from the Court, and this was granted.
This is a very important precedent that sends an extremely clear message: the Commission can and must be firm and thorough with Member States that act as if nothing had happened, and it must use all the tools the democratic system allows: the media and public opinion.
One of the most important innovations that the Commission introduces in the communication concerns a 'new' working method.
We have expressed many doubts about this new working method, which mostly consists of sending complaints directly back to the Member State against which the complaint is being made, in order to try to solve the problem.
We expressed these doubts and the Commission gave us a few assurances that I hope we will also hear today, but we will be keeping a very close eye on the matter and truly hope that, on the issue of infringement procedures, transparency, the ability to 'name and shame' Member States and the joint work with Parliament, will bring progress.
Mr President, at the end of the debate, I will speak again for two minutes to finish my speaking time.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Thank you Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Council I would like to welcome your report on the Commission's annual report on monitoring the application of Community law, and the additional analysis envisaged in the Commission's communication 'A Europe of results - applying Community law'.
In our opinion the report by the European Parliament is a very useful contribution to our common aim of securing the timely and correct application of Community law.
On behalf of the Council I would like to welcome the findings of Mrs Frassoni's report, which in our opinion are essential, namely that securing the positive effects of Community law on the everyday lives of the citizens of the European Union depends primarily on the efficiency of European Union policies and on the supervision and monitoring of the methods by which the Member States comply with Community law.
We have a positive opinion of the European Parliament's commitment to supporting the exchange of best practice among the Member States.
In our view such exchanges would significantly contribute to a more efficient and unified application of Community law.
I must explain here that the Presidency of the Council cannot comment on most of the questions and proposals presented in this valuable report.
As we know, the administrative implementation of Community law is principally the responsibility of the Member States in accordance with their constitutional regulations, and of the Commission, which, as the guardian of treaties, is responsible for monitoring the uniform application of Community law.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions. - Mr President, in the minute I have on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to do three things.
First of all, I would like to thank Ms Frassoni for her cooperation on this annual report, but, most of all, I would like to make clear the importance of the Petitions Committee in this monitoring and implementation procedure.
I think that importance has, at long last, been recognised by the Commission.
I thank the Commissioner for that, because we should really have a partnership in this exercise between our two institutions, and particularly involving the Petitions Committee, which is really our eyes and ears, as legislators, through our citizens, who come to us with direct problems that they perceive.
But, in order for our citizens to be able to do that, I come to my second point.
Commissioner, you talked about our law being living law.
Well, in order for it to be living law, it needs to be understandable - comprehensible - to our citizens.
I have had a long dialogue with your colleague Ms WallstrÃ¶m about citizens' summaries, so that citizens understand our law.
She has, on many occasions, promised us that these will be forthcoming with every legislative instrument.
We still await the real evidence of that happening.
Lastly, the Petitions Committee - and this I address to my own colleagues - needs much greater prominence and resources in our own House.
It is not just an interfering busybody committee. It does a real job in connecting with our citizens in this area.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Commissioner, you are absolutely right: the rule of law is the foundation of the EU.
You correctly point out that Community legislation is the way to achieve the goals of the EU treaties, as its byword is the interest of European citizens, who have the right to demand the implementation of this law.
The bulk, breadth and complexity of legislation are constantly on the increase.
We MEPs from the European People's Party should like to express our satisfaction: through its 23rd annual report on monitoring the application of Community law and also through the announcement of the results in Europe, the Commission is demonstrating its desire to be the trustee of the treaties and to ensure that the legislation is implemented.
You are absolutely right in saying that we want the correlation tables, on which the Council made a decision today.
The rapporteur cooperated extensively with you to draw up Mrs Frassoni's report, on which we had an interesting hearing in Parliament.
Let us tell you that we also want Parliament to participate in the control procedure and wish to be kept informed about your activities.
We want you to come to our committees, as you do to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
We wish to hear your progress report.
We certainly want you to take into consideration the petitions we receive, as you point out in your report.
We should also like to stress that, as far as our decisions on immunities are concerned, we should like you to intervene to ensure that the national courts uphold them.
The implementation of Community law allows European citizens to hope that democracy, law and order will be strengthened, and that the EU authorities will become closer to them.
Today, after the resolution on the new reformed Lisbon Treaty, we all wish for a better future for the EU.
Mr President, one aim of Community legislation is the implementation of various EU political strategies.
The application of this legislation should be a priority for all Member States which, while simultaneously subject to control and monitoring by the Commission, will guarantee that it has the desired positive outcomes for the citizens of Europe.
In past years the total number of proceedings dealing with violations of legal regulations instigated by the Commission was steadily rising, to reach a level of almost 2 700 in 2005.
Despite EU enlargement by 10 new states, the years since then have not seen any overall rise in the number of violations.
There is a danger, however, that this situation may have arisen from a lack of registrations of complaints, or from administrative problems in the institutions responsible for considering violations.
The report should be praised first and foremost in respect of its inclusion of detailed studies of instances of violations linked to petitions, as well as the information provided on the readiness for broad cooperation by individual Directorates General on such matters.
We should also welcome the Commission's comprehensive communication 'A Europe of results - Applying Community law'.
However, the questions of funds available for consideration of instances of violation, the length of proceedings in cases of violation, the restricted application of Article 228 of the Treaty and evaluation of the application of priority criteria still need to be fleshed out in more detail by the Commission.
The proposed new working method being introduced in 2008, as a pilot project involving several Member States and, aimed at conducting existing proceedings more efficiently, deserves acknowledgement.
One stage of the procedure, however, namely the sending of a case to an interested Member State that is, above all, the party responsible for improper application of Community law, is a cause for concern: this may lead to a weakening of the role of warden of the treaties that rests with the Commission.
The creation of Community law should come to meet citizens' problems in such a way as to enable prompt answers to be found to their questions and complaints, which will make it easier for them to understand and make use of their rights, while at the same time effectively reducing the number of proceedings relating to violation of the law.
Finally, may I warmly congratulate Mrs Frassoni on a very well-prepared document.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to turn my attention to our three institutions and to emphasise how important it is that each one plays a part in the implementation and monitoring role.
Clearly, here, we are looking at the Commission's report.
Of course, the Commission has the prime responsibility for implementation and enforcement, and we would not wish to tread on its toes in that respect.
However, I think the Commission can assume that, in future, we will be watching much more carefully.
We are grateful that many of the lessons that were thrown up by our report on the demise of Equitable Life have been taken on board.
But, as we move into a new period, and perhaps try out some new ideas, we have to be very careful.
First of all, if we look at the Council, we still have to get agreed - and I was pleased to hear the Commissioner mention it - the idea of correlation tables in respect of each and every piece of legislation, so that everybody can see exactly what happens at Member State level and where each piece of law fits in.
The pilot project is an excellent idea.
That is all well and good, so let us see how it works out.
But - and here is the but - I am a little sceptical that so many Member States have signed up to it.
I hope they do not perceive it as some sort of soft option and I hope the Commission will disabuse them of the idea that could, in any way, be the case.
Lastly, I come to our own Parliament.
Clearly, post-Lisbon Treaty, we must have a much more important role in terms of monitoring.
We cannot assume that, once we finish with a piece of legislation here, that is the end of it.
Our committees will have to take on a much bigger role in checking.
One or two implementation reports are already happening - that will increase - and we will have to take on our responsibilities, along with the other institutions.
Just as a postscript - but a very important postscript - we also have to turn our attention to the education of our judiciary in our national courts to make sure that they, too, know how to implement Community law.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I congratulate my group colleague and group Co-President Mrs Frassoni for a timely and well thought-out report.
I also echo Mrs Wallis's comments and agree with them absolutely.
Passing laws keeps us in business, but enforcing laws actually delivers for our people, and a failure to enforce laws, frankly, makes us look like fools.
I congratulate the Commission on a number of steps that have been very positive.
But we really must bring this closer to the top of our agenda in this Parliament because, certainly in Scotland, there remains a strong perception that there is one law for one country and one law for another.
I am very aware that is not all the fault of the Commission, but we must all play our part in resolving that if we are one Europe.
So, in congratulating my group colleague, I am glad to hear that many of those points will be taken on board by the Commissioner.
I would like to make one more point, particularly in relation to environmental legislation, where many of the conflicts arise: many of the very worthy aims of individual pieces of legislation do conflict, and we must face up to that in preparing them.
There is scant guidance in terms of application for local authorities as to how they should deal with the often very worthy aims when they do conflict.
We were promised a review of that in the energy package, so if our Commissioner could give us some light on that process, which is ongoing, I would be very grateful.
(NL) Mr President, I, too, wish to compliment Mrs Frassoni on her report.
We have now had a number of reports on implementation, and a distinct common thread can be seen in those reports.
This means more attention to implementation, including on the part of the European Parliament.
We now have recourse to implementation reports.
In July I myself shall be presenting a report on the implementation of the eighth directive concerning the supervision of accountants.
It is good that Parliament is also taking a serious look at the transposition of legislation in Member States.
I should like to focus on the issue of supervisors in this regard.
We are talking about transposition by the authorities in the Member States and about the judges who apply the law.
However, many Member States also have independent supervisors who apply and elaborate legislation.
In practice, wide divergences have arisen among the various Member States and among supervisors.
Increasingly often, businesses operating internationally in several Member States are being faced with differing requirements from different supervisors from different Member States.
This is extremely inconvenient, and inhibits the operation of the internal market.
I should like to discuss one more point.
We cannot, in addition, avoid a further examination of the legislative instruments used in Europe.
Up to now, we have mainly been working with directives where harmonisation is concerned.
Commissioner Verheugen has already said on certain occasions that in future it may make sense to make more use of the regulation instrument for internal market legislation, in order to avoid all kinds of problems such as cherry-picking and gold-plating during the transposition of directives.
I know that in the national parliaments too, particularly the Dutch Parliament, the realisation is slowly but surely sinking in that implementation involving gold-plating and cherry-picking can be detrimental to the operation of the internal market and also to the domestic economy.
That being the case, the step towards a regulation, where possible, is no longer so very great.
(ES) Mr President, we are aware of the importance of your mission to monitor the application of Community law.
We are talking about relations between a supranational institution and national governments.
National governments are strong entities, with a great deal of power, they are public authorities.
Normally the Commission is the guardian of EU law and for citizens, in many cases, it is the only guarantee that they have that the law (because Community law is law) will be applied correctly.
The report by Mrs Frassoni is aimed at strengthening what I would call the backbone of the Commission, so that the Commission is aware of the importance of this task, and so that, even if we want a prior phase of negotiation with governments on the difficulties that may arise, at the moment of truth the Commission acts as the citizens expect, with strength and vigour, and applying Community law.
It is a concern that, following enlargement, we should have the impression that the Commission is applying less strict criteria to the new Member States than it applied to the old Members.
This would have a negative impact on the consolidation of the European Union and on the reputation of the European Union itself in those Member States.
Having followed many of the Commission's infringement proceedings, I can assure the Commission that, when it intervenes, citizens, and even the public authorities, feel strengthened by the action of the Commission in this area.
In other words, I think that the European Parliament report, the proposal put forward by Mrs Frassoni and also the opinion of Mrs Wallis are aimed at strengthening the Commission, so that the Commission does not consider itself to be alone and defenceless against the governments, but rather has the European Parliament to strengthen this role of overseeing and monitoring that the Commission has in relation to the application of Community law.
(DA) Mr President, the citizens of Europe are decisively important for the EU's legislation.
They are not simply sacrifices for the infringements, as in Naples for example.
In many environmental issues they have often been key players.
As guard dogs, they maintain a watch to ensure that the laws are implemented correctly in all corners of Europe, and in many cases they are the only ones to do this.
Because of this, the EU should also support citizens by securing them a strong position.
When they draw attention to infringements of Community legislation, their complaints should be handled seriously and with respect.
I sincerely hope that this is not an attempt on the part of the Commission to put a stop to many of these complaints, as this would be bad practice.
I would therefore like to thank Mrs Frassoni for drawing attention to these threats.
Her excellent report will now become an important general step in the right direction.
EU citizens will gain a stronger position through the Treaty of Lisbon, but if this is to be anything other than a pointless decoration, their contribution to the EU must be taken seriously.
(PL) Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Frassoni on an excellently prepared report.
I would also like to say how pleased I am that, according to the statistics presented by the European Commission concerning the number of proceedings relating to cases of violation of EU law, the accession of 10 new Member States has not had an impact on the number of violations recorded.
The statistics do not, however, tell the whole story.
One of the most important mechanisms enabling us to check how well the application of European law is really going is the system of pre-judicial references, the aim of which is to assign to national courts the potential to provide a uniform interpretation of the application of European law in all Member States.
The fundamental problem in this procedure is the time one has to wait for an answer from the Court, which is still very long (about 20 months).
The main reason - the time taken for translation - accounts for about nine months.
It is a matter of concern that in many national parliaments we hear voices demanding a cap on the budget specifically for written translations.
The European Commission's recommendations for Member States and candidate countries are based on the assumption that EU law will be effectively introduced when suitably qualified staff are employed and suitable funds are set aside.
I do not entirely support that view.
The number of staff and the amount of funds available is not the right yardstick.
Also needed are determination and involvement in the matter of introducing European law.
Proper execution of the tasks facing Member States and candidate countries requires three factors: knowledge, competence and readiness.
The first of these factors - that is, possession of knowledge - is not a problem today.
The second factor - the capacity to introduce the Community's achievements - is linked to the provision of suitable funds and the engagement of additional employees.
The Commission is currently placing the greatest emphasis on this particular aspect.
The third factor - the readiness of those whose task it is to introduce and apply European law - is the most underestimated.
Readiness to apply Community law in practice depends on the institutions and the system of procedures, incentives and restrictions.
Success or failure in the introduction of EU law will eventually be decided by the specific institutional model.
Knowledge and funds are not everything.
A good will to act is also needed.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, in your introduction you pointed out that the Commission does not want to launch out blindly but sound out whether something should be done, by discussing it with the Member States.
Now, within the Commission itself - which is, after all, a collegial institution - there is not always a clear, unified position on certain issues.
In the area of transport I currently see a topic that will become more and more problematic for us in the coming years - and probably within the Commission too - and that is the concept that money should be redirected to more environmentally friendly modes of transport by way of cross-subsidies from money that is earned in a less environmentally friendly area - road tolls, parking fees, etc. That is, in effect, a subsidy.
Has there been any discussion about this, and how does the situation look?
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
As has already mentioned by several speakers before me, success in achieving the objectives set out in the Treaties and legislative acts will depend on how effective the Member States are in applying Community law, and on how they transpose it into the national setting.
If they fail to apply the legislation or enforce it properly, or are unable to comply fully with the goals it contains, then we will have a problem.
In recent years the tendency has improved in terms of compliance with the legislation, and I think compliance by the ten new Member States is good.
I hope that this is not just because the Commission is more lenient towards us, towards the new Member States, but because we are putting genuine effort into fulfilling criteria and meeting expectations.
Unfortunately, navigating the bureaucratic jungle is still far from easy; we know how enormous the number of legislative measures is, and transposing these into national and regional law is often exceedingly time-consuming.
Enabling the simplification of bureaucratic language and more widespread use of impact assessments would be very important, as would ensuring that as little time as possible is taken up with conducting complaints procedures.
Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, the implementation of Community law by individual Member States is one of the basic principles of the European Union.
This is why monitoring and the elimination of deviations is the goal of numerous actions.
Checking of individual states and publication of the results of the checks would make it possible for citizens to play a part in the introduction of EU legislation in states.
Meanwhile, it continues to be the case that Poland, for example, still applies national imposition of value-added tax, VAT, despite the Sixth Directive and court rulings.
The same thing applies to double taxation on earned income.
There are known cases of duty being applied to vehicles purchased by Polish citizens in EU countries, despite rulings by the Court of Justice, and of delays in refunding wrongly calculated charges that have been paid.
One particular oddity is that our citizens are held on remand for years on end without any sentence having been passed.
The citizens of Poland are impatiently awaiting the European Commission's reaction to the examples provided and a curbing of the unlawful actions perpetrated by our government.
Finally, I would like to express my sincere congratulations to Mrs Frassoni; it is just a pity that this report concerns a rather remote past, and it would have been nice if it had been about 2007.
(DA) Mr President, comitology is a study of how to limit democracy without the electorate realising.
Firstly, power is transferred from the electorate and the popularly elected representatives to government officials and lobbyists behind closed doors in Brussels.
Voting is then made subject to complicated rules that no-one can remember, no journalist can write about and no textbook author can explain.
The essence of this is simply that the non-elected in the Commission will decide, unless a qualified majority can be established against the Commission.
It is legislative power that is being turned into executive power; it is transparent legislation that is being turned into secret decrees; it is a majority democracy that is being turned into a minority government.
It is not an absolute autocracy, but it is heading in that direction with a hint of Mussolini's corporate ideas.
With the new interinstitutional agreement, Parliament can put a matter back on the agenda, but only if the right and left wings of the House are in agreement and can produce an absolute majority of members in favour.
Scrap the mixing of autocracy, however, and govern with shrewdness and corporatism!
Introduce democracy in all legislation!
As a fundamental principle, let us see that a majority of the popularly elected representatives are behind every law, either from national parliaments or here within the European Parliament!
Legislation by government officials and lobbyists should be a thing of the past, yet it is unfortunately being cemented into place in the Treaty of Lisbon.
It is therefore another good reason to make the Treaty the subject of a referendum.
President-in-Office of the Council. - On behalf of the Presidency I would like to stress in a concluding comment that the Presidency is aware of the fact that efficient monitoring of the application of Community law is essential if the law is to be universally respected and if the general legal principles on which the running of the Community is based are to be safeguarded.
Primarily, however, it is important for ensuring legal certainty among European citizens.
It should not be forgotten that they have an important role in the implementation of Community law.
This role is also reflected in the number of complaints made by citizens about infringements of Community law.
During the debate, which I followed very closely, several people were astonished that the number of infringements, or at least perceived infringements, has not increased since the enlargement of the European Union.
Several speakers suspected that the Commission is not as strict with the so-called new Member States.
I must stress that the Presidency does not have any reason or evidence to support those doubts.
However, there is at least one possible explanation I can offer.
When it comes to the so-called new Member States, it must be taken into account that they became Members after many years of intensive transposition of Community law into their internal legal system, since when they have found it easier to continue the process on a smaller scale.
This is just by way of a comment on the suspicion that the Commission is not equally strict with all the Member States, but I think it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to comment on this matter.
To finish, I would like to stress that the Presidency attaches great importance to the common responsibilities and aims defined in the Inter-institutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking.
Finally I would like to encourage all institutions and Member States to fulfil their obligations in the transposition and application of Community law.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already said that today's debate should not be without consequences, and I want to re-emphasise that.
I will brief Mr Jung on the content of this debate and Parliament's input, and make suggestions too, as several very important suggestions have been made during this debate, which the Commission should take seriously.
Allow me to make another comment based on the philosophy of law: a community of nations under the rule of law is based on trust.
It can function only if those who participate can trust each other.
This is why, in a constitutional state, legal proceedings must take place in public and it is also the reason why I agree completely with what Mrs Wallis said.
Information is vital here, and transparency is imperative.
There can be no policy of secrecy in applying and interpreting the law.
Everything must be open and public.
That is what I take from this debate, anyway, and I have always been convinced of it.
I agree with what Mrs Wallis said about the role of the Committee on Petitions.
As her customer, in a manner of speaking, I freely admit that this sometimes requires a great deal of work and effort, but citizens are entitled to expect us to make this effort.
In addition, the petitions we receive teach us a great deal about how our citizens perceive our law and our policies.
Mrs Frassoni, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m has already promised that, in future, we will create a citizens' summary.
Since then, the Commission has also passed a formal resolution on this, so it is going to happen, and I am quite sure you will find ways and means of making very sure that we do it. It has been decided and it will happen.
Many Members have pondered the question of the new Member States and how it can be that, despite growth in the number of Members, there has been no growth in lawsuits for infringement of treaties.
The Commission has a very clear opinion on this, and that is that there are two reasons: firstly - and here I feel rather self-conscious, for I really ought to say that this is due to the good work of the previous Enlargement Commissioner - it has to do with the fact that the new Member States prepared so exactingly for their acquis that, at the time they joined, they met the requirements more precisely than the old Member States.
I can only confirm this.
It is the absolute truth.
We would never have been able to conclude the accession treaties if the acquis had not been fulfilled.
The other reason is perhaps somewhat more practical, however: citizens of the new Member States need to learn, gradually, that they can complain, and how to do so.
I therefore assume that the number of complaints will increase.
Mr Smith mentioned that the law must also be straightforward and applicable, particularly in regard to environmental legislation.
As we know, the Commission is working on reviewing all Community law by the end of next year in order to ascertain where and how it can be simplified.
Just a few days ago, as part of our presentation of progress on this 'Better Regulation' project, we promised that this whole process would indeed be completed by the end of next year.
Mr Medina, you do not need to worry that the Commission is sweeping complaints under the carpet.
From my own experience of more than eight years as a member of the Commission, I can assure you that I have had to put the brakes on overzealous Commission departments far more often than I have needed to urge them to fire up the heavy artillery of the treaty infringement process.
Far more frequently, I have to say to them: 'Hang on, just slow down, talk to them first and see if this can be resolved peaceably'.
The risk of Commission departments tending to brush things under the carpet is almost nonexistent.
I am certain that it does not happen.
As far as Mr Rack's question is concerned: decisions on treaty infringements, be it the lead-up or the conclusion or any individual step in between, require a formal decision by the College of Commissioners.
That is how it is organised.
I am unable here and now to answer your question about the specific problem of cross-subsidies, but I will make sure that you receive an answer before the end of this week.
Regarding Mr Kuc's remarks on the length of detention while awaiting trial, I admit that this would be a scandal if it occurred, but it is outside the jurisdiction of the European Union.
The European Court of Human Rights is the competent court for such cases.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all your suggestions and the constructive spirit of this debate.
I am fairly sure that we will have made further progress when we discuss it again next year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members, the Commissioner and the Presidency for their participation in this discussion which, as Commissioner Verheugen said, does not end here.
Just a few points quickly.
I would like to comment on the issue of defining priorities, which Commissioner Verheugen spoke about.
I believe this could actually be a risky exercise.
However, it has never really been done until now.
I have always been rather sceptical about the possibility of really defining priorities.
Anyway, if you really want to go along this route, take the risk of being transparent, and why not even debate these priorities?
Otherwise the suspicion could take root that the priorities have been chosen because you want to get rid of the inconvenient infringements.
I do not think this would be a good thing.
The second comment is that despite the fact that the Commission denies that it needs more resources, particularly human resources, to deal with infringements, the reality is that in almost all the meetings I have had with your fellow Commissioners, everyone has told me that they do not have sufficient resources, sufficient people, to deal with this matter.
In the debate the question came up of the number of infringements in the new Member States, and what the Commissioner and the Presidency said is probably true.
However, we should also know that, for example, on environmental matters, there are only two or perhaps three officials dealing with all ten of the new Member States, so obviously there is certainly a human resources problem.
Lastly, the issue of Parliament's role.
We are discussing internally various ways of making our role as co-legislators more effective, by following up the application of the directives we approve.
I believe there are two things we absolutely must do: the first is decisively, through a political decision, to strengthen the role of the Committee on Petitions, which as Mrs Wallis said, is our window on the world; the second is that we should systematically organise application sessions, which do, however, require the open cooperation of the Commission.
Because if we organise sessions where we discuss the application of directives and the Commission official who attends remains silent or tells us things that are of little interest - perhaps because he cannot say what we really want to know - then the whole exercise becomes pointless.
Anyway, thank you and we will undoubtedly speak about this again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Kosovo (debate)
The next item is certainly also tremendously important and topical.
It is the Council and the Commission statements on Kosovo.
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I think about it and overlook some of the detail, I must say that my generation and our younger colleagues have been quite lucky.
We have lived the greater part of our lives, perhaps the best part, at a time when the doors and windows of opportunity have been open.
That period started in 1975 with the Helsinki Final Act, and its consequences were most influential in eastern and central Europe, where the Berlin wall and the communist system collapsed in 1989.
A new vision burst onto the scene over the collapsed wall and through the open doors and windows of the western faÃ§ade of the Euroatlantic community.
We saw the broad, sunny, dynamic landscape of a united and free Europe, beautifully symbolised by this immense European Parliament building.
I could never imagine in my youth that one day I would speak in it.
In Slovenia we call the 1980s and early 1990s the Slovenian spring.
Sadly, right at the start of the democratic awakening, we were hit by the Yugoslav crisis, which attempted to halt democratic development and caused the peoples of the western Balkans to fall way behind.
Most western and central European countries, and here I mean the ten new Members of the European Union, have taken up the historic challenge, but time has stood still in the Balkans.
The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC), of which I am President, has, among other difficult tasks, that of putting the European perspective of the western Balkans into effect.
This means involving countries such as Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Albania in the system of European memberships, candidatures and agreements.
The Yugoslav crisis will have to end.
Doors and windows are open.
The wall is no more.
The European Union announced in the Thessaloniki Agenda that the western Balkan countries would sooner or later become members of the European Union.
Now is the time for us to remember our commitments.
We must endeavour to start negotiations with Macedonia, that is to say the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, on membership of the European Union.
Serbia must cast off the burdens of her past, namely the horrors and shadows of the MiloÅ¡eviÄ regime. MiloÅ¡eviÄ was the one responsible for the gridlock in the western Balkans.
And we must not forget Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Kosovo.
The EU-Western Balkans forum which is to take place in Slovenia at the end of March will be very important in this context.
In cooperation with the Slovenian Presidency, the Commission is preparing a special communication on the western Balkans.
The forum will also consider strengthening regional cooperation in various areas, such as transport, civil protection, research and development, and so on.
In accordance with the January decisions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Commission is discussing visa liberalisation with all the countries of the region.
We must not underestimate the exceptional importance that the gradual abolition of visas would have for this region.
At the same time, Mr President, we would like to point out a peculiar paradox.
Before 1990, the citizens of the former Yugoslavia travelled to most European countries without a visa.
Now, however, a whole generation of young people who grew up after that year which was a turning point for Europe need a visa to travel.
Ladies and gentlemen, at our January meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, we unanimously invited Serbia to sign the political agreement constituting a new step towards membership of the European Union.
After Mr TadiÄ, who is pro-European, won the elections, we were hopeful that, after many years of slow development and isolation, Serbia would join us as soon as possible.
The European Union has already sent a European security and defence policy mission to Kosovo.
However, establishing relationships with Kosovo is a matter for each Member State.
We will probably not differ in the fundamental assessments referred to at the December session of the European Council.
The most important aspect is to have consideration and respect for Serbia.
The European Union needs Serbia and Serbia needs the European Union.
In my opinion, intercultural dialogue is not an empty phrase.
Even if negotiations grind to a halt, the possibilities for dialogue are not exhausted.
Now is the time for practical dialogue between the Serbs and the Albanians in Kosovo, between Serbia and Kosovo, and between Serbia and the European Union.
The fate of Kosovo has burdened us for many years.
In the past, Kosovo was part of the Yugoslav federal system and in 1974 was given practically the same status as the Yugoslav republics.
Towards the end of the 1980s, Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ deprived Kosovo of its autonomy and in 1999 occupied it by military force, thereby causing a tragedy of global proportions.
The case of Kosovo is truly unique, because the international community had to take it under its protection for humanitarian reasons and then had to govern it for almost nine years.
Nevertheless, Monday's decision by the General Affairs and External Relations Council was not easy.
The decision and the declaration of independence in PriÅ¡tina were not unexpected.
We were led to it by the following facts.
Firstly, it was realised that a return to the previous position was not acceptable and nor was the present 'status quo'.
Neither side found a new formula to resolve the status of Kosovo, and it was obvious that further negotiations would not be fruitful.
Since 1999 Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations and, during that time, in accordance with Resolution 1244, Serbia has not been able to exercise any effective authority.
For a number of years prior to 1999 the majority of the population of Kosovo had been exposed to systematic repression, including ethnic cleansing and humanitarian disaster.
Ladies and gentlemen, all these facts, which were originally recognised by all the members of the contact group, including the Russian Federation, are evidence for the argument that Kosovo presents a really special case 'sui generis', which is why the validity of the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity is not in doubt.
For some time the Council has been convinced that the European Union must take responsibility for Kosovo.
This conviction was confirmed at the February session of GAERC in the decision we already know.
Even though everyone had predicted disunity, we nevertheless achieved unity.
After lengthy negotiation and harmonisation processes, the decisions were reached unanimously.
The European Union is an interesting and unique community.
Of course we are linked by common interests and common values.
Among them are respect and tolerance for differences.
We could say that we are linked through our differences.
At the end of the February session of the General Affairs and External Relations Council we adopted a common position.
The important conclusion of the session was that, in respect of the recognition of Kosovo, we expected each Member State to act in accordance with its own national practice.
Some may have expected the European Union as a whole to recognise Kosovo, but that is not possible because the European Union is not a state.
The European Union has adopted the common position on events in Kosovo and the western Balkans.
Firstly, the European Union noted that Kosovo had adopted a resolution on independence.
Secondly, the European Union took note that the resolution committed Kosovo to democratic principles, including the protection of the Serb minority and cultural heritage.
Thirdly, the European Union reiterated its commitment to the international mission there and its readiness to play a leading role in the region.
Fourthly, the European Union reaffirmed its commitment to the European perspective for the western Balkans.
Fifthly, the European Union would prepare specific economic measures for the wider region.
And sixthly, the European Union is well aware of the principles of the international community, but considers that, due to its sui generis character, the case of Kosovo does not call these principles into question.
Of course, Kosovo also comprises Serbs and their heritage and culture, and I would like to stress that it is a particularly precious component of European culture.
Many European peoples, including the Slovenians whom I represent, have important monuments to their own culture and ethnic heritage which are now outside their own present-day state borders.
This is a fact which does not create obstacles in contemporary Europe; on the contrary, it unites us.
The same applies to minority ethnic groups.
In our opinion, it is essential that, with its reaction to the declaration and recognition of Kosovo's independence, Serbia does not close the door to the European Union.
I repeat that the Kosovo question is separate from the question of Serbia's integration into Europe.
Serbia must not link these two questions.
In this sense we find it particularly difficult to understand Serbia's opposition to the European Union, that is to say to its mission in Kosovo, because this mission is primarily in the interest of Kosovo's Serbian population.
To conclude, the European Union is one of the most successful peacemaking organisations in the world.
The peoples and countries of Europe are united and practise solidarity for the benefit of peace and a better life.
This attitude also encompasses tolerance and generosity and, above all, understanding and compassion when others are in distress.
Ladies and gentlemen, with the decision which I have mentioned, the European Union has opened its doors and windows not only to Serbia, but also to Kosovo.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, recalling our excellent cooperation on the Western Balkans, I want to thank you for the opportunity to inform Parliament on the Commission's standpoint on the Kosovo status process.
Kosovo's Assembly declared independence last Sunday in a climate of dignity.
In its declaration, Kosovo committed itself to fully respecting extensive rights for Kosovo Serbs, especially with regard to local self-government in education, culture and health, in line with the comprehensive proposal presented by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
Celebrations in Kosovo took place in a joyful but responsible manner.
However, there have been acts of violence in Belgrade and North Kosovo.
We condemn the use of violence and call on all leaders and people of the region to remain calm and maintain peace and stability.
As Foreign Minister Rupel explained, the EU Foreign Ministers on Monday responded to developments in a united way.
European unity is indeed essential to enable the European Union to successfully steer the ongoing stabilisation in the Western Balkans and to help bring the Kosovo status process to a conclusion.
After the prolonged talks in the United Nations Security Council failed, the European Union was bound to steer the process to a conclusion.
The Union has already taken the essential decisions to send an ESDP rule of law mission to Kosovo.
On Monday, the Council also provided a platform for dealing with recognition.
It will be up to each EU Member State individually to establish relations with Kosovo in accordance with its national procedures.
Several Member States have already recognised Kosovo.
I expect most of the others to follow suit, at their own pace.
The Council rightly reiterated the EU's adherence to the principles of the UN Charter and the CSCE Helsinki Final Act and to all UN Security Council resolutions.
It underlined that 'in view of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration, Kosovo constitutes a sui generis case which does not call into question these principles'.
The Commission fully shares this position.
In line with Monday's Council conclusions, the Commission stands ready to provide its full support to the EU's effort in Kosovo.
This must be the hour of European unity also between the institutions.
By using Community instruments, the Commission will support institution-building in Kosovo and foster its political and economic development.
On 5 March, we shall propose concrete measures for the broader region in order to advance its European aspirations.
In Kosovo, many areas are in need of development, and we must strive together to help Kosovo to help itself, to stand on its own feet as quickly as possible.
In this context the Commission is working on organising a Donors' Conference that should help alleviate the most pressing financial challenges concerning Kosovo.
I expect the Conference to take place before the summer.
I know this is a difficult moment for Serbia.
I am very conscious of Kosovo's historical importance for the Serbian people.
However, I find that the time has come to turn the page on the past, and to look to the future.
And Serbia's future is in Europe.
Serbia and the whole region of the Western Balkans have a European perspective, with the ultimate goal of EU membership.
This EU perspective functions as the glue that keeps the countries of the region on a peaceful and reformist track, which is extremely important in these sensitive and difficult times.
Finally, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the unwavering support of the European Parliament for the EU perspective of the Western Balkans.
We count on your continuous support, so that the citizens of the region can fulfil their aspiration of becoming, one day, part of the European Union.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Kosovo's independence has been declared; Kosovo is a state.
Anyone who experienced the situation in Kosovo between 1989 and 1999 must have known that this independence was inevitable.
The long-time pacifist president and winner of our Sakharov Prize, the late Ibrahim Rugova, would be very pleased to hear of it.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to negotiate a solution.
I am sure that every one of us would have dearly loved to be part of one.
The current solution brings to mind a modified version of Churchill's aphorism: this is the worst option, except for all the others.
On Sunday I watched - half joyful, half tearful - as events unfolded in PriÅ¡tina.
Half joyful because I believe this was the only way out of the stalemate; half tearful because I am certain that we have created problems for ourselves that will not be easy to solve.
Nevertheless, the EU has been firm, even though the press has frequently painted a picture of disunity.
The EULEX mission was launched unanimously.
It is not an attack on Serbia; rather, it is necessary, including for the Serbs in Kosovo, because it will keep a close eye on implementation of the Ahtisaari Plan, which this Parliament passed by a two-thirds majority in spring 2007.
This plan guarantees extremely generous minority rights for the Serbs, respect for the borders and the rule of law, and therefore also the protection of other minorities.
Politicians in Kosovo must now create their state with sound judgment and determination.
The battle against unemployment can be won only by a functioning constitutional state.
Radical measures to deal with crime are an equally high priority.
The EU mission will support them in this, where possible.
Kosovo has a large number of well-educated young people who will be delighted to help establish the new state.
Kosovo is not a test case.
It is unique.
Its development into a state is the final stage in the downfall of Yugoslavia, initiated by MiloÅ¡eviÄ in Kosovo in 1989. I therefore regret the fact that MiloÅ¡eviÄ did not live to see it, but his democratic successors must take on this onerous inheritance.
We wish the Serbian politicians composure, and hope that they will now devote all their energy to taking Serbia along the path to EU membership.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, the House will understand that our group, too, has held a detailed discussion on the situation that has now arisen with regard to Kosovo.
The most important conclusion was actually that, whilst we have to accept the reality, there is no cause for celebration, as we are now faced with an extremely complicated situation, including in view of the reactions from Serbia.
After what happened under MiloÅ¡eviÄ, however, and also after years of negotiations to find a solution, what has now happened was unavoidable.
We should like to focus in particular on the role of the European Union.
The recognition of Kosovo is a matter for the Member States, as Mr Rupel and Commissioner Rehn also emphasised.
We do need to act, however.
We bear joint responsibility for stability in the region and also in Kosovo, and therefore our group lends its political support to the ESDP mission for which the Union has now given the starting signal.
Of course, we also require the Kosovo authorities to implement the Ahtisaari proposals, to make genuine investment in a multiethnic state and to put in place sufficient guarantees for Serbians living in Kosovo.
Finally, on the subject of Serbia itself, everyone is, of course, very uncomfortable with the situation there.
We have just had the opportunity to listen to the Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
He gave a hard-as-nails reaction to events, making an attack on Europe, particularly the countries that have now recognised Kosovo.
I have another question: what can we do to prevent Serbia being isolated by others and also by itself in this situation?
I was disheartened by his reply, as everything he said focused on the issue of Kosovo.
However, I think that we must continue to make strenuous efforts to offer Serbia a European perspective, including for the sake of its people, complete with a specific offer concerning, for example, visa facilitation and further visa liberalisation.
We must also place particular focus on the younger generation, which recently demonstrated in favour of movement towards the European Union, of a European future.
I commend the Serbian Government on its repeated commitment to refrain from the use of violence.
I am also assuming that it will refrain from imposing any economic sanctions on Kosovo.
What we can do, and what the European Parliament has the responsibility to do, is to continue to invest in a European perspective for the whole region, and also apply this to Serbia.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, every country created by breaking away from an existing country damages the territorial integrity of the original country and unilaterally alters the international legal order.
My country is one such example: it was created in 1830 by breaking away from the state created in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna.
Belgium's existence was recognised very quickly by the London Conference, which was attended by the United Kingdom, Prussia, Russia, Austria and France, but the Netherlands, from whom we had broken away, waited nine years before recognising Belgium.
I should actually have liked to tell the Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs this if he had wanted to hear it.
This was not the case, however, as he repeated the familiar Serbian position ad nauseam without even a glimmer of an appreciation that opposing points of view also existed.
The only chink of light was his clear statement that Serbia would not use any form of violence, blackmail or intimidation whatsoever.
We must all now concern ourselves with the future - the future of Serbia, of Kosovo, of the whole region.
The European Union has already spent EUR 3 billion on Kosovo to date.
A further EUR 200 million is to be added to this for the coming 16 months, but that will not suffice.
With regard to Serbia and all the other Western Balkan countries, we must attend to visa facilitation as a matter of urgency, so that relations between the citizens of those countries and the citizens of our countries can be normalised.
Mr President, in recognising Kosovo's independence, we have taken a huge responsibility upon ourselves; a responsibility for maintaining peace and for the construction of sound state institutions in Kosovo.
There is no scenario that would enable international forces to be promptly withdrawn.
Any solution, either leaving Kosovo in Serbia or showing support for its independence, brings with it a risk of conflict and ethnic tensions.
The Serbs must realise, however, that there is no way back to the situation as it stood prior to 1999. Destabilisation attempts are merely bringing them losses.
There is only one way for Serbia to gain support for its claims in the sphere of cultural and social rights, and that is through constructive cooperation in the region.
The failure of Kosovan independence will mean a return to the idea of a Greater Albania and inevitable war.
Such a war will bring political losses that will primarily affect Serbia.
This is why that state is responsible for avoiding this scenario and for stabilisation in the region.
Mr President, I am pleased that I was present in PriÅ¡tina last Sunday, when, in a truly dignified fashion, independence was proclaimed.
What happened there last Sunday was the inevitable consequence of what happened in 1998-99, when more than 10 000 Kosovars were murdered and hundreds of thousands forced to flee.
Could PriÅ¡tina have gone back to administration by Belgrade?
No.
Was muddling along after nine years of an increasingly illegitimate, increasingly ineffective UN administration an option?
No.
Would a negotiated compromise between PriÅ¡tina and Belgrade have been better?
Yes.
Would approval by the Security Council have been better?
Yes.
Was it attempted?
Yes.
Was there any chance of success?
No, particularly as a result of Russian obstruction.
I very much hope that, following the euphoria of the last few days, the Kosovars will shoulder their responsibility quickly, as it is they who are at the helm.
When the UN has gone, and when the EU mission has arrived, it is the Kosovars who must prove that good relations with minorities do not exist on paper alone, and that they are able to save the economy.
It is true that the EU is now divided on the issue of recognition.
This will last a few more months and then it will be over and done with.
What the EU Member States agree on unanimously is that the future of Kosovo lies in the EU.
The tempo of Kosovo's movement towards the EU will also depend on Serbia's position, however.
We have just seen in the Committee on Foreign Affairs how angry Serbia is, how angry the Minister for Foreign Affairs is, how aggressive his attitude was.
That will be a while in changing.
To be frank, I can appreciate this, provided such opposition remains non-violent.
When the anger has subsided, I very much hope that good sense will prevail.
It is true that the secession of Kosovo was inevitable.
It is true that the future of Serbia lies just as inevitably in the European Union.
To achieve this it is sometimes necessary to surpass oneself.
I wish the Kosovars and the Serbs great courage in this.
Mr President, it is difficult not to feel very uneasy about the responsibilities taken on by the European Union and its Member States in the Kosovo affair.
Firstly, in principle the EU aims to contribute to better world governance.
Yet under its impetus, several Member States have weakened or are about to weaken dangerously the future credibility of international law through their support for the unilateral declaration of independence by a province of a sovereign state, a member of the UN.
Whatever is said about the sui generis - because that is not decreed - the EU's major powers thus place power relations above the law, and in doing so open a Pandora's box.
This is serious.
Next, this unilateral recognition is in serious danger of going against the EU's stated objectives in the Balkans.
It will fuel nationalism rather than stemming its sources.
Furthermore, the EU has just deeply alienated the Serbian people, without whom any regional policy in that part of Europe is impossible.
As it happens I am not talking about those who would like to have MiloÅ¡eviÄ back, but those who opposed him and are now in the majority.
As for the Kosovo Albanians themselves, will the EU be able to satisfy their expectations after fuelling them?
It is a question worth asking, hence the third reason for the unease felt after this day of jubilation in Kosovo.
The new challenge the European Union has just given itself is quite breathtaking.
Here we are in the front line, heading towards a new protectorate, even though no satisfactory analysis has been produced of the reasons for the failure of the previous protectorate: Kosovo's gross domestic product is equivalent to that of Rwanda, half of its active population is unemployed, there are more than 200 000 refugees and displaced people, and violence against minorities is on the increase, despite EUR 2 billion of international aid and the presence of 17 000 NATO troops.
It will not be EULEX that sorts out all these problems.
What comprehensive lasting prospect is the European Union able to offer to the Kosovars and to the other peoples of the Balkans - a prospect that can stabilise the situation here without the risk of destabilising it elsewhere?
Membership?
Within what timescale?
Under what conditions?
With what degree of probability that the necessary unanimous agreement of the 27 Member States will be secured?
Nobody knows.
Clearly, my group cannot associate itself with the short-term self-satisfaction of the principal European leaders.
(Applause)
Mr President, the EU Special Representative in Kosovo and intended International Civilian Representative, my compatriot Pieter Feith, gave an inspiring interview in the Dutch press on the difficult task that lies ahead of him in Kosovo Polje.
I found one passage in this interview puzzling, however.
To the straightforward question of which of the external actors was in charge in Kosovo - the French ex-general Yves de Kermabon, who is to lead the European Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, or himself - Mr Feith replied, 'In political matters, I advise the French commander.'
As the Council, in turn, is Mr Feith's superior, I would ask Mr Rupel of that institution how exactly decision making is now taking place in Kosovo.
What is the situation with regard to international power relationships?
This is all very important for the future.
By way of conclusion, I should like to relay a disturbing quote from a Kosovo police officer: 'Serbs and Albanians have managed to come to terms with each other at criminal level.
Serbian and Albanian mafia organisations are cooperating excellently, and have been doing so for years.'
