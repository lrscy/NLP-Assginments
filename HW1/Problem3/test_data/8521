Secondly, it informs us that no governments are currently asking for European boats, and, thirdly, that the vessels and the industrial fish sector on the Atlantic coast are in every respect different from the traditional canoes and catamarans of Sri Lanka and India.
A fourth point is that local boatyards must do the repair work, for that is what they are good at, and that provides the people there with money, work and the wherewithal to earn a living.
Our money would buy something like 2500 boats in place of the 200 referred to here.
Fifthly, we must prevent our vessels from further interfering in the already gravely ravaged fishing grounds and local fishing communities.
The only conclusion to be drawn from this is: help the local fishermen in the boatyards, but do not send ships, or else, no matter how good our intentions, we will be inflicting another tsunami on the coasts of Asia.
I am disappointed that the Commission is willing to accept only 3 of this Houseâs 22 amendments, which, let me add, I was happy to support.
All this, along with the FAO letter and the reports from the NGOs on the ground, leads me to vote against the report.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would just like to make two points.
Firstly, while the Commission is trying to find innovative solutions to an unprecedented disaster, I would urge it to remain pragmatic about the impact of this gesture.
This proposal is well-intentioned.
I appreciate we all want to do all we can to help the hundreds and thousands of people who have lost their homes and their livelihoods because of the tsunami but it is important that this is additional help and not replacement help or help in kind and that this does not count towards the EURÂ 350Â million that the EU has already committed to this.
Secondly, I would like to ask the Commission to look at the best use for the larger decommissioned boats.
The fishing communities in India and Thailand were equally devastated and I believe that the more developed fishing industry in these countries may be better placed and better equipped, to use the larger vessels, so this idea should be explored.
Obviously, these boats will not be of any use to the individual, local fishermen, but they could be used by cooperatives or SME businesses.
It is important that all the countries are treated equally and that we explore the right avenue for them.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, in January 2005 the European Commission and the European Parliament joined the international show of solidarity by taking an instant decision to grant enormous amounts of financial and other assistance to the victims of the tsunami.
One of the ways in which non-financial assistance will be granted is the transfer of second-hand boats to fishermen who were affected by the tsunami, and who lost not only their families and their closest friends, but also their homes and the means of earning their living.
When the House held a vote on this resolution on Tuesday morning, noÂ one was in any doubt as to whether to vote in favour. This was a natural expression of emotion and solidarity.
There are a number of questions that must be asked, however.
Will the Commission pay out compensation to all of those to whom it has been guaranteed?
To what extent will this make extra demands upon the European Unionâs budget, and why does the Commission wish to transfer some of the cost to the Member States?
Will European fishermen who have decided to give up their jobs receive the compensation promised by the EU?
Will there be any chance of compensation for companies and steelworks that had already been awarded contracts to demolish boats and had incurred organisational costs, and will jobs created under the previous programme be safeguarded?
Should the Commission consider providing assistance for building new ports and shipyards in countries affected by the tsunami, instead of restricting itself to the transfer of old fishing boats?
Many thanks.
Â Â  . Mr President, as always there is no easy answer.
I shall attempt to address all the questions that have been asked, but I should like to start my answer with a phrase that MrÂ Kindermann used; âa political sign of solidarityâ.
Our aim is to send out precisely such a sign by means of this project, which is merely a small part of a much larger aid measure, and one way in which we can provide aid rapidly and to those who need it.
With your permission, I am now going to give a more specific answer to a few particular questions.
First, the question of the calculation.
I have heard talk of EUR 47Â 000, 50Â 000 per vessel.
As has already been explained to the Committee on Fisheries, these figures are not correct.
The vesselsâ owners are paid a scrapping premium for them in any case.
The only thing that changes is that the vessels are not scrapped but transferred, and the transport cost is no more than EUR 4Â 000 per vessel.
That is therefore the cost to be taken into account and not the fanciful figures that have been mentioned.
Incidentally, they are not small boats.
Small boats like dinghies can of course be rebuilt on the spot.
What we are talking about here, however, are medium-sized vessels of not more than 12 metres, and the necessary capacity for building such vessels does not exist on the spot.
Another question was about the age of the vessels.
The average age of European vessels in service is 25 years; that of the vessels that will be exported to the countries affected by the tsunami will be between 5 and 20 years.
We are not therefore talking about very old boats.
On the question of experts, I would like to say that experts have already been sent out and more will be sent.
Moreover, it is at our request that the FAO is making an assessment of needs and this point will be on the agenda for the 12 March ministerial meeting, at which Mr Borg will represent the Commission.
We are all in favour of close cooperation with the FAO; we will see to it that our experts are able to contribute.
So far as the establishment of the early warning system is concerned, together with experts from international bodies, the Commission is in the process of setting up early warning systems by transferring our technologies to the countries concerned.
Mr President, I would like to say very clearly that the condition of the vessels and their suitability for the needs will be examined by experts.
The needs will be assessed by the FAO.
We want to be ready if requests come in.
We have already had a request for vessels from Thailand.
Finally, Mr President, I believe this is a moral question.
Can we continue to scrap vessels here if they can be of use to fishermen on the other side of the world?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during voting time, which will follow shortly.
Â Â  I should like now to announce to the House and, at the same time, welcome to the distinguished visitors' gallery, the delegation from the Turkish Grand National Assembly led by vice-president Professor Dumanoglu.
The delegation attended the 5th meeting of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee yesterday and today.
Â Â  â Mr President, on a point of order.
At the beginning of this debate, the Commission informed us that it would not accept most of the amendments that have been agreed between the political parties in this House.
That now means that instead of sending meaningful help to the devastated fishing communities by way of skilled experts, fishermen, engineers, boat-builders and money, we are going to send one or two old, redundant boats at massive cost as a purely political gesture.
That is not helpful.
The FAO has written to the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries to explain that Sri Lanka and Indonesia reject this help.
They do not want these boats.
Under these circumstances we should think again, before the final resolution is voted upon.
I would suggest that we are not in the business of political gestures; we are in the business of giving real, meaningful help to the fishing communities that have lost their livelihoods and their lives.
Meaningful help does not mean sending one or two redundant boats from the Mediterranean.
I hope that we will therefore reject the Commission proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, you will not be surprised if I tell you that the Commission does not agree at all with what has just been said.
There was probably a little too much noise in this House just now to hear what the Commission said at the end of the debate.
So far as the cost is concerned, I will repeat what I said so that everyone can hear.
There is no cost of EUR 47Â 000, 50Â 000 or 100Â 000 per vessel.
In any case, these are vessels the owners of which are paid a scrapping premium.
Now the final destination for these vessels is not scrapping but transfer; that is what has changed.
The transfer of a vessel costs EUR 4Â 000 at the most, and they are vessels that are too large to be built on the spot.
Finally, we are supplying such vessels only if we are asked for them.
At present, we have a request from Thailand.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment in relation to Amendment No 7 presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, on which we will vote next.
This is a very important amendment, Mr President, and, together with others, our political groupâs final position on the important report on the next meeting of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva will depend on it.
Since this amendment is presented by the Socialist Group, I have spoken, rather than to the author â who is not in the chamber at the moment â to Mr Howitt, and I have proposed to him that, in order that our group may take a favourable position, we focus on the second part of this amendment and remove the first part.
Mr President, I shall simply propose an option on behalf of my group and I believe that the authors of the amendment agree with it.
The political groups clearly have the right to oppose, but we also have the right to vote against the report.
I therefore intend to take this opportunity, Mr President, to try to unite the house in relation to this report.
I believe that the essential content of the amendments is preserved, although our group is against it, and that this may be a reasonable solution that would allow our group to vote in favour of the resolution in the end.
Â Â  â Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, as I understand it, Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra proposes removing the word 'deplore' as part of a deal that maintains the support for the Brazilian initiative in this paragraph.
The Socialist Group accepts that proposal.
I have just spoken to the President of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and I appeal to other groups to support it because it will enable this report to be agreed in full.
Â Â  â To be quite clear, I want to ask MrÂ Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra whether he is in fact proposing that we remind the Presidency of his request to continue its efforts in support of the Brazilian initiative concerning discrimination based on orientation and sexual identity by seeking other countriesâ support for a resolution on this problem.
Is that it?
Does he want to repeat the terms?
In fact, if we delete the first part, we will have to restate what it is about in the second part.
Â Â  âMr President, this is the situation specifically.
I believe that a majority will be in favour of this proposal.
We are clearly opposed to it. But in these terms, I believe that, in the end, if the result of the rest of the vote on the amendment is positive, our group could consider taking a favourable position.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to point out, on behalf of the Socialist Group and my colleague, Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco, that we believe there may be an error on the voting list concerning Amendment 15, tabled by the PPE-DE Group.
This amendment mentions the recent declaration of the Donors Conference for Colombia held in Cartagena.
Also involved are the identical Amendments 4, 19 and 23, tabled by the Socialist and ALDE Groups.
These concern support for the recommendations of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia.
These are clearly not mutually exclusive.
It would be quite wrong for Amendments 4, 19 and 23 to fall if Amendment 15 is adopted, as the voting list suggests.
The services have advised me that this problem can be resolved by voting on the PSE and ALDE amendments as recital Ia (new), rather than as amendments to recital I. I ask for your support on this, Mr President.
In conclusion, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is established in Bogota by agreement with the Colombian Government.
It is actually funded by the European Union.
I hope the entire House will reaffirm its support for the work of the Office by supporting the PPE-DE amendments and the PSE/ALDE amendments.
Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra agrees that it should be voted separately, although he advises his Group to vote against.
I regret that, but I am grateful for his support in the technical matters concerning these amendments.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to apologise for tabling a last-minute amendment.
I believe this is an important amendment, however, as it could help ensure the adoption of legislation that would benefit millions of EU citizens.
ParagraphÂ 7 is divided into two parts, and I propose that the following text be added at the end of its first part: âin accordance with the decisions taken by Parliamentâs Committee on Legal Affairs on 2Â FebruaryÂ 2005 and by its Conference of Presidents on 17Â FebruaryÂ 2005â.
After this amendment, the first part of paragraphÂ 7 would read as follows: âinvites the Commission to review its proposal for the software patents directive in accordance with the decisions taken by Parliamentâs Committee on Legal Affairs on 2Â FebruaryÂ 2005 and by its Conference of Presidents on 17Â FebruaryÂ 2005â.
The second part of the paragraph would be left unchanged.
I thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, concerning Amendment No 15, I would like it to be considered as a supplement.
In that case, we could vote in favour, if not we will vote against.
Â Â  â Mr President, could I ask the Verts/ALE Group to accept this amendment as a supplement to the paragraph and not as a substitute for it?
Â Â  â Yes, Mr President, for Amendment No 21 we would like it to be a supplement.
In that case, we could vote for it, if not we will vote against.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I merely wished to extend my sincere thanks to all Members, especially those on the Right, who voted in favour of our amendments.
Unfortunately those Members were too few in number, and not enough consideration has been given to the social concerns that are of such crucial importance to us and to the public.
This means that we cannot vote in favour of this resolution, and we will continue to fight for the publicâs social rights.
Â Â  . â The conflicts and general developments in CÃŽte dâIvoire constitute a significant political issue.
The UN has a commitment with regard to this conflict and, by means of Resolution 1572 (2004), has decided to introduce restrictive measures against CÃŽte dâIvoire.
This resolution was adopted by the UN Security Council.
The UN is, and must remain, engaged in international issues.
The June List does not believe that the EU Member States should coordinate their respective commitments as members of the UN within the framework of EU cooperation.
There is a general tendency for the EU to attempt to promote its foreign policy positions.
We object to this development and recommend that there be national foreign policies, together with international cooperation within the UN.
Our fundamental view is that the EU should not be involved or engaged in issues of foreign policy.
We have consequently chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  . The most important issue addressed by this report is the effectiveness with which the EU deals with its international obligations, especially those arising from the fact that all of its Member States are Members of the United Nations.
In this context, and bearing in mind the Unionâs legal structure, this proposal for a Council regulation makes perfect sense.
Nonetheless, the intention of this proposal is to implement sanctions â and they will hopefully be implemented with the necessary rigour â intended to thwart anyone who may constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process in CÃŽte dâIvoire.
Given the fragile nature of this peace and national reconciliation process, it requires all the international protection that it can be accorded.
Furthermore, the sanctions laid down in this proposal do not concern â nor are they intended to concern â the wider population; rather, they are solely aimed at certain persons.
It is therefore evident that they are both useful and just.
For these reasons, I voted for the report.
Â Â  . â The aim of the proposal for a directive on unfair commercial practices is to increase harmonisation of rules on unfair commercial practices that harm consumersâ financial interests.
The directive is to help improve the functioning of the internal market and strengthen consumer protection.
The proposal bans unfair commercial practices.
We wholeheartedly support the completion of the internal market and effective consumer protection.
The reason that we are unable to support the proposal for a directive in its current form is that it threatens to result in Sweden being unable in the long run to retain its ban on TV advertising aimed at children.
We do not want to be instrumental in weakening the existing rules on advertising aimed at children and have therefore chosen to abstain in the final vote on the Bresso report in its entirety.
Â Â  . I warmly welcome this proposal to outlaw sharp practices by rogue traders.
Many of my constituents have suffered as a result of the kinds of behaviour this will hopefully bring to an end.
For example, one of the practices targeted by the legislation is prize draw swindles, where consumers and encouraged â often via mobile phone text messaging â to ring a premium-rate number for a prize that does not exist.
This new legislation will overhaul disparate national rules across the 25 nations of the EU and make it easier for consumers to take legal action against unduly aggressive or misleading selling methods.
It will also introduce a âgeneral dutyâ to trade fairly.
Â Â  . One of the essential prerequisites for the smooth running of the capitalist economic model is genuine freedom of choice for consumers, and genuine freedom of choice only exists when, , consumers are properly and accurately informed about the products and services that they purchase.
It is also true, however, that the overregulation of business is a barrier to standardisation and harmonisation and ultimately renders competition unworkable.
When the issues are viewed from this perspective, the directive of the European Parliament and the Council concerning unfair business to consumer practices in the internal market clearly manages to achieve, as stated in the report, âsufficient harmonisation of mutual recognition of national legislationâ, resulting in a proposal for a directive that the report rightly deems âproperly balancedâ.
Accordingly, I voted in favour.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance shares the universal concern that it should be ensured that the viability of the fishing communities in the regions affected by the tsunami be secured, but it has to be said, ladies and gentlemen, that the present regulation is a bad idea and a poor proposal.
We have had advice from the WWF and from the NGOs on the ground, and I have also sought an opinion from the FAO.
It is evident that the boats that we want to send there are completely inappropriate, being different in terms of structure; the fishing techniques used are different, and, without adaptation, aid can be counter-productive in its effects.
The operational maintenance of the boats we are willing to donate will also bring problems in its train.
Let me add to that the fact that the FAO confirmed to me that most of the fishing grounds in that area have been over-fished and that we have to take into account the limited biological capacities that exist there.
It is a matter of absolute necessity that fishing techniques be adapted accordingly.
As if that were not enough, ladies and gentlemen, the FAO also stresses that the affected countries do not wish to import vessels, whether old or new.
The Indonesian and Sri Lankan Governments have themselves told the FAO that they have no desire for such action.
The authorities and the fishing community would far rather receive support in building boats for themselves, adapted to local traditions and methods of fishing.
The FAO has confirmed that there is ample technical capacity in the area to build these vessels there.
In short, this sort of support is unwanted and inappropriate.
The Commission has even stated that it will accept only 3 of the 21 amendments we have passed, and so, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very large majority of my group has voted against this proposal for a regulation.
Â Â  â Mr President, I voted for this proposal, but I have to admit it was a difficult call to make.
In the end, I voted for it because I see it as giving the Commission permission to investigate the transfer of vessels to the tsunami region; it does not mean, even with this vote, that they have to go ahead with it.
I insist that the Commission take the FAO advice before taking any action; that they only respond to requests from tsunami countries and do not impose the transfer of vessels on any particular country; and that they carry out a full cost/benefit analysis of shipping boats to the tsunami region, as opposed to building boats in that region.
Today, we have given the Commission the green light to change the regulations.
What we have not said is that, even if they change the regulations, they should necessarily then start to send the vessels.
That decision should be based on other considerations.
Â Â  â Mr President, like my colleague, Mr David Martin, I found this to be a difficult vote.
I voted against this resolution with a heavy heart but I did so for practical and sensible reasons.
I was very disappointed by the Commissioner's lacklustre explanation and her rationale for rejecting Parliament's amendments.
They were amendments that would have moved the vote in the right direction.
Nevertheless, I believe that the proposal was a flawed gesture from the EU and not the sort of aid we should be intent on sending.
I was in the north and east of Sri Lanka recently.
I saw at first hand the devastation.
I saw boats ruined and lives devastated, but I saw nothing to make me believe that discarded, old, unwanted European vessels would be of use to them.
Nor can I believe it is economic to try to transfer them: a few hundred boats to replace thousands that were lost.
The people of Sri Lanka and elsewhere in South Asia need real help.
Eight-and-a-half weeks on from 26 December, here we are offering a few clapped-out boats.
I believe in real aid; helping the people to rebuild their lives themselves.
Give them the tools to build their own boats, suitable vessels.
Lend them the labour, by all means.
Help them make nets for continued fishing and everything else that they need.
At the moment that aid is not getting through in the way that it should.
We should not be in the business of just making gestures, however well-meaning they are.
Â Â  â Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to give a very brief statement about my vote on the transfer of vessels to countries hit by the tsunami.
I completely agree with Mr Evans.
I think that the region needs real help, not some symbolic gesture from the European Union.
I was very disappointed with the answers we received from the Commission as regards our criticism and amendments.
Right up until the last minute I was undecided whether I would vote for or against, but in the end I voted against.
This statement explains my decision.
Â Â  . â The tsunami disaster is a major international tragedy requiring global solidarity and generosity.
We have chosen to vote in favour of the proposal.
In our opinion, however, the UN is the international body best suited to providing humanitarian aid in connection with international disasters.
The UN has broader international support and greater experience in handling crisis situations than the EU.
We disapprove of the EU taking every opportunity to promote and strengthen its own position and influence.
In addition, there is good cause to question whether sending vessels from EU Member States to the countries hit by the tsunami is the most appropriate way of helping.
An alternative contribution would be to buy the vessels locally.
This would simplify the relief effort and contribute to the development of the local economies of the countries hit by the tsunami.
Â Â  . The tsunami disaster had an enormous impact on the fisheries sector in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Maldives, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Figures show that thousands of fishermen died, 110Â 000 vessels were destroyed, with the costs in the sector rising to around EURÂ 400Â million, more than EURÂ 450Â million if one includes repairing damaged port facilities.
The scale of the disaster means that a major effort is required on the part of the international community to support the rebuilding of this key sector
Unfortunately, the proposal to transfer vessels to these countries that were destined for the scrapheap in the various Member States illustrates the hypocrisy of nominal and barely practicable aid that does not address the needs on the ground.
We have arrived at the unheard-of situation of there having been no request from the countries affected.
According to the figures, with the money spent on sending out these vessels, 9Â 600 new ones suited to the fishing methods used in those countries could be built.
We therefore support the amendments aimed at turning this Commission proposal into humanitarian aid and financial and technical aid to develop the fisheries sector in the countries affected.
We must ensure compliance with the concept of transferring boats if requested and with the criteria laid down by the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
We voted in favour, in order to rectify a mistake.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the proposal as amended, substantially improved, by the European Parliament.
In particular, my own amendments, which were supported by a large majority make it clear that this should be only part of a wide range of necessary measures to aid the fishing communities around the Indian Ocean.
The challenge laid down by the European Parliament is to the European Commission to change its mind and accept our amended proposal, and to the Council of Ministers to follow the strong lead which we have given in this matter.
Â Â  .Â Â Despite my heartfelt sympathy for the victims of this unimaginable tragedy, I voted against the Council regulation, for the reasons I shall now explain.
No estimates have been made of the costs this measure will incur, although preliminary analyses indicate that they could be enormous.
The fishing boats sent out will be old ones that would otherwise have been scrapped.
In other words, they no longer meet basic safety requirements.
This is essentially the same as what happened in Poland during the 1997 floods, when flood victims were sometimes sent completely worn out clothes that were not fit to wear.
The European fishing boats in question were built to operate in conditions that are entirely different from those prevailing in the countries affected by the tsunami.
It has become very clear from what we have heard that countries such as Sri Lanka and the Philippines have absolutely no desire to be helped in this way.
For these and other reasons, I am inclined to believe that the sending of around 150Â fishing boats is intended to appease European consciences and to be a symbolic gesture.
Genuine assistance is what is needed, however, not symbols.
Seen in this light, it must unfortunately be concluded that the Council regulation does not make sense.
Â Â  . â The European Parliament voted today on a proposal whereby small fishing vessels no longer used in the EU would be transferred to fishing communities hit by the tsunami.
I fully agree about how important it is for the fishing industries of the countries hit to recover.
On the other hand, I do not believe that transferring fishing boats, as put forward in the proposal for a regulation, is the right way to proceed.
Transferring a number of fishing boats will not meet existing needs.
In addition, support for the fishing industries of the countries hit should be adapted to local needs and local demand.
Â Â  . â I am voting against this resolution, as I consider it to be contrary to the principles of the market economy.
Experience in Sweden shows that the solutions proposed in the resolution will make no impact on the problems there is a desire to solve.
Â Â  . â The June List does not believe that the European Parliament should become involved in deciding where enterprises should locate their production.
Each Member State should be free to conduct its own industrial policy within the framework of competition law.
The survival of the European steel industry depends on its competitiveness on the international market, not on protection and subsidies.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the resolution on future prospects for the steel industry.
The steel industry is one of the areas in which technological development is crucial and in which we have come across a number of examples of areas of production viewed as models in terms of their technological know-how.
These industrial activities account for a large proportion of the population of the enlarged Europe and, in recent years, there has been substantial public investment in innovation and development in European industrial interests.
I should like to point out that much of that investment has come from Community funds and that clear and practical rules are required as to how those funds are used.
We must not allow the businesses concerned to sidestep the agreed conditions on the basis of which they enjoy those subsidies, obligations such as long-term production in the territory and maintaining jobs.
The situation is all the more serious when, as mentioned in the resolution, the business concerned registers positive net results and economic growth, and yet takes the inexplicable decision to relocate or to close the plant in question.
Â Â  .â We express our undivided solidarity and support for the workers at the Thyssen Krupp steelworks in Terni in Italy, who are fighting for the right to work and for industrial steel production to be protected and against the anti-labour policy of the EU and of the company, which is expressed in terms of coercion and threats of further redundancies.
Nonetheless, we abstained from the vote on the joint motion for a resolution by the European Parliament because:
- it places the workers' interest within the Lisbon strategy, which is an assault on employment rights and which promotes mass redundancies and unemployment;
- it equates the interests of workers being made redundant with the competitiveness of the European monopolies and of this specific industrial group and pleads for social cohesion, meaning the abolition of the class struggle to reverse mass redundancies;
- it calls for more 'corporate social responsibility', thereby cultivating the dangerous delusion that monopolies can be pro-worker and pro-grass roots.
The state of the steel industry is the result of capitalist restructurings, market liberalisation and the concentration of capital.
The European Union itself and the governments of the Member States have strengthened big business in the practices of restructuring, relocating and shutting down units and activities, indifferent to the social consequences.
The right to work and satisfaction of contemporary grass-roots needs will be achieved through the working-class and grass-roots fight against the ÎU and its anti-labour policy.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to give the following explanation of vote with regard to the vote on the human rights report.
We have voted in favour of the report as a whole, although there are a number of key paragraphs in it that we have been unable to endorse, above all the one relating to reproductive health and the Brazilian initiative.
I should like to stress that our Group voted against these points because we do not wish the human rights report to be used as a pretext for the liberalisation of abortion through the back door.
Â Â  â Mr President, with this resolution on human rights we have looked at the situation in a very large number of countries of the world, which are mentioned in the United Nations report.
There are so many, it would be impossible for me to list them all.
What is worse, a recital to the resolution that was adopted expresses concern that not enough of them are mentioned.
This disturbing list of countries does not include any Member States of the European Union.
That really is a problem, ladies and gentlemen, because I think we ought to put our own house in order first, the Kingdom of Belgium for example, where we have recently witnessed the sorry spectacle of an unbelievable legal action brought by an agency directly dependent on Prime Minister Verhofstadt and financed by him.
I am referring to the âCentre for Equal Opportunitiesâ, the director of which is a Dominican by the name of Johan Leman, a new kind of Torquemada, who, following scandalous proceedings, brought about the prohibition of the Vlaams Blok, a perfectly legal and peaceful party, simply because of its beliefs.
It is an absolute scandal, but it has never been mentioned in this House other than by members of the political grouping in question.
Finally, what should we say about the situation in many European countries, including France?
France, where âthought crimeâ is hunted down in many fields; where making reference to the crimes of communism during the second world war is banned on the pretext of revisionism; where criticism of immigration policy is banned on the pretext of combating racism; where mentioning a legitimate national preference is banned on the pretext of fighting xenophobia; where, only recently, on the outrageous initiative of Mr Perben, stating a preference for the natural family over homosexual or lesbian partnerships is banned on the pretext of fighting homophobia; that is the scandal our Parliament should be concerned about.
Â Â  . I am very much in favour of the work of the UNHCR in Geneva, but I do think sometimes we should proceed a little more carefully, engaging in real versus resolutionary politics.
The European Union had a human rights dialogue with North Korea modelled on our human rights dialogue with China.
This was suspended in 2003 when the EU sponsored in Geneva a highly critical human rights resolution on North Korea without even informing our interlocutors in advance.
At a recent meeting I attended in Geneva on the issue of human rights in North Korea, in the presence of the special rapporteur for North Korea, we were told we must have a new resolution next month because there was no dialogue, something we lost with the initial resolution.
It might have been worth considering whether a real ongoing dialogue might do more to assist improving human rights than merely passing resolutions.
Â Â  . On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, can I stress that we strongly support human rights and the call for free elections in Zimbabwe.
That is why we specifically support, in today's resolution, condemnation of the failure of the EU's resolution on Zimbabwe at the UNCHR last year, calling for the EU once again to co-sponsor a resolution condemning human rights abuses in Zimbabwe in Geneva this year.
Today we voted against EPP amendment 12 for the technical reason that it simply duplicates these political positions, which were already contained in Parliament's text.
Â Â  . â The resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs expresses in its entirety the reactionary, aggressive and anti-grass roots foreign policy of the ÎU and its imperialist character.
It uses as a pretext human rights and their selective protection, legitimising intervention in and even war against countries.
It is no coincidence that the long list of countries on which the UN is called upon to issue condemnatory resolutions also includes countries in the immediate sights of imperialism (Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, Belarus, Zimbabwe and so on).
It refers to violations in dozens of countries, but is provokingly silent on the subject of the human rights of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, Afghans, Palestinians and so on murdered during the imperialist wars and interventions.
On the contrary, it collectively condemns Iraqi and grass-roots resistance in general as terrorism.
It hypocritically emphasizes the protection of the fundamental freedoms which it massacres with the so-called anti-terrorist laws which criminalise social struggles.
The references to poverty, hunger, environmental pollution, health, education and so on are an insult to the grass-roots classes and millions of people in the third world who are deprived of fundamental human rights as a result of the (temporary) imperialist and capitalist dominion.
That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall vote against the resolution.
Â Â  . The EU and its 25 Member States must endeavour to look upon the forthcoming 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as a further opportunity to put into practice the stated and repeatedly reaffirmed values of the EU and each of its 25 Member States.
The EU has undoubtedly been a factor in the expansion of the defence of human rights, both in its relations with third countries â although some serious anomalies continue to exist â and, particularly, throughout its enlargement process, whereby the expectation of accession or some kind of privileged partnership with the Union has led to some welcome reforms in various countries.
What we must do â beyond saying that the content is right but the practice is failing â is be consistent with the values that we state, both as a Union and as countries.
This is the idea that must be uppermost in the minds of those participating in the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights when it gets underway.
The world will only be a better place if someone shows the way forward, and we should be that someone.
It was in this spirit that I voted in favour.
Â Â  . I welcome this resolution and the support it gives to G8 countries in their plans for up to 100% debt relief to the world's poorest countries.
It is important that money for debt cancellation comes from new funds and the diversion of existing resources for development.
To this end debt relief must be treated and reported separately from aid.
Developing countries must be encouraged to use funds saved from debt repayments to finance core services such as health and education without which it will be practically impossible to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
In this context it is important that the poorest countries are not subject to undue pressure to liberalise their service sector in reciprocity for EU trade liberalisation.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on action against hunger and poverty because I feel that we must keep a close eye on all of the measures that have been proposed and put in place to combat this scourge that affects millions of people around the world.
I should like to reiterate my deep concern at the delay in meeting the deadlines for complying with the millennium development goals and to point out that debt and trade relief are key factors to be taken into account when drawing up measures to fund development.
The main challenge that we face is the difficulty in finding the right means of ensuring that the poorest countries receive transparent and effective help.
The Member States and the Commission must continue the work done in this area on a continuous basis and must be alive to any potential new initiatives, be they private or public, that may contribute towards raising the level and effectiveness of aid, towards debt relief for the poorest countries in the world and towards international trade, which plays a crucial role in eradicating the root causes of poverty and hunger.
Â Â  â Mr President, I want to give an explanation of vote on the Commission's legislative work programme.
I did not vote to support this report because, while much of the content of the work programme is acceptable, I was concerned about what is not there.
I am concerned that the EU continues to overregulate; it continues to produce legislation that is too detailed, imposes too much red tape on enterprise, and is significantly harming the prosperity of Europe and its Member States, including, of course, the United Kingdom.
I am also concerned that we do not see serious enough measures put in place in this work programme to try and get serious financial control over the EU budget.
It is not acceptable that, for nearly a decade, the EU has failed to produce a budget that is capable of being signed off by its own auditors, and that over 80% of the EU budget is not properly accounted for.
It is taxpayers' money, and I would have liked to have seen a Commission work programme that took this scandalous situation much more seriously and proposed action to deal with it.
I would also very much like to see a Commission work programme that considered ways in which powers could be returned to Member States, to decentralise power in the European Union, rather than driving forward more integration with the euro and the European constitution, both of which I firmly oppose.
One thing I am pleased about is that Amendment 64, the amendment on Cyprus, proposed by the Liberal Group, was rejected.
That would have sought to increase economic ties with the unrecognised regime in Northern Cyprus.
It is important that we give financial support to Northern Cyprus, but that must be through the recognised democratic Government of the Republic of Cyprus.
It would not be acceptable to have direct links with a regime that is not recognised.
The reason for the embargo is the initial invasion by Turkey that took place so many years ago.
This is not an international boycott: it is simply that the regime there is not capable of issuing export certificates.
Therefore, the embargo is a reflection of the illegal nature of the invasion by Turkey.
That is why I cannot vote to lift the embargo, but I would support legitimate financial support being given to Northern Cyprus but only with the consent and cooperation of, and via, the democratic, recognised, lawful Government of Cyprus.
Â Â  . When what is really required is a sea change in the orientations and objectives of Community policies, by revoking the Stability and Growth Pact and replacing it with a Growth and Employment Pact, along with root and branch changes to the Lisbon strategy in order to put an end to the liberalisations and privatisations in industries and essential public services and to give absolute priority to the creation of jobs with rights and to the fight against poverty and social exclusion, the Commission continues to follow the path of even greater liberalisation; that is, more of the same.
When it is disclosed that the operating profits of the large companies in the EU rose by almost 80% in 2004, and that the percentage of profits as a proportion of GDP in the euro zone is currently approaching its highest level in the past 25 years; while salary levels continue to fall, yet both the trade balance and the balance of payments on current accounts in the euro zone have registered positive results in the past 12 months, we cannot accept the prevailing strategic importance that the Commission attaches to competitiveness and on the structural economic reforms.
It is also unacceptable that the new Social Policy Agenda is deprived of both the necessary instruments and adequate financial resources, ...
Â Â  . My EPLP colleagues and I abstained on the final vote as we did not wish to vote against the whole resolution.
We believe that the Commission Work Programme takes forward the Lisbon Agenda and details some necessary environmental action.
Â Â  . â I shall be voting against the Commissionâs legislative work programme, presented by MrÂ Barroso, for the following reasons.
It says nothing about the withdrawal of the directive on services or of the country of origin principle.
It gives no precise commitment for a framework directive on public services.
There is no upward fiscal and social harmonisation, and the anti-social trends of the draft âworking hours directiveâ are maintained.
It calls for flexibility, for structural reforms to take account of ageing, which will call retirement schemes and labour law into question.
Its industrial policy is weak, containing no sectoral plans for sectors such as textiles, nor a strategy to prevent relocation.
It lacks ambition in development aid, especially with the creation of a tax on capital movements.
It is clear that this programme does not make for the creation of a genuinely social Europe, but will instead pose a threat to the present European social model.
It confirms the ultraliberal tendencies of the Barroso Commission.
Â Â  . I welcome the Commission's intention to promote policies designed to get the European economy moving.
However, I am not convinced that the programme presented to Parliament strikes an appropriate balance between being âpro-businessâ while continuing to promote social inclusion and sustainable development.
Economic, social and environmental policy do not appear to be addressed in an integrated way.
For example, I am concerned that no proposals to promote equality of opportunities between men and women or to reduce economic disparities between regions are included in the work programme.
I also find it unacceptable that the Commission does not foresee any legislative action in the priority area of climate change.
Â Â  .â The barbaric reality experienced by the workers and the peoples is the result of the imperialist policy of war, the policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, exploitation by the multinationals and predatory free trade agreements.
The ÎU and the European monopolies are jointly responsible for the situation.
Neither resolution contests the unfair international economic order or its causes.
They pass in silence over the attack on workers' rights and the general wave of privatisations, even in health and education, under policies implemented by conservative and social-democrat governments.
They have deleted all reference to the unfair, imperialist wars against Iraq, Afghanistan and so on.
Universal problems are deliberately projected, so as to conceal the class character of the policies applied for the benefit of big business.
Both resolutions cultivate the theory of social assent and social partnership in a bid to bring the workers and other movements to subordination and subjugation to capitalist barbarity.
The motion by the European People's Party and the Liberals proposes the formulaic solution of the free market, WTO agreements and G7 agreements, while the other resolution proposes a more democratic form of global governance, which will never come about through the dominion of the imperialist class.
To conclude, an effort is being made to legalise the reactionary Davos guidelines on the pretext of the World Social Forum, by projecting the message that a world other than a capitalist world is not feasible.
The Communist Party of Greece will vote against both resolutions.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the resolution on the World Social Forum and the World Economic Forum.
I feel that globalisation offers genuine opportunities for growth and for improving standards of living throughout the world.
I should like to highlight the work of these two fora each with its own perspective, in addressing global issues such as the fight against poverty, health, education, trade, agriculture and human rights.
I wish to restate my belief that globalisation must be accompanied by strenuous efforts aimed at reducing poverty; we must recognise the value of cancelling debt as a means of fighting poverty in countries where progress is made towards democratisation, respect for human rights, the rule of law and a sustainable economy.
I wish to restate my belief that globalisation is a key element in promoting competitiveness and growth in the EU and in developing countries.
I therefore feel it is essential to establish a worldwide system of free and fair trade.
I also wish to point out that this work is being done primarily by the World Trade Organisation, the main forum for managing globalisation by means of opening up trade, by strengthening multilateral standards and the pursuit of sustainable development.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the parliamentary elections in Moldova.
Within the scope of the European Neighbourhood Policy, Moldova continues to pursue the reforms in the Action Plan, which was drawn up to promote and consolidate democracy, respect for the values of the rule of law and respect for human and civil rights.
The political and institutional reforms will offer the country gradual integration into the EUâs policies and programmes.
Accordingly, I wish to restate my belief that the forthcoming elections will be an important yardstick for measuring the Moldovan authoritiesâ commitment to democratic standards.
I also note with concern that the situation as regards access to information in Moldova has yet to be resolved.
Parliament therefore expects from the elections a clear sign that the Moldovan Government will ensure that the parliamentary elections will be free and fair, both on election day itself and throughout the election campaign.
I am sure that my country, which has a large Moldovan community, will work with the Moldovan diplomatic authorities to find ways of helping the highest possible number of Moldovan immigrants to have access to the ballot box.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this important report on promoting health and safety at the workplace, drawn up by a Member of our Group, which contains a number of very positive proposals.
The figures cited in the communication are alarming: 5Â 200 workers lose their life as a result of work-related accidents per year.
Throughout the EU there are about 4.8Â million work-related accidents per year.
About two thirds of accidents lead to an absence of more than three days at work and almost 14% of workers suffer more than one accident in a year.
This means that around 158Â million daysâ work are lost annually, and nearly 300Â 000 workers will get various degrees of permanent disabilities resulting from a workplace-related accident or disease every year.
It is estimated that the total cost to the economy amounts to between 2.6% and 3.8% of GNP.
These data are evidence of the high economic cost of not having appropriate social policy in place, which constitutes a major obstacle to attaining the strategic objective of full employment.
The framework directive could go further and could be more practical...
The proposals tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are unacceptable.
Â Â  . â The June List has chosen to vote against the own-initiative report on health and safety at the workplace.
This report deals with important issues, and the June List supports many of the basic ideas proposed.
A good working environment is important for all employees.
The June List is of the opinion, however, that each Member State must be permitted to decide for itself how it wants to achieve a good working environment.
As far as Sweden is concerned, for example, it is a matter for negotiation between the social partners, and not a matter for regulation by EU legislation.
Â Â  .
I congratulate Mr MaÅ¡tÃ¡lka on his important report on promoting health and safety at the workplace, to which I offer my support, particularly as regards the need to strengthen the system of prevention as a key means of increasing safety at work and of reducing the number of work-related accidents.
It is now fundamental for the Commission to examine the state of Member Statesâ preventive systems in greater detail and to come forward with proposals, in cooperation with the competent national authorities, for framing coherent national prevention policies based on an overall EU strategy.
To this end, it is essential to improve the statistical system for accidents at work, since the absence of reliable and compatible statistics makes it difficult to devise Community policies and promote them in an effective way.
Health and safety at work represents one of the Communityâs most important policies, and safe and healthy organisations have a very positive knock-on effect on the economy and on competitiveness in a society.
Â Â  . The report before us raises a general point that has, in itself, influenced my vote.
Whenever we speak about health and safety at work we immediately think of how far we have come since the beginning of the industrialisation process.
This unavoidable thought process illustrates that, as far as this issue is concerned, what is acceptable today will fall short of what is required tomorrow.
In other words, we are increasingly demanding and, with regard to this issue, that is a sign of significant progress.
That is the first consideration.
Although I do not agree entirely with some of the points made in the report, and whilst I would change the order of priorities in some cases, I welcome the thrust of its content, because its guiding principles are close to mine on this issue.
Indeed, bearing the above in mind, I believe that the defence of health and safety at work is a prerequisite to the kind of civilisation that we must promote, and, moreover, amounts to an obligation on the part of employers, because businesses also have social obligations.
In addition, the better the conditions at work, the greater the productivity, the better the quality of work and the lower the losses incurred, both individually and collectively.
Consequently, I voted in favour.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all I would like to apologise to the services, who do a great deal of work, most of it unthanked and unrecognised.
I know that they work long through the night.
I approached them yesterday in relation to a ruling on paragraph 89 of the Commission's legislative proposals.
I have to apologise because I believed that another colleague would raise this at the time and I expected a ruling on the admissibility of that paragraph from you.
Therefore, I should like to ask if such a ruling has been made.
If so, was it made in conjunction with paragraph 88?
In any event, is what we voted on today legally admissible?
Â Â  Mr Cashman, I have to tell you that the matter has in fact been examined and that paragraph 89 was considered admissible.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am sorry to raise this again but, given that this issue was raised, I thought, as indicated in the voting list, that the matter had been referred to the authorities for a ruling.
We expected â perhaps wrongly â that the ruling would be made prior to the vote being taken.
Mr President, are you telling me that the ruling was that paragraph 89, as written, was in any event admissible?
Â Â  Indeed, the paragraph, as written, was admissible.
This is what they told me.
We just had the ruling before the voting.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the sitting is resumed.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning PopeÂ JohnÂ PaulÂ II was admitted to hospital in Rome.
Before we begin the debate on the defence of human rights, I think it is appropriate, if you agree, to send a message of support and solidarity from Parliament to a great defender of human rights, a man of peace and a great European, loved by all European citizens, believers and non-believers alike.
I think that this could be an important signal from the European Parliament.
Â Â  Yes, certainly, Mr Tajani, we shall immediately communicate your suggestion to the President's office, since I believe it is very appropriate and we will tell the President that the House wishes to send a message of support and solidarity to the Holy Father at this time.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Togo(1).
Â Â  â Mr President, it is not only in monarchies that the Head of Stateâs children succeed to power; it is also, alas, not unknown in republics.
It has already happened in Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, more recently in Togo, and may well happen soon in Egypt as well.
It sometimes happens that elections are announced to decide the succession, but it is known in advance who will emerge from them as the victor.
In Togo, this step was missed out; the GnassingbÃ© family took power by violent means from the Olympio family a long time ago, and they want to hold on to it.
An amendment to the constitution, accomplished in the twinkling of an eye following the death of the Head of State, prevented the President of the countryâs parliament from succeeding him temporarily and preparing new presidential elections in good time, and instead made it possible for his son to take over the state as if he were the heir to private property.
The fact is that the son is in no more legitimate a position than his father; what is happening is the continuation of a long-past .
Continuing this state of affairs has robbed Togo of the hope that it, having been a German and then a French colonial possession, and then for a long time a home-grown dictatorship, might develop into a democracy.
Up to now, it has been cause for popular lamentation that power has almost always been in the hands of profiteers who were supported by military might and were not concerned with serving the national interest; their concern was rather with taking up their privileged positions.
Not only in Togo, not only in Africa, but throughout the world too, this state of affairs must come to an end.
Instead of being selective in our outrage at what is happening in Togo, let us help to put a stop to the military and economic protection of regimes of this kind.
That is what matters at the present moment.
The unfortunate fact that it is the rule rather than an exception means that we have to ensure that these events do not repeat themselves and that it would be a good thing if free elections could be held in Togo within a short period of time.
Â Â  â Mr President, I believe that the reaching of a clear conclusion about the events in Togo demands that a differentiated approach be adopted towards them.
Togo is similar to many other West African countries in that it is an artificial state, created to serve colonial interests, and indeed one only needs to glance at a map to see this, as Togo, in common with most other West African countries, is shaped like a narrow handkerchief.
Togo was governed first by German and then by French colonial masters, but its borders were imposed artificially, and initially there was very little chance of it enduring in this form.
In view of the fact that Togoâs borders were drawn on a drawing board, with entire peoples and families being torn apart in the process, and other ethnic groups that had nothing in common being artificially merged, it must be said that in spite of this the country made every appearance of developing remarkably well for a number of years.
It appeared to be an island of stability in West Africa, even though we are all aware that there have barely been any real democracies in our sense of the word in the region.
Yet EyadÃ©maâs rule, as MrÂ Meijer has pointed out, has come ever more to resemble an extremely violent dictatorship, and attempts are now being made to put it on a hereditary basis.
Without wishing to deny the fact that families and tribes have a different meaning in Africa than in our societies, it must be said that we cannot accept this hereditary dictatorship.
Our demands are therefore quite clear; resignation by the President, who came to power illegally, a reinstatement of the parliamentâs legitimate President, free elections to be held without delay, and widespread respect for the rule of law and human rights.
Above all, one thing must be clear; this time the African Union itself â and this is something I welcome greatly â as well as the West African Economic Community that is forming along the lines of the EU have made it very clear that they do not accept this illegal rule.
I should like to thank both these communities, and see this as an encouraging sign that Africa is â albeit hesitantly â beginning to seize its own destiny in such issues, and deserves our full support in so doing.
Â Â  â Mr President, after nearly 38Â years of dictatorship by President EyadÃ©ma and with his son Faure GnassingbÃ© having seized power in defiance of every constitutional rule and the commitment given in Brussels on 14 April 2004 for a return to political dialogue between all forces, Togo is sinking deeper every day into crisis and the risk of civil war.
The Togolese people and Togo nationals living in our European countries are looking to the European Parliament and the European Union to take a firm and resolute stance.
They want our solidarity and new prospects for their future and that of their children.
This requires first of all a genuine return to popular sovereignty.
There are two conditions for that. The first is that FaureÂ GnassingbÃ© must withdraw immediately and without argument and put an end to this hereditary dictatorship that he sought to install by military in defiance of democratic principles and the laws of his country and in violation of international law.
The second is the restoration of constitutional legality and the resumption of pluralist dialogue involving all parties, including of course the opposition parties.
Only MrÂ Natchaba, the speaker of the National Assembly, would be in a position to provide an interim government to prepare for presidential elections in accordance with the constitution.
It will only be possible for Mr Natchaba to return to Togo if his safety can be guaranteed, however.
In this connection, Mr President, I want to stress the justified concern expressed in this House yesterday by a representative delegation of associations of democratic movements and human rights associations about the real risks that political activists, human rights activists and journalists are running today.
With my colleague, Marie-Arlette Carlotti, we received them and listened to them with the greatest attention, because some of them, or members of their families, have been physically ill treated and abused under the EyadÃ©ma dictatorship.
They made an emotional appeal to us and to all international bodies to take definite concerted action to restore democracy permanently to Togo.
Knowing that their country, which is already subject to sanctions, has suffered during the last several years, they nevertheless said they expected us to adopt a firm and tough attitude towards Togo if nothing happens to guarantee the holding of free elections.
Our resolution responds to that expectation by referring to sanctions, some of which have already been imposed by the Economic Community of West African States, while others are planned by other international bodies.
For my part, I want to stress the need for targeted measures to be taken quickly concerning the supply of arms and transfers of money outside Togo.
International bodies must also act to give the population the security necessary for future elections to be prepared for in an atmosphere of calm.
It is essential that the political parties should be able to conduct a proper election campaign; it is equally essential that all the media do their duty by providing information.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it almost beggars belief that, in 2005, we can still have tinpot dictators seizing control of countries based on nothing more than being the sons of their fathers but, sadly, that is reality in Togo.
The good news, as Mrs Trautmann has emphasised, is that the Economic Community of West African States responded very quickly and positively.
They insisted on the withdrawal of all their ambassadors, they applied trade sanctions, they banned arms sales and stopped issuing visas both for their own citizens to visit Togo and vice versa, for Togolese citizens to visit their countries.
That is a step in the right direction.
We need the rest of the international community to follow that example.
The European Community needs to support the democratic forces which, I am glad to say, exist inside Togo.
We need to give them encouragement; we need to urge the army to stay in its barracks.
As Mrs Trautmann has said, we need to try and work with Mr Natchaba to establish a situation whereby he can return to his country and organise fair and free elections.
The idea that this is popular is killed by the fact that, on seizing power, the president has had to ban all public demonstrations for two months.
He has closed eight television and radio stations and has made sure that every other voice of opposition is oppressed.
This is a coup in every sense of the word and we should show no sympathy for it.
Â Â  . Mr President, as the honourable Members know, the Commission is following the situation in Togo very closely.
Incidentally, EU aid to the country has been suspended since 1992, and the unconstitutional seizure of power, described as an hereditary dictatorship, has called into question any hope of normalising relations with the country that we might have had at the end of last year.
The European Union has responded firmly by condemning what must be considered a and by calling for a return to the constitutional order and respect for the principles of the rule of law.
MrÂ LouisÂ Michel has voiced a very firm position on behalf of the Commission.
Everything we are doing and saying is therefore in support of the action taken by the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, which have been exemplary in their handling of the Togo crisis.
The actions of the international community have already begun to have an effect, since on 18 February MrÂ GnassingbÃ© agreed to hold presidential elections within the time laid down by the constitution.
However, we must also condemn the breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the days following the takeover.
Demonstrations were banned and many radio and television stations were closed.
The first demonstration was put down violently, pressure was put on journalists and arbitrary arrests were reported.
It was because of international pressure that the Togolese Government started to backtrack.
The right to demonstrate was restored on 18 February and some radio stations were able to resume broadcasting from 21Â February.
So far as cooperation is concerned, Mr President, and in particular the ninth EDF, the Commission is therefore sticking to the conclusions of the consultations contained in the Council decision of 15 November 2004.
There will be no new cooperation measures until free and transparent elections have been held, and obviously that now also means presidential elections, which are part of the process of returning to the rule of law.
There will therefore be no resumption of EU aid outside that framework.
The Council decision of 15 November last also provided for a partial resumption of cooperation.
All the projects concerned are suspended until the situation is clarified.
So far as the money remaining from previous project-funding EDFs is concerned, the Commission intends to organise support for the presidential and legislative elections should the government express a desire to hold them soundly and transparently and if the time available allows.
Regarding the proposal for targeted sanctions, in its statement of 20 February the European Union indicated that it reserves the right to take measures to support the action taken by the Economic Community of West African States.
In general, the Commission supports Parliamentâs draft resolution, which is in line with the proposal and position adopted by the European Union and backed by the Commission.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
Â Â  â The situation we are seeing in Togo today calls for the strongest condemnation from our Parliament of the that brought FaurÃ© GnassingbÃ© to power in that country.
I am therefore very pleased about the Councilâs statements and the European Parliamentâs response today through this resolution.
Just as we showed our solidarity with the protagonists of the âorangeâ revolution in Ukraine a few weeks ago, we must today give our support to the Togolese demonstrators who are refusing to accept this and are being harshly repressed for doing so.
There have already been several deaths in the demonstrations taking place in LomÃ©.
It is all absolutely unbearable and intolerable.
Europe must bring all its weight to bear in rejecting this hereditary dictatorship, which is backed by certain Mafia financial networks, calling first of all for the resignation of FaurÃ© GnassingbÃ© and then for the drawing up of a new constitution.
That is the only way to guarantee the holding of free and transparent elections, to ensure the return to democracy of a country that has been bled dry and reduced to poverty by General EyadÃ©maâs dictatorship and to enable the European Union to resume its cooperation with Togo, which has been suspended since 1993 and which the Togolese people greatly need.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Nepal(1).
Â Â  â Mr President, in January 1990 Nepal celebrated the Year of Tourism.
A magnificent parade involving tens of thousands of participants and several hundred thousand spectators demonstrated the full extent of the cultural wealth of the country, with its sherpas, monks, temple dancers, sadhus, mahouts, mandala artists and mountaineers.
I took part in this parade with the organisation Friends of Nepal.
We marched through Kathmandu and past King Birendra, who enjoyed the highest respect of 95-98% of the Nepalese people, both as a person and as a champion of the constitutional monarchy. This makes the contrast withÂ King Gyanendra, seven years later, appear all the starker.
He has dismissed yet another prime minister, and dozens of politicians, human rights activists and journalists have been taken into custody or placed under house arrest.
He now intends to rule as an autocrat for three years.
The question that needs to be asked is why not one prime minister in recent years has managed to hold free elections, and the answer is that agreement has never been reached between the various parties, not to mention with the Maoists.
The main reason, however, is the lack of security in the country.
People are living in fear, and by no means only in western Nepal.
Two thirds of the country is now under the control of Maoist rebels, and inadequately-trained police officers fall victim time and time again to lethal attacks.
The civil war has claimed 10Â 000 lives so far and shows no sign of coming to an end, with tourism, the country's main source of income, having been brought almost to a standstill.
I am afraid that the Maoists will gain further supporters following the coup of 1Â February.
The state of emergency will be used to place further restrictions on human rights, and it is for this reason that it is a cause of great concern to us in the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
By way of example, key places of refuge for Tibetans who have been forced to leave their homeland have been closed, including the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office.
For the past 15Â years, this Office has supported the work of the UNHCR refugee centre in Kathmandu, with which I myself am familiar, and at present around 1Â 000 asylum seekers are living there.
In addition, the Office of the Representative of the Dalai Lama, which was established in 1959, has been closed.
The situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
Commissioner, I welcome the initiatives taken by the European Union, as well as those taken by India and the USA, one example of these being that the King has been called upon to end the state of emergency within 100Â days.
A representative of the European Commission who was present at the meeting of our SAARC Delegation this morning said that a number of funding programmes would be suspended, in order to strengthen democracy by means of economic pressure.
Fortunately, however, development aid will continue to be granted, and targeted at the poorer sections of the population and local human rights organisations and NGOs.
I would be delighted if the issue of human rights violations in Nepal were to appear on the agenda of the session of the UN Commission on Human Rights to be held in Geneva.
Nepalese democracy is only 15 years old; it is still fragile, and must be protected rather than destroyed.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is facing a dilemma.
On the one hand we cannot afford to waste any time in taking a stance on this issue.
That is exactly why we are aiming to adopt a position today.
On the other hand, however, we have no detailed knowledge of the precise reasons behind the staged by the King of Nepal, although that knowledge would be extremely useful for us.
If we delay on this account, however, it is likely that our intervention will come too late, and rapid intervention is key.
The King has announced that he wishes to mount a more effective fight against the Maoist guerrilla movement, but at the same time he has closed the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office, as MrÂ Mann mentioned a short time ago.
In addition to this closure, Nepal has stopped its aid to Tibet, which was intended to strengthen the countryâs resistance against China's aggression.
Against this background, the reasons given by the King appear somewhat unconvincing.
The European Parliament must adopt a stance on this issue rapidly, as if we leave it too late we will be unable to achieve our goal, which is to prevent further criminal acts.
I believe we should be reassured that the more active diplomatic measures taken by other countries, such as the United States and India, are appropriate.
India is a neighbour of Nepal, and so it may well have its own reasons for taking diplomatic action.
These may be reasons we would not entirely subscribe to if we were familiar with them.
The measures taken by other countries such as the United States, however, should convince us that that theirs is a course of action we should also be following.
All rights have been suspended by the King, and while we have not forgotten the tragedy that befell the royal family several years ago, since that time no questions have been asked by the international community or international organisations as to the legitimacy of the royal rule.
There are therefore a number of considerations that must be weighed up.
As I said earlier, the reasons behind these events are unclear, but they are a source of some concern.
Furthermore, and reiterating MrÂ Mannâs comments, we cannot condone cutting off aid to Tibet, just as we cannot agree to the suspension of civil rights, to arrests, to the closure of press outlets or to far-reaching restrictions on freedom of speech.
We are therefore fully justified in taking action, and we should adopt the resolution.
Let us hope that a rapid reaction by this House, along with the measures taken by other countries, will go some way towards normalising the situation in Tibet.
Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Â Â  â Mr President, Nepal, like Afghanistan, was, in the Sixties and Seventies, a holiday destination for Western European disciples of the alternative life, who went there in search of a less materialistic way of living, of different ways of dressing, and in order to do drugs â rather fewer of these than we now know about.
Both these destinations for alternative holidays have since become places of horror to which nobody goes any more as a tourist or as somebody in search of a better world.
In both countries, over past decades, various attempts have been made at imposing from the top downwards an authoritarian monolith lacking any real support from a majority of the population.
The outside world, too, has an interest in putting governments in the saddle or imposing one new regime or another.
It is under such circumstances that people, on realising that they cannot bring about change by peaceful means, reach for their weapons.
In Nepal, one king after another has dismissed democratically-elected governments in the belief that they could do a better job themselves.
In so doing, they have not only incurred the hostility of a wide variety of political parties, but have also provoked popular uprisings.
Insurgents are now in control of much of the country, particularly its western parts.
The warring factions on both sides will stop at nothing.
While this is going on, mainstream politicians are in dispute about how best to gain the upper hand over the insurgents, whether through one-man rule by the king or by means of parliamentary democracy.
It is Belgian weapons suppliers that protect the King against the insurgents.
There seems to be no prospect of an end to this misery for anyone, and yet a stop must be put to it.
The traditions that Mr Mann celebrates may well not return that quickly, but the people of Nepal still have the right to make their own choices, to opt for democracy and human rights.
Let us not impose limits on the people of Nepalâs ability to choose for themselves.
Â Â  â The state of emergency declared by King Gyanendra on 1 February represents a clear threat to human rights in Nepal, since it has increased the power of the security forces and reduced the prospects for a political peace process.
We must all remember, however, that although the European Union's Code of Conduct in the field of arms exports explicitly prohibits sales to countries in armed conflict, certain European governments, such as the government of the United Kingdom, have been selling arms to the Nepalese Government over the last three years.
Ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are voting on today is of crucial importance in terms of clarifying the European Union's position on the peace process and on human rights in Nepal.
Given the seriousness of the situation, we must firstly welcome London's decision, and that of the Indian Government, to suspend all military aid to the current Nepalese Government.
Furthermore, the European Union must strongly insist that King Gyanendra immediately suspend the state of emergency and engage in a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, based on justice and respect for human rights.
In addition, the European Union must urge the Maoist guerrillas to commit themselves to respecting international humanitarian law and to signing a humanitarian and human rights agreement with the governmental security forces.
Fourthly, in accordance with the resolution we adopted this morning on the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, we must also urge that Commission to adopt a specific resolution on Nepal and to appoint a Special Rapporteur to monitor the human rights situation in that country.
Finally, with reference to Mr Mannâs invitation â with whom I entirely agree â we must not forget that the situation in Nepal has a regional dimension, particularly with regard to its neighbour Tibet.
To this end, we must demand that the Nepalese Government reopen the Tibet Refugee Welfare Office, as well as the Dalai Lamaâs representation in Kathmandu.
Â Â  â Mr President, as we have all heard, the state of emergency was declared on 1 February by the King.
He sacked the Government and assumed direct powers himself.
This follows on from a decade-long conflict, which has cost 11Â 000 lives.
The Nepalese people have suffered a legacy of human rights abuses, both from the security forces and from the Maoist rebels.
They have suffered torture, detention, disappearances and unlawful killing.
Communication links with the outside world have been severed and, hidden from public scrutiny, the risk of further abuse escalates, according to Amnesty International.
Radio news broadcasts have been shut down, foreign news channels taken off air and local media barred from publishing news or commentary without prior approval.
In the immediate aftermath, telephone lines were severed, and some mobile phone services have not resumed.
Approximately 3Â 000 people are currently under house arrest according to Nepalese Government sources.
The people who have been arrested are either senior members of the ousted government, human rights defenders or student and trade union leaders.
Access to them has been restricted.
They should either be charged or tried under due process of the law, or released forthwith.
The EU and the Member States provide more than EURÂ 100Â million in aid per year.
All military assistance should be stopped now.
Emphasis should be put on a multiparty democracy, conflict mitigation and alleviating poverty and suffering.
A military solution is not the answer.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to welcome to the Chamber Mr Desmond de Silva QC, who is assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Deputy Special Prosecutor for the Special Court in Sierra Leone for war crimes.
He is here to listen to our debate on Sierra Leone.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is with deep regret that we witnessed the recent events in Nepal.
It cannot be overlooked that King Gyanendra's actions on 1 February were a sad day for democracy in Nepal.
Neither can we ignore the actions of the terrorists.
The European Parliament cannot just stand by.
Nepal, as we have heard, is a desperately poor nation with an unfortunate history of conflict and has recently suffered under terrorist attacks from the Maoist rebels.
This Himalayan country faces several problems, including the issue of refugees from Bhutan.
The dissolution of the Nepalese Parliament does not help the situation of the common Nepalese people.
On the contrary, the Nepalese need stability and democracy in order to prosper economically and politically.
The most immediate actions that we demand of the Nepalese authorities are: the lifting of the state of emergency; the release of all political prisoners under house arrest or detention in prison; and the lifting of the media embargo, to allow freedom of the press, national and international.
In the medium and long term, we must also examine the ways that the EU and other international bodies can help.
So, I ask the Commission and the Council to support the following three suggestions.
First, that the EU look very closely into our conflict resolution programmes and identify other innovative solutions to help reduce poverty.
This is conducive to reducing the vulnerability of the Nepalese to the Maoist rebels.
Secondly, I would request that the Member States impose sanctions in their bilateral programmes. That would send a clear message that Member States do not approve of what has happened.
However, we must be careful not to penalise the ordinary people, as that would alienate us from helping them.
Thirdly, we must look at the diplomatic efforts we could make.
That could include arbitrating between the monarchy and other political parties, so as to encourage them both to the negotiating table, where steps towards multi-party democracy could be made.
Furthermore, we need to explore the possibility of sending a neutral third party, such as Javier Solana, the EU High Representative, or the United Nations, to formulate a road map to peace and democracy in Nepal.
It might even be helpful to send a delegation from Parliament.
In conclusion, I would like to stress the importance of the restoration of fundamental freedoms in Nepal, and the role we can play to encourage and support a democratic future.
However, the EU must act with caution: there are dangers in this unstable time of aggravating a fragile situation.
We must remember Nepal's fairly precarious geographical situation between India, Pakistan and China.
So, this small country is very significant for regional security.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Gill on her excellent speech.
We have heard that the King has declared a state of emergency, dismissed the government, assumed direct power and suspended civil rights indefinitely.
Since then the King has continued to suppress the media and potential opposition, detaining thousands of people, including politicians, student leaders, human rights activists, journalists, professors and other important public figures.
A few have been released since then.
Nepal is relatively new to the concept of multiparty democracy, which it established only in 1990 with the framework of a constitutional monarchy.
I enjoy and respect constitutional monarchies.
At this time, Nepal reinstated previously banned political parties and increased the civil liberties of the Nepalese people.
Unfortunately, its attempt at democracy has been fraught with difficulties.
Over the last 15 years, the credibility of the Nepalese politicians has been repeatedly undermined with allegations of corruption and self-interest.
They refuse to put Nepalese interests first; they have been putting their own first.
Politicians have proved incapable of ridding Nepal of a group of so-called 'Maoist insurgents' that was launched in 1996 to bring down the monarchy and the regime.
The ceasefire they attempted to negotiate with the insurgents broke down in August 2003.
The King's recent actions exemplify someone who, on the one hand, wishes to rid Nepal of terrorism and, on the other, wishes to bring stability to a country whose democratic actors have failed to achieve it. He has decided to take matters into his own hands.
However, in doing so, he has played into the hands of rebel forces and has infringed upon the very rights he was purportedly aiming to protect.
Nepal cannot be allowed to regress to a system whereby the King is undisputed ruler and the rights and lives of his subjects are in the hands of one man.
The recent chain of events is extremely worrying and reminiscent of the Nepal of the Rana oligarchs, a Nepal whose human rights record the world had hoped was finally going to be laid to rest.
We in the international community must encourage the King to undo his recent actions.
If necessary, this may involve suspending military aid to Nepal until the King finally realises that the fight against terror is an international struggle which is best dealt with in an open and democratic society, as opposed to the oppressive, closed, authoritarian state which he is sadly attempting to recreate.
Â Â  â Mr President, Nepal, one of the poorest countries in Asia, has had a very troublesome recent history not least because of the rebellion by powerful Maoist forces, which has been going on for the last nine years. In this period more than 11Â 000 people have been killed.
In June 2001 the King of Nepal was murdered, along with other members of the royal family.
His brother, Gyanendra, was crowned as the new King.
Gyanendra's democratic credentials have never been too obvious, quite the contrary.
He has followed the line of aggravating confrontation with the rebels and he has side-stepped the country's political forces.
In 2001-2002 a state of emergency was declared which led to an explosion of serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture.
Despite this, the King continued to enjoy the support of Western nations, including EU Member States, I am sorry to say.
On 1Â February this year, the King, supported by the Royal Nepalese Army, dismissed the government, assumed direct power and again declared a state of emergency.
As expected, widespread human rights violations ensued.
This joint motion calls on the King to lift the state of emergency, to restore all fundamental democratic freedoms, including freedom of the media, and re-establish parliamentary powers.
It also calls on the Council and the Commission to take practical measures such as imposing an embargo on military assistance to force the King to give up his dictatorship.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Many thanks.
The events of recent weeks have left the European Parliament with no choice but to hold a debate on human rights violations in Nepal, a problem that has been escalating for many years.
The Kingdom of Nepal, which is situated between India and China, is becoming ever more dependent on China, as that country is both its main trading partner and the main source of inspiration for the Maoist guerrilla movement.
The latter is engaged in a struggle to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, and its aim is to establish a Communist state.
The civil war in Nepal has already claimed over 12Â 000Â victims, and the political situation is Byzantine in its complexity, although the information blackout means that we are not familiar with all the details.
After the Prime Minister was dismissed, the King and the Nepalese army seized power and suspended basic constitutional rights such as the right of association, the freedom of speech, the right to information, privacy and property and the ban on illegal detentions.
The King has prohibited criticism of the security services on the radio, on television and on the Internet.
Censorship and persecution are part of everyday life.
The Nepalese Government also disregards the rights of refugees, as it has closed the Office of the Representative of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Refugees Welfare Office, which provided assistance to Tibetans persecuted for their faith.
Every year 2Â 500Â people flee from Chinese-occupied Tibet because they wish to practice their religion freely and to study in their native language.
An ever-greater number of Tibetans are choosing to leave the country because they feel increasingly threatened.
The Nepalese Government, however, acts in violation of national and international law by handing Tibetans over to China.
These Tibetans are imprisoned and subjected to unbelievably cruel abuse after having been deported to China.
Both the Government and the Maoist rebels have been accused by international humanitarian organisations of committing atrocities against the civil population.
The debate this House is holding today will make it possible to identify the roots of the conflict.
These can be found in an insane totalitarian, Communist and atheist ideology that denies the existence of God and treats human beings as objects, as well as trampling on their dignity and violating their rights.
Nepal has a population of 23Â million, and every second person is illiterate, whilst society is still governed by a caste system.
What are needed are improved living conditions and education, not a civil war aimed at establishing a destructive Communist system.
The only options available to us are to increase awareness of the conflict and to use diplomatic channels, such as this European Parliament resolution, to insist that the Nepalese Government puts an end to the illegal arrests and other corrupt practices.
We must also demand that the Nepalese Government protects human rights activists, journalists and political leaders from such practices.
Public pressure has already resulted in a decline in persecution once before.
Consideration should be given to the question of whether EU aid is in fact used to foster development and for humanitarian purposes, and there is also a need for action.
Finally, I should like to quote the Holy Father JohnÂ XXIII, who wrote that a threat to the family is a threat to the state, and that similarly, a threat to social order in one state is a threat to international order.
I thank you.
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
Ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have spoken very knowledgably on the internal situation in Nepal, the lack of democracy in the country and its history.
I should like to highlight a further point, namely the lack of media freedom, which has become particularly acute since 1Â FebruaryÂ 2005.
We know for certain that censorship is taking place and that journalists are being dismissed and arrested, often without their families being informed.
The Government has also barred private radio stations from broadcasting, and 800Â journalists have lost their jobs as a result.
As many Nepalese citizens cannot read, the closure of these radio stations means that they no longer have any access to news or to any radio stations other than the BBC.
As if this were not enough, editorial offices have been ransacked and documents censored.
This is a brief snapshot of the present situation in Nepal, and we must not remain unmoved by it.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome and support the resolutions on the unacceptable domestic policy, the suppression of civil liberties and the systematic infringements of human rights implemented by KingÂ Gyanendra of Nepal.
Having said that, I would press for just as much effort to be put into resolutions and, above all, into robust measures to place political and economic pressure on China, which has been oppressing the Tibetan people for decades.
The goal of Parliament and the other institutions must be to promote the defence of Tibet and its culture, and we should do so not just by denouncing the systematic genocide of the Tibetan people, which has been taking place for decades.
We must draw on principles such as non-violence, democracy, tolerance, solidarity, dialogue, respect and justice as a whole, without choosing, as often happens, however, easier or more convenient struggles with regard to upholding peoplesâ right to self-determination.
This principle knows no geographic boundaries, nor must it ever be subject to the dictates of the economy, or worse still, of finance on policy.
These initiatives are the best means to promote the principles of freedom and self-determination, principles which cut across parties and institutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission is gravely concerned about the sharp deterioration in the political situation in Nepal since 1 February.
I do not have to tell Members of this Parliament how important the respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law are in our relations with third countries.
The Presidencyâs declaration of 2 February is very clear: the European Union views the King's move as a serious setback for the prospect of a negotiated and democratically-based solution to the current conflict.
The European Union troika, which visited Nepal only two months ago, expressed at that time its grave concerns at the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation.
Since 1 February, Nepal has been experiencing a profound human rights crisis, as many parliamentarians have now underlined.
The United Nations has recorded more than 340 detentions of political leaders, journalists, human rights defenders and civil society activists.
We, the European Union, will continue to press for the release of all those who remain arbitrarily detained, and we will use the opportunity of the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to remind both sides to the conflict of their obligations under international law.
As Members may be aware, no European Union position has yet been taken on the issue of continued external assistance to Nepal, because the situation is very complex.
The Commission's global approach to conflict prevention calls for us to ensure that Community instruments and programmes are directed towards achieving political and social stability and democracy.
As we have frequently stated, development policy and other cooperation programmes provide the most powerful instruments at the Community's disposal for treating the root causes of conflict.
We have learned that conflict countries sometimes require more, rather than less, assistance, and applying blunt political conditions risks penalising the weakest in society.
That is why we think that the basic objectives of EC cooperation remain achievable.
Indeed, the priorities of support to poverty reduction, human rights and conflict mitigation are more urgent in the new environment.
Now is not the time for us, for instance, to cancel our support to Nepal's National Human Rights Commission, provided this institution continues to operate as an autonomous and independent technical body, seeking to promote the rule of law.
However, this does not mean that it is 'business as usual' in terms of donor support to Nepal, not least because of the new constraints faced in ensuring that all sides respect the donors' basic operational guidelines in the state of emergency as the conflict escalates.
Therefore, the Commission has taken the following position.
The delegation of the European Commission in Kathmandu will not accept any high level invitations from the King or from any of his cabinet ministers unless instructed otherwise by its headquarters.
All ongoing EC cooperation activities are carefully reviewed and the situation in the field is constantly monitored.
For the time being, activities continue but new appraisals or identification missions will not be launched for the preparation of the 2005 cooperation pipeline until further notice.
The Commission maintains extensive contacts on this issue with Member States and with other donors on the ground, and will participate in a meeting of like-minded donors during the week of 7 March in Europe to continue to seek a coordinated line.
As ever in such situations, the cost of conflict falls heaviest on the weakest in Nepalese society.
I am thinking of the children denied schooling or forcibly recruited, the poor deprived of basic healthcare and shelter and the many victims of brutal violence.
Whilst the primary responsibility for resolving the conflict in Nepal rests with the local actors, we must not abandon them now.
Working closely with the European Union Member States and especially with successive European Union Council presidencies, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all diplomatic, political, and developmental efforts that might facilitate the peace process and a return to democracy in Nepal.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place following the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on The Special Court for Sierra Leone: the Charles Taylor case(1)
Â Â  â Mr President, Liberia and Sierra Leone have moved on from being countries whose social elites were very much in thrall to American and European traditions, to being countries that have brought into the present day the most primitive aspects of African history.
We can take it as read that the chaos and the reversion to old ways have resulted from the long-standing discrimination against the people of the interior, who are poor, ill-educated and least urbanised.
They rebel against the English-speaking inhabitants of the coastlands, whom they regard as colonials.
That is what happens in Liberia, established in the nineteenth century as a colony where slaves freed in America could return to their African roots.
One group managed the land, while the other regarded themselves as colonial masters along the lines of the Europeans in other African countries.
It is significant in all African countries that present-day state borders were drawn by foreign colonial powers.
Groups that belonged together by virtue of a shared language and culture were separated from each other.
Groups that had very little in common were joined together in a single federated state.
Mr Posselt also drew attention to this during todayâs discussion of Togo.
Adventurers and profiteers, who employ drug-addled children as assassins and decorate themselves with the heads of the victims they kill, terrorise those whom they cannot control.
I might add that the Americans did a good job of training Charles Taylor as President and bringing him into office, after which it was very difficult to get rid of him again.
What is even more important is that, after the removal of one person, the groups in the interior who have reverted to primitive living should be given the opportunity to develop as fully-fledged twenty-first century people.
I would counsel against pinning all our hopes on Nigeriaâs influence.
Nigeria may well be a major power in the region, but it also has a tradition of internal conflict, and dictatorships, although it is fortunate that matters have been improving recently.
The problems of Liberia and Sierra Leone will not be resolved in the long term without all the groups of their inhabitants being involved on an equal basis.
Â Â  â Mr President, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia are all members of the ACP and signatories to the Cotonou Agreement.
This agreement secures good governance.
However, Sierra Leone is ranked as the least-developed country in the world.
Sadly, the criteria set out by the Cotonou Agreement as essential to long-term development could also be used as a list of what Sierra Leone lacks most.
In January 2002 Sierra Leone saw the end of a decade-long, savage civil war.
The conflict in Sierra Leone cost tens of thousands of lives and the displacement of millions.
Charles Ghankay Taylor, the former President of Liberia, has recently been indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone with actively supporting the Revolutionary United Front which was responsible for the widespread atrocities in Sierra Leone.
According to Amnesty International, Taylor's crimes included the systematic killing of civilians, amputation, rape, other forms of sexual violence, the use of child soldiers, abductions and forced labour.
The Special Court of Sierra Leone created by the international community and which the EU supported with some EUR 800 000 last year, has charged Taylor with 17 counts of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law.
However, Nigeria has given Taylor asylum.
International law now cries out that those suspected of committing war crimes or crimes against humanity must be investigated and brought to justice.
Under the 1949 Geneva Convention the Nigerian authorities are obliged to arrest Taylor and to surrender him to the Special Court of Sierra Leone.
There is no legal base whatsoever for Taylor to be protected by President Obasanjo of Nigeria.
If Taylor remains in Nigeria, however, it is doubtful that this man accused of heinous crimes will ever face trial.
Moreover, if he seeks sanctuary in another ACP country we should bring the full force of the Cotonou Agreement to bear on that country.
Â Â  â The impassioned speech by the previous speaker and the motion for a resolution before us, along with its justifications, which has been endorsed by all political groups in this House, are proof that action is urgently needed.
Those of us who live in prosperous countries have no idea of what is happening in many African states.
Immediately upon achieving so-called freedom after centuries of exploitation as colonies, many countries suffered another tyranny of the worst kind, for example in the case of Liberia under Charles Taylor.
We cannot remain indifferent to the catalogue of crimes of which a Special Court in Sierra Leone found Charles Taylor guilty in 2003, and we must do everything in our power to ensure the handover to the courts of this criminal, who, whilst in exile, is persisting in his attempts to destabilise Liberia and its neighbouring countries.
I support all the initiatives that this House has called for, yet it is with concern that I note that neither the UN, the UN Security Council, nor any of us yet possess anywhere near the authority for which world peace cries out.
International law and human rights require that all people of good will overcome their indifference, and that all possible means be used to find fairer and more peaceful solutions.
I should like to thank everyone in this House who has worked on this motion for a resolution.
Â Â  â Mr President, Charles Taylor, as President of Liberia, was guilty of serious crimes against humanity and of acts of war.
He actively supported armed opposition groups in Sierra Leone in their committing of such atrocities as murders, mutilations, rapes and the conscription of child soldiers.
Under his rule, Liberia bore the brunt of violence and the misuse of power, all of which resulted in great human suffering that must not be allowed to go unpunished.
Nigeria must be induced to surrender Charles Taylor to the court in Sierra Leone, thus doing the right thing by the innumerable victims and survivors in Liberia and elsewhere, and bringing peace to West Africa.
The European Union is working for peace, security, stability, respect for human rights and democratic principles.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that Charles Taylor remains at liberty in Nigeria, from where he is still in a position to manipulate the peace process in the region.
Not only is Nigeria under a moral obligation to hand Charles Taylor over to the tribunal, but it is also subject to an obligation under international law.
Among other things, the international legal order, in the shape of the Geneva conventions, stipulates that war crimes must be punished at all times.
This rule of international law ensures that states refrain from offering protection to this sort of malefactor.
Nigeria will need to extradite Charles Taylor to the tribunal in Sierra Leone, in order that he may be judged by it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Africa has for too long been torn by civil strife, hunger, economic mismanagement and blatant corruption.
It is now, at last, beginning to get its own house in order with regional blocs and continent-wide supranational institutions committed to observing international human rights law, such as Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS) and the African Union.
Charles Taylor, as a former warlord, ruled Liberia brutally between 1997 and 2003 as a bloody dictator, sanctioning rape and summary executions at the end of that country's 14 years of civil war, but he was forced into exile as part of a peace-making deal mediated by Nigeria.
During Taylor's reign, ECOWAS imposed sanctions on Liberia because of the abuses he perpetrated.
In power, he supported the Revolutionary United Front in neighbouring Sierra Leone, which, in alliance with renegade soldiers, overthrew President Kabbah in 1997, having wreaked havoc in the country since 1991, with tens of thousands of civilians brutally slaughtered, and which made use of child soldiers.
The War Crimes Tribunal in Freetown, Sierra Leone, is a hybrid mix of national and international justice, accepted by all parties and with UN backing, and aims to be a model for other war courts not mandated by Chapter 7 UN resolutions.
Taylor was indicted for war crimes by this court in 2003, but Nigeria is refusing to extradite him, claiming he has sovereign immunity and benefits from the asylum deal they agreed to.
A children's rights group called FOCUS is now calling for his surrender to the court in Sierra Leone, directly blaming Taylor for the limb amputation of thousands of women and children in Sierra Leone, as well as for ordering bloody, cross-border raids into neighbouring Guinea.
We now know that sovereign immunity no longer applies for war crimes, but the group has also pointed out that Taylor has breached the terms of his asylum by interfering in Liberian politics ahead of the elections scheduled there for October and by financing parties sympathetic to him with money he obtained corruptly through the diamond trade when in power as President.
He presumably hopes that, with a change of government, he will be allowed back.
President Obasanjo of Nigeria is currently Chairman of the African Union, and his country must set an example to the international community, and end impunity for bloody tyrants, by handing Taylor over.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Charles Taylor, the former warlord president of Liberia, is alleged to have been responsible for gross human rights violations, including thousands of killings, widespread torture, massive forced displacement of populations and the breakdown of social and economic structures, over the ten year period of his rule over Liberia.
In July 2003, Taylor fled the country and accepted the Nigerian Government's offer of asylum.
In March 2003, Charles Taylor was indicted by the prosecutor of the Special Court of Sierra Leone on 17 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, mutilation, rape, sexual slavery and the recruitment of child soldiers.
It is an insult to international law and an affront to human dignity that this alleged mass murderer continues to be given refuge by Nigeria.
The Nigerian Government not only has a duty to humanity, but also has the obligation under the Geneva Convention, which it has ratified, immediately to surrender the infamous Charles Taylor to the jurisdiction of the Special Court of Sierra Leone, so that he can be tried, and if found guilty and punished accordingly.
If it fails to do so, it should and will face the justifiably serious consequences from both the EU, and the international community in general.
We should ask ourselves one question: why has it taken 14Â years of rule by Taylor in Liberia, with him having already carried out all his terrors, before we decided to take some decisive action?
Â Â  â Mr President, I am pleased to have this brief opportunity to strongly support this resolution.
Perhaps the strongest contributing factor to the likelihood of current and future human rights abuses and war crimes is the fact that, in the past, persons of power have been allowed to act with impunity, with no fear of prosecution or trial under international law.
This is particularly the case on the continent of Africa.
This resolution emphasizes a high-profile case in the necessary fight by the international community to bring an end to the scourge of people committing human rights abuses with impunity, anywhere in the world.
On 7 March 2003, Charles Taylor was indicted by the Prosecutor for the Special Court of Sierra Leone on 17 counts of crimes against humanity. These crimes included mutilation, rape, sexual slavery and the recruitment of child soldiers â all significant human rights abuses that this Parliament and the EU is trying to act against in a positive way.
Charles Taylor is being protected and given asylum status in Nigeria at present, despite the fact that Nigeria has ratified the Geneva Convention which states that those that have committed war crimes may not be granted refugee status.
I encourage the Council, the Commission and indeed the UN to act and take this resolution seriously.
Â Â  . Mr President, the resolution before the House summarises the background to this question very well.
Charles Taylor is indicted for heinous crimes, including extermination, murder, rape, enslavement, inhuman acts, crimes against humanity.
The resolution also recognises the importance of the pacification process in the region, a process led and implemented by African countries and organisations.
It has been said several times in this House that it is very important that African nations themselves take the cleaning up of the continent in hand.
The crimes Charles Taylor is accused of are terrible and have led Interpol to add his name to the list of the most wanted criminals in the world.
Taylor's challenge to the Special Court's indictment on the ground of presidential immunity was an insult to those who suffered the atrocities.
Taylor's alleged interference in Liberia's economic and political life, and his openly expressed desire to return to the country, represent a threat to the continuation of peace-building in Liberia and to this year's electoral process.
The non-execution of the arrest warrant issued by the Special Court undermines the legitimacy of this Court.
The Special Court of Sierra Leone, unlike the international courts for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, was not granted a mandate under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter requiring all UN member states to comply with the court orders.
Making the Special Court successful, therefore, needs the cooperative attitude of all countries hosting criminals.
The Commission formally supports efforts by the European Union to ensure the handing over of Taylor to the Court.
The latest UN initiative was during the high-level troika meeting with Nigeria in December.
Nigeria's position has been as follows, and I quote: 'There cannot be impunity for Taylor.
However he is currently a guest of the Nigerian Government and he will be handed over to the first democratically elected Liberian Government asking for his extradition'.
The Commission believes that EU offers have to continue and we must make it clear that at some point â and we hope that this point is not too far away â Charles Taylor will have to go to trial.
It is also vital that effective initiatives are taken in Nigeria and elsewhere to stop Taylor from continuing to interfere in Liberian affairs and destabilise other countries in the region.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
Â Â  â Mr President, I just wanted to make it absolutely clear how the Special Court was established.
Therefore, I propose that we amend the first citation of the joint resolution to read: 'having regard to the Special Court for Sierra Leone, established through an agreement between the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1315 of 14 August 2000, with the aim of putting on trial those accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and violations of international law committed in Sierra Leone,'.
This is a tidying-up exercise.
Furthermore, because of the importance of this issue to the international community, the Commission and the Member States, I should like to request a roll-call on the final vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, I support my colleagueâs call for a roll call vote.
Â Â  We shall therefore treat this request as if it were presented by a political group and we shall vote on this joint motion for a resolution by roll call, with the oral amendment by Mr Deva incorporated.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I obviously have no objections to this decision.
I should like to state, however, that this morning we agreed with CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik to request that a Conference of Presidents open to all Members be held at 2.30Â p.m. on 6Â April â and I would ask that this be entered in the Minutes â in order to present the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.
We would further ask that Commission President Barroso, Commissioner Reding and Commissioner PotoÄnik be present on this occasion to outline the Seventh Framework Programme to the House, and I would ask that the Conference of Presidents take a decision on this matter.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 24 February 2005.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin this sitting by making a statement on certain issues which are topical and which have been raised by some Members of this Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, last Thursday, the Conference of Presidents of the Political Groups unanimously adopted a statement on the situation of journalists in Iraq for me to read to you today.
This statement was the result of meetings I held with heads of the French and Italian media organisations of the European journalists held hostage in Iraq and representatives of the âReporters Without Bordersâ organisation.
The Conference of Presidents issued this statement, which was very widely reported in the European media.
A little later, on Friday afternoon, we were overjoyed to hear of the release of Giuliana Sgrena.
That joy was soon overshadowed by the death of Nicola Calipari, who died tragically while using his own body to protect Giuliana.
Let us acknowledge today the courage and sense of duty that lost Nicola Calipari his life in carrying out that duty.
In tribute to him, I would like today to join with the Italian authorities, in particular Presidents Ciampi and Berlusconi, who have called on the United States authorities to clarify fully the dramatic circumstances in which Nicola Calipari died.
As in other similar circumstances, we must know how and why these tragic events have taken place.
This morning the whole of Italy paid a posthumous tribute.
I would like our Parliament to join the Italian people in their acknowledgement and, on behalf of all of you, to communicate our solidarity and friendship to his family at this painful time.
Today, Giuliana is back amongst us and enjoying freedom, but we must continue our efforts to achieve the release of Florence Aubenas and her interpreter and guide, Hussein Hanun Al-Saadi.
They are still being held captive, held by people who reject the right to information and, therefore, democracy.
As from today, pictures of them will be displayed at the entrance to our Chamber. They are a visual demonstration of our solidarity.
The European Parliament wants them to return to their friends and families as soon as possible.
In these circumstances, the European Parliament must once again state that there can be no democracy without freedom of information and that the security of journalists must be protected in every part of the world.
We must take every possible measure to ensure that the media can carry out their duties, particularly in regions where there is armed conflict, including Iraq.
After this statement on topical issues, some painful and some happy, I must make another statement on what we may call historical commemorations.
As you know, centuries of fratricidal wars between our countries are etched on our memories.
As President of the European Parliament, I frequently receive requests for minutes of silence to commemorate the events which remind us of the saddest moments in our history.
Just a few days ago, our Polish colleagues asked that we observe a minuteâs silence to remember the massacre in Katyn, Miednoye and Jarkov, when 14Â 000 Polish officers were executed in cold blood by the Stalin regime on 5 March 1940.
There is no question that this is a legitimate request and it is our duty not to forget those events or the victims of them.
But every day, given the history of our continent â a tragic and turbulent history â the calendar is going to record sad events for each of our countries.
This is the case because Europe has been divided by wars in which millions of our fellow citizens have died.
Nevertheless, although we must remember the past â and we do â last week the Conference of Presidents agreed not to observe a minuteâs silence or make statements systematically at every plenary session on every occasion when we are reminded of a painful event.
Our current history, our reunification, must help us to overcome the events of the past and to remember that the consolidation of peace and democracy, the values of the European Union, must prevent them from ever happening again.
Finally, while I hope that all our fellow Members understand the resolution we have adopted in this regard, I must mention the police repression suffered by women who were demonstrating in Istanbul ahead of International Womenâs day.
Before coming to this plenary session, I issued a press release in which I strongly condemn these events and I call on the Turkish Government to apply exemplary penalties in relation to events that in no way send the correct message in terms of Turkeyâs possible entry into the European Union.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 3 March pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
No amendment has been proposed.
I have received two requests for the Commission to make statements.
On the one hand, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has requested that the Commission make a statement on its position on services in the internal market.
The Commission is prepared to make that statement and we could discuss this issue tomorrow, Tuesday, from 6.00 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., with a communication from Commissioner McCreevy, followed by questions and answers by means of the âcatch-the-eyeâ procedure.
Secondly, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that Commissioner McCreevy make a statement tomorrow, Tuesday, at the same time, on the Directive on the patentability of computer software, followed, at least, by speeches by the political groups.
The Group of the Greens has also requested that on Wednesday the Council and Commission statement on the health workers detained in Libya be replaced by a Council and Commission statement on the patentability of computer software.
Clearly, to a large extent, these requests are not compatible with each other.
We cannot approve all of them.
We cannot discuss two different things at the same time, and I shall therefore have to submit the requests for amendments to the agenda to a vote in the order in which I have received them.
If any of them is approved, there would be no point in voting for the others, since that would clearly contradict the decision we had adopted.
I am therefore going to submit the Group of the Greenâs request that the Commission make a statement on its position on services in the internal market to a vote by a show of hands, naturally.
Â Â  Mr President, is there any reason why the Commission cannot deal with both the Services Directive and software patents at 6 p.m. tomorrow?
This would allow us to keep the serious and ongoing issue of the health workers detained in Libya on the agenda for Wednesday.
Â Â  â Mr President, we could go along with that suggestion.
If Commissioner McCreevy were to make a short statement on both matters, we in the groups could then decide where our priorities lay.
I would support this as an alternative compromise.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we too are perfectly happy with this proposal, on condition that discussion of the subject is not completed in thirty minutes.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I did not properly understand what you were proposing to us at the start.
What we want is for its to be possible for the two issues, that of the patenting of computer software and that of theservices directive, to be tackled during the sitting.
For example, one could be dealt with on Tuesday and the other on Wednesday, or at any other time, but placing one of the two on the agenda must not lead to the otherâs being removed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we do not agree with this proposal.
In fact, we want there to be a debate involving clarification of the Commissionâs position on the directive on liberalisation of services. That is very important.
Regarding the patentability of computer software, we consider that Parliamentâs work should be done in the normal way. There will necessarily be a debate within our Parliament, but as part of the second reading procedure, since we have just adopted a joint position.
We do not, therefore, want there to be any confusion between the two debates, and we prefer to give all the time needed to the debate following the Commission statement on the directive on liberalisation of services.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should just like to make it clear that our request regarding the software patents debate was a call not just for a Commission statement but also for a Council statement.
Â Â  Mr President, irrespective of how the vote turns out, I would just ask you to ensure that tomorrowâs questions to the Commission can be of the same length, as that is a fundamental parliamentary right, and one guaranteed by the Treaties.
Â Â  Very well, Mr Posselt, you may rest assured that we shall do that.
I believe we should vote on an amendment to the agenda to the effect that tomorrow, from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m., the Commission should make a statement on the two items proposed, that is to say, on services in the internal market and on the Directive on the patentability of computer software, for which there are currently more requests in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, I beg leave to make a comment on the procedure.
I would ask you first to have a vote on the services directive, for which there may or may not be a majority.
We can then â still in a split vote â move on to the software business.
If you have them both voted on together, you may well end up with a result that this House does not want in the least, and so I ask that we vote item by item.
Â Â  This is a complicated issue.
We shall proceed as follows, and this is a decision by the Presidency that I will carry out next.
We shall vote on the request for the Commission to make a statement tomorrow on services in the internal market and then, regardless of the result of that vote, we shall vote on the proposal that the Commission make a statement tomorrow on the patentability of computer software.
If both are approved, they will take place jointly from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m.
We shall proceed to the vote on the proposal that the Commission make a statement on services in the internal market:
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am really sorry but I do not understand what we are voting on at the moment.
Are we voting on replacing the debate on the services directive with the debate on the software patents directive?
Â Â  Mrs Frassoni, we have voted on a proposal that tomorrow there should be a Commission communication.
Now we are going to vote on another proposal that there should be a Commission communication tomorrow on the patentability of computer software.
We shall proceed to the vote.
Tomorrow, therefore, from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m., there will be a Commission statement on the two issues we have dealt with.
Â Â  Mr President, this concerns the last decision you made.
I wish to make two points.
As Coordinator for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the question of the internal market for services, I hope that first of all we will have the first opportunity...
Â Â  Which Rule are you invoking?
Â Â  Mr President, this is new.
We do not have a point of order, we have a new procedure.
We have now agreed to combine two statements and I would like to ask âŠ
Â Â  Mr Harbour, please sit down.
You do not have the floor.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have requested that the whole of Wednesday morning be dedicated to the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and that the debate be extended until 12.30 p.m.
The agenda could be presented as follows: from 9.00Â a.m. to 12.30 p.m., mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
At 12.30 p.m., the vote. From 3.00 p.m. to 5.30Â p.m., Council and Commission Statements, firstly on the preparation of the Brussels European Council, and secondly on the health workers detained in Libya.
Â Â  Mr President, I would be very much against removing from the agenda a debate on the health workers detained in Libya.
Indeed, my understanding is that there is no longer a request to remove that item from the agenda.
Â Â  Mr President, could you explain again?
You are keeping the statement on the Lisbon strategy between the hours of 9 a.m. and 12.30Â p.m. The votes will take place at 12.30 p.m., but at what time will the debate on the health workers detained in Libya take place?
Â Â  From 3.00 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., we would debate the two Council and Commission statements on the Brussels European Council and on the health workers detained in Libya.
Fortunately, we do not have any proposed amendment for the Thursday sitting.
Â Â  Pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure, we shall proceed to the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, you have paid tribute to the name and the story of Nicola Calipari, a high-ranking Italian State and SISMI intelligence officer, who was in Baghdad for the fourth time with the task of rescuing a hostage from the hands of armed terrorist groups who have murdered Iraqis.
Thank you for doing so, but I should also like to say that it might perhaps be time for Parliament to stop being unintentionally racist.
The fact is that we consider the death of a westerner to be an event of worldwide significance, but we remain silent while Iraqi men and women are continually being slaughtered for the sake of ideologies like Saddam Husseinâs and other comparable ideas, just as we have also stayed silent about the mass graves in Katyn for the last fifty years.
That is an absolute disgrace!
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make the point I was going to make earlier.
Could I say to you first of all that as political group coordinator for the committee most affected by the new procedure for tomorrow, you should have allowed me to speak earlier.
I hope that the discussion on the internal market for services will be taken first and that we have enough time.
Last Thursday, when we had a special meeting with the rapporteur, all the committee members signed an oral question.
It was not in time but we want that statement in full.
The second point is crucial and I feel I was perfectly entitled to make it when everyone was here.
As a number of colleagues have indicated, the statement on the Computer-Implemented Inventions Directive must also involve the Council.
The issue at stake is that the Council reached an agreement today.
You completely ignored that, Mr President.
You did not indicate whether the Council would be available.
That was the point that I wanted to put to you.
The coordinators and senior people involved in the discussions have detailed knowledge, and if you are going to stop them commenting on changes of procedure, you are not doing justice to the Members of this House when they are discussing changes to the agenda.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Harbour.
You will appreciate that changes to the agenda always create conflict and controversy; I must deal with the requests made by the political groups via their spokespeople.
Â Â  Mr President, this House has a very proud record of supporting the peace process in Northern Ireland and of supporting both the Irish and United Kingdom Governments in trying to achieve a lasting solution to the difficulties there.
It is the view of both the Irish and UK Governments that the only remaining obstacle to peace is the criminality and paramilitary activity of the IRA, a statement that was greeted with some surprise by IRA circles.
However, the events of the last few months â the raid on the Northern Bank, the murder of Robert McCartney, the intimidation of witnesses, the evidence of money laundering â suggest there is extensive criminality, which has now become part and parcel of the Northern Ireland scene.
I hope that this Parliament will send a message of support to both governments and tell all parties that criminality has no place whatsoever in political action.
Criminality imprisons people, it does not liberate them.
Â Â  For Croatia to become an associate member, it has pushed through far-reaching reforms in the last few years in order to meet the European Unionâs political, economic and legal requirements, the so-called Copenhagen criteria.The Council has recognised these efforts, thanks to which in December last year Croatia won the status of associate member, and a date was set for the start of accession talks.
However, disputes surrounding the handover of General Gotovina have created uncertainty as to whether Croatia can really begin the negotiations.
During the talks in Zagreb last week, our committee should have satisfied itself that the Croatian Government is responding to the Council Decision of 17 December and is wholeheartedly cooperating with the International Tribunal.
Above all, I ask the members of the Council that they accept as wholehearted cooperation the fact that 625 of the Hague Prosecutorâs 626 demands have been met.
It is not fitting for the history of European Union enlargement that the destiny of a thousand-year-old European nation should be tied to a single man.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, genuine integration of the peoples of Europe will only be possible on the basis of truth.
On the occasion of the recent commemoration of the tragedy suffered by the victims of the Auschwitz German concentration camp it was clear that not everyone finds this truth pleasantor easy to accept.
Today I should like to draw Membersâ attention to certain events deliberately written out of modern European history.
Sixty-fiveÂ years ago, the Polish nation felt the full brunt of the coalition between the two criminals Hitler and Stalin.
The aim of this coalition was to annihilate the state of Poland and the Polish people, and to subjugate Europe.
On 10Â FebruaryÂ 1940, the Soviet aggressors began the inhumane task of deporting Polish families to Siberia, the Golgotha of the East.
Children, women and old people were snatched from their homes in the dead of the winter night and herded into cattle trucks.
After a journey in life-threatening conditions that lasted several weeks, they arrived at the forced labour camps in the so-called evil land, where temperatures fall as low as 40Â ÂºC.
Years of humiliation, hunger, disease and homesickness awaited those who survived the journey, and 1Â 500Â 000Â innocent people were deported in this manner merely because they were Polish.
Such wrongdoing continued even after the end of the war, when Poland was ruled by the Soviet Union.
The majority of my fellow citizens did not survive these genocidal deportations.
My fellow Europeans, are you familiar with this period of history?
Do they teach children about it in European schools?
If we wish to build a peaceful future for our peoples, we must stand in truth, both before...
Â Â  â As you mentioned, Mr President, yesterday, 6Â March, a demonstration in Istanbul to mark International Womenâs Day was brutally put down by the Turkish police and dozens of people were detained.
Unfortunately, this act of violence is not an isolated incident.
On 26Â February, an activist of the EMEP, the Turkish Labour Party, was shot.
I wish to express my solidarity with your words, Mr President, and would ask you to condemn such acts to the Turkish authorities and demand that the perpetrators be held to account.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have heard that the Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister is to visit the EU and that you are going to receive him.
I do not know if this is true, but we should like confirmation.
If it is true, it would never even cross our minds to have him kicked out, unlike the Cuban Government, which did just that to Spanish and Dutch Members of this House a few months ago.
On the contrary, we feel that he should be received and we want him to be received.
There are three things that we would like to ask you to do once this visit is confirmed, Mr President.
The first request is that you forward to the Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister the resolution adopted by Parliament on 17Â November of last year, which is Parliamentâs position on the Cuban situation.
Secondly, if the Minister does come here, he will be coming without an invitation.
We have nothing against this, but we have repeatedly invited Oswaldo PayÃ¡ SardiÃ±as, the 2002 Sakharov Prize winner, to come to Parliament, and it is this Ministerâs government â the Cuban Government â that has not allowed him to come.
We would therefore strongly urge you to emphasise that we want Oswaldo PayÃ¡ to be able to come to Parliament to discuss the Cuban situation with us.
Lastly, a request: I would ask them to release the political prisoners, to release the political prisoners in Cuba once and for all, and to announce a general amnesty, particularly for all those targeted by the March 2003 wave of repression.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
In fact, tomorrow at 7.30 p.m. I shall receive the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs.
You may rest assured that I take very good note of your request and I shall communicate it to the Minister.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to refer to a manifesto issued by 157 state school teachers from the Basque Country affected by a Basque Government decree which means that they will lose the jobs they have been doing for more than 15 years, because they have not achieved a sufficiently high level in the Basque language, the co-official language with Castilian and the language in which the subject they teach is taught.
They are the victims of a form of linguistic discrimination which puts political considerations before professional qualifications.
They are suffering discrimination when compared to other groups of teachers and other public administration departments.
It is regrettable that the Basque Government, in its intransigence, is forcing these teachers out of the Basque public system, without recognising the professional work they have done or offering any compensatory solution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, thank you for giving me the floor.
I should like to endorse what has been said about the situation in Turkey.
Over and above Parliamentâs rejection, expressed by the President, I should like to ask whether there are further initiatives the President has considered taking in this connection.
That is because this Parliament has, for the most part, been sympathetic to Turkish membership â and we, for our part, are very positive about Turkish membership of the EU, which we see as presenting great possibilities â and it is incredibly important that Parliament also be the first to shout out and protest whenever Turkey is clearly moving in the wrong direction.
If the President could come up with an offer of further initiatives, that would be very helpful.
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago doctors at the World Health Organization warned that the world faces the very grave possibility of the virus known as bird flu triggering a human flu pandemic.
The mortality rate for the virus is currently around 72%.
Should the virus spread among humans, this flu could kill literally millions of people.
The World Health Organization advises that stockpiling vaccines is just one of the measures governments can implement to combat the spread of the virus.
Italy and France reportedly plan to stockpile two million doses of a vaccine each, while the UK has decided against this owing to the difficulty of designing an effective anti-viral drug in advance against a mutative virus.
Klaus StÃ¶hr, head of the World Health Organizationâs Global Influenza Programme, voiced his concerns in November last year.
It is now time to ask whether the European Union is doing enough to prepare itself for a potential pandemic, and if not, why not?
Â Â  Mr President, millions of people around the world are currently observing International Womenâs Day, and that includes Turkey, where, as we have heard, their demonstration was brutally suppressed.
I thank you for responding so rapidly and for sending out the right message.
We have to see the women of Turkey given their democratic rights, or else the countryâs accession will come to nothing.
Something else I would like to mention is that this House will, tomorrow, be discussing the outcomes of the UNâs âBeijing + 10â Conference.
The debate will begin tomorrow morning with an oral question, and the vote will be held at midday.
President Barroso has now sent out invitations to an exchange of information with ten members of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality to be held at that same time.
This I regard as an affront, and none of our Members should have any part in such a meeting, held here in this House but ignoring the vote.
I ask that it be made clear to MrÂ Barroso that we have to do our duty here in the plenary, and it is there that we will be debating womenâs rights.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on my own behalf and on behalf of the âGreen Initiativeâ Association, I should like to alert Members to the potential destruction of the environment along the Lower Oder between the cities of Szczecin and Schwedt, on the Polish-German border.
There are plans to reconstruct the channel at this point, or in other words to widen and deepen it.
The work is more than likely to damage and destroy the International Lower Oder Valley Park.
Having seen the plans, I am convinced that this reconstructed channel will destroy the local peat bogs, as well as disrupting waterÂ flow and destroying natural breeding grounds for birds.
I am certain that in this day and age and in this House there will surely be no lack of people willing to fight to protect the environment from destruction.
Â Â  â Mr President, the question of Lebanon is included in this week's agenda.
We shall be debating the withdrawal of the Syrian occupying forces from Lebanon, a Security Council resolution.
We here â in civilised Europe â welcome this, we applaud it and there is not one among us who does not want the occupying army to leave Lebanon.
However, there is also an identical Security Council resolution for the Turkish occupying army in Cyprus.
Is there no sensitivity on that subject?
We cannot maintain that there are two sets of standards?
We here in the European Parliament must say that what applies to the Syrian army â which must leave Lebanon â should also apply to the Turkish army, which must leave Cyprus.
It is an identical resolution by an identical council, the Security Council.
If, therefore, we really want democracy and equality before the law, we should call on the Turkish army to leave Cyprus, just as we are calling on the Syrian army to leave Lebanon.
Â Â  Mr President, like Mrs DÃŒhrkop DÃŒhrkop, I wish to condemn in this House the fact that 157 teachers in the Basque Country, 157Â workers with more than 15 years professional and educational experience, may lose their jobs for linguistic reasons, because they do not speak a particular language.
The Basque Government, headed by Mr Ibarretxe, wishes to discriminate against, to marginalise and to expel these Basque teachers from the administration.
This is a scandalous case of linguistic and educational apartheid, which is contrary to the Spanish Constitution, to the Gernika Statute, to the European Constitutional Treaty and to the Charter on Human Rights, since the right to work is a human right and these teachers are going to be deprived of that right by means of a nationalist decree despite their professional and educational experience.
What the Basque Government is doing, ladies and gentlemen, does not conform to educational or academic criteria, but to the ideological, political, xenophobic and exclusive criteria of the Ibarretxe Plan.
The Europe of freedoms, solidarity and equality must therefore ensure that regrettable cases such as this do not arise again in any part of our European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to commend you for taking a stance so promptly on the sad events in Turkey that we saw on television yesterday, where a demonstration to mark International Womenâs Day was put down in a manner that was both extremely brutal and incompatible with Turkeyâs commitments arising from its application to join the EU and from the decision made by Parliament and by the European institutions to open negotiations.
Mr President, you requested sanctions that would set an example and those sanctions demand that not only the perpetrators of this brutality but also those in charge of giving the orders be brought to book.
Combating impunity is an essential factor in promoting human rights and impunity is rife in Turkey.
This was seen recently with the death of the Kurdish child, Ugur Kaymaz, which was covered up by the Turkish police.
The Commission and the Council must also send out a clear message to Turkey that this is incompatible with its commitments as regards negotiating accession to the EU and that respect for human rights involves not only changing the law, but also putting that respect into practice.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs Gomes.
You will have noted that in the Presidencyâs initial statement I referred to this issue and to the press release I have issued on behalf of all of you.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in your opening speech you recalled the death of Nicola Calipari, but I would rather call it the murder of Nicola Calipari.
A statement by Mr Barroso was put out a few minutes ago, in which he describes what happened as an unfortunate incident.
I do not know whether the Commission has any information that has not yet been made public which enables him to state that it was an unfortunate incident and not something more serious.
About an hour ago, CNN, referring to Pentagon sources, leaked the conclusion reached by the US inquiry, which is that it was simply a misunderstanding between the Italian and US authorities over the communication that the vehicles would be going past.
I should like to endorse the demand by Reporters Without Borders for a United Nations inquiry to be set up, and I call on the Commission and the Council to support their demand.
In addition, I request that this issue should be included in the debate within the European Union on transatlantic relations, since we, as the European Union, have a very specific responsibility.
Â Â  Mr President, as has already been mentioned, this week we celebrate International Womenâs Day, but I also hope that during this week Parliament will take time to help raise awareness of an illness that affects more than 14Â million women across Europe: endometriosis.
This week is also Endometriosis Awareness Week.
I know we get fed up with weeks for this and weeks for that, but this horrible disease is too little talked about and too often dismissed.
The average time for diagnosing it is going up: it now stands at nine years.
It affects 14Â million women across Europe.
For this disease there is still no known cause and no cure.
It wrecks lives and families.
If nothing else makes us think, perhaps the fact that over EURÂ 30Â billion is lost to our economy every year might make us think.
There will be a written declaration on this open later this week.
I hope colleagues will take the opportunity to sign it and support raising awareness of this horrible disease.
Â Â  Mr President, while endorsing the last point, I also wish to emphasise the points made by Mr Mitchell.
The World Health Organization has issued one of its severest warnings ever on an imminent flu pandemic, likely to be on a scale not seen since 1917, and yet Parliament remains mute.
We asked for this matter to be placed on the agenda of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; it is not on the agenda this week.
We asked for it to be placed on the plenary agenda; it is not on the agenda this week.
The United States took action six months ago.
Member States are beginning to take what amounts to inadequate action now.
Mr President, will you write to the Commission and request a progress report on the action being taken by the Commission and Member States, and attach the response to the Minutes of this sitting?
Could you also ensure that, through your good offices and mine, pressure is exerted on the Commission to make a statement the next time Parliament meets in plenary?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Bowis.
I have taken good note of your request.
