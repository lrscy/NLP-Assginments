There is a lot of money in already existing funds that is not used to the full.
We are in favour, however, of the proposal to set up an inquiry into the development of new methods for funding major infrastructure projects of common European interest.
Amendment No 26:
This proposal is far too detailed.
It does not fall within the scope of this report to lay down detailed regulations on speeds.
. (FR) The need for a policy to rationalise transport at European Union level is obvious, since the organisation of the railways and the major road and river routes at national level is so out of date, not to mention air transport.
However, we need to be aware of the kind of policy we are talking about.
The main concern of the report is to hand over more public transport services to the private sector, even though they are still public services, and the whole scheme involves proposals for subsidies and tax incentives aimed at private capital.
We totally reject this policy, in which the so-called rational organisation of transport is merely a trick.
To base the operation of this sector, which is so essential to community life, on competition and maximum profit seeking leads to wastage, anomalies, lack of safety for users, and possibly even disasters.
A European transport policy should be based on the public service provided by the principal collective means of transport.
Basic public transport services which are absolutely essential to the public should not generate private profits but should be organised on the basis of need.
Consequently, we voted against this report.
. (FR) Yesterday evening I had the opportunity to express my strong reservations about a White Paper and a report, both of which illustrate the gulf between the objectives sought and the means used to achieve them, not only in the field of transport but also in many other fields in Europe.
Today, at voting time, there were still 'margins of uncertainty' regarding the possible adoption of certain amendments, in particular those tabled by the GUE-NGL Group.
Those on the Right united against them, very often with the support of the Socialists.
I therefore voted against a report which does not respond to the serious issues at stake in terms of regional planning, the environment and social matters.
- (FR) I heard a Member talking about a 'revolution in transport culture', and I say yes to that.
Yes, we should encourage the development of clean transport systems, yes we should limit road traffic, and yes we should have a European transport policy which contributes to economic and social cohesion.
However, there is one thing that we must not forget: there are real geographical and cultural differences between States, which explain the history of the transport systems of each one of them, and Europe should not seek to erase these differences.
For example, in France there is great diversity between the various landscapes, especially in mountain regions and rural areas.
If we want to treat our citizens fairly, wherever they happen to be in France, or in Europe for that matter, we cannot think dogmatically, as the Commission has done in its proposal.
This proposal is lacking in pragmatism and does not take sufficient account of disparities in treatment at local level.
When I see the flagrant lack of infrastructures in certain geographical areas, when they are already isolated, depopulated and abandoned, I cannot accept the guidelines set out in this White Paper, which continues to address only liberal concerns.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (FR) I voted in favour of the report.
Transport policy is essential, both for economic development and for the preservation of the environment and of our living conditions, and this means that we have to take the long-term view.
Improving the quality of transport means increasing the alternatives to road transport, in particular by giving support to rail transport and effectively implementing north-south links (Rhine-Rhone-Mediterranean via the Frankfurt/Lyons/Perpignan/Barcelona axis) and European interconnections (Lyons-Turin,?).
In this field, political willingness on the part of governments is sometimes lacking.
Improving the efficiency of transport also means paying special attention to trans-European navigable waterway networks.
All too often these projects are prevented from being implemented.
Improving transport safety also means preventing foreseeable bad weather conditions from blocking roads and airports, leaving people to fall back on their own resources owing to the lack of sufficient capacity to react to such situations, and the lack of equipment or of efficient warning systems, even when the appropriate technology exists.
Finally, I am not in favour of the creation of a European road safety agency.
I do not think that we can solve the problems we are currently encountering by multiplying structures of this type.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (DA) The members of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in the European Parliament voted neither in favour of, nor against, the first part of Amendment No 19.
The ELDR Group is in favour of an environmentally friendly plan for traffic through the Alps, but such a plan must support the development of environmentally sound transport.
That is not emphasised in the proposal.
. (EL) The Commission proposal and the report follow up and flesh out the policy set out in the White Paper on competitiveness, advocating the full liberalisation of the transport market.
The ultimate aim is to increase the return on capital.
Proclamations about safe transport and environmental protection are cancelled out by the philosophy of all-out, unaccountable competitiveness.
The report welcomes the fact that a good deal of progress has been made with regard to liberalisation and competitiveness in transport.
Using demand as its criterion, it highlights the advantages of road transport and focuses on the creation of high capacity north-south and east-west corridors.
At the same time, it insists on the need to privatise the railways as a precondition for making them profitable.
It also supports market access to port services and stresses the need for a uniform taxation and costing policy for transport.
The Commission and the report are indifferent to the impact this policy has and will have on the standard, safety and cost of transport to the general public.
It supports the single European sky, the abolition of national FIRs and flexible civil and military use of airspace; in conjunction with the general border changes taking place in the area as a whole, this spells danger for the security and national independence of countries such as Greece.
.
(PT) I congratulate Mr Izquierdo Collado on the excellent report he has drawn up on the Commission White Paper entitled 'European transport policy for 2010: time to decide', which I fully support, in particular his call for the issue of the growing liberalisation of the transport sector to be accompanied by guarantees, investment, mobility, subsidies, price support and maintenance of services for remote and island regions.
In this context I should like to emphasise that, due to the importance of transport for the development of the outermost regions, the European Parliament must, within this process, defend the commitments given to the outermost regions in the Treaty of Amsterdam, thereby contributing to economic and social cohesion in Europe.
I should also like to point out that the safety of transport cannot be made conditional on its profitability and that, where the safety of road transport is concerned, I fully share the aim laid down by the Commission to achieve a 50% reduction in the number of road deaths by 2010, (totalling 20 000) and I support the proposal for the Community-level implementation of evidence-based measures that will enable this target to be achieved.
. (PT) The increasing attention paid to road safety represents added value for Portuguese interests.
In fact, the adoption of this report will enable many problems experienced on Portuguese roads, and in particular on some roads in the Algarve, to be solved.
Creating a European Road Safety Agency, as proposed in this report, seems, in my opinion, to be of enormous importance, particularly to 'speeding up developments in road safety and providing access to road safety data and best practice information across the EU.'
Furthermore, I think that the European Transport Fund, another of the measures proposed, is an important pillar for the proper development of infrastructures for roads, railways, maritime routes, river and sea ports and airports, in the aim of creating a European network of balanced and sustainable infrastructures.
For all of these reasons I am persuaded to vote in favour on this matter.
This report is based on a premise that is good for my country, since it seeks to launch new initiatives to improve access in the outermost regions.
. (PT) It is absolutely crucial that we adopt a realistic approach to this matter.
Firstly because of the distant horizon of 2010, the deadline set by the Commission White Paper is directed and secondly, in light of the practical difficulties of implementing a very broad range of measures with meagre resources.
This will be a good way of giving the Transport Policy the solvency and credibility that it needs.
With regard specifically to freight transport, I have for a long time maintained that priority must be given to restoring rail transport and to developing short-sea and inland waterway shipping, rather than to the excessively overcrowded roads.
Many of the problems of concern to the rapporteur, such as road safety, the prevention of bottlenecks, mobility and environmental protection, will be significantly alleviated by action designed to achieve this new balance, favouring the modes of transport that are most heavily penalised today.
Internalising external costs, such as environmental costs, can also play a major role in this correction, obviously most heavily penalising the most polluting and most redundant forms of transport, which are also those most likely to cause bottlenecks.
These are my reasons for voting in favour of the report.
I have voted against the report, which has been adopted by 406 votes, with 95 votes against and 33 abstentions.
I object to the fact that the European Parliament has voted (by 344 votes, with 185 votes against and 12 abstentions) in favour of the proposal to set up a new European authority for road safety issues.
Road safety is a very important responsibility.
Every year, many thousands of lives are claimed on European roads.
Setting up a further EU authority is no solution, however.
What, rather, is required is more stringent monitoring of the ways in which the road traffic regulations are complied with.
The EU is weighed down by a significant bureaucracy which swallows large sums of money.
National authorities now already exist with the task of promoting road safety - in Sweden's case, the National Road Administration in BorlÃ€nge.
Nor can I support the decision to set up a new European transport fund, as approved by 368 votes, with 145 against and 13 abstentions.
The proposal is in danger of causing Member States with currently high road standards indirectly to be forced to pay money to countries whose roads are of poorer quality.
The Southern Europeans would see in a new transport fund an opportunity to request funds to improve neglected roads at a time when funds from the regional and cohesion funds will, to a greater extent, be going to the new East European Member States.
A European transport fund could easily lead to countries' deliberately according less priority to their national investment in roads in order, instead, to request funds from the common European budget.
. (PT) Transport is an essential sector of undeniable strategic importance for sustainable development and for economic and social cohesion throughout the Union because it transcends the economic and union interests of the sector and its quality affects the entire Community.
We fully support the railways within the Union's transport system and call for top priority to be given to urgent changes to the terms governing its expansion, nature and adjustment to market conditions.
We advocate the responsible liberalisation of European railway management.
We support the institutionalisation of a European Transport Fund.
Mr President, a key aspect of the roll-out of third generation mobile communications is the protection of children.
The mobile revolution could greatly increase their vulnerability to predators.
We need strong action and strong recommendations from the Commission in this area.
The importance of the precautionary principle should not be ignored either, given possible health problems.
What are the effects of electromagnetic waves on the human body?
Scientific research is continuing in this area.
Specialists are asking questions.
It is essential that we consult medical organisations on this question.
3G relay masts must be positioned with due regard for the environment.
Third generation requires between 4 and 16 times as many masts as second generation.
Hence the need for mast-sharing and for the Commission to take full consideration of the environment in its proposals.
Mr President, I am starting to feel the pangs of hunger so I will not deliver an explanation of vote this time.
- (FR) While supporting the Auroi report and the work of our rapporteur, throughout the debate I have felt the need to point out that, in the field of mobile telephone communications, if we applied the precautionary principle we would stop using portable telephones altogether.
It is easy to see why.
Well then, let us at least ensure that proper research is carried out with a view to limiting the potential risks of this technology, and let us very quickly prohibit the most suspect installations or materials.
Let us not wait for another asbestos-type crisis to make us aware of the dangers that are threatening us.
. (PT) The potential delay in implementing third-generation mobile communications networks and services is today a major risk factor for a sector that has been considerably weakened by the bursting of the speculative bubble in the USA, which could have a knock-on effect on the communications and information technology sector and hence on the economy in general, given this sector's influence on telecommunications, and particularly on mobile communications, in some Member States.
This situation is largely due to the great expectations raised for the sector's development and to the enormous financial sums obtained by some Member States by auctioning UMTS licences.
Consequently, these States are now considering adopting unilateral aid to 'rescue' this sector from a situation of considerable debt.
In addition to this risk factor, we must consider the issues of equal access for citizens to third-generation mobile communications, content-related issues, specifically in terms of public service provision, the consequences of the further liberalisation of the sector and the effects of radiation from the electromagnetic fields created by mobile phones, making it crucial to extend scientific research in this field.
Mr President, I cannot refrain from delivering this explanation of vote.
The document is entitled: 'eEurope 2005: An information society for all'.
For all?
For absolutely everybody?
Mr Silvio Berlusconi has issued a letter giving money to students to buy computers.
What about pensioners?
I would like pensioners not to be overlooked in this information society.
I propose that, when pensioners draw their first pension payment, together with this first pension payment they should be given - and I stress, given - a computer, so that they too can enjoy the benefits, the marvels and the joys of information technology.
. We are all aware that for the European Union to remain competitive we must take full advantage of the new information technologies that are coming on stream.
That is the core of the Action Plan for eEurope 2005 guaranteeing widespread availability of broadband networks throughout the EU.
It also seeks to ensure the widespread use of the Internet through eGovernment, eLearning, eHealth and eBusiness initiatives.
I represent a peripheral part of the European Union - both the western and border county regions in Ireland.
It must remain a central European policy that the benefits of new technologies extend equally to all urban and rural parts of Europe.
If access to these new technologies is not available, investors will locate their companies where the best available technology is.
On issues such as information technology, there is the principle known as universal access.
The cost of access to the internet must be the same whether the user is living in a rural part of Ireland or in a capital city in the European Union.
We must do more to promote a dynamic e-business environment, and ensure that small and medium sized companies take full advantage of the new evolving technologies to meet that objective.
. (PT) I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has dedicated itself to a plan as important as eEurope 2005, in the aim of enabling the Member States to develop their online skills in the sectors of public administration, by modernising public services in order to guarantee universal accessibility; education, specifically the aim of guaranteeing broadband access for all educational establishments; health, by providing online health services to the population, and broadband data networks between the various points of healthcare provision, such as hospitals, laboratories and homes; and 'business', obviously not forgetting issues involving the technical means necessary to achieving these aims - extending bandwidth and multiplying channels - and the sensitive issue of the security of information.
Despite the fact that there is generally consensus amongst Members on this issue, I think it important to register my vote in favour of this report.
. I and my fellow British Labour MEPs do not support any amendments critical of the auction system for allocating radio spectrum.
It was always clear, from both the Council and the Commission, that Member States had the choice of the system to allocate radio frequencies.
The UK quite properly chose the auction system, and we do not concur with the criticism of this contained in these two reports.
. (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, and I agree, therefore, with the conclusions reached by the competent parliamentary committee on its content.
I felt I should give my unequivocal support to promoting the skills - especially the technical and logistical skills - of the Member States, in order to achieve the aim proclaimed at the Lisbon and Santa Maria da Feira European Councils and later at the Barcelona and Seville Councils, to make the European Union the most competitive society in the world and in this respect at the forefront of the 'world information society'.
This report must also be seen as forming a link with the Van Velzen and Khanbhai reports, because, as it states, a new era of high-quality content must be promoted, in which the Member States must have a special say and their own contribution to make.
I therefore consider establishing priority action frameworks to promote online skills, as the report suggests, to be of the utmost strategic importance, especially in public administration, by modernising public services in order to guarantee universal accessibility; education, specifically the aim of guaranteeing broadband access for all educational establishments and health, by providing online health services to the population, and broadband data networks between the various points of healthcare provision, such as hospitals, laboratories and homes.
. (EL) The prospects and expectations of Lisbon are, unfortunately, a far cry from the situation on the ground in Europe.
Europe has not only failed to take the lead in the most important technologies; it is still as far behind the USA as it was before, growth has slowed, unemployment has risen, new sciences are finding it hard to break into the market and regional disparities persist.
Unfortunately, the summit Council does not appear to have a cohesive programme or proposals and the proposals by the leaders of France, Germany and Great Britain are confined to the industrial sector.
The Spring Summit will need to set out new priorities, tailored to the current climate of economic recession and international tension, which include relaxing the Stability Pact criteria, tax incentives to boost labour intensive activities, special incentives to help regions lagging behind in the new technologies, joined-up interventions to upgrade the education system and monitoring the implementation of eEurope objectives in each Member State.
. (PT) This resolution on preparations for the 2003 Spring Summit, which highlights the urgent need to re-establish credibility and to implement the Lisbon Strategy in order to improve the European Union's economic and social model by 2010, warrants support despite the fact that Europe's current political and economic climate is substantially less favourable than the climate that served as backdrop to the Lisbon European Council of 2000.
We need to restore confidence in the Lisbon Strategy and to implement its aims.
In order to achieve this, a roadmap must be drawn up for its monitoring and for legislative commitments to be smoothly transposed into national legislation.
In the context of employment and social affairs, the crucial role of the social partners must be emphasised.
Furthermore, the Member States must adopt measures that will enable the most disadvantaged social groups to be better integrated into the labour market, investment in basic and ongoing education and training as a factor of vital importance to individual and collective progress. These measures must also combat undeclared work and poverty and social exclusion.
We must furthermore improve the system of the mutual recognition of qualifications, in order to encourage greater and better mobility.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) The agenda for the European Council this coming March, which has just been presented to us, includes so many economic and social priorities that it is bound to give rise to confusion.
We believe that it will have three negative effects in particular.
First of all there is a complete lack of visibility in the eyes of the public, particularly since many of the subjects that are regarded as priorities at European level are really of very secondary importance to our fellow citizens.
Then we are being sent a subliminal message which we do not accept, namely that the European Union is a super-state which has its finger in every pie.
Finally, and most importantly, ineffectiveness is guaranteed, because faced with so many priorities, action on the part of the Union and of its Member States is bound to become fragmented.
As I said during the debate, many of the measures proposed are extremely interesting, but we ought to concentrate on certain central selling ideas.
The European Union should not add an additional cumbersome and restrictive level of management.
It should remain flexible and differentiated. It should make life easier for Member States on the international stage, by helping them to limit immigration and to fight, within the WTO negotiations, to enable us to retain our security and the identity of our societies.
. (FR) When I spoke this morning I asked that this summit should not turn out to be a mere catalogue of good intentions and that the objective of full employment, with all the consequences that that implies, should become more or less the sole objective from which all the rest are derived.
The resolution which was voted for and signed by Members on the Right and belonging to the PSE, was not acceptable, particularly since the votes had 'liberalised' it even more.
I therefore voted against it.
. (IT) We would like to express our satisfaction at the proposals and at the commitment of the Presidency to the events ahead of us, and point out that a rapidly developing society brings cases of social exclusion as well as general prosperity.
A policy which caters for the weakest is the hallmark of a civilised human community which has to meet the needs of the weakest too.
We must preserve the family and the right to a dignified life as basic values, activating instruments to ensure equal access to education and work and preventing the spread of child pornography and all physical and moral violence.
We must be more mindful of the environment, food security and animal rights, for these are issues related to quality of life.
We need to prevent practices such as female genital mutilation which damage physical integrity and personal dignity.
We need framework rules requiring each country to establish basic salaries and pension, health and welfare systems which reflect the true cost of living, and we need to bring about the effective participation of employees in enterprise profits and gain.
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the votes.
The sitting is suspended
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Iraq.
Mr President, at this crucial time in the effort to achieve the disarmament of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, and when the risk seems to be increasing that he has still not fully understood the need to disarm, I welcome this opportunity to share with you our views of the situation and the role which Europe should play.
What is crystal clear is that Iraq needs to cooperate more willingly and intensively both in form and in substance with the inspectors, if war is to be avoided.
Some encouraging signs of cooperation emerged recently, as a result of Mr Blix's and Mr El Baradei's mission to Baghdad last weekend.
We will have more indications on the extent of Iraq's cooperation next Friday when the chief inspectors report to the Security Council.
We are about to face another crucial point as regards whether Saddam is ready to disarm or not.
Beyond any possible speculation, it is easy to imagine that we will still be in a somewhat unclear situation open to different interpretations.
In any case we have to stick to the inspectors' assessment, bearing in mind that war must remain the very last resort.
The preservation of the UN Security Council's role, and of the primacy of international law, must remain our basis if we want to maintain a credible system able to guarantee peace and security.
The recent resolution voted by the European Parliament expressing its full support for a multilateral approach gave a clear message in this direction.
As confirmed by recent events, we all know that the Member States have quite diverging views on this issue, and that achieving a common position on this issue is a huge challenge for the European Union.
The EU in fact looks weaker and more divided than ever.
These differences are not the product of some minor institutional inadequacies in the architecture of the European Union.
We already have a High Representative entrusted with the responsibility of speaking on behalf of the European Union.
The differences are honest and real, and therefore demonstrate that a more fundamental change is necessary if Europe is to achieve a true Common Foreign and Security Policy.
This is a moment of truth.
Anything short of qualified majority voting will not be a solution.
This lesson should be kept in mind in the present institutional and constitutional debate.
In any case the need now for internal clarification is strong, and in this regard we welcome the Presidency initiative calling for an extraordinary summit next Monday, in an attempt to get Europe to speak with one voice, defining the European position in view of the most recent events.
It is not up to the European Commission to speculate on hypothetical possibilities or the future course of action.
Many scenarios are still possible - including the likelihood of a military attack.
Yet our major responsibility at this point is to give absolute support to the Security Council.
Needless to say, in parallel, each of us needs to work on what to do in case things do not go as we wish.
Let me now turn to the humanitarian aspects of the crisis.
The humanitarian situation in Iraq is already precarious after 20 years of degradation deriving from a long war with Iran, followed by the Gulf War and 10 years of international sanctions.
The European Commission, through ECHO, is the largest external donor to Iraq outside the 'Oil for Food Programme' (which is funded with Iraqi money).
Over the last ten years ECHO has provided EUR 156 million worth of humanitarian aid to the population in Iraq.
In June 2002 ECHO approved a global humanitarian plan of EUR 13 million which focuses on the health and water and sanitation sectors in order to complement the 'oil for food' programme.
The operations from this funding will run until summer 2003.
For 2003, ECHO has earmarked EUR 15 million to continue this established - more or less 'normal' - humanitarian operation in Iraq.
It is estimated that over 7 million Iraqi people benefit from ECHO's assistance.
Eventual military action against Iraq would further worsen the living conditions of the Iraqi people, and in particular of those of the most vulnerable civilian population groups.
A military attack might have humanitarian fall-outs in the whole region, with movements of refugees and also quite possibly negative consequences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Commission is going through studies and analyses right now, looking at contingency measures in case of a conflict.
ECHO is maintaining very regular and close contacts with all key humanitarian partners and notably with the UN agencies: OCHA, UNICEF, UNHCR, WHO, WFP, the Red Cross - both the ICRC and the IFRC - and NGOs in the region, and it is also important to maintain close contact with UNHRA.
ECHO has recently sent two missions to Iraq and neighbouring countries in order to assess the current humanitarian situation and security measures for staff, and to monitor the preparations by different humanitarian agencies in the event of a conflict in Iraq. This is in order to be able to react quickly to any change in the humanitarian situation.
These missions also looked into the security measures envisaged for relief workers and humanitarian operations - evacuation plans and other such difficult issues.
A strict separation must be maintained between military action and humanitarian assistance to make sure that delivery of aid is possible.
Humanitarian assistance has its own rationale and objectives.
It is based on the needs of the civilian populations and allocated solely in proportion to these needs.
Neutrality and impartiality are crucial for having access to populations and a condition sine qua non for the security of relief workers.
Delivery of humanitarian assistance by or assisted by armed forces is not desirable.
It should in any case be closely coordinated and decided by the humanitarian organisations which have the necessary mandate, know-how and experience.
These are the guiding principles for our assessments and for our possible action in the area of humanitarian aid if a conflict breaks out.
Mr President, on a point of order, we are facing a threat to world peace.
This is a most serious situation.
This Parliament proves its utter irrelevance by having a two-hour-only debate to discuss this matter with no possibility to 'catch your eye', thus allowing a limited number of Members only to make a contribution.
If this Parliament is to be relevant, it has to allow more time for all points of view to be expressed.
It is unfair that it is limited only to the leading players in Parliament and that ordinary Members do not have an opportunity to contribute.
I suggest to colleagues who have concerns in that regard that in the first instance, when we work on setting the agenda in the Conference of Presidents, that is the appropriate place to put it forward.
This is our second substantial debate on this subject in recent weeks.
It will not be our last.
I hope that the diversity of opinion in the debates we have will find the capacity to express itself.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance face the prospect of their unity being shattered.
Even though Europe is a sad sight to behold, there is an opportunity in every crisis, and so we should not be saying that a common European foreign and security policy makes no sense, or that it has failed; rather, we have to redouble our efforts in order that our foreign and security policy may indeed be shared by all of us.
Any such policy must be founded on clear analysis, that analysis being that it is Saddam Hussein who is the problem, at the head of a regime of terror founded upon crime, terror and murder.
Commissioner, Iraq is in fact a rich country, but its dictator has plundered it.
So anyone who sees the USA as the problem is confusing cause and effect.
It is the Iraqi dictator who is the problem.
Our group is of the very decided opinion that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein are a menace to the region and imperil the peace of the world.
It is under the UN's aegis that disarmament must take place; it must be peaceful if at all possible, and, if that proves impossible, military means must be employed.
Responsibility for whether it happens peacefully or by military force lies solely with the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
(Applause)
Let us just remind ourselves of the chronology of events.
At the heart of disunity within Europe and across the Atlantic is the self-isolation of the Federal Republic of Germany, for which its present Chancellor must bear responsibility.
(Applause from the right, heckling)
The German Federal Chancellor, by isolating Germany - whatever reasons he may have had for doing so - during a federal election campaign, in which he said, 'No matter what the UN does, we will never take part in it!', took the pressure off Saddam Hussein; he acted in an anti-European way, for one needs to speak first to the Europeans before coming out with utterances with such implications at public election rallies.
He gave a complete repeat performance in the elections to provincial assemblies, but it brought him no success in terms of votes.
We then come to the second chronological element, the Franco-German declaration at the celebrations of the ElysÃ©e Treaty.
Speaking in terms of political psychology - and I do so for the benefit of our French friends in particular - this gave the false impression of the French position now being identical to the German one.
The French were always much more sophisticated, but that was the political impression that was given.
Then came the statement by the eight states.
I am speaking for our group when I tell you that we regret this way of going about things, which bypasses the Community process, and that we cannot endorse it.
In essence, the statement does meet with our approval, however.
It was also necessary in order that we might send out a signal of friendship to our American partners.
(Applause from the centre and from the right)
We are now faced with the question of what is to happen next.
I recommend that we give thought to how we understand our relationship with America.
If we understand European unity in terms of opposition to the United States of America, then we are building Europe upon sand.
Rather than that, we want a partnership between the European Union and the United States of America, a partnership founded on cooperation between equals and on multilateral partnership.
There are also, of course, things that we demand of our American partners.
We do not think it right that the American administration under President Bush tends to see the USA's relationship with Europe in bilateral terms, in other words, Washington and Paris, Washington and London, Washington and Rome, Washington and Madrid, Washington and Berlin and so on. We have to define the relationship between the USA and Europe in such a way that Europeans can take common action and also in such a way that the European institutions are the American administration's partner in negotiations.
(Applause)
For if we do not build this partnership of equals with America, that also goes against America's interests, as we now see, as European disunity has consequences for the North Atlantic Alliance.
The American administration and President Bush should also recognise the value of European unity, which is also in the interests of the United States of America.
If we in Europe were to revert to forming axes as we once did, then both our group and I would consider this a perilous road to go down.
Just imagine - and I will not use the word 'axis' - that there were to be, as seems at present to be taking shape, something like two common positions, with Paris, Berlin and Moscow on the one side and London, Rome, Madrid and Washington on the other.
If Europe were to present itself thus to the world, it would be a nightmarish sight.
That is why we have to act within the framework of the Community.
All the things we are doing now have to be done on a Community basis.
That, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is why our group supports your decision to call a summit meeting of the Heads of State and of Government.
Let me say just a word or two on the subject of Turkey. If our Turkish partners ask us to involve them in planning and to supply them with weapons for their defence, I do not believe that we can refuse such a request, such an entreaty.
I hope that we will also achieve a result on this issue.
(Applause)
My wish for the Presidency of the Council next Monday is for three things to be achieved: a European common position, the bridging of the deep gulf between us and the United States, and the sending of a signal to the Iraqi dictator that he must disarm.
It is to be hoped he will be brought to do this by peaceful means and under the guidance of the United Nations!
(Loud applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest achievement of European construction is the fact that for half a century we have broken the pattern of war, replacing it with peace and a shared destiny.
The European peoples do not just co-exist in the Union, but we share a destiny in brotherhood and mutual tolerance.
And we are still constructing Europe, with difficulties, but the united Europe is not the old Europe of endemic civil wars between us nor the new Europe which was preached by fascism and Nazism.
At this time much more unites us than divides us.
We all want peace, we are all against bloodthirsty dictators and we all want to see the disappearance of weapons of mass destruction.
In families - and in the Union - there can be moments of tension, but we must be able to overcome them through solidarity and mutual compromise.
The approach which can unite Europe is the mandate of the United Nations, respect for international law and the continuation of the inspectors' work.
We are not condemned to war; we must work to give peace a chance.
In this context, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the European Socialist Party support and welcome the correct and timely initiative of President Simitis: we must do everything possible to find a common position and overcome the disagreements within the Council and also with the candidate countries, who are already members of our Union.
I would like to correct Mr Poettering on a point relating to the isolation of the current German government.
I would like to remind him that the first government of the German Federal Republic since the war to fully assume its responsibilities in the international field was the Socialist/Green coalition of Chancellor SchrÃ¶der.
Before that there was nothing more than passivity.
Therefore the SchrÃ¶der government is not isolated, it is in good company.
From the point of view of our responsibilities as the European Parliament, we were significantly united in the resolution approved in January by a large majority - from which, curiously, the Group of the European Peoples' Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats withdrew at the last moment, after having negotiated it.
My Group would ask the President to use the resolution as a guide for his speech on Monday, in which we urge him to make a solemn appeal and to insist on the need for the United Nations Security Council resolutions to be fully applied and complied with, to express opposition to any unilateral action and to consider that a preventive attack does not conform to the United Nations Charter, and that he also urge the Council and the Member States to take the initiative of proposing to the International Criminal Court that the Iraqi leader is responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
In this regard, it is important to point out that at this time we must not anticipate events.
The military machine must not be allowed to take on its own dynamic, leading us into war, the war is still avoidable and the United Nations Organisation is still necessary.
The geopolitical effects of action adopted unilaterally outside the framework of the Security Council would be catastrophic not only for Iraq but for the whole of the Middle East, with unpredictable consequences.
We must not forget that Iraq, despite everything, is still a secular and religiously pluralist regime, which is important in view of the situation of increasing fundamentalism.
We have heard the Commission's report on the humanitarian issue - and I thank Commissioner Nielson - which also points out the risks involved in this.
We must therefore carry on supporting the inspectors, insisting that Iraq comply with the resolutions of the Security Council without allowing it to make any excuse or evasive response.
In this context, the inspection chiefs have noted that it is a positive step that Iraq has agreed to allow surveillance flights and is cooperating.
At the moment, the international community has put is faith in the inspectors. They must continue their work and we must support them.
Finally, Mr President, since 11 September we have insisted on the need to coordinate efforts with the United States and we have expressed our solidarity with this great country in the fight against the threat of international terrorism.
This is not only a result of our historic gratitude and friendship, arising from the role of the United States in favour of European democracy in the two world wars.
The issue today is not the extent to which we are friends on paper with the United States.
We are in disagreement - and this must be said - over the doctrine of preventive war.
We are even more in disagreement and we totally reject the unfortunate comments of the Secretary of State, Mr Rumsfeld, in Munich last week, insulting a European country and not explaining the thing he should explain: why, as Secretary of the Reagan administration, he went to Baghdad to give weapons of mass destruction to his then ally, Saddam Hussein.
This must be explained.
(Applause)
Mr President, I will end by saying that we are friends and allies who behave like genuine friends: we say what we think.
We are allies of the United States as a result of shared historical responsibilities and principles.
We must fight to give peace and hope a chance. We are not condemned to the disaster of war and mass destruction, and we call on President-in-Office Simitis to speak on behalf of a Europe with one harmonious voice next Monday.
(Applause)
Mr President, it seems hard to believe that the disunity of the world community as a whole, and the European Union in particular, could reach a lower point than when the 'gang of 8' prime ministers signed their ill-judged letter backing the USA on Iraq.
But we are now plumbing new depths of public bickering, with the splits spreading from the UN and the EU to include Nato.
Anarchy reigns in our international institutions, and that only provides comfort to Saddam Hussein.
If we are to prevent these fissures becoming a chasm, our governments must draw back from their quarrels, return to first principles and move forward on the basis of what unites them.
The United Nations, Nato, the European Communities - these institutions have served us well, and they are too valuable to be abandoned in the face of current differences of approach.
And if that requires America to show a little patience, that is no bad thing.
Public opinion in the US is less united than President Bush pretends - over a third still want a new UN vote to authorise any conflict, and almost a quarter do not want US troops to be sent to Iraq at all.
When a former president pleads for patience, and leading Democrat Senator John Kerry hopes for an America: 'where military might is not clouded by our need for oil', is there really bipartisan backing for President Bush, to give him the credibility he needs?
Democracy can be difficult, and building support for a position often takes time and good arguments.
But it is better to take the time to do it and get it right than to launch into a course of action, half cock.
Liberals therefore congratulate the Greek Presidency on convening next Monday's meeting.
We trust that all governments will attend.
They should come prepared to listen and to seek common ground, not simply to repeat their well-known positions.
Europe's leaders too should take care not to overplay their hand.
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees is rightly following the maxim that they should prepare for the worst while continuing to hope for the best, by making contingency plans for a possible refugee crisis.
As a collective defence organisation, Nato should be guided by the same principle, and it is the responsibility of every Nato country to support Turkey's request for assistance under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
Given the reservations he expressed last time, Dr Hans Blix's report on Friday will carry particular significance.
Those who call for more inspectors should heed his remark that: 'the principal problem is not the number of inspectors but rather the active cooperation of the Iraqi side'.
At the same time, if he reports progress towards active cooperation, the US and Britain should give the UN process the space to work.
Amid all this gloom, perhaps we can take comfort from one ray of hope.
When the inspectors report again on Friday, the eyes of the world will again be focused on the UN Security Council.
It will be the body which represents the ultimate authority of the international community and considers Iraq's fate.
We should welcome the fact that the UN, established to preserve world peace, is at the heart of the process.
Let us keep it there.
Mr President, the European Union is facing a test of truth.
The attitude which it will shortly be taking towards the prospect of a new Gulf War will be crucial in defining our vision of Europe and our conception of the world.
It will have to shoulder its responsibilities in circumstances which will leave no room for one of those woolly consensuses to which, all too often, we have become accustomed thanks to the common foreign and security policy.
Hemmed in by the pressure from the Bush administration's call to arms on one side and the demands of European public opinion, which is massively opposed to it, on the other, there can be no middle way: we shall have to choose.
In these circumstances, what message should Parliament be sending to the European Council?
Its resolution of 30 January was clear on the essential points, and is still entirely in line with our current view.
Allow me to add a few points drawn from the moving experiences of the delegation of over thirty Members of the European Parliament, drawn from eleven countries and four political groups, which has just returned from Iraq.
First of all I should like to brush aside the insidious remarks of those who have tried to portray us as being under an obligation to Saddam Hussein.
On the contrary, even in the opinion of the journalists who were present, ours was the most independent delegation of any in recent times.
After all, our links with the democratic opposition to the Baghdad regime and our absolute rejection of Saddam Hussein are sufficiently well known to enable me not to waste any more time on this unfounded, petty accusation.
I hope, in this respect, that the European Parliament's ad hoc delegation to Iraq will not stop in New York but will continue to its final destination, Baghdad.
Our delegation, by contrast, will proceed rapidly to New York and Washington, where the anti-war movement is growing day by day, reaching right to the heart of Congress.
Well then, what did we see and hear in Iraq, and what collective conclusions have we drawn?
First of all there are the accumulated impressions and observations of the life of the population, from Baghdad and its most deprived suburbs to Basra, in the south, and Mosul, in the north, with its enormous camp for Turkish Kurd refugees.
Everywhere, poverty is on a massive scale, and there has been spectacular social regression according to those who knew Iraq before the Gulf War, and even more so compared with what the country was like before the war with Iran.
There is no longer an economy, apart from oil, exports of which have fallen by half due to lack of investment.
In rural areas, all activities have collapsed, desertification is progressing and the population exodus is speeding up.
UN agents are sounding the alarm: one third of the population is suffering from chronic malnutrition, and one third of children are seriously underweight.
Infant mortality has exploded in the last ten years.
More than eight thousand schools are in ruins and need repairs that would now be too costly.
Students have no books, and teachers earn the equivalent of a few euros per month.
In Iraq today, people do not live, they try to survive thanks to the meagre assistance provided by the 'oil for food' programme, which is financed using revenue from hydrocarbons and is managed directly by the government.
This is the result of twelve years of embargo, and it is absolutely essential to put an end to this unbearable collective punishment.
It is possible to get an idea of the memories left in people's minds by the war, by going, as we did, to the so-called demilitarised zone in the south of the country.
There, the heaps of countless wrecked tanks, cars, jeeps and buses remind us that, in the final hours of the conflict, even as the Iraqi troops were falling back, a final bombardment claimed more than thirty thousand needless victims.
Against this background, now, the predominant feelings are of fatalism, resignation, and silent traumatisation.
A new war would undoubtedly lead to the catastrophic disruption of supplies of food and water.
It would be a humanitarian disaster.
In our view this reason alone is enough to rule out absolutely any new recourse to war, whatever the circumstances.
There is also another reason, however, namely the risk of destabilising the whole region, starting with the Middle East, where the Palestinians are currently facing one of the worst situations in their history.
The other striking experience in our view was our meeting with the spokesman of the inspectors and the director of the UN inspection centre in Baghdad.
What they told us makes good sense.
First of all, as long as the inspectors are present, it will be difficult for Saddam Hussein to manufacture prohibited weapons.
Then again, it is completely impossible to complete such a mission in the space of two months, but given time, resources and the cooperation of the authorities, it will be possible to achieve the international community's objective, namely to ensure that Iraq no longer constitutes a threat to the world.
This is why we stated publicly, on the spot, that in our view, at the present time, the only chance for Iraq lies in complete cooperation with the United Nations inspectors.
This is also why the Franco-German proposals seeking to strengthen the resources of the inspectors now constitute, in our view, the only acceptable outcome of this crisis, ruling out any military action.
This is the position that our group expects Member States to adopt, especially those among them who sit on the UN Security Council, particularly if they have the power of veto, which if necessary they should use if that is the only way of refusing to sanction the shameful actions of a team which is drunk with power and is currently placing world peace and equilibrium at risk.
What credibility would the United Nations be left with if a policy of giving in to the strongest party were to lead a handful of states to violate so cynically the spirit of the UN Charter?
Next Saturday, throughout the world, a tidal wave without precedent in many countries will rise up and say no to war.
We hope that as many Members of the European Parliament as possible will be seen at these demonstrations, because Europe has a duty to say no to an imperial machine, whose new strategic doctrine, as published by the Bush administration on 20 September last, illustrates its nature and its scope, namely the cult of military power, the thirst for domination, the claim to be able to act alone, if necessary, on a preventive basis, in order to achieve objectives which have nothing to do with world security.
Following the events of 11 September, we said that we were allied but not aligned.
This handful of Member State leaders who are ready to divide Europe at a signal from the White House needs to be reminded of this principle.
As for the candidate countries, I believe that this is the time to let them know, in all frankness, before the ratification of the accession treaties, that we must be clear about our common ambition: let us not confuse the new Europe with the reform of NATO.
We must keep abreast of European public opinion as it emerges throughout the continent.
In the eyes of an increasing number of our fellow citizens, what the United States has gained in power it is losing in confidence, owing to the Messianic and megalomaniac behaviour of its leaders.
This situation gives the European Union a historic responsibility, not against America, but against the dangerous desire for hegemony on the part of those who claim, on its behalf, to dictate to the world, only to lead that world into chaos.
We are, as I said, facing a test of truth.
History has not yet been written.
Let us hope that those who are holding the cards are able to measure the weight of their responsibility.
President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in every country in the European Union, the great majority of public opinion is still opposed to the idea of a war in Iraq.
If the objective really being pursued is that of disarming Iraq, we must strengthen the inspection programme.
The inspectors are the alternative to war.
If, on the other hand, the objective is first and foremost to topple the Iraqi regime by force, then we must conclude, here and now, as the American Government has done, that the inspection programme has now become pointless.
We must therefore confirm, at the Security Council on Friday, that the sole objective of Resolution 1441 is to disarm Iraq.
I would remind you that the resolution adopted by the plenary session of the European Parliament on 30 January is clearly in line with this reasoning.
This attitude in no way signifies that we accept the dictatorial nature of the Iraqi Government.
It signifies that we do not want a change of regime to be brought about by war.
That, Mr Poettering, is the attitude of the German Government, and it is not an isolated one: it is also the attitude of the French Government and the Belgian Government, and I hope that next Monday, at the European Council meeting, it will be the unified attitude of the fifteen governments of the Union.
Whatever happens, I am proud of the position adopted by these various governments.
I mentioned public opinion in Europe, but I should also like to talk, though not at such length as Mr Wurtz, about the fate of the people of Iraq.
I too was a member of that delegation of 31 Members.
The contact that we had there, both with the authorities of the UN agency and with the NGO officials, have led us unanimously to conclude that after two wars and the current embargo the Iraqi population is at the end of its tether.
A new war in Iraq would obviously have catastrophic humanitarian consequences, and this was confirmed to us by all the UN workers whom we met in Baghdad.
Is this really how we imagine we are preparing a future for the people of Iraq?
Finally, in order to give some hope back to the people of Iraq, I should like to emphasise, as I already have done and as we already did at the previous plenary session, the need to change the embargo arrangements.
Before 11 September 2001, the whole of the international community recognised the negative effects of this embargo, which is helping the dictatorship and keeping the population in a state of dependency while at the same time stifling the Iraqi economy.
I propose that, at the same time as we intensify the inspection programme, there should also be a revision of the mandate of the 'oil for food' programme, which would make it possible to buy local products, thereby encouraging the Iraqi economy to make a fresh start, and which would also give responsibility for distributing food rations to the UN World Food Programme.
(Applause)
Mr President, this is an exceptionally important debate.
Tensions are certainly rising in an international context.
If we are not careful, and if this crisis is badly handled, this will only result in serious and long-term consequences for us all on many fronts.
It would be tragic if the authority of the United Nations is weakened to a point where it loses international credibility.
That is why it is so necessary to guarantee that the United Nations is involved at each and every stage of the developments to disarm the Iraqi Government of its weapons of mass destruction.
International security is best served in a collective sense, via global institutions such as the United Nations.
In many ways, it is even more important for smaller Member States to have their security protected by an international organisation such as the United Nations.
This is the crux of the issue.
There is genuine good will, support and confidence on the part of the people of Europe in the work of the United Nations.
In fact, no one would dispute for one moment the professionalism and integrity of the United Nations officials who are officially involved in the inspection missions in Iraq.
The United Nations has been involved in the whole process to disarm the Iraqi Government of its weapons of mass destruction.
The United Nations must remain a central player in this ongoing process of disarmament.
Any unilateral action in the coming weeks would gravely and seriously damage the authority and credibility of the United Nations as an organisation involved in maintaining international governance in the world.
Weapons inspections must continue as long as the inspectors themselves and the United Nations Security Council believe that they will serve a useful purpose.
We all want to see a peaceful solution to this issue by guaranteeing the compliance of the Iraqi Government with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441.
Saddam Hussein must recognise that the international community wants to resolve this issue by peaceful means.
Disarming Saddam Hussein in a peaceful manner is by far the most acceptable and preferable course of action for all of us.
EU governments are meeting next Monday to review the political situation.
This meeting is taking place at a time of rising tension between the different European Union states.
I certainly hope that this meeting can and will be used to defuse this tension which simply serves no one's interests whatsoever.
This meeting will take place only a few days after the next United Nations weapons inspectors' report is published.
We must continue to try to secure a common European position on Iraq, notwithstanding the very clear differences in approach to this issue that now exist between the different EU governments.
We must all try to approach the next few weeks collectively in a calm and reasoned manner.
However, Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to defy the authority of the United Nations as he has sought to in the past.
We must not forget that this is a man who brutally abuses the human rights of his people.
He has used chemical weapons on his own people; he has invaded Iran and Kuwait and bombed Saudi Arabia and Israel in the past.
This is certainly a track record of brutal belligerence.
Saddam Hussein needs to be disarmed, and he must recognise that the international community will continue to demand that he does disarm.
However, the United Nations must continue to be the organisation that oversees the implementation of United Nations Resolution 1441 or any future resolutions that may be agreed at the UN on this very important and sensitive matter.
The mutual damage inflicted across the Atlantic over the past few days has benefited neither the Iraqi population nor international security.
In fact, only the current terror regime in Baghdad stands to gain from it.
And then we talk about a potential neighbour of the European Union, in view of Turkey's candidate status.
This political option prompts me to put a couple of questions to the Greek Presidency.
Has the Council resigned itself to the domestic status quo in Iraq - with all the dangerous consequences this could entail for the nation and the region; or is the Council striving for a better internal and external perspective for Iraq, actively involving Iraq's very diverse opposition?
Sooner or later, a new policy of containment towards Saddam Hussein will do the international community, and therefore the European Union, too, serious harm.
My second question concerns Turkey's position with regard to the Kurds in northern Iraq.
I presume that Turkey, too, has been invited to next Monday's European crisis deliberations on Iraq.
According to international press reports, the candidate countries are also receiving an invitation.
Is the Council also intending to raise the Kurdish question, a crucial factor in the Iraq crisis, with Turkey at these deliberations?
I assume, Mr President, that the Council is not divided on conserving Iraq's territorial integrity!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there is only one person at this time, shut up in his 13 palaces, who is happy and feels in a stronger position because of what is happening.
That person is Saddam Hussein.
That person - I do not know whether it is his evil genius or our or your stupidity - has succeeded in very little time in exposing the European crisis, the Nato crisis and what we hope, at least, will not be a United Nations crisis.
Ladies and gentlemen, the alternative to war is not, for democrats, the status quo, that bloodthirsty, cruel dictatorial regime described by many of you as 'peace'.
The alternative is politics, and it is the role of politics to define what kind of peace, what kind of conditions, what kind of rules.
Yet, here, there have been no political proposals, apart from a few banalities, and, whether this self-important House likes it or not, the only political proposal currently on the table is for a free, democratic Iraq governed by a transition government under the auspices of the United Nations, which would mastermind the democratic transition for Iraq and the Iraqi people.
You see, you are incapable of doing anything except mumbling 'peace'.
And what does that mean, pray?
Peace for whom?
For the oppressed Iraqis?
You will go out in your millions to demonstrate for peace and Arab public opinion will see you as supporting Saddam Hussein, whether you like it or not.
If you had taken 'A free Iraq' as your slogan, that would have weakened the conflicting arguments and created such a strong position that even Saddam Hussein would have seen the advantages of going into exile.
That did not happen, and just look at the chaos.
I hope that, at the European Council, this single proposal, which has now been signed by thousands of people, will be the only point of convergence. I believe it can enable us to regain some of our lost dignity.
Mr President, the problem of Iraq is a Gordian knot which needs to be cut with the greatest possible consensus within the international community.
Terrorism is a running sore, which may flare up if moves are made without the backing of the Security Council.
This means that, first, Security Council Resolution 1441 on Iraq needs to be duly applied and I should like to take this opportunity to say that it would be a good day for the international community and the credibility of the United Nations if all its resolutions were applied.
We all know that this international crisis has been provoked by Iraq's failure to comply with the resolution in question.
That is why Saddam Hussein, who has proven how dangerous he is in the past by freely using biological and chemical weapons, including against civilians, needs to cooperate with the international community and give the United Nations inspectors all the information they need on his weapons of mass destruction.
In addition, Iraq is being governed as a dictatorship, with no respect for human rights or democracy.
The European Parliament has led the way in the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms and cannot therefore tolerate this situation.
The second point I want to make is that we must first exhaust every peaceful and diplomatic means of getting Iraq to comply.
International peace and security need to be safeguarded and action taken at international level must not undermine the credibility of the UN or the Security Council.
Military action against Iraq must, of course, be the final solution and it must be sanctioned by the international community on the basis of the inspectors' report.
At the same time, the international crisis highlights the weakness of the European Union and I think that the Greek Presidency should not only call on the Fifteen to adopt a common position within the CFSP; any common position should, if possible, also include the candidate countries.
There must be an end to action which polarises the international community and creates divisions, because the credibility of the Union and of the CFSP will be dealt a mortal blow unless a common line of approach is taken to the problem of Iraq.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have just been listening carefully to the President-in-Office of the Council setting out what the extraordinary summit on the 17th is intended to do.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think it would be a very good thing if we really could find a common position on the points you have set out.
They are also the essential points of the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 30 January, with which you are no doubt well acquainted.
I would like to take a close look at these four points.
The removal of all weapons of mass destruction from Iraq is not at issue.
That, I believe, is something we can all agree on, as, no doubt, we do on support for UNMOVAC and IAEA, that is to say, for the inspectors' attempts to bring all this about in Iraq.
Where we will have difficulties, and where it is important that we be clear in our own minds, is with the maintenance of the UN's primacy.
That international organisation is in charge of the process and must remain so; it alone is capable of endowing with legitimacy whatever measures will turn out to be necessary in this case.
We also have to make clear our opposition to unilateral courses of action and, most certainly, our opposition to a preventive war.
The final point that needs to be made is that we must try everything that occurs to us as individuals and groups as a means of averting this war and finding a peaceful solution.
There are many possibilities for this.
The latest proposals put forward in Europe point in this direction.
There is one point I would like to address and one prefatory remark I would like to make in order to make Mr Poettering's speech comprehensible.
This House is perhaps not aware that we had elections in Germany on 22 September last year.
They were won by Gerhard SchrÃ¶der and not by Mr Stoiber.
That is something with which Mr Poettering cannot yet come to terms, and he believes that his speeches in this Parliament will bring about Mr SchrÃ¶der's downfall in Germany.
He can carry on believing that, but I do not believe that this House is particularly interested.
We have quite different problems with which we should be getting to grips.
One of those problems is that with the candidate countries.
I think we have to make abundantly clear to the future members of the European Union the importance of the principle of solidarity, which is in every respect equal to the Copenhagen criteria and all the other technocratic criteria by which - so to speak - their readiness for accession was measured.
I do not find it acceptable for these states, at this point in time, to make affirmations of solidarity, although I too welcome solidarity with the United States of America and have nothing against it.
What is of primary importance, though, is solidarity with the European Union, which is to accept them as Member States and has made massive efforts in order to do so.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a great deal is being said at them moment about Europe being divided.
I believe that never has Europe been so united at the level of its peoples as it is today in rejecting this war in Iraq.
Opinion in all the Member States and in the candidate countries is between 80% and 90% opposed to war.
And I wonder how Mr Poettering, whom I have known for twenty years now, can make himself so remote from the opinions of his own people.
(Applause)
Mr President, while the drums of war are rumbling, Europe is quarrelling.
We are quarrelling with each other.
We are quarrelling with the United States.
It is incredibly tragic to see how the splendid ambitions of a common European foreign policy are slowly crumbling.
Disagreement in NATO's Security Council is genuinely unfortunate now that we no doubt need so badly to stand together The only winner as a result of this disagreement is Saddam Hussein.
The losers are the EU, NATO, the UN and relations with the United States, which are being considerably weakened.
The rift may have incredibly serious consequences, and the different initiatives now coming out of the various capital cities will be of no use if they are not coordinated.
Competition does not help in these circumstances.
Rather, cooperation is required.
As a passionate Europhile, I am ashamed of the EU's impotence.
The net is closing in on Saddam Hussein.
The world's patience is running out.
It is he, and he only, that can prevent war.
It is Iraq, and not the UN, that must demonstrate that there are no weapons of mass destruction in the country.
Resolution 1441 is crystal clear on that point.
On Friday, Dr Hans Blix and the inspectors will produce a new report.
In his latest report, Doctor Blix points to the Iraqi dictator's insufficient willingness to cooperate.
Friday's report will therefore be very important.
If Doctor Blix and his colleagues need more time, they must be given it.
It is the Security Council that must then decide what is to happen.
The anti-UN attitude adopted by the German Chancellor is deeply regrettable.
This is not a matter of German domestic politics, but a matter concerning the whole of Europe.
The UN needs our support at this difficult time.
Instead of having a go at the candidate countries, Mr Sakellariou, a little self-criticism would be in order.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish you luck at Monday's meeting and with your attempt to unite the Member States.
Perhaps it is too late, but it is the last chance for the EU to re-establish its rather tarnished reputation.
Good luck!
Mr President, I was also part of a delegation from the Verts/ALE Group which went to Iraq last week, and we would like to say to those eminent Members of Parliament who criticised the visit that it was an important and timely initiative for peace, during which we also had occasion to criticise the Iraqi Government in no uncertain terms and call for the resignation of Saddam Hussein.
There is genuine desire for peace in Iraq.
It is a country devastated by sanctions, with teachers and university professors earning as little as USD 10 per month and 3 000 children a month dying of malnutrition and the lack of essential medicine.
If war finally breaks out there, the only means through which the country presently survives - the Oil for Food programme - will come to an end and throw the country into massive chaos.
It will create 900 000 refugees - those are not my figures, they are figures produced by the United Nations - who will flee, not to America, but to countries in the Middle East and Europe, creating an unprecedented humanitarian aid disaster.
If the human tragedy unfolding before us can be resolved peacefully - and I am heartened by the initiative of several countries now, calling for more staff resources and more time for the weapons inspectors and for the possible intervention of a UN peace keeping force - then surely that is the only alternative before us.
If weapons inspectors can avoid the deaths of half a million civilians, then that is surely the only logical course of action we can consider.
This imminent war is also about human rights and democracy in Iraq.
I visited a Kurdish refugee camp in Makhtur in northern Iraq, where 10 000 refugees from Turkey are captives in their own camp.
They are allowed to leave the camp only under strict surveillance.
The latest understanding between America and Turkey, ceding control over the whole of the devolved Kurdish territory in the north of Iraq, is a nightmare scenario in which the Kurds will again face persecution and attack.
How long can the international community allow the continued suffering of the Kurdish people?
Democracy must apply to all in any new Iraqi administration: to the Kurds, the Shias and the Turkmens and, of course, to the Iraqis themselves.
But it must be achieved through peaceful means, not through the bombing and killing of half a million defenceless men, women and children.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this sad business of Iraq has many aspects.
We have already mentioned a great many of them, but what strikes me at this stage is the incredible power of propaganda, and in particular of the process of demonisation.
Throughout the world today there are many men and women who believe, probably entirely sincerely, that Saddam Hussein is threatening the peace of the world, or even, as Mr Poettering said just now - and if the situation were not so dramatic it would be amusing - that Saddam Hussein is starving his people, whereas the truth is exactly the opposite and is so simple that one is almost ashamed to have to spell it out: it is the American and British Governments which for years have imposed a terrible embargo on people who are reduced to living, or rather surviving, in a ghetto.
Consequently, Iraq is a country which has been drained of blood and which is now quite incapable of fighting any sort of war.
Karl Ritter, who headed the inspection mission that ended in 1998, assured us that it was impossible that Iraq could be in a position to build any weapon of mass destruction whatsoever.
I repeat, the propaganda must have been very powerful to make us keep on swallowing one impossible lie after another.
Then again, even if Iraq were armed, what right would we have to deprive it of all means of defending itself?
This is the second thing that propaganda has achieved, namely to make us lose sight of one of the conditions for world order, that is a world of sovereign nations who cooperate with one another and are well-balanced.
No, the arming of Iraq is no more dangerous than that of other nations, and in particular that of its neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria, who are not necessarily motivated by the best of intentions.
I believe, quite simply, that we do not have the right to disarm Iraq any more than we have the right to disarm any other country, as General de Gaulle reminded us in 1963 when he refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
Another thing that propaganda has achieved is to make us believe that what it calls the international community has the right to topple a regime, which is absolutely contrary to international law and even - and this is my final remark, Mr President - contrary to the most fundamental truth in the world, which is the liberty of nations.
I hope that over the course of this century we shall gradually become aware of this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many people are today discovering the indescribable misery that has been created among the Iraqi population over the last ten years by the embargo.
We have tried to explain this to Parliament, in over thirty speeches in public session, but we have tried in vain.
Yet it is not too late to stop the infernal machine which, having caused the collapse of the CFSP and created discord within the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance, is now threatening the peace of the world.
War, the scourge of humanity, was outlawed by civilised nations and the League of Nations and then the United Nations Organization made it their principal objective to re-establish and protect peace.
Only legitimate defence can justify having recourse to arms.
Who can really believe that Iraq, a small country which has been bled dry and ruined, could threaten the United States and Great Britain, which are a hundred times or a thousand times more powerful?
Iraq has been summoned to prove its innocence, but we know that that is a diabolical demand, because in law it is for the accuser to prove guilt.
Contemptible, discreditable processes have been used to justify this aggression.
Mr Blair dared to present as evidence to the House of Commons a document stolen from a student and dating from ten years ago.
Colin Powell, too, authenticated it before the Security Council.
Even when their deception was discovered, neither of them drew the obvious conclusion, namely resignation.
If, despite the opposition of their people, this premeditated crime is committed, then let the war criminals be condemned, and let the blood of the children of Iraq be on their hands.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Le Pen is applying the yardstick in not quite the right way.
If anyone is a mass murderer, it is Saddam Hussein; of that there is no doubt.
The question is by what means he may be disarmed.
We have to make clear the necessity of using every possibility of a peaceful solution, no matter how difficult that may be in the days that remain to us.
I am very grateful to the Greek Presidency of the Council for having, despite the behaviour of many Member States of the European Union over recent weeks and months, summoned a special summit, in order that, in what one almost has to call a free-for-all in the European Union, we may seize the opportunity to pause for a moment and consider where there might be common ground, where we can still join in playing our part, in order to make a positive contribution.
I hope that they will be supported by many Members of this House and that Monday's summit will meet with the success it deserves, so that Europe does not end up looking foolish on the sidelines of this dispute.
I think it is important to see that there must be no emotional reflex actions.
Although historical parallels are never a good idea, I sometimes get the feeling that we are in something like the summer of 1914, and so I believe that we all have to engage in renewed dialogue with each other, so that we Europeans, being united on the essentials, can take our place in the negotiations on the final United Nations resolution, which must aim to make good use of every opportunity for peace, whilst at the same time making it clear that Saddam Hussein has to be disarmed.
If the relevant United Nations resolution makes it possible for this to be done by force if need be - but only if we avoid unilateralism - then we have a chance of doing this.
But the use of force can be avoided only if Europeans present a united front.
All those who have violated this unity have also thrown away Europe's chance of playing a part in this dispute.
Mr President, on the issue of Iraq, Europe is not divided. Its governments are, but its public opinion is not.
As we all know, the majority of European public opinion is united against war.
So the discussion on the division of Europe, in relation to the CFSP, must take this aspect into account.
And, incidentally, the European citizens should take this into account when casting their votes in the forthcoming elections.
However, there is an aspect which worries me particularly and that is the high number of governments of European candidate countries who have joined an operation which, rather than reinforcing European values and principles, supports the warlike approach of a non-European superpower whose values, such as the death penalty and the rejection of the International Criminal Court, are not our values.
Having said that, I also have faith in the public opinion of those candidate countries.
I am less optimistic when it comes to the gulf separating us from the United States, or rather the gulf which the Bush Administration is widening every day.
I believe it is a bad sign that some sections of the so-called 'liberal' press in the United States are tending to jump on the war bandwagon and that in doing so it is furthermore using insults which are not supposedly worthy of it.
Thus, regrettably, we have recently read this sentence in the New York Times: 'Only an imbecile or perhaps a Frenchman could be insensitive to Colin Powell's arguments'.
Well, I would declare myself French and insensitive.
This francophobia is being cultivated alongside germanophobia.
It has just been said insultingly of the other unfortunate partner from the old Europe: 'The Germans do not play any important role in international decision-making', said by Richard Perle, one of Minister for War Rumsfeld's tough advisers.
Well, in view of this I would declare myself to be German and a Social Democrat.
(Applause)
In my opinion, though, the greatest and most significant blunder is from Richard Boucher, spokesman for the State Department.
As you know, Bin Laden has just said in a very timely manner that, in the face of the aggression being prepared, all Muslims should support the Iraqis, despite the fact that the latter are socialists and apostates.
Rather than coming to the opposite conclusion, Mr Boucher not only states that this proves the links between Al Qaeda and Iraq, but he also adds: 'We have already said that this is a fight by civilisation to protect the civilised countries'.
So it now turns out, Mr President, dear friends, that the Bush Administration sponsors war between civilisations.
(Applause)
Mr President, the risk of terrorism is omnipresent now.
The dull and brooding presence of sudden, unanticipated and violent death hangs over military and civilians alike in all our nations.
Links have been found recently between the Al Qaeda network and pro-Saddam forces fighting the free Kurdish people in northern Iraq.
However, a much better established and older terrorist organisation has been working inside Iraq since 1986: the MKO, or MEK as they are known inside the USA.
The MKO have thousands of members inside Iraq and thousands outside, financed, equipped, armed and trained by the Iraqi army and fully engaged, militarily at least, since 1986 in all of Saddam's many wars.
The USA froze MEK assets in 1994, declaring the group under its many aliases to be an international terrorist organisation.
The EU followed the US example as late as 2001, yet last week the New York Times published a full-page advertisement for the MEK, using the names and photographs of members of the US Congress and claiming their support.
Our recent debates on Iraq have been attended by known members of MKO.
These people are a threat to world security.
Their organisation strikes silently but with lethal impact.
This is Saddam's private international terrorist army, working against us all.
Whatever our differences on the future treatment of Iraq, for the sake of our citizens and global safety, I urge that far greater security attention be paid to the MKO.
For war or no war, with or without a war, the criminals who make up the MKO continually kill and destroy the innocent among us.
Mr President, last week I went to New York with a delegation from this Parliament, and there we had, I must say, impressive discussions with Dr Hans Blix and Kofi Annan, but we, as a delegation, were also witness to a shameful performance in which four ambassadors from EU countries that are members of the Security Council made not the slightest effort to hide their differences.
That was humiliating, but was it inevitable?
It is not clear.
I know that it will be extremely difficult to reach agreement at next Monday's summit of European leaders, but I refuse to accept that this is inevitable.
There are the French proposals to increase the number and power of the inspectors.
Next Friday, there will probably be a cautiously positive report from Dr Hans Blix and Mohamed El Baradei in favour of doing just that.
I would therefore make an urgent plea to the governments of Great Britain, Spain and Italy to stop playing the role of yes men to the United States and to at last seize the very real chances we still have to disarm Iraq by peaceful means.
I urge those same governments not to turn their backs on Europe.
Many Members have said this already this afternoon: all the opinion polls in all the European countries point to one thing: it is not the French government, not the German government and not the Belgian government that have become isolated; instead it is Tony Blair, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar and Silvio Berlusconi that have lost touch with European reality.
To the Eurosceptics in this Parliament, and also to the United States, who are quite happy about this discord among the EU Member States and see it as proof that it is unlikely that anything will ever come of one joint European policy, I would say this: this Parliament is a European institution that, in its pronouncement in its last resolution, gave a voice to the vast majority of the European population and that voice says 'no war'.
I sincerely hope, therefore, that, next Monday, that voice of the vast majority of the European population resounds in the heads and hearts of the European Heads of Government, too.
Mr President, UN Resolution 1441 must be complied with.
Some say that this is exclusively Saddam Hussein's responsibility.
They are placing the fate of the world in the hands of a psychopathic dictator.
We too have a responsibility, namely to work out how much cooperation is required here and now in order to prevent a war.
When we were in Baghdad last week, the weapons inspectors made it quite clear that, if they were to continue to be present, Saddam Hussein could neither develop new weapons nor use those he already has.
We must give the weapons inspectors more time.
We must support the Franco-German proposal, and we must do so partly on humanitarian grounds.
UNHCR has drawn attention to the fact that 100 000 Iraqis would die in the first 48 hours of a war.
Seven million people would be without food, and 22 million debilitated Iraqis would be without clean drinking water.
There would be a danger of civil war.
Dare we take responsibility for all this by demanding that UN resolutions be complied with to the letter here and now?
I also think that this debate is too serious to be subordinated to domestic policy.
Mr President, last Monday's joint declaration by France, Germany and Russia begins with a sentence which I believe everyone will approve of.
The three parties confirm that the disarmament of Iraq, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions, is the common objective of the international community and it should be completed as soon as possible.
This sentence contains four affirmations: yes Saddam Hussein is armed, yes he is (presumably) dangerous, yes he must be disarmed and yes this should be done as quickly as possible.
If this disarmament is to be effective, we must not let ourselves become bogged down in the wait-and-see policy and the beating about the bush that we have seen in the last ten years.
If we are to avoid becoming bogged down, however, there is only one new argument, and that is the threat of armed intervention.
It is absolutely essential that this argument should remain credible.
We must do nothing to destroy its credibility if we want the discussions to make the progress that we are hoping for.
This is why I believe deeply, Mr President, that the apparently different strategies of the countries of Europe and the United States are complementary rather than contradictory.
We would do better to harness this complementary aspect if we are to avoid playing Saddam Hussein's game.
Mr President, we are glad that the European Council has been called, as my Group has demanded.
I imagine that the Greek Presidency will be holding very intense contacts in order to propose a common position, because intentions are not sufficient.
But it did not take this crisis to demonstrate that one of the gaps that reform of the Treaties must confront is the lack of instruments to promote the common foreign and security policy.
In fact, it is now exactly two years and seven months, Mr Nielson, since the Commission committed itself to adopting an initiative to respond to Parliament's proposals on common European diplomacy.
We are still waiting.
Meanwhile, the Member States have taken positions.
I believe that the Franco-German axis is very positive in terms of promoting European integration, but with 15 Members, and particularly with 25, nobody, by definition, can assume they speak for the European Union, and neither do I believe - as some do - that the European identity must by definition be in opposition to the United States.
At this point the European institutions should take concrete initiatives - and I have not seen any - within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean relations, because the danger does not come from Islam but from the Iraqi regime, and also, despite all the difficulties, initiatives to re-launch the battered Middle East peace process.
And since there has been reference to European history, that history shows that complacency, the failure to meet responsibilities in relation to despotic dictators, for whom expansionist ambitions are intrinsic, may be more comfortable in the short term and also more popular - there were no opinion polls in 1938 but now there are - but sooner or later they cost us dearly in terms of freedom and human lives.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what happens next week will surely not be about playing Europe off against America, but about countering the Bush Doctrine with an unambiguous European position.
The Bush Doctrine is founded on the assumption of the unilateral use of military might, underpinned by a commitment to preventive warfare.
We in Europe must affirm our commitment to a multilateral approach, in other words, to the United Nations.
We in Europe must start by using every means other than military force.
We in Europe reject the theory of preventive strikes against potential dangers.
We affirm our commitment to containing them, above all when this approach has a chance of success.
What does that mean in terms of Iraq?
I believe it to mean that we all, out of profound conviction, abhor this regime in Iraq and its inhumanity.
Everyone living in Iraq has the right to democratic government.
Anyone who campaigns - as I do - for the rights of the Kurds in Turkey cannot fail to campaign for the rights of Kurds in Iraq.
Yet no one country and no alliance - be it an alliance of the willing or of the unwilling and dependent - may claim for itself the right to simply get rid of disagreeable governments, and, moreover, to use massive force in doing so - not, above all, when a policy of containment has a chance of succeeding.
Everyone living in the region and beyond it has a justified interest in weapons of mass destruction not ending up in the hands of Saddam Hussein.
Is it not possible, though, to use inspections, surveillance flights, and other non-violent means to prevent him from getting his hands on dangerous weapons?
Europe must surely not allow itself to be characterised by the pursuit of a policy of non-resistance and appeasement in the face of the present dangers.
Is that, though, a reason for denying Europe the right to refuse to let fly with a war waged in the way that President Bush and Mr Rumsfeld want?
We Europeans contend particularly for democracy and the rule of law in the Arab world, but we do not do it with weapons in our hands.
Even 'old Europe' seeks a secure source of oil and gas, but do we therefore have the right to wage war for the sake of oil?
We do not!
If, moreover, doubt is cast on our clear and unequivocal commitment to the UN and to its resolutions, are we in this House not aware of how many UN resolutions have not been complied with?
Are we not aware that there is a UN resolution, relating to this region, that dates back to 1947 and has still not yet been complied with?
Even so, we are not willing to go to war, and rightly!
So I do believe that, yes, we are to help the United Nations get what it is entitled to.
Yes, we are to strive for all the resolutions to be complied with, but that must mean all the resolutions - those on Palestine as much as those on Iraq.
Then our position would be a truly European one.
(Loud applause)
Mr President, after both the First and Second World Wars, people demanded 'No More War!', and the international legislation drawn up in order to give this demand tangible form expressly incorporated a clearly defined ban on the use of force, making the use of it subordinate to the United Nations.
They expressly rejected any preventive war of aggression without United Nations approval.
Any preventive strike against Iraq on the part of America and Great Britain would, without a doubt, be in breach of international law, and its consequences for the Middle East, for the Arab world, but also for the world community as a whole, would be incalculable.
If one or more states arrogate to themselves the pre-eminent right to use force and take the law into their own hands, that amounts to unmitigated private warfare, the so-called law of the strong, one of the characteristics of which is that it breeds more private warfare.
Looking at things from this angle, the European Union must do everything possible to avert a unilateral war of aggression.
Europe's peoples have long known this, and now it is time for European politics to grasp it.
Mr President, I welcome this debate on the eve of Monday's Summit, for Europe must speak out for peace, in support of all initiatives which can prevent war in Iraq.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament, acting together, can help to bring about a change in the situation in Baghdad.
However, war can be avoided if Saddam Hussein leaves his country or if he can provide concrete evidence that he has destroyed all the prohibited weapons.
Thus far, the dictator has failed to comply with the United Nations' requests formulated in the 1991 resolution.
If Iraq had behaved like South Africa, Belarus or Kazakhstan, we would not be in this tragic situation now.
The Baghdad regime is guilty of a major violation of the will of the UN.
Iraq has, in practice, failed to comply.
I wonder, and I put it to you, whether it is still possible to prevent conflict.
It may be, but Europe must stand united, the international community must stand united.
Indeed, the Iraqi regime will use each division, each sign of weakening, to attempt to strengthen its own positions.
That is why the Union must speak with a single voice in order to bring about peace, but also in order to ensure the safety of the citizens, who are still at the mercy of terrorist organisations which are threatening to use bacteriological and chemical weapons which may still be in Iraq.
That is why I support the position calling upon the institutions and governments of Europe to follow three guidelines.
Firstly, to strengthen relations between the countries of the Union in order to achieve a common position.
Secondly, to prevent divisions between the United States and the European Union, and, in this regard, I agree with the Italian politician who said that Europe cannot exist if it stands apart from or in opposition to the United States of America. Thirdly, to make every endeavour to preserve the credibility of the multilateral organisations, NATO and the UN.
In conclusion, Mr President, not forcing Saddam Hussein to respect the United Nations resolution is tantamount to divesting the Security Council of its authority.
This is the line being taken by the Italian Government, which will be at the helm of the Union during the second half of the year.
I feel this is another reason why we must pay careful attention to and support the peace-keeping initiatives emanating from Rome.
Mr President, I have to say that I was more than a little surprised to hear Commissioner Nielson's opening remarks.
He said that the poverty in Iraq at the moment is a result of the Iran-Iraq war, the Gulf war and ten years of international sanctions.
I heard no mention whatsoever that Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction to kill hundreds of thousands of his own people.
Nor was there any reference to the fact that Iraq has a corrupt dictatorship which represses freedom, stifles initiative and siphons off money that was intended for food and medicines for its own people under the oil-for-food programme, but is instead used by Saddam to build more of his own palaces.
We must be clear that the villain of this piece is Saddam Hussein - full stop!
Any weakening of that position will make war more, not less, likely.
Commissioner Nielson also said that this is not an institutional problem, but then he gave us an institutional solution.
He said that we could solve all these problems by more QMV.
QMV will not create the political will to have common policies.
We should have a common foreign and security policy - not a single policy but a common policy.
We all have our views on how it is that the common policy set in Copenhagen has suddenly somewhat disintegrated.
The French President is very good at the rhetoric of European cooperation, but not so good at the practical aspects and seems to think common policies apply to everyone but him.
Nonetheless, we must have a common policy.
That much is very clear.
Let us remind ourselves that Resolution 1441 states that Iraq is already in breach of UN resolutions and has been for over ten years and that any obstruction will lead to serious consequences.
We have to be united in accepting that those serious consequences will follow.
Any weakening of that position runs the risk of undermining world global security.
If we are to resolve this situation we need less name-calling and a more coherent approach.
Mr President, 12 years ago this month, we saw the cease-fire after the liberation of Kuwait.
In March 1991, UN Resolution 686 set out the conditions of the cease-fire.
In April 1991 UN Resolution 687 required Iraq to accept the internationally supervised destruction, removal or rendering harmless of all chemical and biological weapons, agents and components.
In August 1991, UN Resolution 707 condemned Iraq's non-compliance.
Now, after 12 years of flouted UN resolutions, 12 years of internal oppression and torture, 12 years of violence against the Kurds and Shi'ites of his own country, Saddam Hussein has been given a last chance.
And yet, unlike when we took action to rescue the Falklands, Kuwait and Bosnia, this time our constituents are uneasy and uncertain.
They see no unity of purpose among the governments of Europe.
They see Member States declining to comply with their Nato obligation to protect Turkey against the possibility of attack.
Their fears are confirmed that a European defence policy could be dangerous for Nato.
They do not know why action is being proposed, what is supposed to happen at the end of it and which countries might be next.
The guilt of Saddam Hussein is in effect being compounded by the failure of our leaders to explain.
My own Prime Minister, Mr Blair, has abysmally failed to persuade the British people.
He could not even persuade a single one of his own Labour MEPs to vote for his policy.
Unlike Iraq, we are democracies.
Unlike Saddam, Mr Blair, you cannot go to war without heeding the concerns of your own people.
It is time we set out the facts and destroyed the myths.
UN inspectors are not like a team of archaeologists excavating for ancient Mesopotamia in the sand.
It is not their task to play 'seek' to Saddam's 'hide'.
They are there to assess Saddam's evidence of how, when and where he has destroyed or handed over his weapons of mass destruction.
We do not need more inspectors.
Mr Blix has confirmed that.
We need compliance by Saddam Hussein.
Where are those precursor chemicals, the munitions?
Where are the tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agents: 1.5 tonnes of VX nerve agent, 10 milligrams of which on the skin results in rapid death?
I do not believe that any of us want war.
We want peace, but we want a peace that is free from the threat of terrorism.
Saddam Hussein needs to understand that either he complies in full with the UN resolutions or he risks plunging his own people, once again, into the suffering of war.
Mr President, Parliament is today being called upon to debate a situation which, though it is beyond the borders of our continent, constitutes both a major risk to the unity of Europe and a full-scale test of our countries' capacity to assert their humanist values at an absolutely critical point in our history.
I do not want to understate the disagreements that we are seeing on the international scene, or the need to reach a rapid agreement, in Europe first and then in the United Nations, on the assessment of the risks which are actually facing us and of the diplomatic, political and military means by which we can protect ourselves against them.
It seems to me that most of the comments in the media are designed to appeal to the emotions rather than to provide an objective analysis of the situation.
The international community as a whole unanimously condemns the current Iraqi regime, its contempt for the most basic human rights, even those of its own people, and its consistent failure to comply with United Nations resolutions, even when it is not busy invading sovereign states.
It is against this background that the members of the United Nations, and primarily those of the Security Council, must work steadily towards a consensus on the best way of settling the Iraqi question.
In a civilised and democratic world, the world to which we are appealing and the world which the current Iraqi regime is denigrating and making a mockery of, the proper response to a situation of this kind could certainly be a military one, but only after all other possible solutions have been exhausted.
Before that, all reasonable solutions should be explored and attempted, or at least that is the idea which we, the representatives of free and democratic countries, have the honour and the duty to recommend and to put into practice.
It seems to me to be pointless to compare the current situation with the situation in Europe in the thirties, to caricature the position of the United States, which is quite rightly coloured by the events of 11 September, or to focus attention on the differences of opinion between Europeans, who are split between intensified diplomatic action before any assault and immediate military intervention without any additional delay.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a question of peace or of war, of the life or the death of many human beings.
That is what is at stake here, and it leaves little room for taking up positions which are demagogic, precipitate or tactical.
Let us all, together, show our sang-froid and our capacity for reflection, and we shall overcome our differences.
Mr President, with war looming, the European Union is displaying discord that is viewed with disbelief and bewilderment by our citizens.
The most important question, of course, is: is war inevitable?
Anyone who has observed Saddam Hussein at all over the past 15 years cannot escape the conclusion that what we are dealing with here is one of the most dangerous heads of government in the world.
This is a man who, out of self-interest, has attacked a peaceful neighbouring country. This is a man who has used poison gas on rebel Kurdish villages, thereby killing thousands of men, women and children.
This is a man who permanently terrorises the south of his country, with its Shi-ite population. This is a man who, in spite of the poverty of his country, Commissioner Nielson, has built up an enormous and very costly arsenal of not only conventional, but also chemical and biological, and possibly even nuclear weapons, with which to permanently threaten and blackmail other countries, and to endanger world peace.
Anyone who reads today's article in The Wall Street Journal by Khidhir Hamza, a former head of Iraq's nuclear programme, need have no doubt about the presence of those weapons and about what Saddam Hussein intends to do with them.
This is a man who has amassed enormous wealth at the expense of his people and is also still proud of having personally carried out executions.
To my mind, it is naive to go looking for weapons in that large country with 200 inspectors.
Do you know that, in recent years, 6 000 inspectors have gone looking for weapons?
Is it not very easy, given that the country has so many inaccessible mountainous regions, to hide weapons of this kind in caves?
I am in favour of a second Security Council resolution provided that the solution to the problem is not delayed further.
But the position of France, Germany and Belgium in this as dissidents in the European camp is terribly worrying.
Why have you not made the greatest efforts to agree on a single line?
Sit yourselves down together, as the Ministers for Agriculture did earlier, until the white smoke comes out.
I think that it is an excellent idea to actually get together on Monday; I sincerely hope that the European leaders can then iron out their differences and that they do not embarrass the European population and us again.
I do not have so much need to find fault with the United States: we should be clear about who the real instigator is of all the trouble, that is, Saddam Hussein, and not George Bush.
Mr President, we all know that the European population is clear about what it wants.
It wants a peaceful solution to the conflict in Iraq.
I assume that our Heads of Government also have that in view, all of them.
The question to which the European population would like to hear an answer from its leaders goes without saying. It is the question as to whether all means have been employed to avert war in Iraq, and/or the scope for diplomacy has been completely exhausted, before a decision is taken to proceed with military action.
These days, there is a lot of criticism of the United States to be heard, and criticism is not a crime, of course, provided that, as our group leader just said, one does not confuse cause and effect.
But criticism of the United States will not suffice these days in Europe: we must also have the courage to do some soul-searching ourselves.
We are then faced with the question as to whether Europe has done its best for diplomacy in that 5 out of 15 or 8 out of 25 countries have taken up their own position, away from the others.
We must also ask ourselves whether our diplomatic power of persuasion has been strengthened when three countries take decisions that do not even anticipate a decision to go to war, but which do put solidarity within NATO out of kilter.
They are all serious questions.
If crises are opportunities, and let us hope that they are, I think that we should perhaps calmly wait to hear what the weapons inspectors have to tell us on Friday in the Security Council, and I think that we should be happy that on Monday we have a European summit.
We should encourage them not only to deliberate but also to reach clear, unanimous conclusions.
We should encourage the Security Council to take decisions that do what has to be done in Iraq, but in such a way that the cure is not worse than the disease.
In the long term, we must not lose hope, and we must keep pushing, in the Convention, for decision-making mechanisms which make an effective foreign and security policy possible and which also give us a military footing, such that we acquire power and become a worthy and valuable partner of the United States within NATO and the United Nations.
Mr President, as everyone knows, the Portuguese Prime Minister signed the letter from the European heads of state and government because he believes it is crucial to ensure that Iraq disarms and complies with Resolution 1441.
The Portuguese Members of the European People's Party unreservedly support this view because this is a clear position underpinned by the political tradition of the European democracies, based on the transatlantic alliance with the democracy represented by the US and also, it should be remembered, by Canada, Australia and many other democratic countries in the world.
It comes as no surprise that today this approach has the support of the overwhelming majority of European countries, within the European Union, amongst those who will be joining it in the forthcoming round of enlargement, and also amongst other countries on the continent.
Nevertheless, recent events that have led to a crisis in NATO and to the danger of a veto in the Security Council by Member States of the Union pose a serious risk to the unity of Europe.
What we are seeing is that there can be no common foreign policy based on anti-American prejudice and on complacency towards the threat from dictators who present a danger to world peace, such as Saddam Hussein.
We should, therefore, bear in mind some aspects that should not be forgotten:
firstly, Europe does not have strategic defence capacity against the new forms of international terrorism that are bound up with the States that support them;
secondly, the only strategic defence body of which Europeans countries are members is NATO.
If this body goes into crisis, it is Europe that will suffer most at the hands of its enemies, more than the United States, for example, because Europe cannot defend itself.
The crisis in NATO will make any common defence policy for the European Union impossible;
thirdly, for the enlargement countries, with their recent experience of totalitarian regimes, security concerns are vital.
Provoking a crisis in NATO will be profoundly damaging to these countries and will cause them to have confidence only in bilateral strategic alliances with the United States, outside the framework of the European Union and of NATO.
It would be extremely bad if these countries' freedom to take political decisions suffered because they do not agree with some, and I repeat some, countries of the European Union.
Lastly, the effect of a crisis in NATO will isolate the Europeans, and will reinforce the United States' tendency to act unilaterally.
If the United States and its allies, including the majority of European countries, were to embark on military action in order to ensure compliance with Resolution 1441 without the explicit support of the European Union and with NATO in deadlock, the damage caused to European alliances will be very difficult to resolve.
This is my request to the Council and the Commission; please use the little time available to you to prevent action being taken to force Iraq to comply with the Resolution without there being unity amongst the countries of Europe.
Mr President, I have nothing much to add to what I said at the start of the debate.
I should like to thank the groups and speakers who supported the Greek Presidency's initiative to convene the Council next Monday.
I have taken very careful note of the positions, thoughts, concerns and various points raised.
This is a major issue and every proposal has merit.
I should like to say that we are considering our next move and our next move, as everyone has acknowledged, will be next Friday, when the Presidency prepares for the Council on Monday and, of course, on Monday itself.
The European Union also needs to look on Monday, not as a last chance for Saddam but as a chance for us to decide what to do next and how we can best use and shoulder our responsibilities.
Also, irrespective of the outcome or the decisions taken, we also need to look at what problems will arise in the humanitarian and economic sectors.
There may be serious ramifications and we need to be prepared for that.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
The majority of the members of the Security Council seem to want to give peace another chance.
They prefer to disarm Iraq by peaceful means, using the weapons inspectors.
More pressure must be put on Iraq to cooperate.
Parliament has contributed to this through its resolution and by a number of MEPs travelling to Baghdad to explain our position.
A majority in Parliament is on the same wavelength, therefore, as the majority of the public.
It is remarkable that the governments of some Member States would rather take the side of the United States than that of their own citizens.
Even Turkey, traditionally a staunch supporter of the United States, considers war to be very risky.
And then people say that France, Germany and Belgium are isolated!
Would it not be the US, rather, that was isolated if they could not bring to bear a whole arsenal of means of coercion?
It is not enough to make every effort to stave off a military invasion of Iraq.
Peaceful means must indeed be used to bring Iraq not only to disarm, but also to change, to respect human rights, to respect the right to life and respect for the diverse peoples and cultures within the Iraqi borders and to respect for all the peoples in the region.
(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)
It now seems to be an established fact that the Government of the United States is determined to go to war against Iraq, whatever the Security Council decides.
With or without the authorisation of the Security Council, this war is unjustifiable.
Of course we must hope that reason will prevail within the Security Council and that, if there is a war, it will be formally contrary to international legality.
Those thirty or so of us who have just been to Iraq were able to see for ourselves the state of material and moral dilapidation of the country, trapped as it is between a ludicrous and bloody dictatorship and the sanctions imposed by the international community.
The Iraqi army is merely a shadow of its former self, and is formidable only in the hallucinations of the American President.
What concerns the oil-obsessed Government of the United States is of course control of the black gold, and not the weapons of mass destruction which, as the experts know full well, Iraq does not possess.
This war will be another crushing blow for people who are already suffering greatly, particularly the Kurdish population.
Among those people it will give rise to lasting and justified hatred of the West, and will cause innumerable tragedies.
This crisis shows how far Europe still has to go before it becomes anything other than an integrated economic area.
(Written statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)
The next item is the debate on oral questions to the Council and the Commission (B5-2/2003 and ?5-3/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 2002 Annual debate on an area of freedom, security and justice.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have this opportunity today of presenting the results of the work of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in 2002 to the European Parliament.
The Greek Presidency attaches particular importance to the role of the European Parliament, to dialogue with it and to the need for a common policy on issues of concern to us.
I should like at this point to thank Baroness Ludford, whose oral question has provided the basis for today's debate.
The Council worked systematically during 2002 towards creating an area of freedom, security and justice, mainly on the basis of the guidelines laid down by the European Council in Tampere.
Within that framework, the Council adopted a set of acts on police and judicial cooperation on criminal and civil matters.
In all, over 100 acts were adopted, including regulations, framework decisions, decisions and joint positions, resolutions, recommendations and other acts.
Parliament itself made a telling contribution to this work through the consultation procedure and with its excellent resolutions.
Of the acts adopted, I should like to make special mention of Eurojust, the new Union institution whose job is to step up the fight against the most serious forms of crime, and the framework decisions adopted on the European arrest warrant, extradition procedures between Member States and the fight against terrorism.
I should also mention the new European Refugee Fund, the new Eurodac system for comparing fingerprints, the minimum specifications governing the provision of temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of refugees, the integrated plan for combating illegal immigration and illegal movements of people within the European Union, the plan for guarding our external borders, the common list of third countries whose nationals must have a visa and the complementary list of third countries whose nationals do not need a visa and the standard form for a residence permit for third-country nationals.
Finally, in civil and commercial law, political agreement has been reached on a system of judicial assistance on parental care in order to protect the best interests of the child.
That brings me to the questions, not that this list is by any means complete.
An area of freedom, security and justice has to be founded on the principles of transparency and democratic control and I can assure you that the Council's actions will continue to be predicated on maximum possible cooperation with the other institutions of the European Union and constructive dialogue with civil society.
Within this framework, the Council works with the European Parliament, seeking its opinion in the early stages of work and duly applying all the consultation rules set out in the Treaties.
The Presidency attends Parliament in order to present its programme of work at the beginning of each term of office and the results of the Justice and Home Affairs Councils.
I would also remind you that the Council replies to all written and oral questions put to it by the honourable Members.
At the same time, informal contacts are constantly being strengthened, especially at the meetings of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms or at informal ministerial meetings.
Finally, this cooperation will be strengthened still further by the Treaty of Nice, which now applies the codecision procedure to a number of matters which come within our jurisdiction.
In reply to the second question, the Council does not believe that adopting Community acts on sensitive justice and home affairs issues is taking an inordinate amount of time.
First of all, the number and content of the acts adopted is proof positive of the volume of work we have carried out in order to create an area of freedom, security and justice.
However, the question of speed also needs to be placed within the context of how carefully each issue is examined and the fact that all the procedures are adhered to, especially the consultation procedure and, from now on, the codecision procedure, so that the Council can take due account of the opinion of the European Parliament.
That is why opinions are indeed sometimes requested by fairly tight deadlines, so that acts can be adopted at Council level as quickly as possible.
In reply to the third question, the Council would point out that its work is carried out within the framework of the rules laid down in the Treaties.
For example, immigration issues are addressed under Title ?V of the Treaty establishing the European Community, while crimes by persons aiding and abetting illegal immigration are dealt with under the rules set out in Title V? of the Treaty on European Union.
Because the issue is so complex, a certain procedural speed is required, but that derives from the Treaty itself and is not of the Council's making.
As you know, the Council has no authority to amend the Treaty.
We are, of course, monitoring the work being carried out in this respect by the Convention on the future of Europe, which may well open up new prospects; we hope it does.
Until then, I can assure you that all of us in the Council are endeavouring to promote cohesive, rational policy, and are demonstrating the necessary political will.
In reply to the fourth question, the Council would point out that creating an area of freedom, security and justice is an ongoing project, resulting in increasingly close, progressive cooperation between the Member States, as they exercise their authority, and the institutions of the European Union.
The initiatives taken by the Member States within this framework, either alone or jointly, prove exactly how useful that right is.
You only have to think, for example, of the initiative submitted by 5 Member States which resulted in the creation of Eurojust, a Community institution which plays an important role in the fight against serious forms of crime.
Similarly, the Council's framework decision on the status of victims during criminal proceedings was initiated by one Member State.
The regulation on insolvency proceedings initiated by two Member States finally brought about a result after a full thirty years of discussion within the Community framework.
The regulation on obtaining evidence is another such success story.
The initiatives taken by the Member States, most of which have been adopted, have helped to make justice and home affairs a particularly dynamic sector and have been a useful complement to the valuable initiatives taken by the Commission.
In reply to the fifth question, under the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Council will be required five years after the Treaty enters into force, i.e. in 2004, to reach a unanimous decision, following consultations with the European Parliament, on the codecision procedure for visas, asylum and immigration and on judicial cooperation in civil matters.
The Council has not yet been asked to decide on the specific issue raised in the question.
Consequently, this is a question the Council will have an opportunity to decide on in the future, taking account of the opinion of the European Parliament.
For the rest, as you know, the Treaty of Nice, which has already taken effect, makes provision for the codecision procedure to apply to a number of issues and the Council will be applying these new rules to the letter.
In reply to the sixth question, as I said earlier, the Council has made considerable progress on asylum and immigration with a view to applying the programme adopted in Tampere.
The European Council in Seville, on 21 and 22 June 2002, took an important step towards implementing the Tampere programme.
As far as the timing is concerned, the Council has every intention of keeping to the deadlines, where possible, given the complexity of this subject and the fact that events have undoubtedly altered the general perception of the political and legislative environment.
In reply to the final question, as it has stressed on numerous occasions, the Council respects and applies the principles laid down in the Treaty, especially the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
However, the possible inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the new Treaty is an issue which does not come within the jurisdiction granted to the Council under the Treaties.
In reply to the second part of the question concerning work on common principles governing procedural guarantees for defendants, the Council knows that the Commission has issued a working paper and is preparing a new text.
When we receive a proposal, we shall examine it carefully and ask the European Parliament to give its opinion on the matter, allowing it adequate time to do so.
However, this last question gives me the opportunity to conclude with a number of the Greek Presidency's thoughts on the question of human rights in the judicial sector.
We are convinced of, and our initiatives will be geared towards, the principle that respect for human rights and the rule of law is the cornerstone of the European Union and the ultimate justification for all its policies.
At the same time, we need balanced, global policies.
These two principles are inextricably linked.
I believe that, if the importance of fundamental freedoms is overlooked, there will be a visible risk of our policy becoming fragmented, unilateral and irrational.
This is particularly important in the area in which our Council acts, where the issue of the balance between freedom, on the one hand, and security, on the other, arises on a daily basis.
It would be a mistake to assume that these two virtues are mutually exclusive.
I have pointed out on numerous occasions, and I do so again now, that more security does not mean and must not mean less freedom.
With these thoughts in mind, the Greek Presidency has introduced a new framework decision on the mutual recognition by Member States of final judgments in criminal cases.
We cannot take a unilateral approach to judicial assistance.
We also have to make sure that defendants cannot be prosecuted for the same offence in more than one Member State.
The same principle governs the question of minimum guarantees for suspects and defendants.
We are introducing the European arrest warrant, we are taking measures to harmonise substantive criminal law and we must not ignore the question of guarantees for all those affected by these measures, especially suspects and defendants, which is why we have already included the question of minimum procedural guarantees for suspects and defendants on the agenda of the informal Council due to meet in Greece at the end of March.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to close by thanking you once again for giving me this opportunity to update the European Parliament on progress in the area of justice and security and to assure you that I am looking forward to your assistance and cooperation so that we can meet the expectations of European society and its citizens.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the annual debate on an area of freedom, security and justice must be seen against the broader backdrop of the progress that has actually been made in the course of the last year, as a result of the commitment of the successive Spanish and Danish Presidencies. This debate must also be seen in the context of the forthcoming enlargement and of the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe.
First of all, I wish to congratulate Baroness Ludford on the quality of the questions she has put to the Commission and to answer the first of these by saying that the Commission still takes the view that the future Treaty on the area of freedom, security and justice should enshrine the principle of the Commission's exclusive right of legislative initiative.
Indeed, we feel that the transfer of the majority of legislative aspects to the codecision process will only be coherent if we retain the framework of the Commission's right of legislative initiative.
Giving the right of legislative initiative to a Member State or to some Member States will always cause problems and confusion in implementing common codecision rules.
I would add that the Commission's right of initiative is today the most appropriate, precisely because it is exercised in the framework of a set of interinstitutional programmes agreed with the European Parliament and with the European Council itself.
With regard to the second question, dealing with the priority given to combating terrorism and illegal immigration, the Commission believes that these were not only priorities in 2002, but will also be priorities in 2003.
The European Union has demonstrated its ability to respond to the terrorist threat by adopting two important instruments: the European arrest warrant and the framework decision on combating terrorism.
From the Commission's point of view, the final text of these two legislative initiatives will ensure a healthy balance between the objectives intended to facilitate investigations and prosecutions against terrorists, on the one hand, and, on the other, the protection of defendants' rights, but I shall return to this issue a little later.
The Seville European Council gave new impetus to speeding up all aspects of implementing the programme adopted in Tampere with a view to creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
New priority has been given to measures intended to combat illegal immigration and to establish the common management of our external borders.
At the same time, however, the Seville Council also laid down objectives and timetables for adopting the other decisions in the field of asylum and immigration policy laid down in the Tampere Council conclusions.
The Commission responded quickly to this new priority by presenting its proposals for an integrated management system for external borders, that was generally well received by the Council and included in the action plan that was not only approved by the Council last June, but was also recently endorsed by the European Parliament in a resolution voted on last month.
This progress must of course be assessed in light of the timetable and programmes for measures established at Tampere.
Progress must also be in line with an approach that is balanced between the three components: freedom, security and justice.
The Commission emphasised once again in the last scoreboard, of 16 December 2002, that there are still delays in adopting asylum and immigration issues.
We hope that the Greek Presidency will, as the Minister has just stated, give a commitment to speeding up work on adopting this legislation within the framework laid down by the Seville European Council.
In relation to the fourth issue raised by Baroness Ludford, I wish to say that the Greek Presidency has given pride of place on its agenda to the debate on family reunification and on the status of long-term residents in the European Union, together with the directive that Parliament debated yesterday, on the entry of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and with the directive on the conditions of entry and residence for citizens from third countries for the purpose of study.
We will consequently have the basic legislative framework in the field of immigration policy that is being discussed in Council.
I would also add the initiative that the Commission will be adopting next month to present a communication focusing on the issue of integrating third-country nationals into European reception societies.
With regard to the future of decision-making processes, the Commission welcomes the conclusions reached by the Convention's working group on Justice and Home Affairs, because it acknowledges that in issues of asylum, immigration and other policies involving freedom of movement, the general rule for decision-making must be to adopt legislative acts under the codecision process, in which the Council reaches agreement by qualified majority.
I also welcome the fact that this conclusion has been reached by the Convention's working group with a broad majority.
In terms of changes to the Treaty, the Commission is encouraging the Convention to adopt the rule of a more explicit legal basis for developing a common European asylum system that goes beyond the mere minimum common rules that the Council is currently discussing.
As to the issue the honourable Member raised concerning the usefulness and effectiveness of the networks, the Commission wishes to state clearly to Parliament that its assessment of the work undertaken by the networks that have real operational duties, such as Europol, Eurojust, or bodies such as the Chiefs of Police task-force and the judicial networks in civil and criminal matters, is positive.
Nevertheless, we must emphasise that not all networks present the same added value and that the Council should be more particular in selecting its priorities for establishing these networks.
With regard to the relationship between the Commission and the European Parliament, the Commission is attempting scrupulously to comply with the framework agreement signed by the two institutions on 5 July 2000.
In this context, I intend, as early as next week in Brussels, to inform the European Parliament's Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of developments in the negotiations underway on readmission agreements with third countries.
With regard to the issue of evaluating the way in which framework decisions are transposed into the national legal system of each State, The Commission wishes to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that evaluation methods vary from framework decision to framework decision.
Our view is that priority should now be given to the framework decision on combating terrorism, which should be transposed by all Member States by the end of 2002.
We are gathering information from the Member States on this transposal and we hope to be able to present the corresponding report by the end of 2003.
As always, the Commission is paying particular attention to achieving the necessary balance between respect for the law and for the protection of people's fundamental rights and the fight against organised crime and terrorism.
To this end, following a recommendation of the European Parliament, the Commission has created a network of experts in fundamental rights.
This year's report on this network of experts focuses in particular on the compatibility of the measures adopted by the Member States and by the European Union on the fight against terrorism and respect for fundamental rights.
Finally, with regard to the rapporteur's last question on the framework decision on procedural guarantees for persons standing trial, the Commission welcomes the Greek Presidency's intention to include this matter in the discussion at the VÃ©ria informal Council at the end of March.
For our part, before this Council we will be adopting a Green Paper on common rules for procedural guarantees for persons standing trial anywhere in the Union.
This Green Paper will give civil society and legal professionals, in both current and future Member States, the opportunity to contribute to the debate, with a view to our presenting a proposal for a framework decision that we believe must be scheduled by the end of this year.
The Commission is consequently committed to establishing minimum common rules in this field, as stated in its presentation of the annual work programme for 2003.
I wish to conclude by announcing that work is also underway on guarantees for equal treatment in gathering and processing evidence and the on the right to remain silent during trial.
We believe these matters to be particularly important for creating a common base, a common platform in criminal cases, in order to make mutual trust and cooperation between judicial authorities more effective in the fight against organised crime.
In short, the progress that has been made is unequivocal and undeniable.
They are not balanced in all aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice, but in light of this experience we can help the Convention on the Future of Europe to overcome the main institutional and procedural difficulties to ensure that the Union becomes an area of peace, prosperity, freedom, cohesion, security and solidarity.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for Baroness Ludford's question, which, being comprehensive in its scope, was a very good one.
I cannot do other than endorse the rapporteur's constitutional thinking on the subject of asylum and immigration policy.
We need majority voting in the Council, Parliament needs to have the power of codecision, and the right of the Member States to propose legislation needs to be limited, as it is mainly used for reasons of domestic policy and rarely advances the cause of European Union.
She is also right in her conclusion that the EU is a long way from implementing what was decided at Tampere.
Whilst Baroness Ludford regards the Council as being to blame for this, I take the contrary view that the Commission must shoulder a large share of the responsibility for it.
Commissioner Vitorino, although the Treaties require minimum standards of you, you wanted to go ahead and generously broaden the scope of both the Convention on Refugees and the provisions of national law, and your attempts to do so failed at Council level on many occasions.
It might be a good idea if you were to slowly learn the error of your ways; your new proposal on the reunification of families certainly gives us hope that you are willing to do so.
It so happens, Baroness Ludford, that minimum standards are often the lowest common denominator.
The Group of the European People's Party welcomes the Commission's commitment to combating illegal immigration, which demonstrates, Commissioner Vitorino, that you can see that there are two sides to the coin and that you are getting down to work.
Let us turn to counter-terrorism, an area in which 2002 has seen great progress made.
The common definition of terrorism, the European arrest warrant, and the reinforcement of Europol were important milestones on the road towards terrorism being effectively combated in Europe.
I would like to take this opportunity to specifically call upon the Council to make use of the funds we have allocated to Europol, which amount to over EUR 3 million, for if they do not do so, nobody will be in a position, in the event of one or more attacks in Europe, to coordinate or to lead police operations.
Your disputes about competence will not, at any rate, meet with much public sympathy.
Baroness Ludford has diagnosed an imbalance between the methods of counter-terrorism on the one hand and guaranteed fundamental rights on the other.
I do not see that such is the case.
Laws at national and European level have made very good provision for data protection, we have extensive systems for defence and legal protection, and direct intervention can, of course, still only be carried out at national level.
She is right, however, to demand that Europol and Eurojust - which latter has had a successful start - should be brought within the Community sphere, for that, in the long term, is the only way to guarantee effective democratic and juridical control and to prevent duplication of structures.
It is clear to see that, if Eurojust were to be brought within the Community sphere, it could take over OLAF's tasks as well as ensuring that the Community's financial interest was protected.
As well as that, though, the Schengen Agreement and its associated information system have to be brought within the Community sphere.
I might add, by the way, that the plethora of information systems will function effectively only when they are interconnected and equipped with standard rules on data protection, which could also be monitored by the new data protection commissioner.
At the same time, we also need a new coordination body for the external borders, by which I mean a sort of 'Eurobord' or 'Euroguard'.
Open internal borders mean that it is in the interest of all Member States that Poland's eastern border, the waters of the Italian Adriatic, and the Straits of Gibraltar should be secured, and this calls for solidarity on their part.
I might add that the EU has wasted years of valuable time when it comes to these matters, which are closely connected with its own enlargement.
For far too long, Commissioner Verheugen has been lulling the EU to sleep and reassuring it that no reforms are needed.
The second generation SIS has now been delayed, and frameworks for common border control are also only in their early stages - all this with enlargement one year away.
These are issues where we have to work, even now, much more closely with the candidate countries than we have done before.
We all have a long road ahead of us before we can present the Europe of freedom, security and justice to its citizens, but we have to take the first steps, and, Commissioner, let me add that the Convention has to become even more courageous.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the questions she has addressed to the Council and the Commission, which anticipate a resolution from this House and which I hope will receive strong support.
And I would also like to thank the Council and the European Commission for their comprehensive replies.
Firstly, I agree with both the Council and the Commission that it is fair to say that we have made a lot of progress in the field of cooperation on criminal matters.
So much so that it now seems reasonable - and I hope that everyone agrees - that we should expect and ask for the proposals which the Commissioner has put forward here, more than once, in relation to improving judicial standards in the European Union and creating common minimum standards which guarantee to the European citizens that this framework of criminal cooperation reinforces not only their freedom and security but also the efficiency of justice.
I believe that this is really positive.
In relation to the fight against this type of cross-border crime, I would simply like to draw attention to the Conference which took place in Brussels with regard to trafficking in women and children.
I believe that the citizens expect us to deal with this issue from a Community point of view.
We adopted a declaration, the Brussels Declaration, which had our full support, and I believe we should take the lead in the implementation of the measures it called for.
With regard to asylum and immigration, the truth is that I have been perplexed all day.
I do not understand what is going on here.
We have often said in this House that we endorsed the Tampere agreements, that we wanted a common, balanced and global immigration policy, in the way that all the Ministers, including those from the PPE group, had stated in Tampere.
We all agree that the framework referred to by Mr Vitorino is the one we need in order to create this common area for immigration and asylum, in the terms indicated by the Commission and undoubtedly in the terms which inspired the debates in the Parliament and the Council.
Now it seems that, on the contrary, we are only calling for certain minimal things in the field of immigration.
I do not understand.
I hope, Mr von Boetticher, that you are not in the government at some time in the future and that we do not hear you saying, 'This is a European problem which must be dealt with from a European perspective', as so many Prime Ministers affiliated to the PPE do, quite rightly.
I hope that this can carry on and to this end I hope that the Convention will grant Parliament and the Council co-decision powers, as the Commissioner requested, in the field of justice, freedom and security, because the citizens must be secure in this area, and that the Commission will have its right to initiative returned so that progress can be made logically and coherently.
Mr President, 1999 already seems ages ago.
That was the year that the agreements we know well - indeed, with which we are all too familiar - were reached in Tampere on the new European asylum and migration policy to be set up and a deadline was even attached to that, 5 years.
Now we are in 2003, and not much has happened.
I think that as far as that is concerned I am rather less enthusiastic about the outcomes of the Seville Summit, as will also be clear from our support for the position of our rapporteur Baroness Ludford.
What I say is not entirely true, of course, because actually a lot has happened, only not in the dusty chambers of the Council.
Since 1999, roughly 700 000 legal migrants a year have come to the European Union to work.
And in those same four years around two million illegals have entered Europe.
Of course that was not the intention, but you cannot say that Europe is full, even though the feeling has certainly arisen in some Member States that immigration is responsible for serious social tension and that the sharing of responsibilities between the Member States has not been at all fair.
That is one of the reasons for adopting a European approach.
In my country, the Netherlands, immigration for work has doubled since 1998 but against this stream of migrants we are dealing with a Europe that is getting older and older.
In the Netherlands 20% of the population will be over 65 within 20 years, in Germany a similar figure has already been reached and what we call the 'grey wave' means that by 2050 there will be 80 pensioners for every 100 working people.
At the moment there are 40 for every 100.
It is not hard to imagine the effects this will have on the welfare state and pensions.
It strikes me that the Council has been ignoring the long view.
Recent years tell the story of how it has continued to look anxiously at how things are going and taken decisions on an ad hoc basis.
We need to get real; now is the time to act.
Immigration, of whatever kind, and the ageing of the population pay no attention to the passing of time; they just carry on unabated.
There is no solution to be found in either a Fortress Europe or a rejuvenating elixir.
My proposal to the Council is that we take a decision on European immigration policy during the Greek Presidency and stop pussyfooting around.
Today Parliament voted on a directive on the entry and residence of citizens of third countries who want to enter the European Union to work.
If you, the Council, really want to mean something to the citizens of Europe, vote for this directive.
That would demonstrate foresight and with that initiative towards a sort of blue card we could start to regulate labour migration more effectively to the benefit of both groups, the migrants themselves and the countries that receive them.
I ask the Council not to avoid that decision now and to remember that those who really want to get over that high fence into Europe come with all the social tensions associated with that and so it is sensible to create a gateway so that their entry is regulated.
Mr President, I should like to take advantage of this annual debate to express my concern about the obstacles to freedom of movement and, more generally, the immigration-policy restrictions in the Union.
It has to be admitted that the call to combat terrorism is leading to so-called security measures which sometimes interfere with fundamental rights, at the risk of intensifying a trend which already exists.
Therefore, although the proposals resulting from the meeting of the Convention working party are worthy of interest, the events of 11 September have been explicitly quoted as justification for a high level of Community control in fields such as cross-border crime, asylum policy or the control of the external borders of the Union, and yet this process of amalgamation has not given rise to any indignation.
In France, the so-called 'internal security' bill drawn up by the Minister for Internal Affairs targets a whole range of actions: the illegal installation of travellers, the holding of meetings in the entrance halls of blocks of flats, aggressive begging, so-called 'passive or active' soliciting, explicitly aimed at foreign prostitutes, and all these things constitute offences which attract heavy fines and, in some cases, prison sentences.
In other words, what we have here is simply a bill which lumps together immigration, poverty and insecurity.
In addition, as far as any immigration and asylum policy is concerned, the current French proposals can be boiled down to the setting up of quotas for tourist visas, the drawing up of a list of so-called safe countries, compulsory repatriation or the creation of a corps of European border guards.
However, to impose quotas or talk about managing migratory flows, while at the same time recruiting the brains and muscle power from the South which are useful to the 'European market' is a hypocrisy which in actual fact is helping to conceal the networks of people smugglers, to encourage people to emigrate to a life of wretchedness and exploitation, and even to criminalise migrants to the detriment of a policy based on equal rights and freedom of movement.
The Seville Council gave a very bad signal here when it reduced the European approach to immigration to the setting of even stricter conditions for access and residence, and even cashed in on economic aid as a result.
Yet how can talking more about policing than about trade, and more about insecurity than about liberty, contribute towards the development revelled in by so many liberal European speeches, without any human exchanges and without movement?
The closure of the camp at Sangatte in the north of France is proof, if proof were needed, that the closing of borders does nothing to reduce the distress of men and women who are fleeing persecution, conflict or poverty.
The most vulnerable people and ethnic minorities are the ones most severely affected by this repressive policy.
I am thinking of the Romany people, whom the European Union is threatening with expulsion and rejecting in practice.
I am thinking of the illegal immigrants who, in France, despite their legitimate perseverance in wanting to live there legally, are prevented from doing so by a policy of hindrance, arrest and expulsion.
Yet there is so much that needs to be done in order to take initiatives drawn up in a spirit of opening up to the world and welcoming it, for example by contributing towards real cooperation on development, ensuring equality in the social and economic services, in access to employment for everyone, but also in civil rights.
I am thinking of the regularisation of the position of illegal immigrants, or the Madrid appeal for residential citizenship, the recognition of voting rights and eligibility for local and European elections.
What Europe needs, therefore, is a new immigration policy.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Baroness Ludford.
I think that her pertinent oral questions have enabled us to have a debate which is obviously very interesting.
I agree essentially with her analysis of the situation.
I believe that we cannot really accuse the Council of any lack of activity this year.
One might even say that the Council was overcome by a kind of feverishness, obviously under the influence of the atmosphere produced by the events of 11 September, the ultra-security-consciousness of public opinion and, more directly, electoral concerns, which shows quite clearly that the study of a certain number of issues would profit by being shared equally between opinions, through the positions adopted by the European Parliament and the initiatives of the Commission.
When it comes to the general interests of Europe, the sum of national egoisms does not constitute the law.
I should like to draw your attention to work which is currently in progress.
My group has had the pleasure of bringing together a certain number of involved people from all over Europe, who are studying the question of the isolation of foreigners in Europe.
It is quite frightening.
The analyses that have been made, on a country by country basis, show that there have been considerable developments which are quite alarming.
Camps are proliferating, camps in all forms, of all kinds, with or without official status, open or closed, in which foreigners are sorted, guarded, imprisoned, punished, and kept handy for forced repatriation or whatever.
I believe that these obvious denials of people's right, for example to seek asylum in Europe, are extremely worrying.
I would ask the Commission to examine these practices closely and to determine to what extent, since they are initially the responsibility of national States, European policy is likely to result in or encourage actions of this type on the part of Member States.
For example, we discovered at the seminar that readmission agreements were actually an incitement to Member States to create such camps.
In the final analysis, therefore, the question is whether, in the light of what I believe to be the satisfactory results of the Convention working party, we should encourage the Council to work this year, or whether we ought to wait until new decision-making methods make it possible to achieve greater equilibrium between the three aspects of the area that we have been talking about just now.
