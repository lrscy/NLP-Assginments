Simple business methods and pure software will not be patentable in Europe.
The directive states this quite explicitly, and it is also prevented by the fact that patent protection for computer-implemented inventions requires a technical contribution.
I am grateful to Commissioner Bolkestein for stating this quite explicitly again today, and would like to reiterate that we have no doubt about this.
This House should also not act as if someone might interpret the report in a way which conflicts with the clear statement by the Commission and the proposed amendments, which are also very clear on this point.
Secondly, the directive is not meant to protect trivial software.
Patents on trivial software, such as progress bars, are a cause for concern and are not desirable.
The directive also makes it clear that we do not want to grant patent protection to trivial software.
I would ask you, in tomorrow's vote, to support the proposed amendments in which we clarify a number of points, but also to give your endorsement to Mrs McCarthy's report as a whole.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.
At a time when we want to encourage innovation, growth and competitiveness within the European Union, in the form of a simple legal harmonisation and clarification of the varying practices and interpretations in this area, this directive represents a real step backwards, a real change of approach in relation to the European Patent Convention and to the directive on software copyright, because it seeks to extend to the limit the possibilities of patenting this software.
We should consequently reject this directive, because it contains too many vagaries.
First of all, computers have become a crucial tool in transmitting ideas, thoughts and knowledge.
Excessive private appropriation of this tool is, therefore, dangerous. Copyright is more suitable.
Secondly, from the economic point of view, innovation in the field of software is often accomplished by SMEs or by independent researchers, for whom patenting is not a suitable instrument because it is too expensive, too involved and will create a legal nightmare.
It has not been proven that protection will increase innovation, growth and competitiveness.
Lastly, in the context of the economic rivalry that pits us against the United States, adopting this directive would allow some large corporations, which act as monopolies, to maintain their dominant position in the market.
We shall, therefore, continue to wait for a directive drafted after a more detailed study has been undertaken into the economic effects on innovation, competition and intellectual property policy in this sector.
Mr President, Commissioner, if it were up to the EVP (Evangelical People's party), there would be no software patents at all, and if it were up to you, Commissioner, there would not be any either.
This is how I understood it, after I received the proposal and after I read the existing legislation - and the innumerable letters we have all been receiving - more than once.
Many people in our group support the starting points and the objectives in the Commission's proposal.
Commissioner, I hope that you will be able to support a number of amendments which have been submitted on behalf of our group and which - building on Mrs McCarthy's report and the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - define matters more clearly and put more flesh on the bones of the monitoring task.
I do not believe the assertions that are persistently doing the rounds that this proposal would be a bad thing for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
More legal certainty and uniform application of the legal rules in the internal market are things small- and medium-sized enterprises have a particular need of.
In my view, small- and medium-sized enterprises do not have a specific problem with this directive, but they do have a general problem with the patent system as such.
Much of the criticism in the letters boils down to that.
This is true both when they enjoy the protection of a patent themselves and when they have to deal with the patent rights of others.
Hence my question, Commissioner, as to whether you and your administration could not think creatively about how we can achieve a European approach that will enable small- and medium-sized enterprises to improve their position in patent land.
I have not submitted an amendment on this as I think that this text is not an appropriate place for this from a legal point of view.
I do, however, think that it is important enough to make this suggestion now from a political point of view, and I would therefore appreciate it very much if you could give me an answer.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur.
If we try to complicate the work of the open-source community, software houses, those toiling away on their own and small associations by extending patentability, we shall be destroying the whole basis of the information society.
Innovations that benefit all of us, such as Linux, show just how big an issue this is: it is about narrowing the digital divide.
Of course, copyright already protects software codes.
Software patents have their downside in that designers can by no means always know they are infringing patents and may indeed become liable for damages on a huge scale.
The limits of patentability must be defined in such a way that programs, algorithms and business methods are, as such, precluded from patentability, and so that patents may not be used to hinder competition.
We support small-scale entrepreneurship in this sector.
.
Mr President, since there are many amendments, I do not propose to go through them all one by one, indicating the Commission's response.
With your permission I should like to provide you with a list of the amendments by number, showing which of them the Commission can accept, which we cannot accept and which we could accept with suitable rewording
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Our rapporteur wishes to add a few words.
Mr President, I did not want to make this point during my speech, but it is necessary that it should be made.
In the ten years that I have been an MEP I have never encountered such a personal, aggressive and abusive campaign as I have with this particular directive.
I have been bullied and harassed by lobbyists.
My staff have been bullied to the extent that one of them had to take days off with a stress-related illness.
I am now asking you, Mr President, to ensure that you conduct the vote tomorrow in an orderly way, to ensure that Parliament and its Members are permitted to vote as they are empowered to do by their democratic mandate to draft and make legislation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The proposal for a directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions must have aroused more passion than any other matter debated in Parliament in recent times.
From the outset my opinion of the directive has been critical.
I do not, however, object to it totally, as I think it is good that the present confused situation regarding conditions for granting software patents is to be clarified.
At present, with the regulations being so unclear, the decisions taken by national patent offices and the European Patent Office may well have been very different, and therefore common European rules could be needed. There have to be quite a number of amendments made to the report, however, before it can be adopted.
The amendments I have proposed would make the directive less harmful to independent software developers and small- and medium-sized companies.
My main arguments are as follows:
In its present form the directive could significantly harm independent software developers and European small- and medium-sized software houses, which may find it impossible to survive in the 'patents jungle' of the great software giants.
Patent processing times are very long and application is expensive.
That is why they could slow down and even obstruct the development of the European software sector, dependent as it is on innovation and speedy reaction.
Software interoperability and communications should, furthermore, be possible without huge licence fees.
I am in favour of open interfaces.
Algorithms, business prototypes and computer programs should not be patentable as such.
One of the main purposes of granting patents has always been to make society aware of the existence of inventions.
Patents on computer-implemented inventions are virtually useless as data sources if the source code is not published.
In the United States of America the source code is published in the patent application in the case of most software patents, which is established business practice in the industry.
This should also be possible in Europe.
I hope that tomorrow's vote will have a favourable outcome and that as many of my fellow Members as possible will show their support for a creative and innovative European software industry.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on which we are about to vote is not what it appears to be.
What it appears to be is a set of amendments to the Sirene Manual, which regulates the exchange of information between Member States in relation to the Schengen Information System.
Underlying this vote, however, is something a little more complex.
This Parliament was initially asked to express an opinion on two initiatives, but was refused access to the relevant documentation, the Sirene Manual.
At a meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Greek Presidency promised to grant that access so that we could express our opinion.
The Council agreed to nothing of the sort.
The Presidency gave in and the ban remained in place.
The Council eventually agreed to reveal in committee the nature of the contents of the classified documents.
On the basis of that information, I proposed the report which will be put to the vote today, approving the two initiatives with amendments.
My committee accepted that proposal.
By voting in favour, however, we are sending a political message to the Council, a message of good faith and collaboration, but also a message saying that it is time to stop playing hide-and-seek with the European Parliament.
The Council has delayed opening talks with Parliament on how to deal with classified documents within the area of freedom, security and justice.
This situation cannot continue.
This type of information is usually available for Council work, but is not passed on to us in Parliament.
There are other cases, too, in which information regarding a Member State is not passed on until the Member State in question decides that the information should no longer remain classified.
If we are to prevent these situations from reoccurring, clear rules should be drawn up on dealing with classified documents in the legislative area, laying down an appropriate level of security and accepted by all the interested parties.
That is the message we are sending the Council through this report.
Mr President, I propose that we now vote on the draft legislative resolution, to confirm the rejection of the Austrian initiative.
Therefore we will vote on the legislative resolution, the adoption of which will close the procedure.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Recommendation (A5-0307/2003) by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the appointment of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank (10893/2003 - C5-0332/2003 - 2003/0819(CNS) (Rapporteur: Christa Randzio-Plath)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Report (A5-00282/2003) by Harald Ettl, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's communication on 'Progress on the implementation of the Joint Assessment Papers on employment policies in candidate countries' COM(2003) 37 - (2003/2105(INI))
(Parliament adopted the text)

(Parliament rejected the Commission proposal)
President.
We must now ask the Commission if it intends to withdraw its proposal.
. Mr President, I shall certainly report this to my colleague, Mrs de Palacio, and ask the Commission to act accordingly.
Commissioner, I am afraid we need the answer now, so that we can complete this part of the voting procedure.
Parliament has rejected the Commission proposal.
I assume that for the moment the Commission is going to maintain its text.
. Mr President, I am informed by people who are competent in this matter that, according to the framework agreement, I should refer to my colleagues and after that I shall of course inform Parliament correspondingly.
Mr President, perhaps I can assist the Commissioner here.
Last night Commissioner de Palacio gave the House an assurance that if the proposal were to be rejected, she would not seek to reintroduce it.
. Mr President, this Commissioner is always grateful for any assistance he is given.
I can assure you that it happens very infrequently!
(Laughter)
I would not wish to deny the truth of the statement that has just been made.
Once again, I assume that matters will develop as indicated by the honourable Member.
Mr President, as a consequence of our previous decision to reject the proposal for a directive, I believe that we should not vote on the following report because it is about cancelling the previous directives.
As these two reports are closely linked I believe that we should follow the rapporteur's advice and refer this back to committee as well.
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)
Report (A5-0236/2003) by Luis Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 40/94 on the Community trade mark (COM(2002) 767 - C5-0009/2003 - 2002/0308(CNS))
Before the vote:
Mr President, I do not know whether the procedure would be appropriate, but in Amendment No 3, relating to paragraph 5 of Article 8, there has been an error on presentation.
If we take account of the justification for the amendment, which is aimed at increasing legal certainty and protection of holders of earlier trade marks or geographical indications, on drawing up the text, earlier trade marks have been mentioned on five occasions and on only one occasion are earlier Community geographical indications mentioned.
I would therefore like, if possible, to introduce an oral amendment now, to the effect that each time the text of this Amendment No 3 mentions an earlier trade mark, it is followed by 'or Community geographical indication', because that was the purpose of the amendment, but for some mysterious reason, caused by printing gremlins or I am not sure who, Mr President, it has not been included.
Mr President, Amendment No 11 concerns a temporary committee.
It is an amendment which I submitted myself, because although the two main groups had submitted a proposal for a temporary committee, there was no agreement on the content.
I am trying to keep out of a political discussion that is taking place in one of the Member States of the European Union.
I have always tried to do so, and I am now trying to do so again.
Hence this oral amendment, which I think should combine various proposals better.
I will read it out in English as that is the language in which the amendment was drawn up.
Are there any objections to that oral amendment?
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Sterckx for his initiative and to say that I regret the stand being adopted by the socialists.
Obviously, we shall return to vote on his initial amendment which, I am sorry to say, contradicts Article 193 of the Treaty and Rule 151 of our Rules of Procedure, because it basically makes provision for a covert committee of inquiry.
Consequently, I think that we are voting for something which contradicts the Treaties and the Rules of Procedure.
(The President cut off the speaker)
, rapporteur. (NL) Mr President, on the basis of previous information I had written that there was still 13 000 tonnes on board the wreck.
Yesterday I spoke to the people who are trying to bring this oil up to the surface, and they told me that there was still 14 000 tonnes in the wreck.
I would therefore like to amend these two figures.
.
(FR) Inserting new provisions on the legal position of political groups constitutes the umpteenth time that these groups have been recognised.
In principle, there is no reason why the statute of the political groups in the European Parliament needs to be enhanced any further, although one can condemn the desire that has been expressed in recent years to eliminate any form of national representation in the Chamber, which would only lead to a highly partisan form of representation.
Nevertheless, let us not go too far by making Parliament the seat of a future 'government of the parties'.
The influence exerted by the major political groups in this Parliament is already very - or even too - large; it should not in future become a kind of monopoly, which would be inimical to pluralism.
We have recently seen disturbing abuses committed by certain groups that are in a dominant political position, mainly due to their federalist ideology.
I am thinking here of the dissolution of the TDI Group, which was an extremely serious political act given that even Member States no longer ban political parties!
There should be no more shifts of this type.
I am concerned, however, when I see that the proposed text gives further consideration to this idea, which threatens people's freedoms.
Let us show some moderation!
.
(FR) Austria, using the right of initiative that Member States still have in the field of immigration policy, has just submitted a useful proposal: to draw up a list of European countries considered to be safe in terms of their respect for human rights in order to determine whether to allow them to examine applications for asylum lodged in a Member State by persons that have passed through their territory first.
This measure appears to simplify matters, to be common sense, to match the need for closer cooperation between European countries in light of the influx of refugees of all sorts.
This Austrian initiative, which we supported, has not been fortunate enough to meet with the favour of the European Parliament which, in rejecting it, invoked various legal grounds, all of which are quite specious. One of the reasons given is that this text would anticipate a future, broader directive on asylum procedures.
The real reason is quite different.
As we can see from the explanatory statement, the European Parliament is clinging to a narrow interpretation of the Geneva Convention, which was founded on the principle of 'non-refoulement'. This principle is absolute and without shades of meaning or conditions.
It is this narrow interpretation that must be called into question if we genuinely want to address asylum-related issues.
.
(PT) The Republic of Austria's initiative, motivated by a need to respond to 'a dramatic increase in asylum applicants' in that country, 'contrary to the European trend', fits into the logic of building 'Fortress Europe'.
The initiative aimed to produce a list of third countries which qualify as safe for the purpose of taking the responsibility for examining an application for asylum, on the assumption that the country responsible for studying an application was the country where the applicant entered the Union.
Of the countries on the proposed list, Switzerland is the only non-EU Member State and non-Schengen country.
It can therefore be deduced that Austria's immediate targets were the EU candidate countries with which it shares a border.
As the rapporteur points out, however, there is a fundamental principle at stake here, namely that the Geneva Convention allows any applicant for asylum to have his or her case individually examined.
Even if a list of 'safe third states' could be established, therefore, an application for asylum could not be automatically rejected because of the provisions of the Geneva Convention.
Besides, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, a regulation would not be the right instrument to use in relation to such a vital aspect of the sovereignty of the Member States.
The reasons for rejecting the Austrian initiative are more fundamental than those relating to the rapporteur's recitals.
Basically, the concept of 'safe third States' runs counter to the international obligations arising from the 1951 Geneva Convention.
This is most striking in the case of gypsies fleeing the racism and discrimination that they suffer in countries such as Romania or Slovakia - States that the EU considers to be 'safe'.
As the rapporteur acknowledges: 'Even if a list of safe third states were to be established, an application for asylum cannot be automatically rejected, as this would override the Geneva Convention'.
Declaring that a request for asylum is 'clearly unfounded' is already common practice.
The list of 'safe States' will be used as a pretext for further encouraging a hasty examination and the systematic rejection of requests.
The idea of keeping refugees in their regions of origin breaches the principle of non-refoulement.
This is refoulement by another name.
In France, the Villepin law calls this 'internal asylum'!
This means choosing refugee camps over welcoming refugees.
The Austrian initiative must be rejected on the grounds that it authorises attacks on the right of asylum in Europe and anticipates the way in which, in the context of drafting European legislation, the Member States intend to abandon any consideration of the right of asylum and of the Geneva Convention.
.
(PT) I support the rapporteur's arguments, since I believe that the scope of the Austrian initiative is indeed limited.
The rapporteur observes that this regulation would only apply to Switzerland, which is clearly insufficient justification for drawing up such a legal instrument.
At the same time, the inflexible nature of the proposal makes no provision for mechanisms allowing the list of 'safe states' to be revised and countries added or removed.
That might lead to the proposed system being paralysed ab initio, without any benefits flowing from it, either for those making asylum applications or for those implementing the law.
The rapporteur notes that underlying this Austrian proposal is the problem of a 'dramatic increase' in applications for asylum in that country, which is regrettable.
Here, however, is where I part company with the rapporteur, since I have to say that I consider it normal and even positive for a Member State to try to exercise its rights and solve its specific problems even if, at times, this might breach the abstract principle of 'Community interest', which is very often elusive when it comes to security and justice.
I also support the rapporteur's contention that the concept of safe third European states should not be targeted by a separate regulation, but should rather be dealt with as part of the comprehensive approach established by the framework of the Directive on asylum policy.
I was at the Campione d'Italia casino, a distinguished casino which is well-known in Europe.
At a table, a little set apart, the governors of the fifteen national banks of the European Union were playing cards, and with them was Mr Trichet, candidate and now elected President of the European Central Bank.
Mr Trichet was very young, whilst the fifteen governors were elderly, not only did they have white hair, but they were genuinely weary: they were pensioners.
I asked myself then whether this vision that I had was not a warning sign.
What is there for the national banks to do when there is a Central European Bank?
What is there for the national governors to do?
Would it not be good if they went and had a rest, if they retired?
.
(FR) We have voted against the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European Central Bank because during his hearing he expressed no desire for there to be any political reorientation given the semi-stagnation in which the heart of the Eurozone is currently plunged.
Instead, he stressed that there is no recession in the strict sense of the word, which is true, and that the Eurozone's key interest rates are ' the lowest for fifty years', which is also true.
His implicit message was that he could not, in his capacity of president of the ECB, do much more than that.
He is not completely wrong, moreover: the slowdown currently enveloping France and Germany probably cannot be corrected by the tools of traditional monetary policy, because this is the result partially of the single currency - a rigid framework applied in a uniform way to economies that are quite different.
In light of this situation, the room for manoeuvre available to the President of the ECB is perhaps limited.
Is entrapping one of the very people responsible for inventing the Maastricht Treaty, however, not a fitting punishment for history to mete out?
.
(FR) We have voted against 'the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European Central Bank' partly because of the institution but also because of the man himself.
The ECB is responsible, in the field of money and credit, for applying a policy which is entirely favourable to employers in the European Union and, consequently, entirely unfavourable to the working classes.
We oppose the very purpose of this institution, whoever is in charge of it.
Nor, however, did we want to let the man himself off.
Before being nominated for this position, Jean-Claude Trichet was the governor of the Banque de France.
In this capacity, he is responsible for a 'restructuring' plan at this bank that has resulted in half of the branches being closed and the loss of over 2 000 jobs, in other words more than a quarter of the bank's staff.
A man who is happy to carry out such jobs deserves no more support than the institution whose reins he is about to take over.
.
(PT) Predictably, Mr Trichet, President-Elect of the European Central Bank (ECB), has reaffirmed and reinforced the EU's current economic 'triangle', based on price stability, the Stability Pact, and the 'Lisbon strategy', despite the increasingly obvious incompatibility of this 'triangle' with economic growth and employment.
In his answers to the questionnaire, Mr Trichet reaffirms that price stability is a prerequisite for growth, 'by limiting the rise in unit production costs' - in other words, through wage restraint, reductions in real wages and increases in productivity, but only for employers, in this case.
Mr Trichet also mentions the consensus among EU governments on the 'Lisbon strategy', and the need to emphasise the approach based on structural reforms, by which he means liberalisation, increasing the flexibility of the labour market and gradually privatising pensions.
Finally, he reaffirms the Stability Pact's 3% threshold, claiming that no government has called for it to be altered and that the Commission has shown it to be essential.
This is rather ironic, given that France is about to fail, for the third year in a row, to comply with that very requirement.
Mr Trichet also supports amendments to the ECB's voting procedures, which fundamentally distance countries like Portugal from the financial decision-making process.
That is why we voted against this report.
.
(FR) We have voted against the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the European Central Bank, because for fifteen years he has embodied the doctrine known as 'competitive disinflation', which has inspired the neoliberal policies that have been implemented in our countries.
It is under his influence that salaries were frozen in order to allow an increasing share of the wealth generated to be channelled into financial profit.
This policy has stifled growth and stimulated the rise in mass unemployment.
We do not, therefore, want to see this disastrous dogmatism transferred to the European level.
We are not making this an issue of personality, however: we would probably vote against any other candidate, because it is the concept of the European Central Bank itself that we dispute on two key points.
An institution of this nature should not be given a needlessly rigid target of 2% for inflation, which blindly prioritises finance over employment.
The ECB should also be placed under genuine democratic control that goes further than the caricature of democracy that consists, as it does today, of voting for full powers to be given to a man over whom we will henceforth have no control whatsoever.
.
(NL) Today we have to choose a new president of the European Central Bank, but there is not really any choice at all.
From the outset the intention was for the bank to be located in Germany with a Frenchman at the helm.
As the Dutchman Wim Duisenberg had done the groundwork for the ECB, he was ultimately given the presidency for a short time.
It was known when he was appointed that a compromise had been reached in which the eight-year term would be shared between Mr Duisenberg and Mr Trichet.
Mr Trichet was thus assured of this post, albeit for only half the period, from the start.
That threatened to go awry when it looked as if Mr Trichet was going to go to prison.
It has now been suggested that he be given a further period of eight years.
As an argument in favour of his appointment it is now being said that, unlike the government in his country, he will adhere strictly to the 3% ceiling for national budget deficits in the Stability Pact.
That ceiling is turning into a recipe for disaster.
Large Member States are not managing to achieve it; poor Member States will certainly not be able to.
In the Netherlands, which is adhering to it, everything that is valuable is being cut back to nothing.
Against this background I see no reason whatsoever to approve the candidature of Mr Trichet.
.
(FR) The appointment of the next president of the European Central Bank is an act of the utmost importance because, in addition to the personality of the candidate, it is also, and above all, on monetary policy that we should comment.
In the event, although I am clearly pleased that a Frenchman is soon to become president of the ECB, I cannot avoid the fact that Mr Trichet, for he is the person we are discussing, embodies a strict budgetary orthodoxy and demands that this be implemented.
Mr Trichet put this quite bluntly during his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs: come hell or high water, he intends to continue the approach he has inherited from Mr Duisenberg, in other words, a form of monetarism that is as rigid as it is inappropriate.
This decision should not be endorsed, however.
At a time when many Member States are unable to comply with a Stability Pact, the limitations of which appear, in the current situation, to be completely out of step with the harsh realities of the economic climate, I cannot sanction the appointment of a candidate who is clearly afflicted by the same disease: autism.
.
I voted in favour of confirming Mr Trichet as President of the European Central Bank because it is in my country's and my constituents' interest that the ECB be well managed and that the euro succeed as a currency.
The euro zone is by far the most important destination for Scottish exports and source of our imports and tourists.
I am adequately persuaded by Mr Trichet's reputation, and by the way he responded to the questions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that he will maintain the stability of the euro.
He will also maintain the requisite pressure on the Member States to pursue prudent financial policies and to reform their social structures in order to foster economic growth and development.
This is what matters to Scotland.
.
(PT) Unemployment is one of the main problems facing the candidate countries.
In six of the 12 candidate countries, unemployment exceeds 10%, leading to social exclusion and poverty.
Economic and monetary policies promoting economic growth and employment are needed, therefore, and should be driven by the public and cooperative sectors.
This unemployment can be blamed on the rapid destruction of planned economies, linked to waves of privatisation and the complete opening-up of markets, which have caused severe disruption not only of economic activity but also of public services themselves, in particular in the field of social security.
This very transformation is confirmed in the report's explanatory statement, where it is said to have 'further increased the proportion of the population who are threatened with poverty' and caused the rise of 'employment on insecure terms, e.g. on a temporary ? basis'.
This Commission communication, then, aims to transpose the European Employment Strategy, in its 'post-Lisbon strategy' form, to the candidate countries.
The latter do not appear to require greater occupational flexibility and mobility.
Once again, the solution lies in a thorough revision of the EU's entrenched neoliberal economic and monetary policies.
The EU's efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion should be redoubled.
.
(PT) I voted in favour of this report on the Commission's communication on the progress made by the candidate countries in relation to their respective employment policies.
Its aim is to ensure that the candidate countries define employment policies which prepare them for EU membership.
As we know, employment, employment policies and their coordination constitute one of the main challenges facing the EU today.
Above all, it is one of the demands of the people of Europe.
The Lisbon strategy, indeed, defined the challenge of creating more and better jobs as essential to promoting truly humane progress, concerned not only with questions of economic growth, but also with the individual fulfilment of its citizens.
Among the central messages of the European Commission's communication, I would emphasise those which lay particular emphasis on the strategic significance of education and training, from basic level up to the increasingly important lifelong learning.
Lastly, I would also like to mention the importance attached to special programmes on equal treatment for disabled people and provisions to promote equal opportunities.
These measures make it possible to reconcile family life with a professional career.
Mr President, I invited the supporters, the fans, and the enthusiasts of my explanations of vote for dinner.
There were more than 300 of them.
In the kitchen, Mr Fatuzzo was preparing the meal: spaghetti with garlic, olive oil and chilli.
What a wonderful aroma there was, Mr President!
Right at that moment, however, the gas ran out and there could be no more cooking.
That was a bit of a problem, and I wondered what would happen if there was no gas across the European Union.
The Mombauer report is therefore welcome and I voted in favour of it for this very reason.
Who knows how Europe would be affected, when it took so little to spoil a meal!
.
(PT) The Commission's proposal aims to implement natural gas supply measures, in the wake of recent crises or impending crises, particularly as a result of the United States' attacks on countries like Iraq.
There are so many relevant issues here that it is impossible to deal with all of them in this speech.
The Commission even attempts to appropriate the right to intervene in the workings of Member States, an ambition quashed by Parliament, thus ensuring that the Member States retain their prerogatives in this area and in relation to their international obligations.
As researchers suggest, the substance of these documents is not explicit but implied, the point being that world oil production has more or less peaked, or even passed its peak, and that although natural gas production may indeed continue to rise, it will peak in about 25 years at best. Both face inevitable decline.
In view of these facts, the establishment of a European Observation System for supply of hydrocarbons, charged with solving this key problem, could make a contribution, in particular, to our knowledge of the state of world stocks and to essential research into other energy sources, such as renewable ones.
.
(PT) As in the case of the concerns addressed by the Karlsson reports, which deal with a different set of substances, there can be no doubt that it would also be beneficial to begin aligning measures on securing natural gas supplies.
The enforced harmonisation proposed by the European Commission is an altogether different matter.
This harmonisation finds its highest expression in a power which the Commission would like to claim for itself: 'shall closely monitor the degree of new gas supply import contracts from non-EU countries' (Article 6(1) of the proposal).
Regrettably, the Commission's proposal is based on the assumption that, in a competitive market, security of supply cannot be entrusted to the sector responsible, an argument it takes too far.
For my part, I agree with the rapporteur that market operators - businesses and Member States, in other words - are perfectly capable of safeguarding security of supply.
Recent studies confirm this.
For that reason, I was forced to abstain.
I feel that the European Commission should respect the legal nature of the proposed legislation - a directive - and, therefore, suggest general minimum safeguards and precautions, which could then be adopted by the Member States and operators in this sector, with enough flexibility to accommodate the specific circumstances of each country, and with the political freedom to enact concrete legislation in that framework.
I was in my car - a Renault Scenic - taking a pleasure trip in the company of Miss Italy, that is the most beautiful woman in Italy, Miss France, that is the most beautiful woman in France, and Miss Spain, the most beautiful woman in Spain.
We were going to Madrid, where I took part recently in a meeting of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for a night on the town alla spagnola.
However, Mr President, at the height of the evening, we ran out of petrol.
Again, I thought: 'a bit of a problem this lack of petrol and petroleum.
What would have happened to the European Union if we had not thought - with the Karlsson report - of securing petroleum supply?
There would have been a real problem!'
As a result, I voted for the motion.
.
(PT) As in the Mombaur report on natural gas supply, the substance of this report too may be found not in its explicit concerns but in the underlying ones, namely in the fact that world petroleum production has more or less reached or even already passed its peak, and natural gas production will go the same way in time.
The report suggests various measures, which amount to a set of palliative steps.
This approach does not get to the heart of the matter or tackle the larger problem, which is our falling capacity to produce petroleum.
While the European Parliament's proposed Amendments Nos 2 and 5 point to the need to reduce the demand for petroleum, mentioning renewable energy sources, researchers claim that what is actually needed is a reduction in supply over time.
Various researchers claim that there is a need to bring demand into line with supply capacity, to restrain demand according to the rate at which the resource is being exhausted, thereby avoiding any imbalance.
Saying that demand 'must' be diversified and reduced is not enough.
We need to find an objective basis to substantiate that reduction.
A target for reducing consumption, something similar to Kyoto - not made into a mystery or a big deal - is a most essential and pressing requirement.
.
(PT) I voted in favour of the proposal for an amendment whose approval by a majority meant that the European Commission's proposal was rejected.
This really was the best solution, and will spare us a great deal of inconvenience and conflict.
It is not so much that I opposed the overall aims set out in the proposal, which do in fact respond to serious current concerns.
The problem, however, is that the European Commission was using those concerns to mask an attempt almost to assert its right to interfere directly in managing the Member States' energy resources and to nurture a desire to affect the market on its own account.
True, the rapporteur nevertheless attempted to introduce some 'damage limitation': he proposed more realistic transition periods (2007), he left it to the Member States to decide what percentage of stocks should be held by private or public bodies, and he removed the right to intervene if prices rise significantly (that right will apply only during supply crises).
After everything that happened in the specialist Parliamentary committee, however, and after the various proposed amendments were tabled, stiffening opposition to the Commission's ambitions still further, this was a predictable outcome, and a fortunate one, particularly if the principle of subsidiarity is to be respected.
.
(FR) I have tabled an amendment calling for the European Commission's proposal concerning the alignment of measures with regard to security of supply for petroleum products to be rejected.
I do not believe that this proposal would provide an appropriate or effective response in the event of an oil crisis.
Increasing the level of minimum stocks from 90 to 120 days would be an expensive measure to put in place in many States, due to the current inadequacy of stock infrastructures in the Union.
Furthermore, increasing the level of these stocks would not make a difference significant enough to give the Union a greater influence over the oil markets than the producer countries.
Lastly, setting up public oil stock bodies would impose substantial costs on the Member States whereas the European Commission would increase its intervention capacity for managing these stocks.
Such an approach, which deprives States of their powers in the field of managing energy supply is, therefore, unacceptable.
In rejecting this text, we have rejected an idea that wrongly appeared to be a good one, based on solutions that were both simplistic and ineffectual.
.
(PT) I am glad that this report met the fate it did, after the European Commission proposal addressed by the other Karlsson report was rejected.
I hope that the decision in plenary to refer the matter back to the specialist Parliamentary committee will allow for improvements to the text of the proposal for a directive.
It will need to become more realistic if this legislative process is to continue.
It is particularly important to consider the grave economic and financial repercussions of increasing the level of minimum stocks from 90 to 120 days, which would entail intolerable or unjustifiable management costs for various Member States.
The best strategy might perhaps be to leave this matter as it stands today and concentrate above all on promoting real mechanisms for linking stocks together, for encouraging a community of interest and connections between European energy networks.
.
(PT) This consultation procedure, which aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 40/94 on the Community trade mark, may seem unimportant.
That, however, is not the case.
There is in fact a relationship here between Community trade marks and designations of origin or geographical indications, which brings to mind the case of Limiano cheese, from Ponte de Lima, and even the question of wines.
That is why Amendments Nos 1 and 2 in this report are dangerous.
Although he states that a commercial trade mark may in no event be at the same time a geographical indication or designation of origin, the rapporteur also says that the indication or designation may be included in the trademark when the products covered have the right to bear it.
The problem with this is that it may lead to trade protection for trade marks belonging to a titular holder, usually a company, thus threatening the designation of origin, as in the case of Limiano cheese.
That is why we abstained from the vote.
Excuse me, Mr President, but I feel unwell here because of the shouting and the noise from the very large number of Members present, who are always attentive but this time chattering rather.
Well, I was on an aeroplane from Brussels going I do not know where.
I saw many passengers in first class being served copious, tasty, delicious repasts: champagne, beautiful hostesses and stewards serving them, armchairs, comfort ?
A dream, Mr President.
I approached them and asked them who they were to be travelling in such luxury on the plane.
'Ah' was the response, 'we are illegal immigrants and we are on this plane because we are being sent back to where we came from.
We are treated so well on the aeroplane, though, we like it so much, that we keep coming back and we keep being sent back to our country of origin.'
It was a dream, Mr President, because things are much less refined in reality; but it is good to take care of the comfort of illegal immigrants too when they are being returned by air to their state of origin.
.
(FR) We have supported Mr Kirkhope's report on the German initiative to increase cooperation between Member States when measures need to be adopted on the removal, by air, of third country nationals residing illegally in the Union.
These are useful, but relatively technical measures that, Mr Kirkhope, a former Secretary of State for immigration under the UK's last Conservative government, has nevertheless found it extremely difficult to admit to the Commission and the European Parliament.
We have heard, from the benches on the left, unreasonable speeches denouncing the 'deportations', 'inhumane methods' and 'mass expulsions'.
This is a view that is out of step with the reality of the situation, because these removal measures have a clear basis in the law.
In particular, these are not mass expulsions (expulsion of an entire social group without taking individuals into account). These are individual expulsions, overseen by the legal system, of persons in an illegal situation.
On this subject, the minority opinion of Mr Krivine, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and others, who see these expulsions as a 'violation of the rights of migrants', and who clearly wish to open Europe's borders to immigrants from the entire world, is quite enlightening.
.
(FR) We share the minority opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs condemning this report, which proposes to organise more effectively the deportation mechanisms applicable to migrants 'residing illegally'.
Parliament is asked to make the scope of the original initiative even harsher by removing a passage that rejects transit for the purpose of expulsion in the event that the expelled migrant 'faces the threat of inhumane or humiliating treatment, torture or death'.
By voting for this report, the European Parliament claims for itself and endorses the policy of most national States seeking to expel migrants for whom the local authorities refuse to grant the necessary papers.
We, on the other hand, call for a complete halt to deportations, the immediate release of all persons being detained pending deportation and for all those in Europe without residence permits to be given the permanent right to remain.
.
(PT) This initiative by the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to adopting a Directive on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air - which is to say expulsion by air of people accused of being 'illegal immigrants' - is one of a set of initiatives and measures whose aim is to build 'Fortress Europe'.
As the group of honourable Members who put their names to the 'Minority Opinion' appended to the report point out, the real objective of this initiative is to make a cynical attempt to improve and render more effective the machinery for expelling people accused of 'illegal' residence, with as little resistance as possible.
An amendment seeking to safeguard the rights described in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms has been tabled, by inserting a clause. This amendment does not change the fact that the status quo will now de facto - if not de jure - violate the rights of men and women migrating in search of a better life.
It is impossible, and even intolerable in human terms, to address the tragic situation of thousands and thousands of men and women by applying repressive measures designed to increase security.
.
(PT) I voted in favour of this report.
Assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air is a sufficiently important issue to justify laying down a code of conduct and clear provisions on the rights and responsibilities of transit states, as well as of the escorts accompanying third-country nationals during expulsion.
The state of 'legal limbo' in which both states and escorts accompanying persons in the process of being expelled found themselves was of no help in defining their roles and responsibilities.
I cannot, however, support minority arguments which irresponsibly advocate lifting all border restrictions.
If I may, moreover, refer ironically to one of the rapporteur's proposals, I do not consider it 'inappropriate' to refer to third-country nationals as 'persons', because that is what we all actually are, regardless of our nationality.
That is exactly why it is justifiable to insert clauses forbidding transit when there is a risk of any third-country national suffering inhumane or humiliating treatment, torture or the death penalty, or when his or her life or freedom is threatened on grounds of race, religion, nationality, social group or political conviction.
.
(FR) Instead of being concerned with security, the text now before us seeks to regulate the conditions of transit for persons residing illegally within Union territory and subject to an expulsion order.
Already rejected in April and referred back to committee, this proposal for a directive has clearly caused an outcry amongst the far left, the greens and the third world activists for one simple reason: it is immoral and inhumane to expel illegally-residing foreigners to their country of origin!
Consequently, these individuals do not hesitate, in the minority opinion appended to Mr Kirkhope's report, to express their horror and denounce fortress Europe and even the deportation mechanisms illustrating the cynicism of a racist policy that places state interests above people's interests in a better life.
This might appear to be funny but the fact is that we are sick and tired of hearing endless repetitions of all these speeches stuffed with human rights diatribes, these fine sentiments which mean that throughout Europe today, we are seeing the same things, such as uncontrolled immigration and States that are swamped and no longer know what to do with their illegal immigrants and whose only solution is to open temporary accommodation centres, which are temporary in name only.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Once again, whilst I was taking part in a programme on a major Italian commercial television channel and was answering the questions of pensioners who were asking me for information on how to claim their pensions, being so used to giving such replies, I fell asleep whilst we were on air.
I saw again Fatuzzo the seafarer who, aged 20, was sailing a magnificent cruise ship from New York to the Bahamas and back - the good ship Oceanic - flying a European flag: there were dances, elegant clothes, money being spent everywhere.
In short, a trip on a luxury ship, and - unlike the Titanic - in complete safety.
Mr Sterckx has done a good job with this report, but I voted against it because, despite its good intentions, it does not succeed in ensuring this safety.
I would also like to ask when we will have the security of always being able to draw our pensions?
Mr President, earlier this year I visited Galicia to see the environmental catastrophe that was the wreck of the Prestige.
The only word to describe it is devastation.
In particular it was very distressing to see the seabirds; the endangered Galician guillemot is even more seriously threatened now because of this.
It is true that mistakes were made in the early stages and a lot of these mistakes were due to confusion between the regional and national governments.
I am concerned that this inquiry will not be constructive but will be used by the Left in Spain as a stick to beat the government.
We already know the facts, we do not need a post-mortem.
We need rapid action to ban rust-buckets like the Prestige and we also need to defend sensitive coastlines, for example the Beverley and Holderness coastline in my region.
That is the reason we voted against this report.
.
(EL) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution, which makes provision for a series of important measures for safety at sea, such as:
the creation of refuges for ships in distress,
the creation of a European coastguard for strict monitoring, compliance with rules and prosecution of persons responsible,
frequent surveys of high-risk ships,
the creation of a special anti-pollution fleet,
the creation of special zones for ecologically sensitive areas.
.
(FR) The sinking of the Prestige, which caused a large-scale environmental and economic disaster, is a cruel reminder of how crucial it is to attach the utmost priority to maritime safety at both European and world level.
We must rapidly adopt an entire range of measures designed to prevent future accidents similar to that of the Prestige.
Heading the list of these measures are implementing the Community and international legislation in force and monitoring compliance with these regulations.
The measures set out in the two Erika packages must be implemented without delay.
These agreements, which have already been concluded, can be built on and they will be built on more effectively if those working in the fishing and fish farming industries are involved in the negotiations.
This disaster is not, therefore, as some would have us believe, 'just' a Spanish matter.
I believe it is crucial to set up a temporary committee.
This is indeed crucial if we are to prevent similar disasters from occurring again, to find out the causes and the consequences of what has happened as objectively as possible: what is at stake is Parliament's credibility and the dynamic role that Europe must play in the field of maritime safety.
.
(FR) I have voted for Mr Sterckx's report, which provides a detailed overview of the information currently available on the Prestige accident and whose proposals have proven to be appropriate.
Member States must indeed transpose the Erika legislation into their national legal systems as quickly as possible and ensure that it is complied with.
If these rules had entered into force sooner, the sinking of the Prestige could have been avoided.
By the same token, international legislation in force must be strictly observed and monitored.
On the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle, I support the rapporteur's idea of criminal liability applying to all actors involved, including the political decision-makers, in maritime disasters.
It is of the utmost importance that all Member States ratify the protocol on additional International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC) totalling EUR one billion for the compensation of victims from 2004 onwards.
I am, however, unhappy that the compensation fund for victims of oil spills in European waters (COPE) is blocked in Council, when it would have enabled the victims of the Prestige and perhaps of other disasters to be compensated quickly.
A high level of compensation must be assured for the victims of maritime disasters, this must be provided by means of the IOPC fund, with the COPE fund being able to provide a more flexible method of European participation.
.
(PT) The Parliamentary committee incorporated some of our proposals into the report.
They were:
the need for Member States to have at their disposal the appropriate means for carrying out checks, which should be achieved by increasing the number of inspectors and improving their working conditions and methods;
the importance of qualified seafarers, in order to ensure that the required preventive maintenance of vessels is carried out;
the existence, aboard vessels carrying dangerous goods, of means for instantly combating small-scale pollution;
providing safe havens with the appropriate means for implementing the relevant emergency plans.
Some important proposals were rejected, however, including the following:
tabling a proposal on the social, living and working conditions of seafarers.
These conditions are to be respected aboard ship;
delegating the authority to award qualifications to companies which have the technical expertise needed for the job, and which are independent of shipowners;
setting up a European Parliament committee of inquiry.
The votes in plenary, however, went in favour of setting up a temporary committee, which shows that our stance did eventually prevail, in a sense.
That is why we voted in favour of the report.
.
(FR) I have voted in favour of this report.
There is absolutely no question here of one Member State in particular being targeted; what we are trying to do is to become aware of the loopholes that exist in the implementation of the Erika I and Erika II packages, to discover the reasons for the delays in the texts' transposition and to resolve them.
There is still a considerable risk of seeing 'floating dustbins' - genuine weapons of mass destruction - continuing to pollute our coastlines, destroy our beaches, attack our fisheries resources, massacre birds and bring our economies to a standstill.
As we know, such destruction cannot be repaired simply by throwing subsidies at it.
The European Union does, however, have a legislative arsenal at its disposal in the field of maritime safety.
These texts must be transposed, harmonised and fully implemented.
There has been too much shilly-shallying.
Today, no State with a coastline should fail to respond to this call, and this is why I have voted the way I have.
Lastly, I wish to make an observation on the possible establishment of a European coastguard service.
I am in favour of such a development.
- (FR) Let us hope that the provisions recommended by this report do not suffer the same fate as the Erika and the Prestige.
Since 1999, there have been countless reports on safety at sea.
The Erika packages only entered partially into force on 23 July 2003.
It would have been heartening to see the European Union being as diligent in its fight against the 'sea thugs' as in its fight against terrorism.
Now, the oil from the Prestige continues each day to pollute the whole of the Atlantic coast up to the Channel.
Moreover, there are still more than 37 500 tonnes of heating oil in the wreck.
We have supported the principle of a parliamentary committee of inquiry to shed as much light as possible on the ways in which responsibility for this disaster is to be apportioned.
Above and beyond this, however, we have to outlaw the liberal logic that, thanks to the system of flags of convenience, permits the use of dustbin vessels and the exploitation of sailors outside the framework of any social legislation.
We are voting in favour of this report because it strengthens the safety rules by demanding an increase in the number of ships inspected, the training of crews and the unlimited liability, in the event of disaster, of the oil companies and of the whole 'flagships of convenience' chain.
What is missing, however, is a system of monitoring and penalties that gives effective expression to everything for which we are voting in this House.
.
(PT) The sinking of the Prestige oil tanker off the coast of Galicia on 19 November 2002 caused a huge ecological and economic disaster, to which, I am very glad to say, Parliament devoted its full attention from the beginning.
A Parliamentary delegation, of which I was a member, travelled to Galicia in March of this year and observed the scale of the disaster at first hand.
I therefore share the concerns expressed by the Commission and by the Members of this House about maritime safety.
I appeal to all parties to make firm commitments in the vital area of maritime safety, since the quality and safety of vessels sailing in European waters, and of European vessels the world over, depends on them, as does protecting the coasts and citizens of Europe from further disasters.
Safety is down to us all and demands all our commitment!
I am speaking, moreover, as Member for a region where many of the shipping lanes running between the Americas and Europe come together, and which is thus extremely vulnerable to this type of disaster.
The island of Porto Santo has already suffered the terrible consequences of such accidents.
Let us hope that these measures will mean that my region or any other will experience them NEVER AGAIN.
. (NL) The world pays the price for keeping maritime transport artificially cheap.
Ships from rich countries sail under the flags of poor countries, with minimum taxation and minimum protection for the crews, who are paid at developing-world levels.
The ships are inspected on a commercial basis and by agencies who are in competition with one another and who fear that they will lose their customers if they are too strict.
The coastal states try to limit the problem of cargo loss and shipping disasters by keeping transport in which they themselves have no interest as far as possible away from their coast.
In the case of the wreck of the tanker Prestige off the coast of Galicia, the disaster was made worse by the Spanish authorities chasing the ship away from the coast instead of quickly accommodating it in a safe haven.
Now, six months after the disaster, there is still oil coming up from the sunken wreck.
The Spanish Government is persisting in its mismanagement and the rapporteur has largely chosen to ignore this.
I support his proposals to promote safe havens, make guidance by pilots compulsory, encourage investigation, refrain from criminalising seafarers, make the polluter pay compensation and give money for cleaning up oil-covered animals.
They remain inadequate, however, as long as companies chase after maximum profits and countries try to keep costs to a minimum.
.
(PT) I supported this report and cast my final vote in its favour, in line with the speech I made during the debate.
It is deplorable that the socialists and other left-wing Members should have rejected the proposal for an oral amendment, tabled by the rapporteur himself just before the vote on a sensitive amendment - Amendment No 11, on the setting up of a temporary committee - which might have produced an even broader consensus on the final wording of this excellent and comprehensive report.
Sadly, the European left is still more interested in petty political chicanery, serving the interests of sectarian squabbles within Spain, than in serving the common interest effectively.
Developments such as the adoption of Amendment No 23, whose partisan language is unmistakeable, prove as much.
Despite all of this, I voted in favour of the report, and of Amendment No 11 in the rapporteur's original formulation.
The coasts of Portugal are always vulnerable in these situations.
This is true both of the mainland (which was nearly struck by the Prestige disaster) and of Madeira and the Azores.
Clearly, we must always be in the vanguard in matters of maritime security, therefore, and in making progress and substantial demands in this field.
Congratulations once again to the rapporteur on his excellent work.
- (FR) Marine safety must be reinforced in Europe.
It must even become a priority. Otherwise, there is the risk of seeing, in the near future, all our seas and oceans polluted, as the Atlantic coast is by the successive losses of the Erika and Prestige oil tankers.
That is why the Member States must, as soon as possible, withdraw from service the single-hulled tankers that are often the cause of disasters, but also make port inspections more stringent and impose stricter rules upon the companies that issue certificates of seaworthiness.
In short, they must apply the Erika package of December 1999 indefinitely.
That is why, too, I have voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Sterckx.
It includes a whole series of innovative measures to prevent oil slicks and effectively combat them: a European coastguard service, a victim compensation fund and ports of refuge made available for welcoming ships 'in distress'.
I have also voted in favour of setting up a temporary parliamentary commission to cast as much light as possible upon the Prestige disaster, to discover who was responsible and to take action for the future.
In this way, it will, once and for all, be the polluter who genuinely pays, as it is in the United States with its Oil Pollution Act.
- (FR) I am delighted by the decision just taken by our Assembly to create, as I myself had requested, a temporary commission of the European Parliament devoted to safety at sea.
This decision shows how important it is for us that this issue - which is of profound concern to our fellow citizens, particularly those on the Atlantic coast who have been doubly hit by the last two oil slicks - should be handled, at the appropriate levels, with all the rigour and consistency required, in order to prevent the occurrence of other, similar disasters.
The mandate of this temporary commission would have been perfectly clear and would have appeared devoid of petty political ulterior motives if the oral amendment presented by the rapporteur had not been the subject of genuine obstruction by the socialist MEPs.
On a subject as important as this, petty manoeuvring should not be acceptable.
Whatever the case, it is, in actual fact, following the double disaster of the Erika and the Prestige that it appears necessary to take stock of the relevance of the measures adopted, of the initiatives taken by the Member States and regions affected by the oil slicks, of the issues of liability and compensation and, above all, of the persistent gaps in international law concerning ships in transit outside territorial waters.
.
(PT) Water quality in seas and rivers throughout Europe and all over the world is crucial to people's welfare.
Political decision-making should not be faltering, fragile or equivocal.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament should assume a united, clear and unbending stance to ensure that cases like the Prestige disaster do not happen again.
Never again!
We cannot and must not underestimate the value of strengthening vessels' hulls, monitoring their routes (shipping lanes), a high degree of professionalism among their crews, moving shipping lanes further out to sea, and of using corridors correctly.
- (FR) I voted in favour of the creation of a temporary commission, for it is evident that we must maintain absolute vigilance on the subject of safety at sea in Europe, so that the measures we adopt in this House might be fully and effectively applied in the Member States.
That must be the purpose of a temporary commission, which will only be of use if it endeavours to improve Community legislation and to check that it is being applied.
The Prestige disaster hit our coasts and our populations hard.
A temporary commission will certainly have lessons to draw from this tragedy, but certainly not lessons to give to any government.
This petty political objective, which has been pursued by a number of left-wing MEPs, has unfortunately sullied the conclusions of Mr Sterckx's report.
I regret this all the more, given that, following the loss of the Erika, our Parliament had marked itself out by its non-partisan work.
Out of respect for the victims, in Spain and France, of the oil slick from the Prestige, I hope that we shall fittingly pursue our work in the interests of safety at sea.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Mr President, I would like to register my formal protest.
I had to be in my constituency early this morning, which is not far away - around 150 km - and would have arrived in time for the vote had it not been for the demonstrations that were being held in front of the building.
This is why I did not arrive here until half way through the Sterckx report and missed most of the roll-call votes.
I would ask you formally, Mr President, to discuss in the Bureau how it can be ensured that Members are not prevented from attending the vote.
In terms of my journey time, I should have arrived punctually, but this was impossible due to the demonstrations blocking access to the building.
Most parliaments in the European Union have laws defining a zone around parliament where demonstrations are prohibited.
Unfortunately, we do not have anything of the kind here, and apart from the matter of my expenses, the Bureau should give serious thought to this issue and how we can ensure that Members are not prevented from attending votes.
I know that in Westminster, which you know well, it is an offence to prevent a Member from voting.
I have been prevented from taking part in at least five roll-call votes today, and I want this to be noted specifically.
I will certainly make sure that your complaint appears in the Minutes and is raised in the Bureau.
I will point out to the services that you were present, but not voting, during the vote on the Sterckx report.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Mr Staes has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, we were all a little hasty because we did not want to delay the forthcoming debate on the submission of the budget needlessly.
I have a genuine procedural motion.
I am making a point of order as I think that the Conference of Presidents and the President of this Parliament are violating the Rules of Procedure, in particular Article 3 of Annex XIII.
Yesterday, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, sent the President of this Parliament, Mr Cox, a letter setting out how the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the members of the Conference of Presidents should debate the documents on the current investigation into Eurostat.
Mr Prodi drew up a form for this purpose in accordance with Annex 3, Article 3.2, Line 2.
With one exception, that is the least strict rule, in accordance with which we will be looking at the matter behind closed doors tomorrow evening.
According to the agreement between Parliament and the Commission, however, the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission have to negotiate on this.
I would therefore like to ask Mr Cox and the Conference of Presidents to argue for a more favourable regulation.
My second comment is that the meeting between the Conference of Presidents, the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is to take place behind closed doors next Thursday.
All the people from the press in the room downstairs tell me, however, that Mr Prodi's spokesman said that if Parliament wants this meeting to take place in public, it can be.
I think that it is befitting for our dignity and is also in our interest to ask most emphatically that this meeting be held in public.
I think that all citizens of Europe are entitled to this and that it would be counterproductive if it were not to happen.
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr President, to put these two questions to Mr Cox very emphatically.
I will be extremely grateful to you for doing so.
Mr Staes, I take note and naturally your comments will be communicated to President Cox, but I would remind you that that procedure is not a decision by Mr Prodi, but a decision by the Conference of Presidents of Political Groups, including yours, on the procedure for dealing with the issue.
Your comments will therefore be passed on but please be aware what the basis for it has been.
No, thank you, I will not enter into debates.
Mr Parish has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, on a point of order, I am sure you will be aware of the recent announcement by the UK Electoral Commission that the people of Gibraltar should vote in the South-West of the United Kingdom at the next European Elections, following a decision by the European Court.
Will you join with me in welcoming an end to the historic wrong that has denied the people of Gibraltar a voice in Europe?
I should like to ask you to write, on behalf of this Parliament, to Mr Peter Caruana, the First Minister of Gibraltar, offering his citizens a warm welcome and congratulating them on their hard-fought campaign to secure their rightful democratic representation in Europe.
Mr Parish, I take good note and I will be very happy when the citizens of Gibraltar can vote for the Westminster Parliament first.
The next item is the presentation by Council of the draft general budget for 2004.
Mr Magri, President-in-Office of the Council, will take the floor first.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and privilege for me to present, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, the draft budget of the European Communities for the year 2004, as established by the Council on 18 July 2003.
The budget for the year 2004 is of historic significance, first and foremost because it takes into account the enlargement of the European Union to 25 States next May.
The preparation of the institutions for enlargement started with the current budget.
At the same time, this is the first budget to be established according to the new Activity-Based Budgeting presentation.
The draft budget that I am going to present to you incorporates a number of items that were discussed at length during the traditional conciliation meeting last July.
I am sure that cooperation in budgetary matters, as set out by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, initiated with trialogues and the July conciliation meeting, will continue for the rest of the year, and that it will allow the two arms of the budgetary authority, with the assistance of the Commission, to adopt a budget for 2004 which is satisfactory in all respects by the end of this budgetary procedure.
The Council used the preliminary draft budget of the European Communities submitted by the Commission on 30 April as the basis for establishing the draft budget.
The preliminary draft budget contained figures for the 25-Member State Union but, for purely legal reasons, the Council adopted a draft budget for 2004 for the 15-Member State Union, while also agreeing on a position for the 25-Member State Union with a view to achieving a political agreement with the European Parliament by the end of the budgetary procedure.
The figures concerning the draft budget established by the Council that I will mention today thus relate to the 15-Member State Union.
The transition to a budget for the 25-Member State Union will then be made during the first part of 2004 by means of a specific amending budget.
The Council established a draft budget for 2004 that includes commitment appropriations for a total of EUR 100.066 billion.
This represents an increase of 0.4% over the 2003 budget.
It should be noted that this is the first time that the draft budget has exceeded the EUR 100 billion mark in commitments.
It includes payment appropriations for a total of EUR 95.034 billion. This represents a decrease of 2.54% on the 2003 figure.
The total payment appropriations provided for in the draft budget amount to 0.98% of Community Gross National Income.
The draft budget for 2004 established by the Council takes into due consideration the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure.
Moreover, it is fully in line with the Council's conclusions on the budget guidelines for 2004 adopted in March 2003.
Lastly, it takes into account the conclusions of the conciliation meeting of 16 July 2003 between the European Parliament and the Council, with the participation of the European Commission.
In particular, we endeavoured to comply with the annual expenditure ceilings set by the Financial Perspective for 2002-2006, to leave, where possible, adequate margins below the ceiling for the various headings, with the exception of headings 2 and 7, and, lastly, to provide sufficient funding for the European Union's various priorities.
Concerning more specific points, the Council made some changes to the nomenclature proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget and, as in the past, rejected the inclusion of the European Development Fund in the general budget.
Generally speaking, it followed the classification proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, while emphasising that all expenditure concerning pensions, the common agricultural policy, veterinary and plant health, and international fisheries agreements constitute compulsory expenditure pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement.
In addition to the above, the Council was guided by the following principles in establishing the draft budget for 2004: examination in the autumn, as provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement, of an amending letter concerning agricultural expenditure, in order to take account of the updated estimates of requirements, without immediately ruling out a reduction in appropriations for agricultural expenditure.
The letter of amendment should also take into account the effects of the revision of the common agricultural policy and any requirements related thereto.
The second guiding principle was honouring of the commitments written into the Financial Perspective for structural measures.
Regarding the level of payment appropriations, the Council, like last year, invited the Commission to present a preliminary draft amending budget if the appropriations included in the 2004 budget for the Structural Funds - as well as for agricultural expenditure - prove insufficient to cover the payments to be made.
Moreover, the Council noted that the payment appropriations included in the 2004 budget concerning programming periods prior to 2002 are intended for financing measures which have been suspended for legal reasons and similar situations.
The third principle was the identification of genuine requirements within the financial envelope for internal policies, taking into account the possibilities for implementation of appropriations and bearing in mind the need to maintain a margin below the ceiling for that heading of the Financial Perspective.
The Council applied the same principle when deciding on amounts for external action.
In this connection, the Council asked the Commission not to pre-programme the equivalent of 15% of the appropriations for humanitarian aid.
Concerning, more specifically, the common foreign and security policy budget, what is known as the CFSP budget, the Council included in the draft budget a CFSP budget amounting to EUR 52.6 million in commitment and payment appropriations, transferring EUR 2 million for the peace and stabilisation process - budget line 19 03 03 - to line 19 07 04 and also creating a new line to contain appropriations (transferred from the Council's section of the budget) for the Special Representatives.
The new line for Special Representatives is allocated EUR 3.1 million.
A fifth principle was the acceptance of the preliminary draft budget for expenditure on pre-accession aid concerning commitment appropriations.
Regarding the level of payment appropriations, the Council has asked the Commission to submit a preliminary draft amending budget if the payment appropriations entered in the 2004 budget for pre-accession aid are insufficient to cover the payments to be made.
Finally, with regard to administrative expenditure, the Council stresses the importance of maintaining a sufficient margin below the ceiling of heading 5 of the Financial Perspective in line with sound financial management.
While agreeing to a rigorous approach for heading 5, the Council stressed that the appropriations and the items necessary for the success of enlargement should be provided for in the 2004 budget.
The end result must, without a doubt, be a margin very close to the margin which resulted from the Council's first reading.
The Council considers that the opportunity afforded by the accession of ten new Member States should be exploited and additional endeavours made to increase the effectiveness of the organisational structures and management of the institutions.
I must also add that the Council reserves the right, as provided for in the budgetary procedure, to return to the question of the posts requested by the Commission, provided that the Commission presents new arguments, in particular as regards vacant posts.
In the establishment of the draft budget, there was particular focus on the possibilities for implementation of the appropriations.
Thus, in deciding the amount of payment appropriations to be entered in the draft budget, the Council duly took into account the rate of implementation of previous years.
Concerning the rate of growth of the overall payment appropriations, the Council stresses, in particular, the importance of budgetary discipline and sound financial management, and the need to keep the rate of increase of the overall payment appropriations as low as possible, taking into account the results of its first reading.
Recent examples of huge surpluses and reimbursements of unused payment appropriations should certainly guide us in the direction of sensible budgeting with regard to the total amount of payment appropriations, resulting in realistic estimations of payment appropriations which are genuinely needed during the budgetary year.
The Council's concern regarding the level of payment appropriations is even more understandable and important in the current economic climate, in which - as you are all aware - national budgets are facing serious difficulties.
As you have all received a comprehensive explanatory memorandum, I do not think that it is necessary to make a detailed presentation now.
However, I would like to underline the main points of this draft budget in the fields covered by the different headings of the Financial Perspective:
As regards heading 1, relating to agricultural expenditure, the Council has accepted an across-the-board cut of EUR 160 million in the appropriations requested in the preliminary draft budget for all budget lines under subheading 1a - Market expenditure - where the amount of appropriations is greater than EUR 1 billion.
This reduction is in line with the overall approach of controlled growth of payment appropriations.
I must stress the fact that this approach concerns both headings that include compulsory expenditure and headings that include non-compulsory expenditure, like subheading 1a.
As regards subheading 1b, dealing with rural development, the Council has accepted the amounts proposed by the Commission.
Regarding heading 2, relating to structural operations, commitment appropriations have been fully budgeted as proposed by the Commission, in accordance with the conclusions of the March 1999 Berlin European Council.
Concerning payment appropriations, an across-the-board reduction of EUR 138 million has been applied for the budget lines concerning Community initiatives, due to the under-implementation of corresponding budget headings in previous years.
Moreover, EUR 22 million in payment appropriations proposed by the Commission for the scrapping of fishing vessels have not been accepted, consistently with the rejection of corresponding commitment appropriations in 2003.
As regards heading 3, concerning internal policies, the Council has accepted the amounts proposed by the Commission for the 15-Member State Union relating to multiannual programmes adopted under the codecision procedure.
As regards appropriations included in the draft budget relating to codecided programmes for the 25-Member State Union, I must, of course, stress that they are provisional, pending an agreement on new reference amounts, which are currently under discussion.
In addition, it has increased the proposed amounts for some budget lines that are not based on multiannual programmes.
Appropriations have also been reduced for subsidies for a number of agencies while, at the same time, account has been taken of the special situation of agencies that are new or starting up.
It has decided not to accept two new areas of preparatory actions relating to chemical products and to the security of supply of conventional forms of energy.
At the same time, the Council has accepted only partially the new preparatory action for European security research.
It has decided on an increase in appropriations for the Argo programme, to take account of the conclusions of the European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003, for the forest protection programmes and for Prince, an information programme, specifically the part dealing with the promotion of the European Union's role in the world.
I feel that the Council has provided adequate funding for priorities within heading 3.
A margin of EUR 77.78 million has been left below the ceiling of the heading, allowing the European Parliament to finance its own priorities and preserving the possibility of financing future requirements.
As regards heading 4, relating to external action, I can assure you that the Council has accepted the appropriations proposed by the Commission across the board.
However, the Council has reduced some appropriations, making small cuts in a limited number of non-geographical budget lines; it has made a slight cut in the appropriations for geographical headings other than those relating to the Balkans, for which the amount entered in the preliminary draft budget has been accepted.
It has accepted the amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget for the CFSP budget, together with two transfers of appropriations, one from the CFSP budget to transitional civilian administrations for the Stability Pact and the other from the Council budget to the CFSP budget, giving a final total for the CFSP budget of EUR 52.6 million, as already explained.
It has also accepted the appropriations proposed by the Commission for international fisheries agreements.
The Council has left a margin of EUR 145.95 million below the ceiling of heading 4, allowing the European Parliament to finance its own priorities and ensuring that it will be possible to finance future needs.
As regards heading 5, relating to administrative expenditure, the Council's scrutiny of the institutions' administrative expenditure was based on the following principles.
One: leaving an adequate margin within the ceiling under heading 5, in the interests of sound financial management.
This margin should incorporate an amount for the future budget of the European Data Protection Supervisor.
Two: making allowance, in expenditure, for the impact of the revision of the Staff Regulations following the political agreement reached within the Council on 19 May 2003.
Three: limiting the increase in current expenditure to 2.7% in 2003, this being the maximum rate of increase for the 15-Member State Union.
Four: accepting exceptional expenditure put forward by institutions, such as the move of the Commission to the Berlaymont building or the replacement of members of the Commission or of the Court of Justice.
Five: not accepting the creation of new posts or upgrading of posts for ordinary purposes, save in exceptional cases.
Six: accepting all the new posts requested for enlargement according to language requirements; the minor reductions in other posts requested were mainly for C and D posts; the period for which posts approved have been budgeted for in the draft budget is 6 months.
Seven: accepting most of the appropriations requested for enlargement.
Eight: accepting the pensions appropriations, after making allowance for the impact of the revision of the Staff Regulations.
Nine: placing in reserve the appropriations intended for subsidies under the former Chapter A-30, in the absence of legal bases, which are currently under discussion.
The result is that a margin of EUR 128.45 million is left below the ceiling for heading 5.
I will end my presentation of the different headings of the Financial Perspective with heading 7, relating to pre-accession instruments, for which the draft budget includes the proposed commitment appropriations.
As regards payment appropriations, the Council requested a cut of EUR 100 million, in order to take into account underimplementation in previous years.
In conclusion, I think that this draft budget provides adequate funding for the European Union's various priorities while, at the same time, preparing the Union and its institutions so that enlargement can take place under the best possible conditions.
We all know that this budgetary procedure is only at the beginning and that there is still a long way to go until the final adoption of the budget for 2004 in December.
I believe that all the necessary conditions are there for a satisfactory budget to be achieved at the end of the year.
I am sure that all three Institutions represented here today - European Parliament, Council and Commission - will do their utmost to give the European Union the necessary means to take up the challenges that await us, bearing in mind that this budget is ultimately financed, as always, by the citizens of the European Union.
In particular, I hope that we will reach agreement not only on the 2004 budget for the 15-Member State Union but also on the figures that will be entered in an amending budget for the 25-Member State Union to be adopted in 2004, so that the integration of the new Members States into the Union will be a success.
. Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Magri for his speech.
I do not need to remind Members that this is the last budget of this Parliament.
If we look back over the last four years, we can see that there have been significant changes to the way in which the budgetary procedure has taken place.
Those of us who have been here for a long time have seen many changes, not least in the relationship between Parliament and Council.
We now have a minister who will sit here for three hours or so in a budgetary debate, as we had last year, which says a lot about the Council.
At one time we never saw a Council minister here at this point in the budget process.
I say that to be complimentary, not to be insulting.
There have been a lot of cultural changes in the way the process has evolved.
I suppose that we are now less confrontational.
There is now more codecision between the two arms of the budgetary authority, especially when we talk about the flexibility instrument.
The conciliation process that takes place in November each year is a real conciliation.
I am not too sure whether the July conciliation still serves much purpose, but the November conciliation proves its worth.
There has been respect on both sides for the fact that we are the two arms of the budgetary authority.
I hope that the changes we have seen over the past four years will be taken forward when the Convention is finally ratified and Parliament given its rightful place as one arm of the budgetary authority, thereby maintaining its strategic role for future years.
Over these last four years I have had the pleasure of being Chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
This will probably be my last budget as Chairman - I hear one or two boos at the back there - but I am looking forward to seeing this budget through.
It has been non-stop ever since we were elected in 1999.
The first thing we had to do was try to get an agreement on the flexibility instrument for the rebuilding of Kosovo.
That was quickly followed by successive discussions and arguments with the Council about how to fund Serbia, Afghanistan, the notorious fisheries agreement, and even this year we had the problem of Category 5 and how we were going to fund the administration expenditure that was needed.
This period has not been without its moments.
At the beginning of this year, someone asked me whether there were any problems ahead for the 2004 budget.
In a moment of weakness I said, 'no, not really'.
That is, however, if we do not include enlargement, potential problems with Iraq later on or activity-based budgeting.
But, since we do have to include these matters, we have to try and sort them all out.
All those issues need to be resolved.
The 2004 budget will be far from easy for a variety of reasons, firstly because it is in the ABB - activity-based budgeting - format.
The fact is that we now have to vote in a different way for a different structure, and hopefully get it right, as well as deal with enlargement.
We are voting on a new structure and then we will be voting for 10, 15 or 25 countries, depending on the way you look at it.
It will be difficult because of the different amendments from the groups and committees, not least including the extremely interesting amendment by the PPE-DE Group requesting EUR 500 million for the rebuilding of Iraq.
I will touch on that shortly.
The new Financial Regulation is also complicating matters, especially the A-30 lines.
Whilst these matters are just peanuts, they seem to take up a lot of time in the committees, as every member of the Committee on Budgets knows.
There is also the real question of what the real needs of enlargement are, especially within the institutions.
How do we determine that reality from the proposals of the Commission as well as of all the other institutions?
The two rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill, have striven manfully to try to get answers to that - I am not excluding Parliament here either.
The fact is that this budget has to ensure that enlargement is a success and that we treat the applicant countries as equal partners and not as second-class cousins.
We have to ensure that this is done correctly.
We also have to ensure that, within this new format, this debate is meaningful.
Let us hope these next few hours give a real chance for dialogue and trialogue between our three institutions.
In the pursuit of solutions, it is important to address questions to the institutions, rather than to produce formal set-piece statements.
I should like to start that ball rolling in relation to the amendment from the PPE-DE Group that I mentioned earlier.
I will be interested to know how the Commission and the Council would react if we voted through this amendment to give an extra EUR 500 million next year for the rebuilding of Iraq.
. Mr President, as we have heard, the 2004 budget will have some profound changes as a result of the historic enlargement due to take place in May 2004.
My objective has been to balance the needs of the institutions so that they can fulfil their tasks and equip themselves to meet the challenges that will be presented by an EU of 25 Member States.
At the same time, however, we must ensure that the principles of budgetary rigour and prudence are at the core of all our budgetary decisions.
The budget will present the other institutions with major challenges, because it will significantly change many of them.
Some of the institutions will receive additional 50% increases in their budgets, which will lead to doubling or trebling of the staff within them.
This will require sensitive and intensive management to absorb this change seamlessly.
Therefore, I would like to start by welcoming the submission of the Third Report of the Secretaries-General on the evolution of Heading 5.
This has become a useful tool for the decision-making process, and although we have an annual budgetary procedure, it is important to be aware of the likely multi-annual situation, so that the right strategic choices can be made, for example in buildings and staff policy.
I would like to remind everybody that we call upon the Commission and the other institutions that we have this annual report submitted to us by 1 September every year.
The Council's reading of the 2004 budget has been quite a surprise.
I am totally perplexed by the Council's approach: there does not appear to be a clear strategy other than the doubling of the margin.
On the one hand, the Council continues to apply an across-the-board approach, of which the Parliament has always been critical.
In the past we have said that the Council made horizontal cuts in the institutions without looking into real needs.
This has happened again this year on the Commission's budget.
On the other hand, however, the Council has been surprisingly generous, to the extent that I have to question whether all requests that it has endorsed are well justified.
This year it will be for the Parliament to ensure that the budgetary rigour is applied and a more critical examination of needs is undertaken.
Therefore, I would like to ask the President-in-Office's opinion about the approach that I have taken on his decisions.
We will be proposing to put money in reserve for two committees - about a million euro for each committee - and to cut back further posts in most of the other budgets.
My concern is that the Council has agreed to everything to do with enlargement, and enlargement should have resulted in greater economies of scale.
I am a firm supporter of enlargement, but that does not mean that everything that is demanded is required.
It is important that we do not have 'carte blanche' as regards enlargement and at the same time reject existing posts and existing staff policy issues - such as upgrading - which are important for the staff who are already working.
We need to have a balance here.
I do not wish to go into detail on all of the Council's decisions, but I do want to ask about buildings, which is the second biggest item of expenditure after staff.
I want to understand the Council's strategy.
We have always agreed on a policy of purchasing the premises of European institutions because it tends to give greater value for money to the European taxpayer, therefore we need to look at building expenditure, taking a multi-annual approach rather than a piecemeal approach, and to try to purchase the buildings as soon as possible.
We know that the margin in Heading 5 will be under pressure from 2006 or 2007 onwards.
However, we have a considerable margin in 2004.
I was disappointed that the Council rejected my proposal to use this to finance buildings to cater for enlargement.
This would lead to more savings, including savings for taxpayers.
On buildings we do not need piecemeal solutions, we need to take a multi-annual strategic approach.
My next question is to the Commission.
It is about the importance of the adoption of the new Staff Regulation.
This issue has been dragging on for some time and it has implications for all institutions and for our staff.
However, all the establishment plans in the budget pertain to the old Staff Regulation, so I call on the Commission today to confirm that it will propose an amending budget for the implementation of new Staff Regulations and what the likely timing of this may be, because next year, with the elections, the parliamentary calendar will be restricted.
Finally, I would like to call upon all the other institutions to take account of some of the changes and demands affecting them in the light of enlargement.
They should start planning now and start introducing controls that are absolutely essential.
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, honourable Members, overall, we are living through a very exciting time for the European Union, involving a great many changes, especially for the European Union's budget policy experts.
We are jointly preparing the historic 2004 budget - the first for a European Union of twenty-five Member States.
All the lights are now green, as the last referendum has also produced a positive result.
In most cases, the general public in the accession countries has said a resounding - indeed, a very forceful - 'yes' to the European Union.
Next year, the priority for policy-makers will be the successful launch of common policies in an enlarged Union.
Together, we - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - have put the conditions in place for this enlarged budget by adapting our financial planning to the needs of enlargement.
The budgetary framework for the next three years is therefore fixed and the 2004 draft budget naturally operates within this new framework as well.
Promoting stability in Europe and encouraging sustainable economic development - these are the further priorities for new initiatives in 2004.
They include, for example, immigration policy measures, the new Intelligent Energy for Europe programme, and measures to improve safety in the transport sector.
My fellow-Commissioners Mrs de Palacio, Mr Fischler, Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino will tell you more in their own contributions about these initiatives and about the specific programmes which have recently been agreed, such as the financial assistance for the closure of nuclear power plants or the assistance with compliance with the Schengen Agreement, which, after all, are new initiatives for the accession countries.
Of course, my colleagues will be pleased to answer any questions posed during the course of the debate.
The Commission's priorities for the budget proposal are in fact very much in line with the priorities set for 2004 by the European Parliament and, indeed, the European Council.
It is a good procedure.
The method by which priorities are discussed and elaborated jointly at such an early stage has proved its worth.
This is undoubtedly one reason, Mr Wynn, why the budgetary procedure is no longer confrontational and has become far more constructive in tone.
I would like to convey my thanks to Mr Mulder, the general rapporteur, for his excellent cooperation, as well as to Mrs Gill, the rapporteur, and especially the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn.
I would like to thank the other members of the Committee on Budgets and, of course, the other committees' budget policy experts as well.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the President-in-Office of the Council for his cooperation and the swift completion of the budget's first reading in the Council.
As far as it is possible to sum up the most recent budgetary procedures at this stage, I too would like to say that it really is time for the European Parliament to have a stronger role in the budget process, as envisaged, indeed, in the Convention's draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
I certainly do not share some finance ministers' fears that it would be contrary to budgetary discipline if this House had the final say on the overall budget.
On the contrary, my experience over recent years has shown quite clearly that Parliament fully respects the guidelines on budgetary discipline in its proposals and decisions.
The Commission's preliminary draft budget for 2004 envisages expenditure of EUR 100.7 billion.
The increase compared with this year would thus be 3.2%, which demonstrates that all the fears about enlargement being unaffordable were entirely groundless.
Indeed, next year's European public budget ratio will be even lower than this year's, showing that the necessary scope to fund enlargement has been created in the financial planning process.
At the same time, we can be certain that all the new Member States will be net recipients.
The fears of some new Member States that they would be net contributors are quite groundless, especially in view of the decisions that have already been taken, as well as the adjustment of the Financial Perspective and the proposals now on the table, which were not challenged by the Council in the first reading.
In its first reading, the Council made relatively few changes to the Commission's preliminary draft budget compared with previous years, and I would like to thank the Council for that.
However, there is one point where I must register the Commission's complete opposition, and that is on the issue of staff increases for the Commission.
We face the imminent prospect of enlargement and the accession of ten new Member States with 75 million people, and the Commission must guarantee, from the outset, the full integration of the new Member States by all the means at its disposal.
Surely it is obvious that more staff will be needed?
My fellow-Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, will take up this issue as well, and Mrs Gill will talk about the budgetary implications of the new Staff Regulations.
The Commission has certainly not been extravagant in its demands for new posts.
Indeed, we have examined the situation very carefully and calculated very tightly.
DG Budget, which is the directorate-general responsible, can be relied on to produce a very accurate calculation in this particular area.
The 780 new posts are the minimum required to manage integration.
I would like to thank Parliament for its very supportive position. I will of course ensure that all the additional questions and requests for information which you may have at this time are answered in as much detail as you require, for I believe that it is also in Parliament's interest to ensure that the Commission functions effectively.
In the foreign policy field, we face a new challenge as a result of the situation in Iraq.
Next year, we must also launch a strategy for closer cooperation with our new neighbours, but also with the European Union's old neighbours, as part of a genuine neighbourhood policy.
Within the Union, the challenge we face is ensuring a new growth dynamic at a time when the general public also expects more vigorous measures to guarantee internal security.
We also intend to push through the successful implementation of our common policies, such as the agricultural policy, in an enlarged Union and help the new Member States make up substantial economic ground.
At the same time, we know that the Council is watching to make sure that there is no widening of the gap here.
It is everyone's task to do our utmost to ensure that enlargement is a success, that the Union offers the stability which is sought by old and new Member States alike, and that through sustainable growth, positive living conditions are safeguarded for every citizen of the Union.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, it is certainly good, as Mr Wynn said, that we have this kind of generalised debate.
We hope it will not be his last time for presenting this report to Parliament as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, but there may be life after 2004.
We congratulate the two rapporteurs, as always, but we would like in this particular budget to take a cautious approach to the budget overall.
As the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council said, there will be major changes as a result of enlargement, as well as activity-based budgeting.
We will also have three different Commissioners between May and November 2004.
It is going to be a turbulent year.
For this reason, my group does not wish to see any opening of the revision of the Financial Perspective over the next 12 months.
This would be an unnecessarily complex thing to start at a time when we will be out on election campaigns and the present Commission will be in its last year.
We had great problems, in the last legislature in 1999, with negotiating a financial perspective which then tied not only the current Parliament and Commission, but also subsequent ones, to a situation where they could not revise it.
It smacks of Soviet-style planning that we should start now to think of what financing will be like in 2013.
We, as a group, would like to have a five-year financial perspective negotiated from 2005 to apply from 2006 onwards.
I should like to refer to two points in particular.
One is Commission reform.
Last year we linked the Commission's request for new posts to a comprehensive review on what had happened on Commission reform.
It produced a very impressive numerical report.
What we would like this year - and we have tabled an amendment to this effect with one or two other points - is to have not only a report about what the Commission has done, but also a report showing what has gone wrong with the reforms and what still needs to be done to ensure that there is proper communication - Eurostat is only one example, though a rather high-profile one.
The report also needs to show, quite clearly, where the reforms have not taken place.
Is it true that, as Mrs Andreasen stated in a press release today, if the accounting systems had been put in place before, we might not have had this kind of problem?
Who knows?
We wish to clarify it and to have a document to that effect.
The other point is the question of Iraq.
Mr Wynn asked what the purpose of this amendment was.
We believe that, at this stage of international development, Europe needs to show that it is not only capable of acting on the world stage and assisting with humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Iraq, but can also put a figure for this item in its budget.
This figure pales into insignificance compared with the EUR 30 billion which the President-in-Office of the Council has said has been reimbursed over the last three years from the budget to Member States.
A figure of EUR 500 million for next year focused on Iraq would show very clearly Europe's willingness to cooperate with the United States and others in bringing that country to the path of prosperity.
In conclusion, we wish, as a group, to be able to be principled and responsible in this budget process.
We want to ensure that parliamentary priorities will be maintained.
All three issues which I raised are ones on which Parliament has the final say.
You can expect us to be constant in the process which is now opening out ahead of us to the end of the year.
Thank you very much.
Mr SeppÃ€nen, you have made personal references to several Commissioners.
According to our agenda, some of the people you have mentioned will be present during this debate, but later on.
For example, Mr Barnier, who you have referred to, is scheduled for this afternoon, but not for a little while.
I mention this for your information.
Mr President, I am very pleased that this debate is taking place as it enables us to put a number of questions to the Commission before we vote on the amendments in the budgetary procedure.
In my first contribution of the afternoon, I would like to pause, as Mr Virrankoski did, at the implementation of the budget, as the political decisions which we take here with a lot of fuss often falter on that point.
Money is shelved, or red tape hinders recipients of subsidies from spending the money properly and effectively.
Mr Mulder, the rapporteur for the forthcoming budget, said just now that he wanted the Commission to be encouraged to increase the percentage of the money spent by putting part of the administrative credits in the reserve.
Mr Mulder, and also possibly a majority in this House, are not yet convinced that all the items that the Commission asked for before enlargement are really necessary.
A Commission official said the following in this regard: you are tying our legs together and still expecting us to be able to run the 100 metres faster.
I think that the rapporteur's concerns are legitimate, but I have doubts as to the means.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she can give us her opinion on this.
What are the consequences of the reserves?
How can you use them in a positive way?
Even more importantly, do you think that we are on the right track by spending the money slowly?
Up to now we have always put the emphasis on the quantitative side of this.
Is it not time we focused more on the qualitative side of the solutions, like Mr Pittella is doing with the structural funds?
That means that procedures would have to be simplified, that we would need less paper and more responsible officials.
My last point with regard to spending the money properly concerns the fact that we often find that projects that are financed with EU resources often do not respect European environmental legislation.
What happens when you discover this?
Will the money be frozen or will some other more-or-less soft solution be found?
One example of this is the bridge over the Tagus River.
This was a project financed with EU funds in which the bird and habitat directives were not respected.
There are more examples like this.
I would like to know what the consequences are if it is discovered that EU-financed projects are violating EU legislation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on a general note, this is a historic budget, for we are preparing for eastward enlargement.
I would like to start by thanking my committee and its chairman - from whom I have learned so much - the staff of the Secretariat, my fellow Members and the rapporteurs, both for this budget and for the budgets of previous years.
As a young Member, I have been able to accrue a great deal of experience in the field, even becoming vice-chairman of the committee.
I believe that, as far as we are concerned, this is a fundamental budget, for it lays the foundations for the future Europe and for the future European Parliament, and I feel that, in political terms, the crucial issue is precisely expenditure for eastward enlargement.
In this respect, the budget has the full support of both our committee and all the Members of the House, but only where expenditure related to staff and structures for eastward enlargement are concerned.
I would, however, like to focus on what may be a painful aspect of the budget - we must exercise caution when it comes to the appropriations for Iraq.
Personally, I have some misgivings about these appropriations: there is a danger that they will grow out of all proportion.
Moreover, I would call for there to be close monitoring of these funds, an effective monitoring structure which will prevent reoccurrence of what has already happened with respect to the PNA - the Palestinian National Authority - whose funding is currently being analysed in depth.
I would like to flag this point because this kind of monitoring will be essential.
I believe that an experimental phase will be necessary for the new Financial Regulation too.
As a wide-ranging, complex instrument, it will inevitably cause mounting tension in the Commission above the level of Director-General, although I hasten to add that I have greatly appreciated the way we have worked together over this recent period.
Lastly, I must mention the initiative that has led to a major debate within our committee: health insurance for Members of Parliament.
This is an issue which we will be able to address when we get the results of a study we have commissioned.
In this and in all other matters, I would like to wish the Council, in particular, good luck in its work, proud to be able to say that I, too, am an Italian representative.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, we welcome the proposed reduction in payment appropriations.
In view of the economic recession, Member States are having to tighten their belts, and the European Union cannot lag behind in this.
The Council has made a number of substantial reductions in the draft budget.
We do not share the rapporteur's position of categorically opposing this.
Particularly in Heading 2 - Structural measures, 3 - Internal policies, and 4 - External action, we do not consider it necessary to earmark more money than the Council is proposing.
We must not close our eyes to the enormous payment arrears in several items of the budget in these headings.
The arrears in the structural funds are impossible to explain to voters; they amount to more than EUR 66 billion, two-thirds of the current total EU budget.
A Swedish market research bureau came to the conclusion that the effectiveness of the structural policy is clearly not up to the mark.
Does the Commission know the results of this survey, and what is it going to do about this persistent problem?
The European Parliament must also look closer to home and check critically whether certain policy sectors do in fact belong at EU level.
For example, the fact that some people in this House want to use money for the EU budget for tourism is just one example of something that is preeminently a matter for the Member States.
Money for development aid is also going to countries in the southern hemisphere, whilst that is a duty of one or more Member States which have historical connections with these countries.
We are of the opinion that the 8.4% increase in the budget for the common foreign and security policy is inadequately explained.
The European Union must not set up an organisation in parallel with NATO.
That is throwing money away.
The EUR 18 million increase in subsidies to the Palestinian Authority is actually unwarranted as long as it refuses to unequivocally condemn and stop terrorist attacks on innocent people.
Is the Commission aware of the IMF report, which shows that Arafat had USD 900 million deposited in secret accounts between 1995 and 2000?
Finally, the Commission must be more critical when supporting third countries in the Mediterranean region.
We must apply the human rights clause consistently in such cases.
We wholeheartedly support the amendment for a substantial contribution to the rebuilding of Iraq.
At the same time we must stress that the extent of this necessary humanitarian aid should not be contingent on political differences of opinion between some Member States and the United States.
My group thinks that it is a bad thing that the reformation of the European Commission will deliver much smaller savings than originally forecast.
The difference of EUR 8.8 billion is really very substantial.
How does the Commission explain that?
Where we could also make savings is on the supervisory boards of the agencies in which each Member State has three members.
Would it not be excessive if these bodies were to expand to 75 members per agency?
I must also comment on the management of the budget.
It concerns us that expenditure on audits has fallen by 6.4% in the common agricultural policy.
This reduction is unwise, given the problems surrounding the management of this policy and the intensity of manpower required for proper control of agricultural expenditure.
This spring the European Court of Auditors presented a report on support for the so-called 'problem areas'.
What lessons has the Commission learned from this?
Is it, for example, willing to tighten up the vague definition of 'good agricultural practices'?
Finally, according to the people involved, the fraud at Eurostat is partly related to the limited resources the European Commission releases for proper statistics.
Better cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistical agencies is certainly to be desired.
Eurostat needs more independence for this, so that the impartiality and scientific objectivity of the statistics continues to be ensured.
After punishing the fraud and improving administrative control of Eurostat, we need to pay attention to this.
What is the Commission's response to this?
Mr President, this is a historic budget - as one of the previous speakers has said - a budget proposed by the Council for the Fifteen which, with a view to enlargement, is 2.7% down on last year.
Although yet another statistic, this is a sign which speaks volumes, the sign of a Europe which is afraid of itself, of its budget and of addressing the problems of the world.
From this perspective, we welcome the amendment on Iraq, which, at least, sends out a signal, rather than of inconsistency, that Europe does exist, that it wants to do its part and that it has to equip itself to do so.
For the time being, it would appear that the budget heading in question is a token entry; subsequently we will do what we can to find the funds to address what is clearly one of the major political challenges before us and which therefore calls, not least in symbolic terms, for an immediate, convincing, substantial appropriation.
Many of the Members have highlighted the European Parliament's priorities.
It is important not just to state our priorities but - and I am addressing the Commissioner here - it is important that the Commission acts in accordance with Parliament's priorities.
I am afraid that the impression we often receive is that the priorities established by Parliament are not adhered to.
I am not just referring to the EUR 13 billion which we are giving back to the Member States this year; although this does, of course, need mentioning as it reveals a flaw in the system: while this is largely funding earmarked for the Member States, a substantial amount of money has not been spent and a considerable number of priorities, of measures laid down, often together with the Commission, have been carried forward, because of a crisis that we might define as structural.
I see this as a major issue, the importance of which must not be underestimated in our assessment of both the current budget and the budget to be adopted for 2004, for the measures actually adopted often fail to be consistent with Parliament's priorities.
Then there is the section on external aid, which I will comment on, if I may, during the second part of the debate.
. (NL) Mr President, the subject of the budget.
The Council has 'only' cut the European Commission's original proposals for Heading 4, External action, which contained a 3.9% increase on the previous year, by 0.3%.
As we all know, the European Union will be taking on more and more new commitments.
These relate to the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the reconstruction of Iraq, badly governed countries such as Afghanistan and Congo, the enlarged Europe, conflict prevention in the Middle East, and so on. These are important matters and it is also clear that the people are in favour of a more assertive external policy: 67% of Europeans state that they support more European Union in the world.
On the other hand, it is crystal clear that the financial limits of the possible commitments will have been reached unless more money is made available.
In a few weeks' time the European Union will be participating in the international donor conference on the reconstruction of Iraq.
Mr Patten is suggesting a possible EU contribution of about EUR 200 million in 2003-2004.
Others are suggesting an amount of EUR 500 million.
Either way, our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy does not want this to be at the expense of other geographical zones or commitments, such as Afghanistan, or non-geographical budget lines such as the rapid response concept and landmines.
If the European Union wants to assume its share of responsibility for peace and security in the world, it must also be prepared to earmark the necessary financial resources.
If not, Europe is at risk of becoming a political dwarf on the international stage.
. (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a couple of comments on the budget proposals for 2004 from the point of view of development cooperation.
Although we are dealing with activity-based budgeting in this case, I cannot get away from the impression that this split has more to do with the Commission's internal structure.
Funds intended for development cooperation should also fall under this section.
Yet we have seen that budget lines for Asia, Latin America and the Middle-East have been placed under the heading 'External relations'.
My committee finds this unacceptable.
After all, fighting poverty is the main aim of European development policy.
If these budget lines are placed under 'Foreign relations', this will be lost from sight.
My second comment concerns our support for the reconstruction in Iraq.
Regardless of the amounts mentioned, it must be made clear that this money cannot come from the pot for Heading 4, External action, which is limited as it is.
In my opinion the flexibility instrument must be used for this.
The third and last point I would like to mention is the target percentage of 35% for social infrastructure.
The Commission has pointed out that it has achieved this figure in the last few years, but education and healthcare, which are after all two of the very important objectives of the Millennium Development Goals, still come off worst.
I would therefore like to call upon the Commission to adhere to what was agreed at the social summit in Copenhagen in 1995.
. Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Mulder for the very collegiate and cooperative way in which he has worked with other committees, and Mrs Gill for the same reason.
The budget lines dealt with by my committee are the most complex of any committee.
We cover something like 120 budget lines with reference to ten different directorates-general.
Because of that complexity, plus the changes in nomenclature, the activity-based budgeting and enlargement, it has been a difficult task to give an overall view.
I would like to thank the Commission and those staff in its directorates-general who have been patient in their explanations and have explained their rationale for preparing the preliminary draft budget.
I cannot offer the same praise to the Council of Ministers, because in our committee we have seen a whole succession of very large cuts with no rationale whatsoever provided as to why they should have taken place.
I find it impossible to work on that basis.
You cannot have a dialogue when one side does not explain its reasoning for what it is doing.
There may be some sense behind the suggestions, but it is not at all clear to us.
Let me take as one example the preparatory action for security research, of enormous interest to the citizens of Europe.
Why has that been cut?
I am delighted that Mr Mulder is prepared to support us in reinstating the money which was suggested for this action, which many of us on our committee think is important.
We want an explanation about Chernobyl.
We lay great emphasis on SMEs, as you will see, and I look forward to some sort of rational discussion with the Council about its motivation for making cuts which appear to contradict every policy of the European Union.
Mr President, the Commission's preliminary draft budget contains few surprises when it comes to those issues that fall within the area of responsibility of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
We therefore support its main features and have also clearly expressed our support for the amounts proposed by the Commission.
I nonetheless wish to make a few comments and recommendations.
Those measures that are supported within the framework of budget line 02 05 01 ('Industrial competitiveness policy for the European Union') - for example, for the purpose of analysing the effect of the information society on competitiveness and of stimulating the development of electronic trade - involve no genuine European added value and should therefore be discontinued.
We therefore propose that these appropriations be transferred to budget line 02 02 03 ('Programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, particularly for SMEs'), where the funds could be of direct use to European businesses.
We are also concerned about the problems and irregularities in connection with Eurostat and therefore want the European Parliament to ask for 25% of the appropriations to Eurostat's administrative expenditure to be placed in Title 31 ('Reserves') until the Commission has given Parliament sufficient assurance that the problems have been solved and that the people responsible have been identified and appropriately penalised.
We also support the information campaign concerning the euro and welcome the fact that the Commission has proposed increases in the funding for this.
These extra resources will be needed, given that the EU is to acquire ten new Member States that have all undertaken to introduce the euro as soon as possible.
We are nonetheless still concerned about the implementation of this budget line in recent years and therefore want again to call upon the Commission to report each quarter to Parliament's relevant committee on the implementation of the programme in the current year and on the planning for next year.
We also want to call upon the Commission to ensure that additional funds for the information campaign concerning the euro are available if further needs should arise, for example as a consequence of referendums in any of those countries that do not at present have the euro.
As an aside, I regret that, following the result of the referendum last week, my own country, Sweden, will not be eligible for funds for the information campaign concerning the euro.
The committee nonetheless supports the Commission's draft budget, but with the reservations I have expressed.
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, recent years have already seen the common foreign policy become a priority in the Budget debates, and that will be the case in the 2004 Budget too.
The number of foreign policy areas in which the EU is involved in common action is reflected in its Budget.
Together we have taken on responsibility for rebuilding Kosovo, and for bringing political stability to the Balkan States, and this is reflected in the Budget just as much as is support for the reconstruction work in Afghanistan.
The 2004 Budget provides aid for the Balkans to the tune of some EUR 600 million and EUR 184 million for Afghanistan, which, together with other funds, means that the aid we are proposing for Afghanistan amounts to EUR 214 million.
I might point out, by the way, that the European Union is doing all that it undertook to do at the donors' conference in Tokyo.
I would also like to mention that the accusation referred to earlier to the effect that nothing happens for years after the European Union promises aid, is no longer accurate in such sweeping terms.
It is here in the area of overseas aid that financial management reform has made a very positive and visible impact.
This is one reason why the Commission greatly regrets the way in which the Council has cut the funding for the Commission's delegations, which play an ever-greater part in implementing the Budget.
A major feature of the 2004 Budget will be the crisis in Iraq and the European Union's aid for the people there.
This year already, the European Union has allocated EUR 100 million from the Community Budget for humanitarian aid.
Reference has already frequently been made in this House to the fact that, on 24 October, the donors' conference on aid for the reconstruction of Iraq will be taking place.
Commissioner Patten, who is today attending the UN General Assembly in New York, has made it clear to this House the great relevance of the budgetary constraints to effective aid in Iraq.
An independent Trust Fund or a UN agency should guarantee that the aid given by the European Union is multilaterally applied.
Next week - on 1 October - the Commission will propose the amount that we intend to pledge at the donors' conference, that being EUR 200 million.
This proposal will provide for funds amounting to EUR 40 million to be mobilised this year, for the margin under heading 4 to be used next year and for the partial mobilisation of the flexibility reserve as well.
That, then, will be our proposal for the donors' conference for up to the end of 2004.
I believe that, in terms of its size, this promise of aid stands up well to comparison with the EUR 214 million for Afghanistan next year.
Our promising EUR 200 million for Iraq has to be seen in context, in that Iraq is less populous than Afghanistan, which is a wretchedly poor country lacking access to income from oil reserves.
Let me also take this opportunity to thank the budgetary authority for approving the support grant for Turkey, estimated at EUR 250 million for next year, and to be paid from the funds for pre-accession strategies; I mention the amount for Turkey only in relation to our aid for Iraq.
I believe that these things always have to be seen in comparative terms.
The Commission's draft envisages a total of EUR 507 million for humanitarian aid.
The Budget sets aside EUR 82 million for the fight against Aids, malaria and other communicable diseases, which have a catastrophic effect on many countries in Africa; this amount will also be used to fund our further donation to the Global Health Fund - that, too, will be the same amount as this year.
The reason I mention this is that it figured prominently in this debate last year.
Let me announce right now that my fellow-Commissioner Mr Nielson and I will, in a few days' time, be presenting a communication to the effect that, in future - from 2007 onwards, to be precise - resources for the European Development Fund will be incorporated into the normal Budget.
Although the priority will still be the fight against poverty, the needs of the ACP States in particular require of us that we adopt a coherent policy approach.
The simple fact is, though, that comparisons have revealed that the mechanism for implementing the ordinary Community Budget is much better than that for the European Development Fund.
As part of the development policy measures, new resources are being provided specifically for the integration of gender issues into the aid programmes.
Overseas aid in particular involves support for many projects particularly targeting the - often dire - situation of women in poor countries and crisis-hit regions.
This is described in the reports on the aid programmes.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Van Hecke, for his work and his wonderful spirit of consensus and for his choice of the difficult priorities which have been included.
What we need now of course is for these priorities to be accepted by the Committee on Budgets and by Parliament as a whole, with any modifications which the Committee on Budgets may have to make.
Some speakers such as Mr Wynn or Mr Walter have explained very clearly the pressures which have been facing heading 4 of the Budget and the urgent issues which the European Union has had to deal with over recent years.
We have had the case of Kosovo, of the Balkans, of East Timor, of Afghanistan and this year we have the problem of Iraq.
Since this has been discussed during this debate, I would like to say that my political group believes that the European Union must make a significant contribution to the rehabilitation, reconstruction, pacification and democratisation of Iraq, because we believe that the democratisation of that country must not be the exclusive responsibility of the United States, but that it must also fall to the whole of the international democratic community.
Nevertheless, Mr President, tomorrow the European Parliament is going to approve a resolution on Iraq which states very clearly, as Mr Van Hecke has quite rightly said, that the action in Iraq must not be funded to the detriment of other areas or other commitments made.
I have listened with great interest to the comments that the Commissioner has just made and I note that the Commission's intentions or forecasts are not going to go as far as that EUR 500 million.
I would ask you, Commissioner, whether you intend to consider the complete mobilisation of the flexibility instrument, which was not used last year or this year, and whether you intend to consider other very interesting possibilities such as those referred to by the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder.
Next year, with the incorporation of the candidate countries, there will be lines within the external action of the European Investment Bank which could perhaps be used for that priority.
It may perhaps be worth considering that possibility.
Mr President, the problem we are facing this year with Iraq is a recurrent problem, we cannot live from hand to mouth, we must try to find a permanent solution to the urgent issues which arise in the field of external action and try to mobilise instruments which, in a flexible manner, allow us to assist with these priorities but without, I would insist, prejudicing others.
Mr President, as the President of Romania said this morning, or as the President of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, said the other day in this Chamber, if our aspiration is for the European Union to play a key role on the international stage, we will have to seek permanent solutions to these problems, because otherwise we will have to be content with being a non-governmental organisation or a kind of international Red Cross which has no other purpose or job than to pay the bill for the great dramas of our times.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is not merely a project for the ruling classes, but will also, if it succeeds, be an enormous triumph for democracy.
The EU will soon have 450 million citizens, and over half of them are women.
If women are to take their share in building Europe, information must be targeted at them and they must be involved in specific ways.
This parliamentary term has seen us developing our strategy for gender mainstreaming and finding room for it in the Budget process, but its successes are not as evident as they could be, in that women are still generally not visible in the policy areas and we still generally do not see them occupying positions of leadership in the institutions.
Women make up only 14% of the observers from the candidate countries, only 17% of the members of the Convention, and only 25% of the Commissioners.
Whilst women make up 70% of the staff in category C, not one of Parliament's Directors-General is a woman.
Our resolution on gender mainstreaming proposes a whole range of actions to set benchmarks for the horizontal task of deliberately bringing women into the institutions, such as monitoring the success of leave for educational purposes, retraining, career and personal development, and so on.
Commissioner, you are now encouraging high expectations of gender budgeting, the implementation of which will mean the professional 'gendering' of every committee, every policy area, and every one of the Directorates-General.
We need to identify women as a target group when thinking in terms of the visibility of information campaigns, particularly in elections, and that we should involve women in every area of foreign policy - for example, in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq.
DAPHNE was a good challenge, and so, of course, are the internal policy areas such as the Structural Funds, for example.
Mr President, I would like to draw attention to three different issues in relation to this debate. They are forest fire prevention, East Timor and economic and social cohesion.
The tragic fires which have devastated southern Europe, especially Portugal, where 5% of the land area and 11% of woodland has been consumed by flames, makes clear the need to increase assistance for measures to prevent forest fires.
Sadly, a retrograde step has been taken in the form of the new Forest Focus programme.
In its resolution of 4 September, the European Parliament insisted that the amount of appropriations for the European Union should, within the framework of the draft Forest Focus regulation, be the same as in the previous 1992 regulation on the protection of forests from fires with a view to funding appropriate forest fire prevention measures.
We have, therefore, made a proposal suggesting that another EUR 6 million be allocated to the programme and that prevention issues be clearly included in it.
We hope this proposal will be approved.
I would like to know, nevertheless, whether the Commission agrees with increasing the amounts and including preventive measures in the Forest Focus programme.
Turning to East Timor: in its preliminary draft budget, the Commission has removed the specific aid line and reduced aid by around 70%.
This is unacceptable.
We have, therefore, tabled another amendment with a view to restoring the amount of aid to the EUR 25.5 million programmed in 2003.
We hope that Parliament will support this amendment, as in the past, but I would also like to know how the Commission can justify this cut, given the discussions held on the budget during 2003 and the various difficulties and areas of instability still existing in East Timor.
Finally, in view of the fact that this draft Community budget is the lowest, in relative terms, since 1987, representing less than 1% of Community gross national income, I would like to know how the principle of economic and social cohesion in the European Union will be safeguarded.
I would ask, in particular, how we will fight for social inclusion and employment growth, given that enlargement in 2004 will see the accession of 10 new countries whose average per capita income is only about 40% of the Community average.
As I believe it is impossible to achieve economic and social cohesion with this budget, I would like to ask the Commission whether it wants to abolish economic and social cohesion through future amendments to the Treaties.
Mr President, various people have already complained about the Council's reduction of the money for Afghanistan.
I think that this is primarily also an example of the short-term vision of many governments, who seem to be engaged in 'crisis hopping'.
From Kosovo to Serbia - the money transferred along too - and from Afghanistan to Iraq.
The Member States will therefore not keep the promises they made at the donor conference for Afghanistan, despite the fact that it is increasingly turning out that these promises were on the low side anyway.
I assume that common sense will prevail in this House and that we will fix a higher amount than the Council has in mind.
I would like to ask the Commissioner another question, this time concerning a different amendment from the one on Afghanistan, namely an amendment from the PPE.
They suggest putting an amount aside until they stop growing poppies and start growing legal agricultural products.
Is it not true, however, that the aid provided by the EU hardly reaches the remote areas where these poppies are grown?
How do you intend solving this problem?
I also note that the committees and groups have submitted amendments for external policy which amount to EUR 841 million more than the Commission's proposals.
I would like the Commissioner to tell me how she can explain this discrepancy.
Is it true that we simply agree massive amounts, or do you in fact adhere rigidly to the ceiling of the financial forecasts after all, conflicting with the EU's priorities in the process, because there are many more needs in the area of external policy than you suggest?
My last question - very brief - is about North Korea.
The money for the KEDO project has been frozen and we are doing absolutely nothing else about energy provision there.
Is it possible to use the money or part of the money which was previously intended for nuclear energy provision to subsidise alternative energy sources in North Korea?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as well as the draftsman's work and the line he has taken on external relations, we support many - if not all - of the amendments tabled by Mr Van Hecke on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, some of which we have been able to contribute to specifically.
In particular, I would draw your attention to a whole set of amendments on the human rights clause.
As Parliament, we have called - and we have battled for years with success - for our relations with third countries to incorporate a human rights clause imposing - and I do not wish to offend anybody by using that word - mutual respect for the most well-known and most supported agreements in force, the cooperation and aid programmes for emerging countries and, more generally, for countries with which we sustain relations.
In actual fact, this clause, formally included in agreements with third countries, is often disregarded by those who should be enforcing it.
It is disregarded for various reasons, probably because there is no specific monitoring mechanism in place.
However, the fact remains that, very often, we continue blithely to implement our budget on the basis of these agreements - which, as such, must clearly be observed - despite frequent disregard for one of the clauses.
That is why there are a number of amendments seeking to ensure that the budgetary authority is provided with timely information on the situation as regards the human rights clause, so as to place Parliament in a position to decide, should this prove necessary and in the appropriate manner, to request formally the suspension of the agreements with a country.
There are serious, significant cases of systematically violated rights and of countries whose economies depend greatly, if not on European Union aid, certainly on the rich tapestry of relations they sustain with the European Union: I refer to countries such as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia itself, where, as you are aware, the situation is currently very serious and there is a danger of a coup d'Ã©tat taking place within the next few days, in contempt of the results of elections which Parliament itself declared - maybe rather prematurely - to be perfectly above board.
These are the reasons why I believe it is possible, not least through the lever of the budget, to send a clear signal to the beneficiary countries so as to make the human rights clause a genuine reality and to reassure Parliament, which is one arm of the budgetary authority as well as the promoter of the idea, that the Commission is not implementing the budget as if nothing had happened but is carrying out pre-emptive monitoring.
This is one of the most important aspects.
I welcome the exchanges on the subject of Iraq, which would appear to be an indication of a desire for constructive dialogue on the issue.
I believe that the consideration which I have just illustrated deserves, in all respects, as stated by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the support of the House in the final vote on the budget.
Mr President, in the framework of preparing the priorities for foreign affairs, defence and security matters, the rapporteur, Mr van Hecke has had broad support from the members of our committee, in particular when he reinstated a portion of the Commission's proposal and further encouraged NGO activity.
Our rapporteur placed the emphasis on the role of the European Union as promoter of human rights in the world.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists recommends that all the lines concerning countries benefiting from an association and stability agreement on the Balkans be transferred from the category of 'external actions' to that of 'pre-accession aid'.
In addition, we request that realistic appropriations for the Israel-Palestine line be provided, instead of the practice being continued of a posteriori transfers.
We fully support Amendment No 445 which proposes EUR 47 million for conflict prevention activities - and, in my view, prevention is always less expensive than cure - and Amendment No 118, which proposes EUR 2.5 million by way of additional appropriations for information programmes in third countries.
An amendment by Mr Elles proposes establishing a line of EUR 500 million for the reconstruction of Iraq.
There are two reasons why this amendment is unacceptable to the PSE Group.
While remaining open to the creation of a new budgetary line, we cannot envisage providing funds in the absence of any mandate from the United Nations for the reconstruction of Iraq and in the absence of reliable estimates from the Commission.
In our view, it is important that the UN have exclusive control over the reconstruction fund.
