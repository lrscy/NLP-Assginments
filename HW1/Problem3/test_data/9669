First, to make explicit what is already implicit in the proposal.
We are not talking about expensive duties being imposed on employers.
Where the employer finds a risk associated with natural radiation, information will be provided to workers.
In the vast majority of modern occupational settings there will be no risk.
Secondly, by taking the sentence from the Council, granting Member States a role in determining the criteria to apply to the risk assessment in the light of national circumstances, we are acknowledging the obvious fact that, as both speakers have already said, the risk from natural radiation is somewhat lower in Newcastle than it is in Naples.
Thirdly, we are trying to provide greater legal certainty for employers.
Although the right try to deny it, the 1999 Framework Directive clearly imposes a duty on employers to assess all occupational risks.
The 1992 directive on construction sites certainly goes further and specifically mentions environmental considerations.
We should use this proposal to introduce greater legal certainty.
That is exactly what we are trying to do in our amendments, by seeking to highlight the provision of information to workers.
We are talking about a very serious risk.
According to Cancer Research UK, skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the UK.
Cases of skin cancer there have more than doubled since the 1980s.
The UK now has more cases of skin cancer than Australia.
More than 69Â 000 new cases are diagnosed in the UK each year and over 2Â 000 people die each year in the UK from skin cancer.
That is not specific to the UK.
In Germany, skin cancer among agricultural workers has risen by between 15% and 20% over the last decade alone.
Please take a look at the statistics in your own countries.
This is a global, not a national, phenomenon.
So let us use the EU-wide legal base we have to provide greater protection for all our workers.
Â Â  . Mr President, I speak on behalf of the whole of the ALDE Group, contrary to what Mr Hughes was implying.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation on this directive.
I now hope that all MEPs, including the Socialists, will see sense and either completely remove natural radiation from this directive, or at least pass the compromise that we voted for in committee and leave it up to Member States.
It is absolutely ludicrous to keep it in.
I thought it was a joke when I first read it.
I did not believe that the Council and the Commission could actually be serious about this.
It would bring the EU into further disrepute if we legislate against the sun in the workplace.
Apart from that, this is a reasonably sensible directive, to protect people like welders from artificial radiation, but we should not include natural radiation from the sun.
As the text stands at present, employers would be required to do a risk assessment every day, bringing in technical and organisational measures to protect workers.
What does that mean?
Keeping them in from the sun a lot of the time?
Providing protective equipment, such as sunglasses, hats, or sun tan cream, and making sure that they wear them?
It is no business of the EU to tell workers that they cannot be bare-chested or wear shorts. They are adults.
Imagine the language if workers were told to cover up when they were trying to get a sun tan from their holiday.
And how would you prove liability?
If a worker gets skin cancer, was it in the workplace, was it on the beach, was it in the back garden?
It would in my opinion be a legal nightmare.
Yes, everyone should be warned about the dangers of the sun, but that should not be up to employers.
Government campaigns should warn everybody.
If we pass this directive and include natural radiation, this would be taking the 'nanny state' mentality too far.
I sincerely hope that all MEPs will either vote to remove natural radiation from the text, or vote for the compromise in committee.
Â Â  . Mr President, over the past months, a media furore has spread half-truths and untruths in the shape of ludicrous shaggy-dog stories.
The only thing about the so-called minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (optical radiation) â as the title puts it â to gain a firm hold on the public mind was that Brussels, in its mania for regulation, sought even to outlaw the rays of the sun, requiring barmaids to refrain from wearing low-cut dresses and even banning footballers from wearing shorts in future.
I am sure that I do not need to point out to the House that this directive is solely concerned with prevention and with protective measures in the workplace and with improving precautions against skin cancers â not least as an occupational illness.
Essentially, we would have no need of rules and regulations if, for example, the old dress codes to deal with natural optical radiation were still in place, with it being taken for granted that someone working in the sun would wear a hat and clothing to protect the skin.
Nor would we have much need of them if the sunâs ultra-violet rays were not constantly being made more dangerous by the depletion of the ozone layer.
It is, alas, an established fact â and one to which a number of Members have referred â that incidences of skin cancer have multiplied over recent years, particularly among those working in construction and agriculture, neither of which can be regarded as privileged occupations.
The question that we have to answer today is whether or not we want to protect these workers better against optical radiation, just as we do against noise, vibration and electro-magnetic radiation, and do so, moreover, to an equal degree in every Member State, and whether or not we want to guarantee the recognition of skin cancer as an occupational illness throughout the EU.
We must not shuffle off our own powers and responsibilities onto the Member States, who are responsible for implementation.
While health is a fundamental asset for every individual, it also has an economic dimension, so we should adopt the Councilâs proposed minimum requirements â remembering that they are minimum requirements! â while rejecting Articles 4 and 5, which have been completely watered down.
As a matter of principle, we Greens share the Socialist Groupâs position and call for minimum standards for proper protection at work in all EU Member States.
Â Â  . â The protection of workersâ health and safety has already been the subject of a number of directives in areas such as vibration, noise and electromagnetic fields.
It is therefore incomprehensible that members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have voiced their opposition to the adoption of measures aimed at strengthening the protection of workers exposed to natural radiation.
Under such measures, the onus will fall on employers to assess the health and safety risks, so that the steps needed to reduce those risks can be identified and implemented, for example by means of an action plan involving technical and/or organisational measures aimed at reducing health and safety risks to a minimum.
That is what happened in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in respect of Articles 4(2) and 5(2), as mentioned previously, in an attempt to ensure that these proposals did not cover workers in relation to optical radiation.
We naturally feel that workersâ health must be protected, and therefore have difficulty in accepting the Council Presidencyâs compromise.
Of course, Member States may take account of the nature of the activities undertaken and levels of exposure to the sun, and may lay down specific criteria for such a risk assessment to observe.
What is important, however, is that minimum values be established that take account of the World Trade Organisationâs data, which show that thousands of people in Europe have died of skin cancer, a disease that is on the rise throughout the EU.
Consequently, workers in sectors such as agriculture, construction, tourism, law enforcement â that is to say, anyone who works in the open air â must be protected.
This is why we have tabled proposals aimed at reinstating at least basic levels of protection for all workers in the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, why do we in this House continue to bring ridicule on ourselves by promoting such egregious measures as this one?
In Germany the media have mocked it because of its effect on Bavarian barmaids' bosoms.
In Britain the press have poked fun at it because it restricts bare-backed building workers.
I accept that a brickie's cleavage is not a pretty sight, but we have no business in this House making rules about it.
When will we start to treat European citizens like grown-ups, able to make their own decisions?
How long will we continue to treat them like small children, seeking to regulate and control every detail of their lives?
How long will we continue to pile cost, liability, uncertainty and vast bureaucratic burdens on employers, making European economies less profitable and less competitive?
I have been approached by organisations ranging from the National Farmers Union to the Federation of Master Builders, which are deeply worried about the impact on their businesses.
Sadly, I have not been approached by any Bavarian barmaids, but my door is always open should they wish to see me.
This is an unnecessary and damaging measure.
The only people to benefit from it will be compensation lawyers.
We should reject the natural radiation aspects of this proposal out of hand.
Â Â  Mr President, I would point out to Mr Kusstatscher that prevention and protection â not in peopleâs leisure activities, but in their workplaces â is a matter of concern to us too, but, if the Commission and the Council have their way, it is evident that building firms will in future have to certify that ultra-violet rays are safe for those of their workers who work in the open air.
Time-consuming programmes of action to deal with sunburn will be devised; lifeguards in open-air swimming pools will virtually have to wrap themselves up, and serving staff in hostelries with gardens will evidently have to carry not just trays but also a variable parasol or two.
What is put together here on â and let this be borne in mind! â 42 whole pages, is a burden on businesses, puts jobs at risk and is a cause of justified outrage on the part of the public.
The rapporteur, Mr Åry, has done a very good job of work in presenting a compromise in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, where it gained a majority, albeit an extremely narrow one.
What we want to achieve is for the Member States themselves to decide what to do with this âsunshine directiveâ.
By means of this proposal, we have run up the flag of realism and signalled our opposition to overweening bureaucracy.
Surely, the failure of the referenda in some Member States â while others hesitate to move on with the decision-making process â shows that the public will accept the European Union only if we concentrate on the essentials, take the issues really seriously and make use of our powers and responsibilities.
Mrs Lynne is right to say that we risk bringing the EU into disrepute.
Over ten years have passed since this document on optical radiation was given its first reading.
The former version of it bears next to no relation to the present one.
It is irrelevant â and cannot be anything else â to say that we are going to protect workers in the same way right across Europe when we are well aware that the climate zones in our countries differ enormously.
Workers have themselves learned from years of experience what they can and must do about optical radiation.
Some can cope with the sun extremely well and other cannot at all.
They come to their own individual solutions, and in that we must not interfere.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is right to say that what we have seen here is a lack of willingness to compromise on the part of the Council, whose attitude, exemplified not least by this abstruse new proposal, really is far removed from reality.
Needless to say, the Federal Government still in office in Germany has gone along with it.
We, the MEPs belonging to the CDU and CSU, will be consistent and reject a Common Position that does not guarantee subsidiarity.
Let us protect the sun from the European Union and its mania for rule-making!
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the controversy sparked off by this directive is disproportionate and, at the same time, undoubtedly reveals two different approaches to the policy that the EU must conduct on protecting workersâ rights.
I do not believe, MrÂ Mann, that protecting workersâ health puts jobs at risk.
As MrÂ Åry pointed out, this proposal for a directive is simply the fourth part of a set of laws on which Parliament and the Council have already expressed opinions and which is aimed, from a health and safety perspective, at protecting workers against the risks connected with exposure to physical agents.
As you know, we have already adopted provisions relating to vibrations, noise and electromagnetic fields.
In the present case, we are led to draw a distinction between radiation from artificial sources and that from natural sources.
At the same time, however, there is an element of obscurity â if you will excuse the terminology â in your speeches and reasoning concerning health and, in particular, public health policies: you draw no distinction between the risk to which someone â in this instance, a worker â is exposed because of natural rays and that to which he or she is exposed because of artificial radiation.
Even if the provisions proposed in the common position do in fact take account of the difference between standing in front of a machine and being exposed to solar radiation due to outdoor work, we need specific policies for each eventuality, even if we do consider that, in the end, what has been implemented by the Community under ArticleÂ 137 of the Single Act should be enough. In other words, we should take steps to ensure that health and safety measures are laid down for the purpose of protecting all EU workers in their work places.
Not to do so would be to give up, and that is something we cannot do.
There is a new risk. There is data that cannot be ignored from both the World Health Organisation and our national health bodies, showing that the number of cancers linked to exposure to the sun is on the increase.
It is increasing, in particular, in occupations involving exposure to the sun, something that cannot be explained merely in terms, for example, of the variables of holidays and other free time.
There is exposure to the sun in the construction, civil engineering and tourist industries.
Police in charge of security are also very often out of doors.
A much longer list of the occupations concerned could be drawn up.
We therefore have a responsibility, and the proposal being made is reasonable inasmuch as it takes account of companiesâ need to be able to meet this type of obligation at low cost.
It is a question of information, training, assessment and prevention.
It is, in actual fact, a question of laying down obligations for employers, because the fact is, workers are dependent upon their employers.
Some people maintain that the proposal is too precise and that the Community and the European Union will make themselves look ridiculous.
My own observation is that, in the economic field, legislation can never be too precise.
When it comes to financial regulations, the internal market or the banking sphere, we are adept at voting in favour of precise standards.
The point is, we need, I think, also to be capable of being precise when it comes to peopleâs health.
We do not agree with the notion whereby European standards and rules have to be compulsory in the economic field but whereby subsidiarity and opt-out clauses need systematically to be invoked when it comes to social rights and to the protection of workersâ health.
That is why we do not want the content of this legislation to be distorted and why, where prevention and the provision of information are concerned, we want all EU workers to be offered standards such as will help combat the development of skin cancer.
Â Â  Mr President, I â like most of the other speakers â would like to concentrate on natural optical radiation, or sunlight.
Essentially, we need to strike a balance between the health and safety of workers and the temptation to over-legislate â to be too prescriptive â and to override the principle of subsidiarity and attempt a âone size fits allâ piece of legislation.
In the last session, when speaking on the Nitrates Directive, I stated that not even the European Parliament can legislate for weather across Europe and I have not changed my mind.
Therefore, in this context, given the wide variation of climatic conditions across Europe, I consider it appropriate that decisions regarding the health and safety of workers from exposure to sunlight are best taken by the national authorities.
There is no comparison between the health and safety concerns as a result of exposure to sunlight, for instance, between a Nigerian worker on an Irish building site and an Irish worker on a Greek building site.
However, this is not an issue to be ignored, and employers have a real responsibility â primarily, I believe, by means of awareness raising â as regards practical preventative measures, whereby employees who work outdoors can make informed choices about their exposure to sunlight and the need to take practical precautions to protect themselves.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to remind the House that the minimum health and safety requirements applicable to the workplace are already defined as a European competence by the Single European Act, and that employers have been obliged, since as long ago as 1989, to carry out risk assessments, train workers and inform them, providing protective equipment when necessary and keeping documentation relating to these measures.
The specialised directive with which we are concerned today does no more than lay down the framework for these measures, and does so in a balanced and appropriate manner, including in those situations in which we cannot keep tabs on the source, and so I cannot for the life of me understand why the employersâ associations are opposed to such legal certainty.
After all, the only alternatives they have are to resort to simple actions such as the provision of notices or up-to-date information on health risks or else to run the risk of court rulings recognising occupational illnesses.
I cannot understand why they do not go for the cheaper option, and so I regard the CSU amendment as making for greater legal uncertainty and as detrimental particularly to small businesses.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking MrÂ Åry for all his hard work.
I should also like to thank him for his cooperation on this report, which I had the opportunity to discuss with him as shadow rapporteur for our group.
I agree with MrsÂ Oomen-Ruijten that the debate on this report has gone on too long, and that it has been sensationalised by certain press outlets as a result of a lack of clarity in the Commissionâs and Councilâs positions.
There is no doubt in my mind that the protection of workers from health risks arising from optical radiation is a matter that should be regulated at EU level.
After all, such an approach also reflects the findings of the report which I tabled on health protection at work, and which the House adopted some time ago.
As one of the previous speakers noted, the World Health Organisation has reported that the number of people dying of skin cancer is in the thousands. This means that there is a clear need to afford greater protection to workers who are exposed to optical radiation, in particular from natural sources.
I fail to understand the logic of those Members who wish to exclude natural radiation, and I am likewise opposed to those amendments aimed at allowing employers to decide for themselves whether or not to raise their employeesâ awareness about optical radiation and to protect them from it.
Protecting workers is not cheap, but it is indispensable if we genuinely wish to improve health protection at work.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by adding my own thanks to Mr Åry, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job of work.
Which way do we want Europe to go?
We are experiencing a constitutional crisis.
We are going through a financial crisis.
People no longer understand Europe.
We have to make every effort to get the public back on board.
The proposed rules on natural radiation in the Common Position will do the precise opposite, being a classic example of excessive regulation and the bureaucratic approach.
They bear no relation to the European Unionâs efforts at deregulation.
The Commission and the Council are always talking about better lawmaking as a means towards more growth and job creation in the EU.
My concept of âbetter regulationâ, though, is a rather different one; it is that it is with regulations such as these that we must make a start.
With their requirements for protection against the sun, the Council and the Commission are shooting well wide of the mark.
The mere fact that a variety of climate conditions prevail in the EU means that there are also many practical considerations militating against a Europe-wide regulation of this kind.
I do not believe that protecting workers from the sun should be treated with the same importance in Finland as in Spain or Greece.
We are taking responsibility away from the people of Europe; whatever happened to workersâ personal responsibility?
How, moreover, can it be determined whether sunburn was sustained during leisure or at work?
What about the problem of liability if employers carry out the comprehensive risk assessments in relation to the sunâs rays, which this directive will finally impose?
Let me give you another brief example.
I had a discussion with a workplace safety and protection officer, who told me how he had stood beside a worker, next to whom was a metre-high jet of flame.
He asked the worker why he did not put the flame out, to which the reply was: âyou are the one who is responsible for safety in the workplaceâ.
That is an example of why we need to give workers a sense of being responsible for themselves.
Tomorrow, we in this House will be able to indicate our desire for the dismantlement of bureaucracy and for deregulation, and to send a message to the effect that we have learned something from the referenda in France and the Netherlands.
Like Mr Mann, Mr Bushill-Matthews, and many other MEPs, I have tabled amendments aimed at removing the sun from the scope of the directive.
I ask you to support our amendments or at least the compromise adopted in the Committee.
We must regain the trust of the people of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my own country, we have, for several weeks, had to watch CDU/CSU parliamentarians making a truly grotesque attempt at using this directive on optical radiation for their own purposes in the German election.
The amendment tabled by Mr Ferber and MrÂ Nassauer, with its aim of rejecting the Common Position as a whole, now marks the climax of this campaign, and it is truly a sad sight.
One might have expected an amendment like this from the British Tories, but not from the CDU/CSU; with it, these Members are expressing their opposition to workplace protection in the EU as a whole, and it has to be said that their putting it up for grabs also runs counter to their former position on workplace protection.
The CDU/CSU voted in favour of all three of the other workplace protection directives; it supported all of them.
Can someone perhaps explain to me why they want to improve the protection of workers in the workplace from hazards arising from vibration, noise and electromagnetic radiation, but not from those resulting from optical radiation?
To Mrs Weisgerber I have to say that anyone who refers, in the title of their press release, to a âsunshine directiveâ, is consciously aiming to misinform.
You are well aware, Mrs Weisgerber, that this directive is primarily concerned with protection from artificial radiation, but you have nothing to say about that; instead, you take natural radiation and fabricate a bogeyman, hypocritically prating about being close to the citizens.
All this is obliging employers to inform their workers about the health risks associated with sunlight, a point reiterated with great clarity by our PSE Groupâs two amendments.
Whether â and, if so, how â the workers protect themselves again the sunâs rays in practice is still left to them alone to decide.
The handing out of notice sheets is surely not too much to ask.
In the past, doing that sort of thing got a lot done on the workplace protection front.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also want to allow the Member States to define their own specific criteria for how the risk assessment is to be carried out.
That does indeed take proper account of subsidiarity, but what we Socialists cannot go along with is workplace protection in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I echo the remarks of Mr Hughes: this measure has been used by the small-minded, anti-European factions within this House to whip up confusion rather than to legislate sensibly, as nobly demonstrated by MrÂ Helmer, who made a speech full of nonsense and half-truths, then left, presumably to sit in the midday sun somewhere.
No serious person would question the desirability of protecting workers from skin cancer.
In Scotland, despite our northern latitude, this is a serious and pressing issue.
The question for us is whether the inclusion of sunlight within this measure would achieve it.
The inclusion of natural light renders, sadly, the sensible proposals within this package unworkable, legally difficult to enforce and practically difficult to manage.
I am glad to hear the rapporteur mention subsidiarity.
Hopefully, if all else fails it will allow a greater degree of common sense to be brought through in the application of this measure.
The Scottish National Party is concerned that these measures, while laudable in aim, will not achieve the desired result.
Rather, we fear that the inclusion of sunlight in this package will add to the burden upon farmers, fishermen, foresters, businesses in general and others, without necessarily achieving the desired health effects.
We believe that there is a need to legislate in this area.
We do not accept that this is the way to do it.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry that the Commissioner himself cannot be with us today, but I understand he has to be in China.
I hope the sun is shining upon him there and that he is being instructed to cover up well.
The previous part-session, in July, was the first attended by the UK as Presidency of the Council.
We were promised many things: the new Presidency was going to simplify the burdens on business, reduce red tape and provide leadership to make the EU more relevant to the people.
The whole House, including this side of the House, should support such an agenda if, indeed, it happens.
This is the first part-session since then, the first chance for all of us to judge the UK Presidency on whether it means what it says.
Today the judgement is already becoming clear, because what we have on the agenda is more red tape, not less: we have a directive that calls for businesses to record how much the sun is shining.
The UK Presidency is trying to downplay this whole directive, claiming that it is all very straightforward and that the fuss is far-fetched.
If that were true, why have I and my colleagues been getting increasingly frantic messages from organisations and individual companies of all sizes, in such major industries as agriculture, horticulture, construction, tourism and hospitality?
They have not taken their information from so-called 'misleading press releases' â despite the predictable spin from Mr Hughes and his Socialist colleagues â but straight from the directive.
They are not just imagining problems for the sake of it; they are detailing specific problems in the common position that the Council simply did not foresee when it nodded it through.
The Presidency in particular should have very red faces now, though I suspect not from sunburn.
Our role in this House is clearly to help shape EU legislation that is appropriate and proportionate.
In its current form, this proposal is neither.
If the UK Presidency will not give a lead, our political group will.
We have tabled amendments to throw out the common position completely, to remove all references to natural sunlight and to get some sense back into this directive.
We are glad to have support from many of the Liberal Democrats, as well as from other political groups.
However, this whole House should give out the message loud and clear.
People do not want politicians to protect them from sunlight; increasingly, people simply want to be protected from politicians.
Â Â  Mr President, employers have always treated workersâ need for protection as if it were a trifling thing.
Not only, for example, did it take decades to get occupational illnesses recognised as such, but the provision and wearing of ear protectors in training establishments was not, for a long time, regarded as health protection either, and now artificial and optical radiation, something of such great importance to workers has become a fit topic for polemics by the redtop press.
Where this proposal for a directive on optical radiation is concerned, we should go back to what the Council proposed.
It is no more than a polemical trick to compare natural sunlight with a sunbed.
There is, after all, a difference between a worker being exposed to extreme solar radiation for the whole of the day, and a person doing some sunbathing â which, if they are sensible, will be for a brief period of time.
In considering these things, we have to bear in mind the demonstrable sharp increase in the risk of skin cancer in Europe, a risk taken by building workers, forestry workers and other workers exposed to the sun in the open air.
Requiring employers and health and safety officers to provide information on extreme weather conditions when these occur is surely not to demand disproportionate expenditure on their part, and is something that should be taken seriously.
Greater legal certainly also makes perfect sense from the point of view of both worker protection and insurance and is a necessity.
It might be added that Members of this House should, where workers are concerned, be guided in their decision-making by an awareness of their problems rather than by ignorance.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying something about procedure.
We are dealing here with a piece of the European Parliamentâs legal history, for it was in 1992 that the Commission came to a decision on the subject, and today finds us debating it at â and let me stress this â its reading.
When we vote on it, as we will do tomorrow, we will be bound by the rule that a majority is required to reject or amend it.
Speaking as someone who was not even an MEP at the time of its first reading, I have to say that I find it intolerable that neither the Commission nor the Council are similarly bound in the case of a proposal made at a time when most of us were not yet MEPs.
Even though the Rules of Procedure permit it, I was not able to table any amendments in the Committee.
That is why we should all press for such curiosities to be done away with.
It is also a reason why the CDU/CSU has tabled this motion for the directive to be rejected; we did so not because we reject justified measures in relation to unnatural optical radiation, but in order to call on the Commission to come up with a proposal that would be credible in terms of the Constitution and of Lisbon.
President Barroso and his colleagues always get carried away when analysing the reasons why the Constitution was rejected, and regularly invoke the Lisbon objectives.
If you put them on the spot on the subject of regulation and directives, the line they take is: âthe sunshine directive?
I was not in office at the timeâ.
At the same time, though, there is no shortage of officials in the Commission who quite simply ignore whatever their bosses say.
Better regulation?
Of what interest is that to those to whom the protection of consumers is entrusted, those who are supposed to take action to deal with this?
For them, it is âbusiness as usualâ.
In Germany, this is not an issue for only one end of the political spectrum; I would just like to remind Mrs JÃ¶ns of the President of the German Council of Cities.
This may have passed her by during the summer recess, but, in any case, the President of the German Council of Cities, who is also at the same time the Lord Mayor of Munich, and, as she will be aware, a member of the SPD, has held up the sunshine directive to ridicule.
We see, then, that there is in Germany a broad political consensus to the effect that we are in favour of rules that are practicable.
The compromise would take us closer to them.
The motion for rejection calls upon the Commission to come up with something better; if it is not passed, I call upon you to at least support the compromise motion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I think that the right-of-centre Members of the Chamber are trying to make light of a generally serious matter.
Protection of workersâ health and safety is at the heart of a social Europe.
This directive is precisely an attempt to improve workersâ conditions by emphasising all the dangers to health to which workers are exposed in the work place as a result of optical radiation.
Sunlight presents a risk to the many people who work out of doors every day.
There have been seven times as many cases of skin cancer in the last 30 years, and it is beyond doubt that the risk of contracting skin cancer is far higher for those employed in, for example, the construction sector or agriculture.
That is the reality to which we have to respond, and those are the figures that make it our duty to demand that, in future, employers inform their workers as to how they are to protect themselves against the sunâs dangerous rays.
Radiation in the work place is dangerous, and there is a need for common European rules.
The Commission has been given the task of describing all the risks to which workers are exposed in working life.
The sunâs harmful ultraviolet rays endanger people and naturally need to feature in the directive.
For workers, cancer is no less real whether caused by natural or artificial radiation.
Workers naturally have a responsibility for their own health and safety.
We demand only that employers also accept their share of responsibility.
We have found a solution that does not overburden employers and that includes worker protection.
We can only interpret right-of-centre opposition as another attempt to renationalise labour market legislation.
It is an entirely incomprehensible point of view, which will distort competition within the EUâs borders.
There must be common European rules.
That is the only way in which we can guarantee decent conditions for all European wage earners.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner stated that exposure limit values for natural radiation were not deemed to be feasible, and I want to emphasise that point.
I want to begin by asking the Commissioner to indicate very clearly what the Commission's views are on this debate, on the amendments and on what has happened in the various committees.
It would have been helpful if we had known your mind before we started, Commissioner, because we are speaking in a vacuum.
Maybe you agree with what this or that side is saying, but we would like to know where you stand.
As I see it, we have a good piece of legislation: the framework directive requesting employers to mitigate health risks for employees.
None of us disagree with that.
We have already dealt with vibration, noise, electro-magnetic fields and now we are faced with optical radiation.
I agree with it â it is a good piece of legislation â with the sole exception of the inclusion of solar radiation.
We need legal certainty in the field of employment, both for employers and employees.
There is no legal certainty in the area of risk assessment for exposure to solar radiation in the workplace, and it is a legal certainty that in a litigious age it will end up as a lawyers' charter, and nothing else.
If I choose to spend 10 hours on a beach on Saturday or Sunday, or 10 hours in the garden at 80 degrees exposed to the sun, or on the golf course in very hot sunshine, all the health authorities would say that it was far too long.
What colleagues have said about skin cancer is absolutely true.
But if I choose to spend my leisure time taking excess exposure to the sun, then go into the workplace on a Monday, say, and I am working on a construction site, or in the fields, in a vineyard, at a sports venue, beside a swimming pool or wherever, and I am already overexposed through lack of personal responsibility at the weekend, is it my employer's duty to ensure that I should not have any extra exposure to the sun on the Monday?
Two hours might be too much in that case, let alone four hours.
If I am a red-haired, fair-skinned Irish person, two hours' sunshine is the maximum I should get, and with proper coverage from the sun, with a hat, covering up my skin and wearing protection.
But if I am a dark-haired, brown-eyed, dark-skinned southern European, I could spend six or seven hours in the sunshine to no effect at all.
What do the employers do, line up their employees on a Monday morning and check their skin types and whether they have been overexposed at the weekend?
Or check whether they have been toasted on both sides at Torremolinos during the previous fortnight when they were on holiday and say 'Sorry, you can't go in the sun this week at all'?
It is impossible to operate.
We want legal certainty.
We want to leave personal responsibility to the individual.
Yes, we want informed choices from a health point of view â everybody, not just employees, should be informed of the risks to over-exposure â but please, say to PresidentÂ Barroso for all of us, that, if he is serious about Lisbon-proofing regulation and about less regulation being better regulation, then we do not need this nanny-type regulation and solar radiation must be removed from the directive.
It cannot be left to Member States, since there is a legal problem, I understand.
Risk assessment cannot be left to each Member State under the terms of framework Directive 89/391, because it is a Community competence only.
Please tell us what the options are and where you stand on this, Commissioner.
Â Â  Mr President, common sense seems to have abandoned the PPE-DE Group and the Liberals on this issue.
The controversy has focused on a single section relating to a requirement to provide information to workers about cancer risks.
The media, of course, have had a field day, fed by people who should know better, like Ms Lynne.
I have heard no-one here today deny that overexposure to sunlight is dangerous and can be deadly, yet we have these games being played.
The right â both Europhiles and Europhobes â have used this issue as a wedge in their campaign to renationalise health and safety regulations, ignoring the fact that, in an open, competitive economy, if you do not have European regulation, you will have no regulation.
That would inevitably lead to protectionism, which is already raising its ugly head following the French and Dutch referendums.
Provision of information on cancer risks to outdoor workers is not a burden on employers; it is an investment in a healthy workforce.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commission and the Council are aware that protection against risks from natural sources should be the subject of differential treatment, and the common position reflects this difference.
I shall therefore explain in detail the Commissionâs position on the amendments.
I very much wish firstly to thank Parliament for its work and for the debate that has taken place.
During the long and difficult legislative process, the Commission has been keen to do everything to ensure that this document still offers a high level of protection for workers, while avoiding discriminating between workers exposed to similar risks, and that it does so in compliance with framework Directive 89/391 and while ensuring the necessary proportionality.
The aim has been to enable a compromise acceptable to all the institutions concerned to be reached by the end of the process.
The Commission is not, then, able to accept what is stated, particularly in a number of newspapers, to the effect that the text of the common position is the result of a fruitless exercise, likely to give Europeans an image of the European Union as something sterile and bureaucratic.
The Commission thinks that the common position is a balanced text responding to the real dangers constituted by the eye diseases and skin cancers, or melanomas, that are an issue for all Europeans and thinks that it is perfectly in keeping with the terms of the European Parliamentâs recent resolution on the promotion of health and safety.
Obviously, ways must be found of avoiding what could be pointless burdens on our companies and, as many have emphasised, on small and medium-sized companies in particular.
AmendmentsÂ 1,Â 8,Â 9,Â 10,Â 11Â andÂ 36 on the one hand emphasise the need for early detection of health effects and, on the other hand, specify the level of qualifications required by those responsible for medical surveillance.
The Commission is able to accept these amendments.
The Commission is also able to accept Amendments 2,Â 3,Â 6,Â 12,Â 14,Â 15,Â 16,Â 17,Â 34Â andÂ 35.
They improve the text and reinforce and clarify the meaning of the provision concerned.
The Commission cannot, however, accept, as they stand, AmendmentsÂ 5,Â 7Â andÂ 37 which propose giving each Member State the competence to legislate on the appropriateness, or otherwise, of employers assessing the risks in the case of exposure to natural sources of radiation.
Beyond the considerations of protecting workersâ health to which I referred a few moments ago, such provisions would, in fact, be contrary to the obligations imposed on employers by framework Directive 89/391 to take account of all the risks and to make an assessment of the risks in all cases.
Adopting these amendments â and I would lay some stress upon this, since it is an important point of law â would involve something of a transfer of responsibility from the employer to the national legislator.
Where employment law and working conditions are concerned, this would, I believe, pose a real problem and would not, in my opinion, make the task an easy one for countries to carry out.
I would therefore emphasise this point.
Similarly, and even if it understands the reasons that may lie behind them, the Commission cannot accept AmendmentÂ 18 in favour of rejecting the common position, Amendments 21Â andÂ 24 that exclude, in particular, taking account of particularly vulnerable risk groups or the effects of interaction with photosensitive substances, and the full range of Amendments 19Â toÂ 23Â andÂ 25Â toÂ 33 which exclude optical radiation from natural sources from the scope of the directive.
The Commission intends working with Parliament and the Council to find a solution enabling the directive to be adopted as soon as possible.
Regarding AmendmentsÂ 4Â andÂ 13, which introduce a provision asking it to draw up a practical guide, the Commission is ready to examine the best way of responding to this. At the same time, it is concerned to avoid procedures that might impair the wording of Community legislation governed by an interinstitutional agreement.
So there we have it, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen. The Commission wants the amendments that will be adopted tomorrow to enable the text of the new directive entirely to fulfil the objectives laid down by ArticleÂ 137 of the Treaty when it comes to workersâ health and social protection.
I would take the liberty of emphasising personally the quality of the compromise arrived at. This has been done by differentiating properly between sources of risk and by authorising â in a simple way, I believe, particularly for risks arising from natural sources â a number of precautionary measures of which it will be a simple matter to remind workers in the interests of their health and which thus complete the provisions enabling the health of workers in Europe to be protected and to be so without our entering into a wealth of detail and complications.
That is why, MrÂ President, I think that this compromise genuinely deserves Parliamentâs undivided attention.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon.
Â Â  The eye is responsible for the largest share of human perception, so it is understandable that injury to the eye or loss of vision is among one of the most serious of all physical impairments.
The fundamental interests of workers demand that this directive should come into being as soon as possible.
We all have an interest in the adoption of this report.
From our point of view, this is a technical matter and in such instances there is always a good chance of reaching a consensus.
In the course of the debate, however, some technical reservations have been voiced.
Knowledge of the risks, use of protective equipment and strict compliance with safety regulations are essential, not only for visual protection but for health protection in all its other aspects as well.
The range of occupational hazards is extremely broad, and the risk of harmful health effects and of developing chronic diseases is considerable.
Sunshine is a natural phenomenon that is notoriously difficult to legislate on, and some Member States of the European Union do not have very much of it at all.
We must also take into account that the directive should provide Member States with the broadest possible opportunity, on as many issues as possible, to formulate for themselves, at national level â in consultation with the social partners and within the framework set by the directive â legislation that best suits their given circumstances.
There should not be over-regulation, but a balance between the safety of workers and the realities of a given countryâs economic and fiscal situation.
We can and will change the overly bureaucratic approach, but protecting health must always be the primary focus of our efforts.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0199/2005) by MrsÂ JÃ¶ns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity â PROGRESS [COM(2004)0488 â C6-0092/2004 â 2004/0158(COD)].
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin by warmly thanking your rapporteur, MrsÂ JÃ¶ns, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for having carried out a high-quality piece of work and by also thanking the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, MrsÂ Figueiredo.
The future PROGRESS programme will play a decisive role in the development of social Europe.
In this context, it aims to bring together the four Community action programmes on which the implementation of the social policy agenda up to 2006 is based, as well as a series of budget headings concerning working conditions.
The proposed approach will contribute to simplifying the instruments, both in legal terms and from the point of view of managing them, and to rationalising the budget structure.
It will also enhance the clarity, visibility, coherence and consistency of the instruments and will prevent overlaps.
The Commission has always been very keen to ensure that the revised text preserves this simplification and this rationalisation.
That was the case with the initial proposal, and the majority of the amendments that Parliament has seen fit to suggest are also directed to this end.
I would be pleased, Mr President, to listen to Parliamentâs observations, standing in once again for MrÂ Å pidla, who has been detained by the EU-China Summit.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like at the outset to reiterate my thanks to my fellow-members of the Committee for their constructive cooperation, but would also like to thank the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective, which has played a substantial part in ensuring, not only that PROGRESS is now a good instrument for the better implementation of the social policy agenda, but also that we will have enough money to be able to really ensure greater sustainability.
PROGRESS represents a response to the results of the Eurobarometer surveys, for what the public wants is greater involvement on the part of the EU in the combating of unemployment and poverty.
For that, though, a primary requirement is for well-organised and structured sharing of experience, with it being particularly necessary that we should promote to a far greater degree the process of learning from one another, whether by supporting European networks, setting in motion Europe-wide studies and analyses or even by means of conferences.
This is the only way in which we will succeed in maintaining, in future, the highest possible level of social protection throughout Europe, on which, after all, the maintenance of a peaceful society and social cohesion in the European Union depends.
That is something that the Member States now, at last, appear to have realised.
Let me now turn to the Commission proposal, to which we have proposed a range of improvements and additions.
The improvements primarily have to do with an increase in the overall appropriations and certain changes to the way in which they are distributed among the various areas targeted.
What this boils down to is that we have now voted PROGRESS EURÂ 225Â million more than the Commission originally allocated it, and I might also mention that this sum takes estimated inflation into account.
There was one of the fields to which the PROGRESS programme applies for which we, together with the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, had to fight particularly hard, and that was gender mainstreaming.
Without wanting to reopen old wounds, I have to say that I am firmly convinced that, if there are in future to be no more officially free-standing action programmes to promote equality of opportunity, reinforcing this in all areas to which the programme relates and measures taken under it is what is needed to win over the Womenâs Committee.
Moreover, our Committee was not prepared to accept the cuts in the resources set aside for gender mainstreaming that the Council and the Commission sought.
We are reversing many of these cuts, but, rather than taking the money away from other important target areas, we have done this by voting to make the very high flexibility margin of 10% less rigid and thus make it possible for the share allocated to gender equality to be increased by 4% to its present 12% share of the budget for PROGRESS.
The Committee also regards five points in this programme as being particularly important, and I expect the Commission to support us in this.
For a start, we want to make the individual target areas more visible, which means that the programme committee needs to have five sub-committees, and also needs to organise for each target area an annual exchange of views on the way in which the programme is put into effect, enabling each of these committees to join with the specialist committees in this House in debating it.
Secondly, we want the transnational exchange to be maintained in future, for that alone will provide Europe with the added value that we want, and, thirdly, we want PROGRESS to help to really get the experience gained from the programme circulated among the Member States faster than the current programmes have done.
We in this Parliament do of course now want â and this is my fourth point â to be more closely involved in monitoring the programme.
As I see it, the mere fact that the programme is to run for seven years makes this an absolute necessity.
We therefore believe that the distribution of the annual funding around the individual target areas should not be a responsibility for the programme committee but rather a matter for the Budget procedure each year.
That brings me to my last point, the role of the social partners and non-governmental organisations.
The Committee found the Commissionâs desire to limit their role to no more than the pursuit of the EUâs objectives incomprehensible.
We regard their involvement in the ongoing development of strategies as indispensable.
The possibility of participation in PROGRESS must also be open to national and regional non-governmental organisations.
It therefore follows that the maximum co-funding should continue to stand at 90% and not at something like 80%, which would be a cause of major difficulties to many EU networks.
Â Â  . â One of the most controversial aspects of this proposal to set up the new Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity â PROGRESS â is that equality between men and women has been lumped into one single social programme, when the issue is not merely a social one.
Accordingly, in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, we have sought to strike a balance between the need to raise the profile of the struggle for genuine equality between men and women and the Commissionâs proposal, bringing action on the ground and the existing directives closer together.
Against this backdrop, the creation of the European Gender Institute is of major importance; it should be granted greater powers and its own financial resources, more so than the Commission is currently proposing.
Most of the proposals that we adopted in the Committee on Womenâs Rights have been addressed, at least in part, in the report by Mrs JÃ¶ns, whom I congratulate on her work.
I should like to highlight the following points: the increase in cofinancing to a 90% ceiling, in light of the difficulties experienced by NGOs and other social organisations working in these areas; the increase in the financial framework to EURÂ 854.2 million for the seven-year period from 2007; and the change in the financial allocation between the different strands.
This programme must effectively address the question of the protection and social inclusion of immigrants, the disabled, the unemployed, children and young people, and the elderly, along with issues such as working conditions, the fight against discrimination, and the promotion of diversity.
I wish to stress, however, that gender mainstreaming and the issue of equality between men and women must be incorporated into all strands and measures forming part of the PROGRESS Programme and all programmes using Community funds, in order to prevent women from being victims of repeated discrimination and to prevent any backsliding on the policy of equality between men and women across a broad spectrum of areas.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like first of all to address MrsÂ JÃ¶ns in order to congratulate her on her excellent report on PROGRESS.
I am equally delighted by the quality of the debates we have had in committee and by the very interesting compromise amendments, of which I would specifically like to point out the following.
I believe that interesting amendments have been made to the Commissionâs text, particularly with regard to Parliamentâs role itself.
It should be recognised, Commissioner, that the Commissionâs initial text treated us somewhat as the poor relation when it came to the evaluations of a programme actually extending over seven years (2007-2013).
I think it is worth remembering what the Commission was proposing concerning the role of Parliament, namely the simple forwarding to Parliament of an ex post evaluation focused on the entire programme, an evaluation drafted by the Commission one year after the programmeâs conclusion.
I believe that the proposals being submitted by the Commission respond to the need for Parliament to intervene directly and throughout the entire seven-year period covered by such an important programme. They are also particularly acceptable to the Commission.
Secondly, through the use of compromise amendments, MrsÂ JÃ¶ns has drawn attention to the particularly important role of non-governmental organisations and of social organisations.
Everyone will be in agreement in recognising that, from a national and transnational perspective, these organisations play a particularly important role in the framework of the specialised networks belonging to them at EU level.
It is therefore only natural that they should participate in devising, implementing and monitoring the programme.
It is equally clear that promoting the direct exchange of experiences can ensure a greater understanding of the individual nature of events taking place in different countries; it is, moreover, only in this way that exchanges on strategies, good practices and innovative strategic approaches will bear fruit and endow the evaluations with the quality scientific approach they require.
I will say one final word on financial and budgetary matters since they remain the core issue.
It should be pointed out that the sum of EURÂ 628Â million, proposed by the Commission, falls well short of the amount recommended in the BÃ¶ge report on the financial and budgetary package for 2007-2013.
I would like in particular to emphasise that the success of the PROGRESS programme essentially depends on the amount awarded to it, and it is clear that the amount proposed by the Commission is by no means acceptable.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for what is, typically, an extremely good report.
We have taken a positive view of this proposal concerning PROGRESS and the amalgamation of the previous four programmes. This may mean better coordination, less overlap and more efficient use of expenditure.
Amalgamation is therefore to be welcomed.
The programme has a role to play in the Lisbon strategy that is, of course, not only about competitiveness but also about a social Europe and a less stratified society.
It is a fact that unemployment is too high at present.
Social protection systems and social integration do not operate in ways that are entirely satisfactory.
Gender equality is not always to be seen, and there is still discrimination.
This programme is therefore extremely important.
I wish to comment on a number of aspects also addressed by the rapporteur.
Firstly, the pooling of experience, including transnational experience.
It is incredibly important to make the most of the programmeâs innovative character, for, at national level, we conduct labour market policies.
These programmes must be creative and innovative and be extended across national borders so that everyone might benefit from what is being done through different projects.
Secondly, gender equality should not just be applied specifically in one area.
Instead, it must permeate all parts of the programmes and of PROGRESS.
I also wish to emphasise the accessibility aspects.
Disabled people are now excluded from the labour market to a greater extent and have more difficulty being integrated into society.
It is therefore important for the accessibility aspects, broadly understood, to be integrated into, and taken account of in, all parts of the programme so that disabled people can participate in the labour market.
The same applies to the social integration of people who come from other parts of the world and who are not part of the labour market.
I myself have experience of working in Sweden on the Swedish programme.
I wish to emphasise what the rapporteur too mentioned, namely that both sides of industry, as well as non-governmental organisations, must be involved in the whole of the work, designing, implementing and supervising the programmes.
They will be a major resource in the work being done firmly to establish these programmes at national and regional levels.
The financial aspects have already been touched upon.
The Commissionâs proposal would make far too few resources available and is too old-fashioned.
Social Europe is an area on which we must concentrate when we create the long-term budget.
That is why the proposal by the committee responsible, put forward here in Parliament and recommending more resources, is to be preferred.
Now, the subject of a social Europe has been taken up by the British Presidency.
In this context, the need for a properly resourced PROGRESS programme should also be evaluated.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for the excellent job she has done, as well as all the groups and my colleagues in the committee, who have helped, through the amendments they have tabled, to improve an initiative that we are very pleased with.
In my view, the greatest merit of the PROGRESS programme as part of simplification and rationalisation efforts is the renewal of a commitment to priorities that are crucial for achieving the Lisbon Strategyâs objectives, by providing instruments that are appropriate, albeit not fully balanced.
When we talk of investment in aspects such as human resources, training, employment services, efforts to achieve higher employment rates, the promotion of crucial qualitative and quantitative employment levels and at the same time an agenda for social cohesion, we have in mind objectives that should not be seen solely as a compensatory or offsetting appendage to a Lisbon Strategy focused exclusively on the economic sphere, but that form an integral part of it.
For these very reasons, I believe that it is fundamentally important to propose and plan a reinforcement of the financial framework, but we also place considerable emphasis on the success of this proposal, including the section relating to an increase in the cofinancing ceilings, which are essential in promoting a decisive and determining aspect of the programme: an upgraded role for partnership.
If the social dimension does not play a leading and decisive role in planning and implementation, commitment from the institutions alone will probably fall short of the objectives.
Other issues have already been dealt with by other Members, and so I have dwelt on just a few points that, in my view, are crucial for the success of an option that is decisive in the relaunch of European strategies for development and the systemâs competitiveness.
Mr President, I welcome the report by Mrs JÃ¶ns and thank her for her work.
In particular I welcome the emphasis placed on social inclusion, gender mainstreaming, people with disabilities and the role of the NGO sector in this programme.
I also want to throw my support behind calls for an increase in the financial aid proposed and for a co-financing rate of 90%, rather than 80%, in relation to the role of NGOs and social partners.
Let us be clear: the current economic strategies are driving more and more people into poverty within the European Union, and our hope is that PROGRESS can help play an important role in the fight against social exclusion.
The strengthening of gender equality should be supported wholeheartedly by this Parliament, especially those elements which emphasise actions promoting gender equality that aim to combat discrimination and access to employment, career development, pay and training, and that fight the causes of poverty and social exclusion.
This is a real and immediate issue for women in particular.
In Ireland, for example, the gender pay gap has substantially increased for women and the gap between men's and women's pay in Ireland is among the largest of any EU Member State.
Irish women are paid 17% less for the same work as Irish men and, according to a recent report by the Central Statistics Office, one-parent families are three and a half times more likely to experience poverty.
If we want to see fundamental change within society and bring in this fundamental change in mindsets and conditions, we must support this programme and this report.
I will be voting for this.
Â Â  . Mr President, employment and social solidarity go together.
The greatest social benefit, the greatest solidarity, is for people to have jobs.
However, fuller employment will not come about through bureaucratic plans and schemes such as Lisbon, which the rapporteur and others seem to think will help and which is now discredited, surely: halfway through its time span and less than half implemented.
Employment is encouraged by removing restraints and scrapping regulations.
I point out again in this House that those countries that have not adopted the euro have the lowest levels of unemployment.
However, it goes deeper.
In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in July, David Blunkett, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said that we must not work against Member States, that different countries have different solutions and that defining best practice is the first step.
Therefore, we must observe what others do and learn from each other, taking and adapting from each other what suits best.
We must not conjure up new projects with ever increasing budgets.
The rapporteur rightly says that red tape must be cut through but is sceptical about the European Union's ability to do so.
Likewise, David Blunkett said that many regulations were being passed which were impossible to implement.
Just so: the first measure to be discarded is this well-meaning but artificial attempt to create social solidarity.
I voted against it in committee and I ask this House to do the same.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to respond briefly to what the last speaker said.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of this programme.
If we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, if we want jobs for everyone, we must help people to achieve this goal.
After all, people in employment are best placed to meet their own basic needs.
That is why it is so important that all those disadvantaged groups know that Europe exists and that it can provide them with support in finding jobs, in gaining extra qualifications, in changing working conditions, and so on, and it is for that reason that I congratulate Mrs JÃ¶ns on this report.
I should like to answer two questions.
I have just received a note to which I can now respond in my own language.
The first question is: how do you actually arrive at the amount mentioned in your amendment?
The amount that was proposed at the time was EURÂ 854Â million, which was still wishful thinking on the part of Mrs JÃ¶ns.
We then thought that such an amount was not attainable, but we subsequently joined forces and arrived at a final sum of EUR 858 million in Mr BÃ¶geâs report.
That is why we have increased the amount from EUR 854 million to 858 million, and I assume that everyone is agreed on this.
We have also changed the percentages.
We wanted to do the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality a favour by setting aside more funds for gender equality and we also wanted to put some money aside for working conditions.
I think that those issues are worthwhile and that they can redress the balance in PROGRESS to some extent.
Finally, it is because all those minor incidental programmes do not make life any easier that I am delighted with PROGRESS, which will enable us to channel our money, commitment and energy much more effectively.
I would therefore support everyone involved in this PROGRESS programme, and I hope that those two amendments tabled by our group will make it past the finishing line.
Â Â  Mr President, I warmly support my good friend and colleague, our rapporteur, Mrs JÃ¶ns, in her work to strengthen this funding proposal.
It underpins our European work on the critical issues of discrimination and social exclusion that continue to hold back so many people in our societies.
If the Lisbon Strategy is to mean more than just words, Parliament is right to expect a significant increase in funding for this area.
If politicians in Brussels are genuinely worried about disengagement and alienation, as reflected by the votes on the Constitutional Treaty and in other ways, it is right for us to insist that the Commission should strengthen, not weaken, the role of both social partners and of non-governmental organisations in this programme.
I strongly support combating all forms of discrimination.
As many colleagues are aware, I have a specific interest in working with the disability movement.
I would like to remind Parliament and Commission that this is the programme which provides the core funding to enable disabled people, and indeed other groups that are discriminated against, to meet and to represent themselves at European level.
If we fail to allow this, we exclude the most disadvantaged people from our work in the European Union.
I remember very well the budget crisis back in 1998, when the funding for such NGOs was called into question in a wholly unjustifiable manner.
It was resolved at political level by the Member States, on the clear understanding that the work of these organisations on combating discrimination is vital in pushing forward the EU agenda.
Let that be remembered today.
I want to reiterate that it is important for these networks to be independent and capable of representing the concerns of their members.
The Commission too often sees them as agencies for promoting and implementing its work.
No, they must represent the views and experiences of disadvantaged people themselves.
I believe in gender mainstreaming, but it should apply to disabled people too, with disabled, not able-bodied, people representing them.
Our amendments, which provide for adaptations, accommodations and accessibility and include publicity, are absolutely crucial in ensuring that disabled people are involved.
Finally I want to express support for the small disability organisations for blind and people, or people with intellectual disabilities.
They too have a right to meet at European level and we should not forget them and try and lump people together in large groups.
There is room for all organisations, large and small.
Â Â  Mr President, esteemed colleagues.
Solidarity is one of the most fundamental principles of European integration.
In this regard, the neighbouring Scandinavian countries serve as a good model for my home country Estonia.
Finland, Sweden and Denmark have some of the highest human development indicators in the world.
At the same time, they occupy positions at the peak of economic competitiveness.
In order to achieve the Lisbon development objectives and find an appropriate social model to meet the challenges the European Union will face in the future, we should certainly keep their valuable experiences in mind.
The decision under discussion, which would establish a programme for employment and social solidarity in the Union, is a substantial step towards the creation of a more uniformly developed social environment in Europe.
In connection with this, I would like to emphasise that non-governmental organisations can be effective partners to national governments, and as motors of civil society, these are also responsive social indicators.
In order to increase and improve the progress of this programme, and also its implementation, I, as one of the co-rapporteurs, suggested that the rate of cofinancing should be raised to 90% of the total expenses of NGOs.
This is a significant measure which will especially help the 10 countries that have most recently joined the European Union to catch up more quickly with the others.
A prosperous Europe is a goal towards which we all strive.
Today, the new Member States in particular require support in order to work as equals with the other Members, without eating into the other countriesâ budgets.
We must ensure the stability of democratic processes, and this is directly connected with social stability.
The measure of raising cofinancing is also important because both the associated candidate countries of the European Union and the western Balkan states included in the process can participate in the programme.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs JÃ¶ns, for her expert work, and also you, my good colleagues, for your attention.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, we agree with Mrs JÃ¶nsâ report â and I wish to congratulate her â because we believe that safeguarding high levels of social protection and participation of the workers, at a time when the rules of the market and of profit prevail, is our urgent duty.
We consider that all workers have the right to work and live in an environment of equality and social cohesion and therefore stress, among other things, that immigrants are not second-class workers or citizens.
The enjoyment of equal rights and equal opportunities and their social protection and integration are non-negotiable.
The same also applies to people with disabilities, who must also have access to work and whose social integration must be promoted and confirmed.
The European Parliament can and must have a fundamental role in the monitoring and application of the PROGRESS programme.
The citizens of the Union and every person must have the right of participation and of equal opportunity in the society in which they live and this can only be achieved when profit policies do not steal a march on social policies.
We consider that the PROGRESS programme, with the improvements approved by the relevant committees, including the increase in funding, can at least play a role in safeguarding a certain level of social cohesion by giving work to those who have been socially unprotected in the past and, ultimately, by achieving social protection for all workers without cutting corners and without discrimination.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we should talk not about the PROGRESS programme, but about the PROGRESS programmes, which Europe hopes will develop as a result of your Commission's proposal.
Efforts to rationalise the funding administered by your Commission are praiseworthy and we hope that they will prove to be successful in achieving greater cohesiveness and avoiding duplication when this new programme is adopted.
Without ignoring the competence of the Member States, efforts are being made to safeguard the and to apply the open method of coordination in the fields of employment, social protection, the organisation and improvement of working times, the fight against discrimination and gender equality.
Reducing the number of budget lines from 28 to 2 and harmonising the scope of the four programmes which already exist will, we hope, help to make support for the social and political agenda of the Lisbon Strategy more effective.
I congratulate the rapporteur because, with her ability to take a balanced view, she accepted all the positive improvements proposed by the committees in their opinions, especially by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for which I acted as shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Î hope in particular that future provisions adopted by the programme committee, assisted by the four proposed subcommittees, will bring about the required simplification in the use and flexibility in the funding of the programmes, so that the participation of European networks and of national and regional non-governmental organisations becomes a reality, so that transnational cooperation is reinforced and mainstreaming to combat all forms of discrimination and gender discrimination and to reinforce participation by women and people with disabilities becomes a reality, so that the European Employment Strategy, which is the key to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, is helped by the social awareness which will strengthen the PROGRESS programmes.
This programme is designed, therefore, to support the application of protection and of the fight against social exclusion, especially of minority groups, and improvements to the working environment, supplemented by the provision for combining family life and work so that women are given the opportunity to participate in the workplace.
We are also hoping for measures to combat all forms of discrimination against immigrants and to integrate them by recognising undeclared work, as proposed by the programme.
Thank you.
We hope that the objectives of the programme will be implemented.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the fundamental principles of Community law is the equal treatment of women and men.
All the directives relating to this have made a decisive contribution in improving the position of women, who make up 52% of our population and thus constitute the majority.
Grateful though I am to Mrs JÃ¶ns for having reinforced this aspect of the PROGRESS programme, I do take the view that the amalgamation of the five areas of the social agenda is politically mistaken and must not be allowed to remain unchanged.
Gender equality should have a free-standing programme of its own.
There are six arguments in favour of this: firstly, the Constitutional Treaty reinforces equality policy; secondly the equality programme, like the budget for it, was formerly a matter for the Committee on Womenâs Rights, and quite rightly too.
Thirdly, the awaited creation of the Gender Institute, gender mainstreaming and a relevant and free-standing equality programme will, in matters of equality policy, make the EU and this House of ours very visible to women; all women will see that Europe is actively working for them.
Fourthly, the Womenâs Committee remains a driving force for the rights of our female citizens and will not agree to those rights being undermined by such things as the planned amalgamation, with effect from 2008, of the DAPHNE anti-violence programme with the programme against drugs, which amounts to an open assault upon womenâs policy.
Fifthly, gender mainstreaming must be consistently applied in all PROGRESSâs pillars, whether in employment, social protection, working conditions or the fight against discrimination, for women are still subject to discrimination in many areas, and, sixthly, what is currently going on runs counter to the Barroso Commissionâs commitment to putting equality high up the agenda.
Although PROGRESS puts women back on the social agenda, pigeonholing them under âsocial issuesâ, the solution to the equality problem is political in nature.
We women may have lost the first round, but Parliamentâs amendments â and thanks again to Mrs JÃ¶ns â have prevented drastic cutbacks in the area of equality of opportunity.
Let me warn the Commission, though, that, if equality policy becomes even less visible and is taken even less seriously, then support on the part of women will diminish as well.
PROGRESS depends on them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European PROGRESS programme will henceforth encompass the former European Gender Equality programme in the form of a section on equal treatment of men and women.
I congratulate MrsÂ JÃ¶ns on her report.
Without doubt, the Lisbon challenges impose the need for an agenda to achieve a rationalised social policy in terms of spending and monitoring.
Yet, will the new European social policy enable women to gain full recognition for all the functions they perform?
Will the value of their work be better recognised by integrating the policy of equality into that of employment?
Etymologists set us thinking.
The origin of the word economy, , house, and , rule, explains that economy is a desire to run a house efficiently.
In all domestic or professional spheres, in the market or non-market sector, women know how to make use of scarce resources and turn them into something else.
They know how to satisfy everyoneâs needs and desires and to redistribute the outcome of what they produce.
Around 30% of womenâs economic output is not even accounted for.
That earned the US economist, Gari Becker, a Nobel Prize.
In my country, behind the Iron Curtain, women did not expect to receive a pay slip, nor unemployment benefit to support those close to them.
They only worked to ensure their own survival and that of their family.
Lisbon wishes to fight against impoverishment in Europe and for greater social justice.
The clearly identified commercial criteria are widely debated here.
Let us make no mistake, a significant effort remains to be made to identify the work of women, the driving force behind the networks of solidarity, including the economic indicators of our nationsâ accounts.
Solidarity in the economy calls on us to conduct politics in a different way and to establish relations between human beings based on public-spirited and socially aware behaviour that respects everyoneâs differences.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the debate on PROGRESS, the new Community programme, is being held at a very important time.
Firstly, the recently enlarged European Union has as its basic aspiration the difficult objective of economic and social cohesion in today's environment of low development levels and regional and social inequalities.
Secondly, the European Union is preparing to enlarge towards south-east Europe and to start accession negotiations with Turkey, a large country with serious problems in all sectors.
These developments relate directly to our political plans and to our financial perspectives.
Thirdly, the social problems of European citizens which the PROGRESS programme is designed to combat lie at the heart of speculation about the effectiveness of our social model and the credibility and viability of the European Union.
For these reasons, we expect a great deal of the PROGRESS programme in terms of its structure, its collective and coordinating character, its adequate funding, the potential to mobilise social and economic agencies and, more specifically, to give numerous agencies at national and regional level the chance to participate, because we must not forget that our administration to date is making European citizens say that we are supporting and cooperating with the professionals of the European programmes and not the real, basic protagonists.
I should like in particular to highlight the need to integrate the gender factor into all sectors in which action is taken, in all evaluations and reviews, both interim and annual, of the PROGRESS programme, as the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality emphasises in its opinion.
We have a great deal of experience in the European Union today from the application of equality programmes at Community and national level.
At the same time, women have a great many problems in connection with discrimination, unemployment, poverty and exclusion.
We therefore need to work in the new framework which we have before us, in the PROGRESS programme, with political perspicacity and appropriate administrative mechanisms, in order to respond to the aspirations of women and resolve their problems.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I thank Parliament for this interesting and important debate.
I am delighted that the opinion adopted by Parliamentâs Committee on Employment and Social Affairs shares with the Commissionâs proposal the same desire to simplify and to rationalise, and I would like to say a few words about the Commissionâs position with regard to certain major amendments.
Having regard to Amendment 55 on the inclusion of regional and national non-governmental organisations as potential beneficiaries of the programme, the Commission stresses that this support for national and regional NGOs has not been ruled out.
Nevertheless, the Commission wished to send a signal to clearly indicate that the programme is first and foremost aimed at NGOs organised at EU level, as they bring a higher degree of added value.
As regards increasing the financial envelope of the programme, Amendments 66 and 73 together with dividing the funds among the various sections of the programme and the flexibility reserve provided for Amendments 67 and 74 the Commission is not opposed to a debate on these issues but, at this stage, it is not amending its initial proposal and is waiting for an overall agreement on the financial perspectives.
Having regard to Amendment 59, which divides the Committee into five subcommittees corresponding to the five sections of the programme, the Commission will not change its position with regard to the fact that it wishes to be assisted by only one committee on the PROGRESS programme, even if the members of this committee may change according to the agenda, as is indicated in recital 12a of the amended proposal for a Council decision.
I am pleased to note that the position of the European Parliament is not very far removed from that of the Commission.
Inter alia, the amendments aimed at strengthening the role of the European Parliament or, furthermore, at mainstreaming the gender dimension are very much welcomed by the Commission.
There is no danger that we will lose sight of gender mainstreaming in the new PROGRESS programme; on the contrary, the Commission will ensure that it highlights the aspect of gender which, by being integrated into the new programme, will strengthen the principle of mainstreaming.
I quite understand the concerns expressed in the draft opinion of Parliament; that is why the Commission will amend its proposal as far as possible in order to respond to this opinion of Parliament.
MrÂ President, I will now list the amendments that the Commission can accept in full: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 30, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 46, 47, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62, 63, 68, 69 and 70.
The Commission can substantially accept the following Amendments, but accept only the spirit of parts of them, and on condition that they are reworded: 4, 11, 14, 18, 22, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 35, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 58, 64, 65 and 71.
Finally, the Commission must reject Amendments: 9, 16, 23, 33, 38, 50, 51, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 66, 67, 72, 73 and 74.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the quality of its debate on this proposal.
Thanks to the dialogue between the Commission and the European Parliament, I can say with conviction that the resulting text will take better account of the political objectives of the European Parliament while at the same time having contributed to the effort to simplify and to rationalise, which will be to the advantage of the beneficiaries.
The PROGRESS proposal submitted to you is essential for implementing the new social agenda.
This programme will enable us to give financial backing to the instruments we have, such as the open method of coordination, the drafting of legislation and efforts to monitor its application, the exchange of good practices and the action of non-governmental organisations.
Mr President, that is my conclusion.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0202/2005) by MrÂ Weber, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the application of Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 89/552/EEC âTelevision without frontiersâ, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC, for the period 2001-2002 [2004/2236(INI)].
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the âTelevision without Frontiersâ Directive is, without doubt, one of the success stories of the European Union.
In 1989, when the first text was adopted, there were only about 50 television channels in Europe.
Today, there are 50 times that many.
The audiovisual landscape has been changed radically by satellite, cable, digital, the Internet and the mobile telephone.
New media, new broadcasting methods and new services have appeared.
There is therefore a crucial and urgent need to revise and extend the directive.
MrsÂ Reding has announced that she will present these proposals to us in autumn.
I take advantage of this occasion to congratulate her on her commitment to European television and to thank her for the attention she has clearly given to professionals from the sector.
I invite her to pay attention to the three parts of this report, to our thoughts on the application of Articles 4 and 5, to the paths we propose for the revision of the Directive and to the significant problem posed by media concentration.
With regard to Articles 4 and 5, the results are good and these measures must be upheld.
They are the minimum standards satisfying the most people and it is advisable not to downgrade them, even if pressure is growing to reduce regulation.
We can, however, propose improvements when it comes to defining the concepts of âindependent producerâ and âworkâ or to establishing a more standardised grid of the results of the Member States, for example.
Revising the directive is not easy.
We must find the right balance so that the audiovisual sector does not become a purely commercial sector to the detriment of cultural diversity.
At the same time, however, we must not hinder the development of a sector in the throes of a continuous technical revolution, which is very important for our industries and for our jobs.
The standards laid down by the directive are minimal as it is, and they have not always prevented a slide towards commercialism and mindlessness in certain Member States.
Unfortunately, the numerous interviews I have been able to have demonstrate that the general mood is such that the level of regulation will decrease under the combined pressure both of the industries and advertising and also of a number of Member States.
That is why, together with my colleagues, I call for the legal basis chosen to be one that allows this text to be overseen by the Committee on Culture and Education.
Without wishing to create hostilities, I am afraid that another committee might tackle this text from a more commercial than cultural angle.
The proposals that I am submitting are not intended to deviate from the principles of the current Directive, which is based largely on self-regulation and which is not overly prescriptive.
It does not deviate, either, from the two previous reports by our institution, including the one by my fellow MEP, MrsÂ Hieronymi.
This revision of the Directive must enhance a number of fundamental principles: free movement of European television broadcasts, free access to exceptional events, promotion of European works and recent independent productions, protection of minors and public order and protection of consumers thanks to the identification of content providers and to transparency in advertising and the right of reply.
It must also promote the movement of national works in every country of the Union.
We produce a great deal.
We exchange too little among Europeans.
We must remedy this shortcoming.
We must also encourage European content to be shown on television.
That can of course be promoted through the Media (Plus) programme.
I would also like us to address the definition of what a work is.
The âTelevision without Frontiersâ Directive indicates what it is not.
It is not information.
It is not advertising.
Yet is it reality TV, for example?
I would prefer â as would a number of professionals â an actual definition.
I could also emphasise the role of public services.
They must be able to carry out their remit.
How can we help them to do this?
I regret that my fellow MEPs have not followed my proposal for a European Public Audiovisual Service Charter.
I would also like to invite the Commission to find the means to protect the diversity of television property and to prevent all excessive media concentration.
Media pluralism is essential in democracy; since the Union keeps telling us that we cannot legislate in that area, it must at least help the Member States to lay down more stringent rules.
On Tuesday 13 of next week, we are going to hold a seminar on this important issue, in Manchester.
Since MrsÂ Reding is listening to us, I would like her to inform us of the developments envisaged by the Commission at this stage of the work, in particular on issues relating to advertising, to the field of application of the directive, to the support measures for the production of European and independent works and to the organisation of the regulation.
What about adapting the country of origin principle and the principle of media pluralism?
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank MrÂ Weber for his willingness to engage in dialogue and for seeking agreement.
I firmly believe that democracy is essentially a system of public opinion and that its quality therefore depends on the quality of what we have come to call freedom of expression, a right that not everybody understands properly.
For me, freedom of expression is above all the right of each citizen to choose the channels of information he or she prefers.
Consequently, in order to safeguard that right we must prevent too many media organisations from falling into the hands of a few, and I entirely agree with you, Mr Weber, on the need to combat the phenomena of concentration, but we must also consolidate a situation in which the media are not subjected to criteria laid down on a whim by the government that happens to be in power at the time.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe these comments to be very general, and they lead to certain specific considerations which I would like to be implemented in the not too distant future.
We must combat all initiatives that reduce the quality of freedom of expression.
It is therefore not acceptable to interfere with the content of programmes.
Let us stop doing so.
I do not believe that we should dictate to the commercial television channels how to administer their advertising, because advertising is essential to commercial television.
They must respect the limit established by law, but we should not lay down how they must distribute advertising, because they know exactly how to make the source of their commercial survival viable.
Mr Weber, we must establish the political objective â and this is where we disagree â of putting an end to a concept that I believe to pose certain difficulties: that of public service.
That concept makes sense insofar as spectral space is limited and the governments must therefore regulate it by means of a system of franchises, which in the end become intimidatory.
Nevertheless, Mr Weber, you have acknowledged that we are moving towards a world in which television must be redefined, a world in which television means conventional television as we know it, but also television via the Internet, television via mobile phone and television via all the new technologies.
It is not therefore a scarce resource, and we must restrict State interventionism.
I hope that in the not too distant future, this concept of public service will no longer be applied to commercial television.
I would therefore like us to be able to agree on how to redefine the role of public television channels.
They are fundamental, provided they adhere to the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, that they make the programmes the viewers wish to see and cannot see on the commercial channels.
Mr Weber, that is the principle of subsidiarity, which I defend.
In conclusion, Mr President, I believe technologies are changing and that consequently the perspectives are changing too.
I also believe it is our responsibility to do our utmost to ensure the new âTelevision without frontiersâ Directive becomes an opportunity to increase the quality of democracy.
I would therefore like to express my hope that we do a good job.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome Mr Weber's report on television without frontiers and I fully support it.
A proper media policy providing cultural values is crucial to broadening the understanding between our nations.
When the first legislative act on this subject was approved, my country â Hungary â was not yet a member of the European Communities.
However, this legislation meets the requirements of our cultural policy.
As regards this topic, I should like to raise the question: why do we have to regulate the programmes on our television channels?
The answer is very simple: because we want to save our national cultures and create a common European identity.
In order to promote cultural diversity and build up a European identity, we need a stronger exchange of our cultural values, including our cinematographic heritage.
This new report is a further step in the right direction.
The so-called quotas generally worked well.
The cases where they failed to do so should be compiled and studied.
However, we should give a more precise answer to the question: âWhat is a European production?â
How can we ensure that it will consist of as many films with cinematographic values as possible?
For me, that is a crucial point.
I am sure that European cinema helps European people â mainly the young people â to understand each other's sorrows and joys.
Perhaps having a sub-quota, especially for feature and documentary films, would be an improvement.
The other question concerns the case of non-domestic productions.
In smaller countries, such as Hungary, it is not a problem.
On our television channels, many non-Hungarian and European films are broadcast.
However, in some larger Member States, there are hardly any non-domestic European programmes.
As the referendum on the Constitution shows, people from some larger nations hardly know anything about the values of the Central and Eastern European countries or of other smaller Member States.
The European identity needs and deserves to be reflected, even on the channels of the bigger nations.
Often our legislation just follows technical developments.
I hope that, in the light of the digital revolution, we can pass proper legislation in due time.
That is why I welcome Mr Weber's excellent report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to repeat what a special and important place the âTelevision without Frontiersâ Directive occupies within European integration.
Through the impact it has, it creates a strong and clear link between all Europeans; it remains one of the essential factors of intercultural dialogue and contributes to developing our European identity.
MrÂ Weberâs report not only refers to the application of Articles 4 and 5, but also to issues such as the revision of the Directive itself or media pluralism.
Through my amendments, I was particularly keen to encourage assistance to be given to Europeâs special character so that cultural diversity, freedom, pluralism and independence of the media remain the crucial components of Europeâs audiovisual model.
I also attached great importance to prioritising qualitative methods of analysing cultural content when confronted by the offensive of private or commercial production companies on the European markets.
It is therefore crucial, in my opinion, to develop the special European character of content by establishing a link with funding methods.
This precise point did not need to be developed in this report but it will absolutely have to remain a priority objective during the overall revision of the directive.
In actual fact, nothing can be truly effective as long as the Member States do not commit to continuing funding public service television and to justifying the use of funds to the European Union.
Obviously, it is impossible to talk about revising this directive without addressing the delicate issue of advertising.
With regard to the latter, I considered that its content and regulation ought to be clearly defined, in particular for advertising relating to alcohol, which has a harmful effect on children and vulnerable people.
I would even consider it crucial to extend the Directive to all audiovisual services made available to the public.
I therefore hope that the new Directive can lay down legislation that genuinely implements the application of the penalties provided for as regards quotas and advertising.
To conclude, I therefore ask you to vote in favour of this very satisfactory report proposed by our fellow MEP, MrÂ Weber.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Weber for his report and particularly to express my agreement with his view which underpins it, namely that this television directive has been a European success story.
Over recent years, it has been possible to reserve most of the broadcasting time to European works, which is what the directive was intended to do.
What is also crucial is that the process of integration in which Europe is engaged means that there has to be more exchanging of television programmes between all the European countries.
In view of the regrettable fact that the percentage of broadcasts produced by independent producers has declined over recent years, more of them should be sought out and more European joint productions facilitated.
There are two problematic aspects that I would like to address.
Particularly in the new Member States, there has been an increase in media concentration to a disturbing degree, and that is something of which we must not lose sight.
Media concentration of such a kind cannot, politically speaking, be in our interests, for media diversity makes for freedom and liberality, and is something that we must defend.
I agree with Mr Weber about the need for regulation if we are to be able to do that.
The second crucial aspect is that in adapting the directive to the new technological revolution, and to digital media, we must do everything possible to enable public television, whatever the challenges posed by the competition, to really benefit from these new technologies, thus preventing it from being undermined and put at a disadvantage without anyone noticing.
The real test of our success will be media diversity in the public sector too.
Speaking as a German Member of this House, whatever the high regard in which I hold public television and whatever my commitment to it, I have to say that it must do what is required of it even with the new resources at its disposal and there must be no more of what one might describe as surreptitious advertising in public television.
Â Â  . â Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Weber, for the excellent report which he has presented and for the fact that he presents a broader picture of the needs and objectives which the TV without Frontiers Directive needs to serve.
In my opinion, the two major problems against which we need to pit ourselves once more â both the European Parliament and the Commission â in the run up to the review of the directive in the autumn are:
Firstly and most importantly, over-concentration of the media, which is damaging pluralism and substantially restricting democracy, as the rapporteur rightly notes.
However, we also have some experience.
Until now, this matter has been left solely in the hands of the Member States and over-concentration is increasing and in several Member States democracy is suffering.
I therefore think that we need to ask the Commission for a common European antitrust policy which will protect pluralism and diversity and prevent the unfair concentration of ownership.
The second problem concerns the very defence of European television productions, which are a facet of our European identity and of our European culture.
We need to do whatever we can here to strengthen European productions by reinforcing the circulation of national productions at trans-European level, by supporting joint European policies and productions and by improving how we use and coordinate the positive role of public broadcasting.
In addition, if we want to talk about quality, the Commission needs a positive definition of what works are, so that ridiculous, reality-type productions do not pass as quality and as European productions.
I trust that Parliament will play a fundamental role in shaping the new directive in both these sectors.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, having lived most of my life under Communist rule, the rules we are enforcing in the âTelevision without Frontiersâ Directive sound all too familiar to me.
Back in Communist times, a Soviet directive along the same lines was in force in the Czech Republic, aimed at drastically reducing the number of American films in favour of European productions, except that back then it applied to French and Soviet films respectively.
According to paragraphÂ 14 of the Weber report, Parliament should endeavour to ensure that the content of television programmes is uniquely European.
This begs the question of who should decide what âEuropeanâ means in this context.
I can assure you that if there is such a thing as a universal European, then there is a simple solution to any concerns he may have in this regard.
By using his channel selector, together with a small satellite dish and a receiver costing EURÂ 130, he can watch 1Â 400 television channels.
It would be nigh on impossible to regulate his viewing habits.
We will not succeed in creating a European television oeuvre by means of the Directive.
The only cultures that exist are national ones, and it will always be the latter that fill European quotas.
For that matter, the most European programme of all is the American film , since every viewer from Finland to Portugal can understand it in its entirety.
Hollywood productions are surprisingly European in their universal appeal, and our persistent attempts to keep American culture out of the mainstream of European civilisation and values are laughable.
I look forward to the time after Turkeyâs accession when we will use quotas to deny Europeans easily-understood American films of this kind, and be obliged to broadcast Turkish films in their place as part of a single European culture.
This amounts to nothing other than the customary social engineering, based on the belief that bans, quotas, regulations and subsidies can be used to create cultural values.
This belief is entirely misguided, as the only thing that we will create is mollycoddled film directors safe in the knowledge that they can make absurd films that only a select group of relatives, mistresses and friends will see fit to applaud.
By implementing the Directive, we are providing livelihoods to vast supervisory bodies in the EU Member States and granting subsidies to talentless creators who would otherwise be left behind in the usual competition for viewers.
We are also perpetuating an ineffective public television system and funding European television stations that attract such a small number of viewers that it is a waste of electricity to run their transmitters.
Real culture does not depend on regulations or on an endless stream of subsidies.
It survives at national level, even without artificial precautions on the part of the EU.
We should abolish the Directive, and leave cultural values in their rightful place, namely in the nation states.
Â Â  Mr President, the television directive is indeed one that gives the public a direct experience of the benefits of Europe and the European Union.
Protection of young people, protection of consumersâ interests, cultural diversity, European content and European productions â all these things are of value and the âtelevision without frontiersâ directive guarantees them to viewers in all the European Unionâs Member States.
I am very grateful to Mr Weber for highlighting the success of this and demanding those things that we need if it is to be continued.
As we are all aware, people not only have a television at home, but are also, and increasingly, able to receive programmes over the Internet or via their computers and mobile phones.
It is not acceptable that the same transmissions should be subject to different regulations depending on where they are broadcast from, and so it is indeed the case that this directive urgently needs to be revised.
In a couple of weeksâ time, the Commission and the British Presidency will be holding a major conference on this subject in Liverpool.
I strongly urge not only the Commission and the Member States, but also businesses and broadcasters, to be ready and willing to really carry forward this directive.
In particular, I urge, firstly, that the digital divide be reduced, for we need access to all media. Secondly, the television directiveâs objectives â ensuring cultural diversity, the dual system, protection of young people and consumers â need to be guaranteed appropriately in the new media.
It is for that reason that this report enjoys broad support from this House.
Â Â  â Mr President, television has been a catalytic medium for many years now, informing, educating and entertaining European citizens.
The European Union is aware of the lack of quality European productions and has set itself the primary objective in the TV without Frontiers Directive of reversing this worrying state of affairs by setting broadcasting quotas in order to promote European and independent productions.
It is very positive that the European Commission notes in its last report for 2001-2002 that there has been a bigger increase in the number of European works scheduled, with broadcasting of independent European productions fluctuating at around over 10%.
However, this positive image has a number of negative aspects.
For example, careful examination of the quotas shows that they are mainly met by domestic productions.
Although this certainly does not contradict the directive, it does not help to create a European audiovisual area, which cannot come about while European viewers have inadequate access to the audiovisual productions of other European countries.
It is a fact that joint European productions need to be promoted.
The report by Mr Weber, who has worked methodically and has received congratulations on a job well done by the entire Committee on Culture and Education, also extends to other important matters, such as safeguarding pluralism and the major issue for many countries of concentration of the media.
The Commission therefore needs to take serious account of the proposals in the report.
It is our duty to resist the pressure being exerted for a reduction in the regulatory arrangements in the directive, the minimal rules of which have been unable to reverse the deterioration in programme quality.
This century's culture of the image is a challenge to us to defend European culture and to channel it as a competitive product to other continents on our planet, given that to date, unfortunately, its citizens have consumed whatever is produced on the other side of the Atlantic.
This major issue is a cultural and, primarily, a political issue.
We have seen the extent to which the glamour productions of the United States contrast with the reality of New Orleans.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Weber report contains many innovative and important elements, including a full acknowledgement that the way democracy functions in every country is radically influenced by the media systems and that therefore it is vital to have a system of democratic controls to guarantee that citizensâ rights are not violated by state or private monopolies.
Not only is it essential for everyone to receive accurate information, but everyone must be able to participate in the management of communication.
I would like to stress, however, that the issues of information and communication are far more extensive than merely a debate on competition and pluralism.
A public sector is not enough to guarantee public control of information management; it is not enough for state television to be subject to the government and the parties as is the case in Italy and as, apparently, threatens to be the case in Slovenia; nor is the private sector a guarantee of anything, if all the commercial television channels are in the hands of a few and if advertising imposes decisions and content with regard to both entertainment and information.
I believe that Europe and Parliament must take a big step forwards in order to understand problems such as this one.
It is vital for the directive to be revised, but the Commission should bear in mind that the debate goes beyond market-place arguments.
In fact, television determines the cultural, intellectual and ethical environment of every country, and that in turn determines its degree of democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, I have long believed that the audiovisual sector has great potential for Scotland and Europe.
I myself spent a day on work experience on a film set in Glasgow during the summer.
I would add my own congratulations to our rapporteur for a very sensible and ambitious report.
This is not an area lacking in legislation; quite the reverse, the question for us is how effective that legislation is in this mobile digital Internet age.
I would, however, take some issue with paragraph 21 of the motion for a resolution.
Scotland has, of course, a specific cultural, national and, indeed, commercial potential and I believe that the Scottish Parliament should be responsible for broadcasting, although fortunately there is nothing in the EU rules to preclude that.
I also warmly support paragraphs 10 and 11, calling for an extension of the Media Plus Programme.
This has demonstrated what a positive impact the EU can have.
I hope the Commission will rise to our challenge and be as ambitious as we are.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report, which is quite balanced, emphasises certain problems and issues that are a concern for anyone who grasps â as we independent supporters of a Europe of the peoples do â the danger, plain for all to see, of a globalisation whose negative effects are to be seen, above all, in terms of culture.
This is confirmed by the type of message and values or, to put it another way, lack of values that are disseminated through systems for the production and broadcasting of televisionâs message, which are squeezing our own production and suffocating the free expression of independent producers.
I therefore believe that it would be a positive step to revise the directive in such a way as to be able to support producers and small and medium-sized enterprises, which are certainly not the recipients of the aid in question, thus restricting and circumscribing the influence of such messages.
We have not exhausted here, however, the debate over this outright cultural âmongrelisationâ, being imposed through the globalisation of audiovisual messages.
This is, however, the central point: European identity is being threatened by the very broadcasting of such messages.
This is, therefore, the point that we should be debating, and we should have the courage to call a spade a spade, since what we are seeing is actually the pauperisation of everything that is imported from European culture.
One particular point should be stressed, and it is mentioned in paragraph 38: censoring messages from non-EU channels that incite hatred of our culture, of the West, as was recently the case when the Lebanese channel Al Manar transmitted messages opposed to our civilisation, from sources very close to Hezbollah, via a European satellite.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Weber has brought his experience to bear in his excellent report and for that I congratulate him.
Despite the fact that, with the application of Articles 4 and 5 of the Television without Frontiers Directive on the future of European policy in the audiovisual sector, positive steps have been made, there is nonetheless still concern about broadcasting quotas for European programmes, which remain low, making competition with other productions, especially from the United States, difficult to impossible.
At the same time, I note that there has been a reduction of about 4% in independent productions over the last four years, which is out of keeping with the directive and with efforts to enlarge the free market in the field of the audiovisual media.
On the contrary, it restricts the free expression of producers both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the monopoly tactics being applied by other countries in the European Union.
Unfortunately, infringements of the rules adopted by the European Union on total advertising time, interruptions to programmes for advertisements, scheduling of unsuitable works at specific times and the indirect promotion of banned products, such as tobacco and alcohol, during broadcasts, are just some aspects of an uncontrolled phenomenon for which the Member States are responsible.
Cultural diversity is impossible without television without frontiers, without a single market and protection of the human dignity of consumers, minors and citizens in general.
Only with freedom of thought, of provision of services and of protection of producers' intellectual property rights can television without frontiers survive and operate.
The European Union has a duty to defend the role of the public and private audiovisual media, with respect for the relevant regulations and directives and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Â Â  Mr President, I would first like to express my satisfaction at the revision of this Directive, because it updates some of the provisions of the âTelevision without frontiersâ Directive, specifically those which relate to the promotion of the distribution and production of television programmes.
The market alone cannot resolve the problems of the sector with regard to content and furthermore, technological advances must not be left out of the existing legislation.
All the articles of the Directive must therefore be revised periodically, in order to prevent technological development from being synonymous with a lack of control and in order to ensure that the fundamental principles of the current Directive are maintained.
In particular, I would like to stress the principles of the protection of minors and the control of violence.
Given that quotas of European works are largely covered by national works, I fully support the rapporteur in his advocacy of voluntary initiatives for increasing quotas for non-national European works and I support the proposal to establish more effective mechanisms for compliance with and control of the legislation of the Member States.
Bearing in mind that the audiovisual public services are key to the development of public opinion, contribute to cultural diversity and pluralism and help to create an awareness of European citizenship, I would like to emphasise the importance of language learning with a view to greater access to pan-European channels and audiovisual works.
I would also like to say that the revised Directive must safeguard the development of new technologies and new services, in order to guarantee growth of the European economy and job creation, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy.
Finally, we must ensure pluralism of the media.
Concentration is a threat to democracy and should be prevented, as should the granting of licences that do not comply with the law.
Cultural diversity, freedom and pluralism of the media must continue to be the most important elements of the European audiovisual model.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive before us has aims in common with the Council of Europeâs European Convention on Transfrontier Television.
In fact, this directive covers almost all the issues that the Council of Europeâs Convention has passed a decision on.
Both have the purpose of maintaining and promoting the quantity of high-quality European works in television broadcasts.
It is an excellent objective, but this is one example of the work of the Council of Europe overlapping with that of the European Union.
In the discussion of this directive we should approach the search for modes of cooperation between these two bodies with an open mind, and clearly identify the areas of responsibility the Council of Europe and the European Union should have.
It is not sensible to have both bodies dealing with the same issues in exactly the same way.
Firstly, however, it would be a good idea to agree on common concepts in order to eliminate differing interpretations of what constitutes a European work or independent producer.
What is most important, however, is that resources should be combined.
This way we will achieve the best result.
Â Â  Mr President, the phrase 'Television without frontiers' seems innocuous and perhaps it is relevant to the television programme, .
Some might think it is clever to use early television images of pan-European friendship as a metaphor for EU cultural integration.
Actually, the concept contains a deeper truth, which supporters of this proposal miss entirely or are deliberately concealing.
Television is without frontiers.
Twenty years ago, communist regimes could stop human beings getting across the Berlin Wall, but they could not stop television signals being beamed into East German homes.
Today technology has moved on and people all over the planet can watch what they like, where they like.
Yet the EU presses ahead with this paranoid, illiberal plan, with its quotas of European programming, and we all know what chaos quotas can create.
The fact is that, if viewers want to watch American or any other programmes day and night, then nothing can stop them, certainly not the EU â or is that the hidden reality?
In the UK is called 'It's a Knock-Out'.
Europe's viewers, not the politicians, will deal the knock-out blow to this pipedream project, because ordinary people know that if the EU is the answer, then it must have been a stupid question.
Â Â  Mr President, although we are obviously looking forward to the proposal that we hope the Commission will table by the end of the year, the issue papers that the offices of the Commission have prepared in the run-up to the conference on audiovisual policy in Liverpool at the end of this month have not been exactly confidence-inspiring.
First of all, I realise that a new directive should naturally not stand in the way of the development of a European audiovisual industry, but that should surely not mean that no measures can be taken against the high concentration of broadcasters, whether they be horizontal, vertical, cross-border or otherwise.
Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission to table proposals on this subject. As everyone knows, that is crucial if we want to retain pluralism in the media.
I think that the Commission is a little too ready to acquit itself of this task, the excuse being that this falls within the remit of the Member States, in other words that it will not make any proposals, and that I regard as unacceptable.
The idea of a European observatory, the function of which would be to observe the market and collect data has also been mooted.
Excuse me, but that is really not good enough.
It is a mere palliative and totally unnecessary if not backed up by enforceable measures.
Secondly, I should like to comment on the position of the national channels.
A study commissioned by Parliament actually states, in black and white, that the independence of the national channels cannot be guaranteed with any certainty in many Member States.
The Commission labours under the assumption that policy of national channels is in the hands of the Member States.
While that is true, I do wonder if we â that is the Commission and Parliament â should not consider routes and measures we should take in those cases where the national governments have turned national channels into virtual branch organisations of government policy.
Let me conclude by saying that the minimalist starting position that is now before us will lead us straight into American-style situations.
I assume that here in this Chamber, which is now starting to fill up nicely, there are few Members for whom this prospect is an enticing one.
Time is pressing, Commissioner; it is time for action.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must stand in for Mrs Reding, who is in London today as part of the UK Presidency.
I would like first of all to thank Parliament for this broad overview and to congratulate it on the broad support expressed by MrÂ Weberâs report in favour of the overall approach reflected in the summary documents published at the beginning of July 2005.
It is a new and comprehensible approach suggesting progressive regulation for linear services (radio broadcasting) and non-linear services, such as video on demand.
As the report rightly points out, the existing rules must be adapted to structural changes and technological developments, while fully observing the basic principles of the current âTelevision without Frontiersâ Directive.
The fundamental objectives of the directive, including the objectives of an internal market and of public interest, that are still valid, are as follows: free movement of audiovisual programmes on, and between, platforms, whatever their method of transmission may be; free access to events of major importance; promotion of European works, independent productions and cultural diversity; minimum standards of protection for viewers against clandestine advertising; integrity of audiovisual works, in particular films; protection of minors and human dignity, and the right of reply.
The consultation process has been conducted in complete transparency with the participation of Members of the European Parliament.
That will also be the case for the important Liverpool Audiovisual Conference, where the future rules on the regulation of audiovisual content will be discussed in six different round tables.
Having regard to the current Articles 4 and 5, we have taken due note of your concerns with a view to securing a better and more uniform application of notions such as âindependent producersâ or âEuropean worksâ through the introduction of clearer concepts.
I have taken full note of Mr Weberâs wish to give this concept of work a more specific content.
The measures to promote European works and independent productions were also subject to consultation within the framework of the summary documents covering the same points that were highlighted in the Weber report.
The consultations demonstrated that the basic principles remain valid, as Articles 4 and 5 have provided a stable and effective framework for promoting cultural diversity and the European audiovisual production sector.
The idea of organising a European Year of Television and Media, with the aim of drafting a European Innovation Pact, deserves to be considered and shown interest and calls for more extensive investigations.
A commitment for a year, however, still cannot be made at this stage of reflection and debate.
I note the concerns expressed in the Weber report about the need to safeguard media pluralism.
During the Liverpool Conference, a round table will address this crucial issue.
The Commission acknowledges the importance of media pluralism and, in the context of its powers, pays great attention to issues of concentration and property.
Several public debates have been initiated to examine whether this issue should be dealt with at Community level.
This debate showed that there is no immediate solution to this difficult issue.
What can be said is that there is without doubt a need for a set of measures that include effective regulation at national level, application of national and European competition law and active promotion of media pluralism at national and Community levels by facilitating the movement of European works or by supporting European producers in the context of the âTelevision without Frontiersâ Directive and the Media programme.
Those are the handful of points I wished to highlight, on behalf of MrsÂ Reding, by once again saying to MrÂ Weber and to all of the Members who followed the debate that the Commission has taken a great deal of interest in this dialogue and in this exchange with Parliament.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to propose an oral amendment concerning a small technical modification: the words 'at 2004 prices' should be deleted in Amendments 6, 7, 8 and 19.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to propose two changes to the original text.
Both of them are in relation to the Roma community in Europe.
Firstly, at Recital 7, Amendment 6, I shall read out the words that I would like to have inserted into the text: '... as well as the particular situation of the Roma'.
The second change that I propose is in relation to the importance of the positive measures.
In this paragraph, I propose inserting a whole sentence, which would read: 'Attention should be paid in particular to the case of traditionally disadvantaged groups [such] as Roma and people with disabilities.'
Â Â  . â Speaking in my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to point out that the Commission proposal covers all the categories referred to in Article 13, including, that is to say, the groups discriminated against on the grounds of their ethnic origin.
The fact is, then, that PROGRESS will also give attention to the particular problems of the Roma.
I find it a shame that nothing was said in the Committee about whether or not there should be explicit reference to them, for otherwise we would have had the time to discuss this there.
Including a new group at this point creates problems, for we ought then, in fact, to keep on mentioning the other affected groups separately; so far, we have made specific reference only to people with disabilities.
We should leave it at that rather than starting to include individual groups; Article 13 should continue to apply.
I might add, by the way, that it was my group that, when we voted in June, stated that we would pay special attention in this programme to the problems faced by the Sinti and Roma.
In view of all this, I shall abstain from voting.
Â Â  . I would like to extend very warm thanks to the members of the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspective, who have made it possible for us to get, in the shape of the funds we need, a good instrument for carrying out our social policy agenda.
Â Â  â In light of the request made by various Members of this House, who would vote for the amendment if it were changed â although we believe that the current wording is more appropriate â I propose that our Amendment 9 should include the following sentence: âNotes that the scrapping of quotas in the clothing and textiles sector might have serious consequences for the least favoured regions and might lead to a reduction in regional GDP per inhabitant, a situation that requires a suitable responseâ.
Â Â  That concludes the vote
Â Â  I believe it is of the greatest importance that the EUâs agricultural policy, including the organisation of the market for raw tobacco, should be reformed.
The present system costs a lot of money.
What is more, todayâs high agricultural subsidies mean that EU products are dumped on the world market, a state of affairs that has serious consequences for developing countries.
Today, the European Parliament has voted on changing the regulation on the common organisation of the market for raw tobacco.
I chose to vote in favour, since the change means that the reform of the raw tobacco market, which has already begun, can continue.
I do not believe that the EU should support tobacco cultivation.
As a consequence, I welcome the continued reforms whereby half the total aid to the tobacco sector (EURÂ 484Â million) will, as from 2010, be set aside for restructuring programmes in the tobacco-producing regions, and this within the framework of rural development.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs proposal meets the need to recast Regulation (EEC) 2075/92, which has become obsolete owing to the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) 1782/2003.
This new regulation is the result of the implementation of the second reform package of the CAP agreed in April 2004.
A number of articles and the annex should, accordingly, be removed for reasons of legal clarity and transparency. This is due to the scrapping of premium and production control schemes, and to the transfer of the content of certain articles and the annex to detailed rules on implementation and adoption in the raw tobacco sector.
In light of the need for legal consistency, I welcome the Commissionâs proposal, and the favourable opinion delivered by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development deserves Parliamentâs support.
Â Â  . We are voting against this report because we believe that there should be no common organisation of the market for raw tobacco at all.
We believe that a decision should be taken as soon as possible within the EU whereby tobacco producers should, without delay, operate in a free market and adjust to the situation.
It is also incredibly inconsistent that, on the one hand, tobacco cultivation is subsidised in the EU and, at the same time, efforts are made to implement health promotion measures and campaigns.
How long is this absurd situation to be allowed to continue?
Â Â  . I welcome these steps to regulate the international trade in raw tobacco.
However I look forward to the day when this trade is eliminated entirely.
Â Â  . The British Conservatives today abstained on this report.
While we welcome long-overdue moves to end the EU's EUR 1Â billion-a-year tobacco regime, we feel that the reforms agreed in 2004 do not go far enough soon enough.
We strongly condemn the fact that tobacco-growing Member States were given the option of retaining up to 60% of the existing aid on tobacco as a coupled payment until 2010.
Most other CAP sectors have been fully decoupled and we see no reason why such a glaring exception was made for tobacco, a product that kills hundreds of thousands of EU citizens each year.
Â Â  . I believe it is of the greatest importance that the EUâs agricultural policy, including the organisation of the market for raw tobacco, should be reformed.
The present system costs a lot of money.
What is more, todayâs high agricultural subsidies mean that EU products are dumped on the world market, a state of affairs that has serious consequences for developing countries.
Today, the European Parliament has voted on changing the regulation on the common organisation of the market for raw tobacco.
I chose to vote in favour, since the change means that the reform of the raw tobacco market, which has already begun, can continue.
I do not believe that the EU should support tobacco cultivation.
As a consequence, I welcome the continued reforms whereby half the total aid to the tobacco sector (EURÂ 484Â million) will, as from 2010, be set aside for restructuring programmes in the tobacco-producing regions, and this within the framework of rural development.
Â Â  . The Commission is proposing to amend Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs.
In its communication on the European Action Plan on organic foodstuffs and agriculture, the Commission put forward the idea of replacing the current national derogation in the area of imports with a permanent system that makes use of technical benchmarking carried out by bodies appointed by the Community.
A certain amount of time must be given in order to develop the new permanent system.
I welcome the proposed amendment and the favourable opinion delivered by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development deserves Parliamentâs support.
Â Â  . My concern is with the manufacture of gelatine and bio-gelatine.
Both types of gelatine are manufactured using the same production process.
The only difference is in the collection and monitoring of the raw materials, those for the manufacture of bio-gelatine being derived only from pigs reared under monitored ecological conditions, with all the regulations applicable to ecological rearing observed and complied with.
Annex 6, part C of this Regulation includes a derogation for raw materials for the production of conventional gelatine, as non-organically produced agricultural products may, up to a certain percentage, be included in the manufacture of organic products.
That is only right, since the current demand for gelatine still far exceeds the supply of bio-gelatine.
There are, in Germany, many businesses engaged in the manufacture of bio-gelatine.
In order that the production of such bio-gelatine may continue to be permissible, Annex 6, part B of the Regulation must include the following processing aids:
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, due, in no small measure, to the importance of predictability and stability in business rules and, above all, of there being no legal vacuums impeding proper trade.
Leaving aside issues that may arise from the delay in drawing up the updated list under consideration here, and the opinion on the content that we shall give when the list is submitted, the priority at the moment is to ensure that the necessary â and, given the abovementioned constraints, feasible â conditions are in place for international trade to be able to continue.
Â Â  . We wish to reaffirm our opposition, as a matter of principle, to the militarisation of space or its use for military purposes.
We therefore object to the use of the European satellite radionavigation service GALILEO for military or security purposes, as is currently envisaged.
On the basis of that principle, we feel that the system could be used as an alternative to the US-dominated Global Positioning System (GPS).
Let us not forget that the USA has previously blocked access to this system, so that it could use it in its military attacks on Yugoslavia and Iraq.
It should be noted that the GALILEO system is being viewed with interest by countries such as China and India, which may become partners in the project, thereby contributing towards the end of the GPS monopoly, and creating an alternative project based on broad international cooperation.
This project must be used for peaceful purposes within the framework of international cooperation, without jeopardising the citizensâ rights, freedoms and guarantees.
It should be geared towards serving the public through its broad range of applications.
Â Â  . The Galileo Programme is far from being simply a research project.
It has taken on great importance for Europe, given that it is the first satellite radionavigation and positioning system in the world designed specifically for civil purposes.
I voted in favour of the Barsi-Pataky report (A6-0212/2005) on the implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the European programme of satellite radionavigation.
The purpose of the implementing guidelines of this report is to give satisfactory answers to questions regarding finance and intellectual property, and to provide adequate mechanisms of democratic control.
The programme must be implemented in a well-balanced fashion, in light of the new public-private approach to implementation.
Lastly, I feel that the programme will have a thoroughly positive impact on the citizensâ day-to-day lives, in that it will meet some of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy by paving the way for large numbers of jobs to be created in Europe and by strengthening European competitiveness through the body of technology and know-how acquired in the field.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Costa report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Lebanon on certain aspects of air services.
The various bilateral agreements established in the area of air services are the main instruments for ensuring that our relations with third countries run smoothly, particularly with regard to issues of air safety.
As a result of this and the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Communityâs exclusive competence in this field, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries with a view to replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements.
In the case of the Republic of Lebanon, the changes proposed by Parliament are corrective in character and relate to the taxation of aviation fuel, to designation clauses and to pricing.
There is nothing in these areas to which we object.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Costa report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Georgia on certain aspects of air services.
The various bilateral agreements established in the area of air services are the main instruments for ensuring that our relations with third countries run smoothly, particularly with regard to issues of air safety.
As a result of this and of the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Communityâs exclusive competence in this field, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries with a view to replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements.
In the case of Georgia, the changes proposed by Parliament are corrective in character and relate to the taxation of aviation fuel, designation clauses and pricing.
There is nothing in these areas to which we object.
Â Â  . I broadly welcome the ECâs proposal, which follows up a range of measures that have been implemented with the aim of updating the system of controlling fishing vessels in the EU.
I feel that the work of Parliamentâs Committee on Fisheries has made an important contribution to the drafting of the final text.
I should like to highlight the fact that the date for implementing the proposed measures has been put back to 2008, on the grounds that some pilot projects have yet to be concluded.
I also welcome the use of Vessel Detection Systems (VDS) and the introduction of an electronic logbook mechanism.
I feel that these measures will help to improve the monitoring of fishing zones, and will enable better and more accurate management of fish stocks, thereby facilitating the procedures involved in the gathering and dissemination of fisheries information.
Provided that they are in tune with the situation on the ground in the different Member States, I feel that the amendments tabled by Parliament deserve a favourable vote in the Chamber.
Â Â  We have chosen to vote against this report.
We are highly critical of the EUâs common fisheries policy.
However, it is important to be able to see EU vessels reliably complying with the rules.
We therefore support the principle of electronic registration and reporting of fisheries activities.
We believe, however, that the costs incurred in putting vessels onto a computer system should not be borne by the EU.
Individual Member States should decide on the funding.
The obvious solution is for the whole cost to be imposed upon the fisheries industry.
Â Â  . The purpose of the Commissionâs proposal is to introduce the obligation electronically to record and report information on fishing activities, whereby Member States will be required to equip their fisheries monitoring centres with technology that is compatible with the remote-sensing vessel detection system (VDS).
Furthermore, vessels larger than 15 metres must be equipped with an automatic localisation device which makes it possible to survey their fishing activities through a satellite-based Vessel Monitoring System (VMS).
The aim is to meet the control and management goals pursued by the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002.
We have always had our doubts about the introduction of this system, from the point of view of both respect for sovereignty and the cost and effectiveness of such a system.
The results of the implementation of the pilot project entitled Improving Fisheries Monitoring through integrating Passive and Active Satellite-based Technologies (IMPAST) at national level has confirmed our fears as regards the efficacy and the cost-effectiveness of the system, regardless of the Commissionâs overall assessment.
In any event, it is crucial not only that the implementation of the system takes account of the specific characteristics of the different fleets and Exclusive Economic Zones, but also that Community financing be made available to support the spending on investment and training involved.
Â Â  . The excessively complex rules which fishermen are expected to comply with, have become more and more burdensome to the industry, as well as enforcement agencies, as the Common Fisheries Policy has evolved.
In one instance recently, a Scottish boat was wrongly accused of using illegal fishing gear because the enforcement agency wrongly interpreted current rules.
I supported Mr Casaca's Report because in theory, the use of new technology has the potential to ease some of the burden of paperwork but the best course of action for Scotland would be to scrap the CFP and return fisheries management to local control.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate MrÂ Casaca on his outstanding report on the proposal for a Council regulation on recording and reporting of fishing activities and on means of remote sensing.
I fully endorse this report.
This initiative must be supported.
It will lead to improvements in the quality of information and in the effectiveness of fisheries resources management.
Â Â  . The usefulness and importance of this proposal for a Council regulation deserves the support of all those who believe that the protection of fisheries resources is in everyoneâs interests, especially the fishermen and the economies in which fishing plays a major role.
The fact remains, however, that a proposal does not just have to be useful; it must also be reasonable and viable.
Many of the amendments that have been tabled, by the rapporteur and other Members of the House, represent a step in this direction, and therefore justify supporting this report.
The version thus presented is simply fairer, more reasonable and more viable than the version put forward by the Council.
For these reasons, and taking particular account of national interests, I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . As there was no debate on this report, I would like to emphasise the importance of data on fishing activities.
With dwindling fish stocks the collection of accurate data is critical if we are to have a sustainable Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).
Â Â  . The readmission agreements between the European Community and third countries are of key importance to the European strategy to combat illegal immigration.
This readmission agreement, which has been negotiated and concluded between the European Community and Albania, is the fourth such agreement, and follows those already concluded with Hong Kong, Macau and Sri Lanka.
It is scheduled to enter into force at the end of the year.
This agreement establishes Albaniaâs obligation to readmit its nationals living illegally in the territory of the Member States and reciprocally places an obligation on the Union to readmit nationals of EU Member States living illegally in Albanian territory.
I voted in favour of this report, which recommends the conclusion of this agreement.
I also wish to commend the rapporteur, Mrs Klamt, for her outstanding work on the report and for being proactive in issuing a warning now about the problems that Albania will certainly encounter when the agreement comes into force and about the need to support the country in this effort.
It is also important that we look carefully into how we can provide support for the reintegration process, in such a way that people can return on a sustainable basis.
Â Â  . The issue of immigration is one that, as politicians and as members of the general public, we should treat with the utmost importance and place high on our list of priorities.
The existence of an economic and social model obviously acts as a focal point, something that has happened throughout the history of migrations, and despite its difficulties, this model is clearly a relative success story.
It cannot be denied that the search for a better life is part of human nature.
It does not follow, however, that a successful economic and social system is capable of handling all migratory pressures.
We therefore need rules, and, more importantly, we need rules that can be enforced. Otherwise we would be promoting organised violations and the formation of illegal economic organisations offering an illegal service.
We must respond to the migration question with both humanity and realism.
What comes out of the report before us is, in fact, a solution which is both realistic and human and which should send out a message.
I therefore voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  . I welcome the idea of untying the Communityâs external aid, and Parliament itself has supported it.
The point is that a good idea should not produce a bad result.
The amendments tabled in the report before us are worthy of our support, firstly because it is simply not logical solely to promote competition for its own sake â especially when that competition is realised in a way that is unfair or does not respect rules that we believe are of key importance â and secondly because the purpose of granting aid should be to promote development and not to promote developed economies and our competitors.
It actually makes perfect sense to attach development aid to the â indirect â financing of developing regional economies, in which case we will be helping to ensure that the aid granted is doubly effective.
Yet when that serves to promote only developed economies and our competitors, we will clearly only be financing those who do not need financing.
In this context, and in light of the most relevant parts of the report before us, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . I welcome this Council proposal and the European Parliament Report as an opportunity for legal clarity in the area of waste extraction but also as a logical way to combat the very large volumes of waste from the extractive industries.
I have noted the importance of in voting to-day.
It is fundamental that the EU and its Member States need to focus on the problem of this type of waste and the protection of our environment via requirements on Members States and their industries to have waste management plans; to have inventories of closed waste facilities; to make financial guarantees to national competent authorities for rehabilitation and post-clean up operations; to apply monitoring and management controls to prevent water and soil pollution, all of which are consistent with the âPolluter Paysâ principle.
Balance is required however when voting on a certain number of amendments which would impose a large and disproportionate number of unwarranted burdens on aggregate industry benefiting the environment or society.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of most of the proposals in this report, which is a second reading of the directive aimed at introducing sound environmental legislation to promote, as the rapporteur says, more sustainable production, lower waste production, long-term investment and businesses with a serious approach to the environment.
The aim is thus to clarify the Communityâs legal situation with regard to the extractive industries, and this would be of great interest to Portugal.
The Council has accepted a number of amendments adopted at first reading by Parliament.
Some of the proposals not accepted by the Council have since been reinstated and attempts have been made to clarify others.
I feel that a historical waste inventory should be drawn up and that measures should be taken to deal with it in cases where it creates environmental problems.
We now hope that the Council will be receptive to most of the proposals that have been tabled.
Â Â  We have chosen to support this report because the handling of waste from the mining industry is partly a cross-border environmental issue.
However, we are critical of using structural fund resources for drawing up inventories of closed waste facilities.
There is no good reason why taxpayers in other countries should pay for such measures.
Structural Fund resources should only be deployed in the case of poor Member States with unusually large needs in terms of drawing up inventories.
We have therefore voted against Amendment 8.
The principle should be that companies affected should be responsible for any costs that arise in implementing the proposed legislation.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which is designed to ensure that we have legislation in place that covers mining waste.
Mining waste is currently covered by general waste directives, but some serious incidents involving quarrying and mine waste led to the Council to ask for a specific directive on mining waste.
The only controversial issue is whether a new category of waste for this directive non inert, non-hazardous waste, for example, chalk and lime would be created.
While this category does not exist in the landfill directive on balance I think there is a sensible case for this new category.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â I should like to give a brief explanation of my vote on the SjÃ¶stedt report on the management of waste from extractive industries.
In my opinion, mining would become significantly more expensive for the companies operating in this industry if we were to adopt the draft report. This would result in a rise in the cost of constructing public networks, such as roads and railways, and all other public buildings in which aggregates are used.
There would also be a dramatic increase in state spending on the monitoring of materials that have been extracted but not yet used. The end result of all this would be a heavier burden on taxpayers throughout the European Union, without anything positive being achieved.
It was for this reason that I voted against the majority of the amendments.
Â Â  The report on the EU programme for employment and social solidarity (PROGRESS) is all very well, but it is based on the false notion that the Commission can and should prepare general strategies and proposals for how these issues should be resolved for 25 very different countries.
Instead of the EU regulating matters from above, the Member States should learn from each other through healthy institutional competition.
No decisions have been taken about the programmeâs financial framework because the EUâs long-term budget has been rejected by the European Council.
The attempt nonetheless to push through the PROGRESS programme, the cost of which will exceed EURÂ 1Â billion between 2007 and 2013, shows a lack of respect for the Councilâs decision.
Â Â  . I welcome this Report by Karin Jons, which stresses the continuing need to fund and support measures designed to end discrimination in employment opportunity, social protection and working conditions.
In particular I support the rapporteur's intention to better recognise the role of NGOs at local and national level in successfully implementing these aims.
I hope that the Commission will regularly seek the views of those most closely involved in plans to implement anti-discrimination measures, and ensure that co-financing levels should not be so high as to discourage local networks from participating.
Â Â  . The Lisbon European Council set out a new strategic objective for the Union, namely to turn it into the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
The Agenda for Social Policy constitutes the Unionâs itinerary in the social and employment field as part of the general Lisbon Strategy.
In this context, the Commission has emphasised the importance of simplifying and rationalising the current situation, by proposing an integrated programme for employment and social solidarity (PROGRESS).
The PROGRESS programme is the new Community programme containing the four programmes that currently make up the Agenda for Social Policy and a range of budgetary headings relating to working conditions.
As regards the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, I welcome the increase in the financial framework, the strengthening of Parliamentâs role in the monitoring and the implementation of the programme and the involvement of the social partners and non-governmental organisations.
Â Â  .
I welcome PROGRESS which will make a substantial contribution to achieving the objectives of the social policy agenda under the Lisbon Strategy.
In particular, this proposal contains much needed attempts to simplify and rationalise by combining specific action programmes.
However, care must be taken that costs are actually saved, duplication avoided and more administrative clarity and transparency achieved.
I also support the Rapporteur's steps to strengthen Parliamentâs role in monitoring the programme and increase its influence on implementation through measures such as a regular exchange of views with Parliament held by the Commission and an interim report evaluating the results achieved and the qualitative and quantitative aspects of programme implementation.
Â Â  Mr President, I would briefly like to present my explanation of vote.
I appreciate my colleagueâs work with regard to the textiles issue.
I am also pleased that the European Union and China have reached a settlement, but I cannot support the policy of the European Parliament, not to mention that of the EU, in this matter.
The reason is straightforward: the principle at stake here should be free trade, not quotas.
In my opinion, the EUâs policy in this matter has been far too protectionist, and it is consumers who suffer most for that, in the form of higher prices.
In other words, I give my support to the Commission and those countries that are prepared to open up the textiles market, and not to block it.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise to say something about the SaÃ¯fi report.
In principle, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on it, as it is, in substance, a very good report, but there are certain concerns that need to be mentioned.
It could be said that the report has already been overtaken by events in the shape of the problems â with which we are all familiar â currently arising with regard to imported textiles from China.
I do, however, think it important that what we have been demanding to date should again be set down in a report such as this one.
There is a need for further action to address the problem that has arisen in this respect.
I take the view that Europe has a great opportunity to make its consumers the most emancipated in the world.
It would, after all, be very interesting to demand, at any rate for the future, the creation of a standard âmade in Europeâ label, to which stringent criteria would apply, as a means of ensuring that what our consumers buy has been manufactured under the proper conditions, without causing massive damage to the environment and without the use of such things as child labour.
The creation of such a label might also enable European policy to find another way of responding to these challenges.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of the report on textiles and clothing after 2005.
We do not entirely agree with the proposal, and especially not with paragraph 11 where an agreement is sought on more categories of textiles than those that exist in the June agreement between the EU and China.
We believe that the quota system should be abolished in the longer term and that the EU should open up trade with the rest of the world.
Â Â  .
