Consumers should be free to choose their own level of potency and nutrients, provided that they are safe and appropriately labelled.
Availability of supplements should not be restricted for any reason other than safety.
This proposal is profoundly flawed, in that it is based on the old-fashioned research which relies on RDAs of vitamins and minerals.
For the past fifty years, RDAs have formed the basis of conventional nutritional wisdom.
However, according to many reports which I have read on this issue, RDAs are set far too low and should be revised upwards.
Instead, legislators should rely on the upper safe limits, which are a much better device.
For example, the RDA for vitamin B6 is just 2 mg while the upper safe limit is 200 mg.
Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 demonstrated that taking supplements containing 100 IU of vitamin E for at least two years reduced the risk of heart disease in both men and women by approximately 40%.
Despite this, the RDA for Vitamin E remains a measly 10 IU.
I believe that countries with a restrictive policy should relax it, but not on the condition that we tighten our system and restrict the access of our consumers in our countries to vitamin and food supplements.
Mr President, two different types of argument have been put forward for this directive.
The first concerns public health, the second harmonisation of the internal market.
I consider that the public health arguments are weak.
There is no major public health problem from people overdosing on vitamins and minerals.
Nor will the risk of overdose disappear with this directive.
If we really want to make a vigorous contribution to public health, we should possibly address the subjects of alcohol, tobacco or something else rather than the area covered by this directive.
The fact is too that the EU is not allowed to introduce harmonisation on public health issues.
This is clearly stated by the Treaties.
There is also a risk that consumers who use certain dosages of particular preparations will find this more difficult once this directive has entered into force.
The real motivation behind the directive is harmonisation, in other words the opportunity to be free to sell everywhere.
This is not a strong argument in my opinion.
In my view, sometimes other considerations must be more important than a free market.
I consider that, in areas such as this, different EU countries should be allowed to have different rules - more liberal or more restrictive - depending on the wishes of the voters.
I consider that supranational rules should only be used to combat real supranational common problems.
This is not the case here.
We have witnessed a furious and quite unpleasant lobbying campaign.
Its methods and its content have been counter-productive.
Several of the arguments put forward against the proposal have been exaggerated and sometimes also incorrect.
Parts of this proposal are positive, such as the requirement for declarations of contents.
On the whole, there are, however, no strong arguments for implementing the far-reaching harmonisation proposed.
There is also a risk that the system which has been drawn up will benefit major industrial interests at the expense of small enterprises.
The directive which is before us today has two principal key objectives: first, to harmonise national legal provisions on food supplements so as to reduce and eliminate considerable problems facing the free movement of food supplements; second, to establish an appropriate level of consumer protection in the use of food supplements in the European Union Member States.
To achieve these two objectives, it is necessary, as the rapporteur has said, to appropriately define what food supplements are; it is necessary to put in place a scientific assessment of all the ingredients and their minimum and maximum doses; it is necessary also to outline the key criteria for requirements with regard to consumer protection; and of course, the quality of standards has to be looked into as well.
The protection of the European Union's 370 million consumers is of paramount importance.
Under the Amsterdam Treaty, Parliament has the power of codecision with the Council in the area of consumer protection and public health matters.
I have always supported the need for improved labelling provisions so as to ensure that the consumer information is transparent and effective.
The fact of matter is this: we live in an internal market where there is free movement of goods, services, persons and capital.
We need to guarantee the safety of our food chain from farm to table.
It is important that we have the framework proposal to put in place uniform systems for the full certification of food supplements.
If there is any possible likelihood of endangering public health by means of the implementation of any particular proposal, one must always veer on the side of caution, and I compliment the rapporteur on her report.
Mr President, there are no known cases of serious, harmful effects that have been caused by consuming vitamins and minerals that fall within the present directive.
In contrast, we all know that in the European Union, half a million people die prematurely from the effects of smoking every year.
It is therefore astonishing that minerals and vitamins will soon be subject to stricter legislation than tobacco.
In the report, producers of food supplements are being met halfway by extending the period of approval from one and a half years to three years.
This does not solve anything for the, mostly small, companies, since the required tests are too costly.
This will lead to a ban on food supplements which have been sold legally in certain Member States without any problems for many years.
Since permitted quantities in tablets have in many cases been reduced, this will mainly have the effect that consumers will end up buying larger quantities of tablets in order to consume the same levels.
However, I have more fundamental objections.
Since different regions of the European Union have different eating habits and eating cultures, the need for food supplements varies greatly.
I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to draw up European legislation in this area to suit these different cultures.
At first reading, the PPE-DE Group called for a referral back of Mrs MÃŒller's report because it contravenes the Treaty.
This was met with little support at the time.
Meanwhile, it is my understanding that the support for rejecting this legislation has grown considerably.
I therefore hope that there will be a sufficient number of Members who have the courage to reject the Council's common position.
Many consumers share this hope.
Given the numerous reactions, this is a considerable problem for many consumers.
I should like to hand you the many thousands of signatures that have been collected for this purpose.
Mr President, this is a bad directive.
I do not say that on the basis of any emotion or the fact that Doctor Rath has lobbied me.
Oddly enough I have not received many e-mails, so my machine has not been stuffed full of e-mails from Doctor Rath or anybody else.
I do not know why that is, but I am very quick with the delete button.
I do believe this is a very bad directive, not in its intention but in its method.
It is designed, as everybody has said, to bring about a common market in food supplements.
It may well bring that about, but in doing so the risk is - and there is a risk - that some products currently on the market in some countries will cease to be available.
I, like many British MEPs, have received many letters from people in the region that I represent.
These are not circular letters that they have just signed, they are letters that they have written themselves.
The people who write them fear that they will no longer be able to buy over 300 food supplements that their good health depends on.
We do not need to go into why this fear has arisen and who stirred it up, if anybody has stirred it up.
The fact of the matter is that the Commission has created a situation, by bringing forward the directive in this form, that has given people reason to voice and to have such fears.
I have no quarrel with the German Members or with the rapporteur.
She has done a valiant job.
They are standing up for the system they have in place.
They believe our - British, in this instance - more liberal system may allow unsafe products onto the market.
We contend that consumers should be able to exercise as wide a choice as possible and that there is no evidence that products on our market are unsafe.
Where is the evidence that they are unsafe?
Why should we have to prove that they are safe when people buy them every day and believe that their health depends on them?
I say to Commissioner Byrne: be careful.
This directive tries to reconcile very different national approaches to allowing these products onto the markets and it fails in that attempt at reconciliation.
Small businesses have been allowed too little time to submit the required safety dossier on their products.
We may put that right tomorrow, but why, Commissioner Byrne, is it that there is no cost impact assessment on small businesses in this directive?
When it came forward two years ago there was no cost impact assessment attached.
Just as important, we need to have the whole process of reviewing what there is on the market much more out in the open.
It should not be done by secret committees.
MEPs on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy will insist that we are much better informed on this, so that we can keep track of what is happening on behalf of our anxious constituents.
We hope that we will be able to block any heavy-handed attempt to deprive people of the products they know and continue to need.
Mr President, I must confess to being quite astonished!
We are speaking about products that are on the market today and are asking why we need to provide evidence of their safety!
I can tell you why: because it has to be done for every last bit of artificial colouring that goes into your Uncle Joe's Mintballs and for every preservative that is added to jam, and because we have always resolutely proclaimed in this forum that consumer safety is important.
For this reason a product cannot be deemed marketable unless it can be proved safe and harmless.
This is surely easy to demonstrate for any product that has already been on the market for some time.
Moreover, I must also express my astonishment at the references to divergent systems.
I do not know what you are talking about.
I understood neither Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's reference to these divergences nor Mrs Jackson's.
In Germany you can go into any drugstore at all, into any supermarket, and you will be perfectly free to buy vitamins, calcium or whatever you want in various different dosages.
I have nothing against that. Nor do I object to these products remaining freely obtainable.
I do wish, however, to see the introduction of a maximum dose - yes, a maximum dose is something I do want to see.
People like myself, for example, who have the misfortune to suffer from kidney stones, must not take too much Vitamin C, because it crystallises.
People like me must also be careful with calcium, and we have to know these things.
This is why labelling is needed; this is why safety is paramount.
Anyone who stands up today like Patricia McKenna and says that the adoption of this directive would force products off the market is misleading people.
I take no pleasure in saying this, Patricia, because our opinions often concur.
It is not true that a single safe product will disappear from today's market.
All manufacturers must be able to demonstrate the safety of their products.
Every single manufacturer must be able to do that.
For each and every product we buy - for all our cosmetics, our pharmaceutical products, our artificial sweeteners - we expect proof of safety.
And are we now saying that we do not expect the same for food supplements?
Surely food manufacturers will then come along to us and say, 'Why must we prove that our muesli bars are safe?'
And they would be right to do so.
They would then be exempted in future too.
At that point they could start making their products with genetically modified organisms and whatever else.
Why should anyone then have to demonstrate the safety of any product?
Goodness knows that I have been involved for long enough in matters of consumer protection in this House.
I believe my reputation goes before me in that respect.
I tell all the people who call me that none of the products they can now buy will be taken off the market.
I shall ensure that they are informed in future about any product they buy and whether it is safe.
It makes no difference to me whether the evidence has to be produced within 24 or 30 months, but the evidence must be produced.
I congratulate Mrs MÃŒller on her excellent report, which will have my unreserved support tomorrow.
Mr Blokland, I had a quick look at the list you gave me and I thought it best to pass it on to the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, who can give you a response.
You will, of course, receive another response regarding the outcome of the document you entrusted to me as well.
Mr President, last year in Britain alone, 5 000 people died from overdosing on alcohol.
They drank themselves to death in one session.
Yet I do not see a directive before us to require alcohol to be submitted to all sorts of safety tests, or for bottles of Guinness or Strasbourg wine to carry the strongest possible health warnings.
So why on earth are the manufacturers of food supplements being told that they must jump through a series of expensive hoops, which may be so costly as to drive some of them out of business, in order to keep their products on the market?
My colleague, Frederick Ries, says that not all vitamins are safe, but of course you can kill yourself on anything if you eat enough of it.
You can stuff yourself with baked beans until you die, but unlike alcohol or most pharmaceutical products, vitamin and food supplements do not have a track record of killing people.
On the contrary, I, like Mr Blokland, have a stack of letters which testify that many do a great deal of good.
This directive, therefore, is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut!
Better labelling would have been sufficient to provide such protection as is needed, but perhaps that would not have been enough to satisfy the big drug companies, which are seeking to control a lucrative market.
I remember the Commissioner telling us not long ago that under his regime we would have less interference of the kind which angers many European citizens for no good reason.
However, when it comes to Brussels proving that it wants to treat people like an interfering nanny, this directive really does take the biscuit.
I will begin by distancing myself from the very aggressive campaign which we Members and, especially, the rapporteur Mrs MÃŒller have faced while debating this issue.
Naturally, everyone has the democratic right to argue for what they believe in and to attempt to influence decision-makers and decisions but, in this case, matters have gone beyond the limits of what is acceptable.
I am one of those who would like to reject the common position.
This is not because I always have to be against regulation or harmonisation in the area of public health but because, in this particular case, I consider that it is neither desirable nor necessary to harmonise national legislation.
Just as Mr Blokland said, different countries have very different traditions and, as far as I know, no one has ever died from taking vitamins and minerals.
The problem with the directive is partly Article 5, which concerns establishing the maximum daily intake.
The European Parliament will have no insight whatsoever into, or influence upon, how this is determined. What, however, is most likely is that it will be done using the committee procedure.
Another problem is the appendix which states which vitamins and minerals are to be permitted as food supplements.
The opportunity of small companies and manufacturers to make their influence felt in the market worries me considerably in that respect.
Many companies and products will disappear and, most importantly of all, consumer choice will thus be limited.
We are currently exposed to stress and to a number of environmental poisons and chemicals, which means that a varied and healthy diet is not always sufficient to ensure that we keep healthy and well.
We need vitamin and mineral supplements, sometimes in high doses, to be able to balance the functions of the body.
Good knowledge of nutrition, Mr President, could also prevent illness in all contexts.
We should encourage people to take care of themselves and take responsibility for their own health.
This directive sends out the wrong signals.
Mr President, obtaining food supplements as health products from the Internet is not encouraged by this report.
I well understand the life stories of the individuals who are concerned by this directive, but my own experiences tell me something different.
In my opinion, substances that are used to treat and alleviate the symptoms of serious illnesses, of illnesses that may not yet be curable at the present time, should be covered by legislation on medicinal products and have nothing to do with the consumption of foodstuffs.
In other words, products with pharmaceutical ingredients which are advertised as possessing medicinal powers must be subject to licensing as medicinal products.
The aim of the directive is to harmonise maximum permissible quantities of active ingredients throughout the 15 Member States and to improve national conditions on the basis of criteria relating to the harmlessness of products to human health as a preventive measure of consumer protection.
The national food and pharmaceuticals industries are vying for an extremely lucrative market in foodstuffs enriched with active ingredients.
A new type of food product is being advertised here, and the advertisements often focus on additional health- and performance-enhancing qualities, sometimes proven but often imputed, of these products.
I believe that it is important and that it befits our responsibility to ensure that the line between medicinal and food products does not become blurred or negotiable.
In this expanding market, the pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs industries will move heaven and earth to enrich food products with additives which are not naturally found in those products.
The report is based on transparency, disclosure and safety for consumers.
For this reason I support it.
The directive will never absolve patients and consumers, however, from the imperative obligation to read the small print: 'If in doubt, please consult your doctor or pharmacist'.
This is why scientists and researchers have a legal entitlement to improve this common position.
Mr President, circulating the streets of Strasbourg this morning was a mobile advertising hoarding asking this Parliament how it could ignore the wishes of 450 million voters.
The obvious answer is 'very easily': it has been doing it for years.
And if this Parliament accepts the common position on this directive it will prove my point.
It is a totally unnecessary intrusion into the freedoms of millions of people.
Never have I received so many communications from ordinary people asking me to reject it.
The Commission is entirely wrong to assert that lobby groups are scaremongering.
As far as I can see the pressure is coming from ordinary people who are very worried by this proposal.
It is those ordinary people whose interests are under threat.
Accordingly I will be voting for the UEN Amendment No 7, calling for the rejection of the common position.
I urge every Member of this House to do likewise.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Emilia MÃŒller, and Mr Corbey and Mrs Roth-Behrendt too, for the courage they have displayed, despite the immense, absurd amount of pressure to which they have been constantly subjected by people with no scientific knowledge and no integrity.
I would like to inform Commissioner Byrne that, in order to speed up the adoption of this directive, I have withdrawn an excellent amendment which sought to ensure the safety of consumers, particularly, in that it specified that all food supplements should be prepared according to good manufacturing practice.
This amendment was intended to ensure that food supplements are prepared in such a way as to guarantee not just the highest quality of ingredients but also their innocuousness when taken repeatedly over long periods of time.
I therefore call upon Commissioner Byrne to deliver a formal undertaking to the effect that the provisions of the regulations to be drawn up stipulating that food supplements must meet high quality and safety standards in order to prevent small artisans - or health quacks, even - from marketing low quality, potentially dangerous products, will be made clearer and more explicit.
In view of Parliament's clear, great responsibility in matters of the citizens' health, we must be highly focused in our work in order to ensure that all the individual Member States of the European Union are provided with rules making high standards of quality and safety a priority.
One last plea to Commissioner Byrne: in calling for this new documentation we should request that it be differentiated according to the composition of certain products, for this would reduce the expenditure for small and medium-sized businesses considerably.
Mr President, it is not every day we have to congratulate a rapporteur for sheer civil courage in standing up to one of the most unscrupulous lobbies of our time.
I do not believe that I have seen anything like it before.
Like most of us, she has been accused of being a stooge of the pharmaceutical industry, of being ignorant and insensitive.
We should say to those who made these accusations that we cannot be bought in this House and that we cannot be bullied either.
We owe our constituents our judgement, and mine is that for all its flaws and deficiencies, the directive is one that should be commended, with amendments, to those many people who are frightened and nervous, who depend on these food supplements to preserve their health, and some of whom even believe it is a matter of life or death.
They fear this directive because they have been told that these products will be banned, that testing will be prohibitive, and that what remains will be swallowed up in a restrictive and prescriptive regime.
We owe it to them to make certain that is not the case, and shallow populist rhetoric is not the way to do it.
We need to make certain that small producers can come forward and be reassured that it will not be a costly and prohibitive process.
Time after time, we see that this is ignored in directives.
It has been ignored in the PPP directive.
The people who have the greatest need of our protection now are the small producers and we should help them.
They should be able to register their product for simple and cost-effective evaluation.
It should be a positive list which is rapidly expanded, with maximum dosages linked to real needs and not to outmoded daily allowances.
People such as Mr Davies have said: 'well, we have not done this for alcohol'.
My God, we have tried!
We know what lobby it is that stops us doing this on alcohol, which stops us having the labelling that is necessary.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
We have to look at this directive in terms of the way in which it will be interpreted.
The more people make claims about their health, the more we see that this needs a safety evaluation.
You cannot have the one without the other.
If you make the claims, you must expect to see them tested, but they should be tested fairly, simply and in a cost-effective way to leave a regime of light-touch and user-friendly practices.
That is what my country has had and I believe we can keep it.
It is also possible to fit that in to the framework of this directive.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, I believe that this directive represents a terrible infringement of our right to these products.
Commissioner Byrne, your proposal, if implemented, could remove hundreds of vitamin and mineral supplements from our shelves, in the UK and Ireland in particular.
These products are safe and have been accessible to consumers for years.
But instead of going for a scientific safety assessment, the directive is based on an outmoded Recommended Daily Allowance dating back to the Second World War.
This directive will force consumers to purchase these products on the Internet, where there are no controls.
Is this what you really want?
Consumers will not forgo these products.
I believe that this directive is an own goal.
The European Commission has stated that its goal is the extension of the internal market.
However, many Member States have put national interests first and lobbied to keep their markets closed.
This is because the liberal regime in Ireland, the UK and the Netherlands is not acceptable to other Member States such as Germany and France.
This means that products that are safe and widely available will be withdrawn from the market.
The only criterion for taking products off the market should be one of safety.
As I said, this is an own goal and we will end up importing products from the US via the Internet.
Is this really what you want?
Mr President, the EU's internal market is a fundamental pillar of European cooperation.
It has given Europe free trade, competitiveness and welfare.
There is however no need, in terms of the market, for uniform rules on the sale of vitamins and minerals.
Member States have different traditions in this area.
In Sweden, as in the UK and Ireland, individuals can buy many preparations with strengths up to the maximum recommended daily intake over the counter.
This tradition must be respected and take precedence over the requirement for uniform rules.
What is really behind the proposal to regulate the sale of vitamin and mineral supplements at EU level?
Opponents shift the blame onto the pharmaceutical industry on the grounds that it wants to sell more tablets.
Those in favour of the regulation also point the finger at the pharmaceutical industry, but in this case as being opposed to the proposal because it wants to see even higher volumes of sales.
I personally believe both sides are wrong.
I have not encountered any lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry on this issue.
The main driving force behind the eagerness for regulation is instead an overprotective mentality among EU civil servants and politicians.
Naturally, it is inappropriate to overdose on vitamins and minerals, but there is a huge margin between overdose and harmful levels.
With the help of information on the bottles, most people are able to manage their daily vitamin intake themselves.
We should trust individuals to do so.
I myself am a dialysis doctor and have seen many cases of poisoning.
I have seen two young women poisoned by nutmeg and an older man suffering from severe nicotine poisoning, but I have never met anyone with vitamin or mineral poisoning.
Kidney stone patients have to be very careful about taking much more than just vitamin C and calcium.
It is Mrs Roth-Behrendt's doctor whose job it is to tell her what she should be careful of.
Doctors have more important things to do than prescribe vitamins and minerals in higher doses than those accepted as food supplements.
Mr President, today, we are debating the vitamin directive at second reading.
I must say that I am pro-European and in favour of harmonisation, but not in this manner.
I am pleased that the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are willing to grant producers of vitamin tables 36 months instead of 18 months in order to prove that their products are safe.
While this is not a problem for large pharmaceutical producers, it does cause problems for small businesses, especially financially.
In principle, it is wrong that they should have to prove that their products are safe while these may have been on the Dutch, British and Irish markets for dozens of years.
I am in favour of proving the safety of new vitamin tablets, but not of the old tablets.
The Commission, the majority of the Council and Mrs Roth-Behrendt are saying, in fact, that all the old tablets are unsafe.
This is why I shall be voting for rejection of the common position.
Mr President, Commissioner, for 60 years we have had two traditions in Europe and had no significant health problems.
As long as we have acceptance of the upper safe limit, consumer choice should prevail.
Millions of people in Europe have bought vitamins and minerals of their choice.
Not only have they had no problems, but their health and well-being have benefited.
Now we are faced not with a health measure but with a single-market measure which threatens to omit 300 items on this list from the 'positive' list of items available.
These 300 items are currently legally and safely on sale in the shops of my country and yours, Commissioner.
They are not oddball items - they are things based on boron, calcium, copper, iron, manganese, potassium, selenium, zinc and so on. If these items fail in 18 short months to get the scientific committee's approval or to get their dossier in, then they will come off the market.
That is not a problem for large manufacturers, but it is a very serious problem for the small ones.
The cost and time to them may be prohibitive, and if items go off the market, then it is the consumer who will suffer.
If they do go off the market they may, as we have heard, go abroad, go offshore or appear on the Internet, at some risk to the consumer.
What we need, Commissioner, is a simplified procedure for the items that have been omitted so that they can come onto the list quickly, and for that we need the 36-month timescale.
However, may I say also that Emilia MÃŒller has suffered one of the worst assaults by people outside this Parliament that any Member has had to put up with.
It is one thing to be e-mailed; it is one thing to be lobbied; it is one thing to be mass-lobbied; but to endure threats of violence, bullying and harassment as she and her family have is something which this Parliament will not accept.
I say that to whoever is doing it outside: lay off, because we will not allow our fellow Member to suffer in that way.
She has more integrity in her little finger than those people have in the whole of their bodies and I demand, Mr President, that you suggest to the President of this Parliament that this matter be referred to the Legal Affairs Committee, with a view to seeing how a Member of Parliament under that sort of assault can be protected and allowed to do her job properly as a Member of this Parliament, as a rapporteur and as someone for whom we have great affection and respect.
I too fully condemn this sort of behaviour and I will certainly inform the President.
I do not know whether the President will decide to refer the case to the Committee on Legal Affairs but, in any case, I agree that something has to be done.
There is a great difference between all the pressure and lobbies and being subjected to threats and abuse.
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Emilia MÃŒller, who has attended to her task in difficult circumstances.
Many of us have been pestered and obstructed to an unreasonable degree by those who have masqueraded as philanthropists and defenders of the sick.
I have had thousands of messages a day sent to my own private e-mail address, sometimes as many as 8 000 unnecessary messages in one day.
It is not really any longer a matter of public opinion when one and the same person sends 900 messages on the same day.
That is simply criminal harassment.
I can just imagine what it has been like for Mrs MÃŒller!
Parliament should explore, not just in this case but especially in preparation for any future situation, practices of national parliaments that would guarantee Members' inviolability, safety and right to work in peace.
All this harassment, with people being urged to express their opinions, has been absolutely pointless.
It has seemed to be more of an unscrupulous marketing campaign on the part of a private business, which did not even intend to influence the work of Parliament.
Presumably the party that got the campaign off the ground also knew that alternative treatments and vitamin cures and treatments are not banned or prevented in the EU.
A simple thought has many times crossed my mind: the means is the message.
If the means to lobby us has been so unscrupulous, it is hard to be convinced of the sincerity of the issue that lies behind it.
The two main purposes of the directive are, on the one hand, the approximation of national laws so that a single market for food supplements can be created, and, on the other, to establish an appropriate level of consumer protection in all Member States.
For that reason, with this directive there should be an appropriate definition of food supplements, a scientific assessment of all ingredients should be carried out, requirements relating to consumer information and labelling should be specified, quality standards should be developed, and an adequate monitoring system should be guaranteed.
All this should be totally acceptable to the honest players and even directly to their advantage.
Whilst the directive will help guarantee access to the markets for all manufacturers, Parliament has been especially keen to take account of the problems of small manufacturers.
For that reason, Parliament wishes to extend, by way of its own compromise proposal, the eighteen-month deadline proposed in the Council's common position to 30 months.
If these conditions are met I see no reason to reject the common position.
Mr President, what has happened to Mrs MÃŒller should actually have repercussions.
The word 'duress' occurs to me, as a lawyer.
I am full of admiration for her, and I shall most certainly be supporting the common position.
I also feel, however, that this position touches the limits of moral acceptability. You see, I come from a country where vitamins are still available in pharmacies only.
When anyone goes into a chemist's shop and buys vitamins, the chemist will say, 'Don't take too much, and please read the enclosed instruction leaflet'. It will cause great confusion in my country if that all changes.
It will create the impression that vitamin supplements are really quite harmless after all.
This is not the case. Vitamins have side-effects.
The impact, of course, is not immediate.
It is like when you drink too much.
Not until you come staggering out of the pub do you begin to feel the effects on your health. It may have tasted good, but it will catch up with you at some point.
We are far more aware than we were ten years ago that vitamins do indeed have adverse effects.
I really do find it irresponsible to set them loose on consumers in this way.
To tell you the truth, Mrs McKenna, I am deeply disappointed.
I thought you would be encouraging us to eat oranges, lemons, bananas, curly kale and other health foods.
No, you are recommending artificial substances to us, substances that are simply mass-produced by an industry where many people earn great fortunes.
I fail to understand your thinking.
Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at the outset at the progress that has been made on this proposal for a directive on food supplements.
First of all, the objective of this legislation - and I must emphasise this - is not to ban food supplements.
It has to do with maximum safety levels.
I regret very much that I have to disagree with my friend Mr Bowis, for whose opinions I have the utmost respect, when he says that the position at the moment is that there are upper safe limits.
That really is not the position.
This will be the position after this legislation comes into place.
That is the purpose of the exercise.
This exercise will be based on scientific evidence and scientific evaluation.
It also dismays me to some extent to hear people in this House - also for whom I have enormous respect - express the view that this legislation is motivated by, of all things, lobbying of the pharmaceutical industry.
That is a slander.
It is absolutely wrong.
It is unfair to say that I or the people who work for me would be motivated by such things.
But sometimes people who make these allegations are the ones who are inordinately concerned about the role of industry.
But what about the role of industry that profits from this piece of legislation not going through?
What about that?
Have they questioned themselves to determine whether they have been subjected to such a degree of lobbying from that industry that they have themselves been duped by that industry and tried to tar the Commission and those who advocate the passing of this legislation with a brush in a way that I find quite reprehensible?
The subject is not an easy one.
We currently have very different attitudes, rules and practices among Member States.
These impede the free circulation of food supplements within the European Union, and can deprive consumers from access to a wide range of these products.
So the case for harmonisation is obvious and is strong.
I believe that the vast majority of stakeholders share that view.
You will not, therefore, be surprised that I cannot support the views of those who propose, with Amendment No 7, to reject the common position.
A substantial number of Members of Parliament and of the Commission have been subjected to an orchestrated and misleading campaign against the adoption of this directive.
This campaign has only been waged by those who do not share the general European interest.
I should also emphasise to Mr Blokland and others who make reference to being lobbied by consumers who have written letters, that may be the case.
I suspect they may very well be people who have been seriously misled by those who profit by this legislation not going through the system.
The consumer organisations who are there to look after the best interests of consumers have not been misled.
They are in favour of this legislation.
BEUC has come out and said that it supports this legislation.
This is a strong endorsement, in my view, rather than anecdotal accounts of individual consumers who, in my opinion, have probably been misled by the statements made by many which are simply untrue.
They have misrepresented the aims of the directive, used misleading arguments and misinformed consumers.
This was made clear during the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mrs MÃŒller has done an excellent job as rapporteur.
Her contribution to the advancement of the draft directive has been invaluable.
I sincerely congratulate her and thank her.
I would also like to acknowledge the responsible and very constructive role of Mrs Corbey, as shadow rapporteur.
The common position provides a very good framework for the regulation of food supplements in the European Union.
It is designed to ensure that a very wide range of such products is available to consumers.
The underlying criterion for a single market in food supplements is safety: adequate and appropriate labelling designed to inform consumers.
Of course, these products must be used in the context of a diversified diet and in line with manufacturers' instructions.
The deadline for preparing dossiers for the evaluation of substances that are already on the market is an important issue.
I have listened carefully to the concerns expressed, concerning small and medium enterprises, that a period of 18 months for the preparation of evaluation dossiers may be too short.
If that were to be the only amendment to the common position, I would be prepared to consider an extension of the period mentioned.
I can, therefore, accept any one of Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 or 5 that relate to this point, provided that this would contribute to the adoption of the common position without further changes.
I have also taken careful note of the interventions with regard to good manufacturing practice for food supplements, which is the subject of Amendment No 2.
I would like to reiterate what I said at first reading.
The adoption of principles of good manufacturing practice by legally binding measures for specific categories of products is not appropriate in the case of foodstuffs.
This already exists in relation to foodstuffs in many pieces of horizontal legislation.
I am happy to take comfort from Mr NisticÃ²'s contribution on the basis that he is certainly one of the MEPs I know here who is a scientist himself.
He supports this legislation.
He has asked me to take careful note of the risks to ensure the elimination of low-quality products when this framework legislation goes through the system.
I am happy to say that will be taken into account.
The vast majority of these principles are covered by horizontal legislation, particularly in the directives on hygiene and control.
These will apply also to the manufacture of food supplements.
In the draft directive, we are referring specifically to the issue of purity criteria for the vitamins and minerals to be used.
We have improved the relevant provisions following your amendment at first reading.
We also foresee adopting specific technical rules with regard to the margins of tolerance for the amounts of vitamins and minerals declared to be present in food supplements.
We believe that these rules are important for ensuring the quality of these products.
I am firmly of the view that this array of horizontal and specific rules fully covers all concerns expressed that these products should be manufactured to high-quality standards.
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 2 to adopt provisions on GMPs for food supplements.
However, I reiterate that I will give priority to adopting the technical rules on margins of tolerance mentioned in Article 9(1).
Amendment No 6 refers to the criteria that will be used for setting the maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements.
This point was the most difficult one to reconcile in the Council.
The text of Article 5 is now carefully balanced.
It is my belief that any disruption would jeopardise the whole proposal.
Finally, Amendment No 8 proposes an addition to the text that concerns principles for the functioning of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and of the Scientific Panels of the European Food Safety Authority.
I believe that these issues are adequately covered in the recently adopted general food law.
They should not, therefore, be repeated in this specific directive.
For this reason I cannot accept Amendment No 8.
But I repeat and emphasise that the role of the European Food Safety Authority in this area will be of paramount importance and that this work will be done by independent scientists.
The evaluation of that work by the Board of the European Food Safety Authority will be done in a fully transparent way - indeed, in public.
In conclusion, the Commission considers that the common position as such is satisfactory on all substantial points.
The Commission would be ready to accept a technical modification of the common position to extend the period mentioned in Article 4.6.b. as in one of the amendments - Amendment No 1, 3, 4 or 5 - if that would help the adoption of the directive at second reading.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 6 and 8 and certainly does not support Amendment No 7, that calls for the rejection of the common position.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the following recommendations for second reading, by Mrs Paulsen, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy:
(A5-0042/2002) on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directives 90/425/EEC and 92/118/EEC as regards health requirements for animal by-products [10407/1/2001 - C5-0588/2001 - 2000/0230(COD)]
and
(A5-0043/2002) on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption [10408/1/2001 - C5-0589/2001 - 2000/0259(COD)]
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for excellent teamwork for the almost a year and a half during which I have been dealing with these two reports.
It has gone incredibly well.
In the common position, the Council and the Commission have accepted the majority of the just under a hundred amendments we submitted on the first reading.
I am very pleased to see that the Council and the Commission are now in agreement with the European Parliament on the fundamental principles.
The first and most important principle is that only by-products from animals approved for human consumption may be used in feed, cosmetics and medicinal products.
I say this with a slight reference to the preceding debate.
We will thus obtain a ban on intra-species recycling, that is, animal cannibalism.
The new regulation will in fact be sufficiently flexible to be adapted to technological developments and new scientific findings.
The common position has in fact been welcomed by the industry concerned in Europe.
Please consider that the final vote tomorrow puts 200 000 jobs across Europe at risk.
Do not forget that this industry is not located in densely populated areas. Instead, we are looking at companies in rural areas.
Every day that passes without clear ground rules, more and more small and medium-sized companies are in danger of being forced to shut down.
To be blunt, I could say that Europe's producers, and consumers too, are standing and stamping their feet while we here, at the very last stages, are engaging in trivial disputes.
Let me first talk about Amendment No 25, which is a compromise.
As is always the case with compromises, this means that no one has got exactly what they want.
We have all had to give in quite a bit, and I am a little uncertain as to what the end result of this compromise will be.
However, the amendment does give the Member States which currently permit the use of catering waste under extremely carefully controlled conditions a transitional period of four years.
Towards the end of the debate on the matter, a number of details concerning sludge and waste water came up.
Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 14 should in fact be set aside in favour of Amendment No 21, which is intended to promote the safe handling of these materials so as to avoid serious environmental consequences.
This is therefore a practical way of dealing with this issue.
I myself would really like to see Amendments Nos 3 and 5 put into effect.
Unfortunately, this is more or less impossible for technical reasons.
These amendments concern the marking of category 1 material.
The already adopted Regulation on TSEs contains clear requirements that direct risk material be marked.
Amendment No 5 is about the marking of category 2 material.
I think this would be desirable, but that the amendment should be rejected because it would have unreasonable consequences.
If the amendment were to be adopted, all fertiliser - natural fertiliser - within the EU would have to be marked, and this would affect approximately 1 200 000 000 tonnes a year.
This means that we would be able to choose whether the fields were to be blue, green or purple each spring, and it would all look a bit peculiar.
Amendments Nos 6 and 16 must in actual fact be adopted.
Otherwise, the report's main principle that only raw materials which have been approved for human consumption may be used in animal feed would be undermined.
The amendments do not in fact involve any changes to the requirements which currently apply to sampling and/or post ante mortem inspections of slaughtered animals.
It is only the final assessment based on existing rules which is affected by this regulation.
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 concern the handling of catering waste.
In this case, I recommend voting in favour of Amendments Nos 22 and 23 whereby catering waste generated from means of transport operating internationally should, with all its risks, be treated in accordance with the most stringent requirements of the regulation, in category 1.
On the other hand, catering waste in category 3 should be handled under existing structures and systems for collection, transport and disposal in line with the EU's waste directive.
The common position contains a somewhat strange proposal regarding endangered species of necrophagous birds, namely lammergeiers in Spain.
Amendment No 24 states that it is permitted to use category 1 material to feed this specific small group of birds.
I have checked this very carefully. These birds have to have this special food.
It sounds a little odd, but sometimes nature is, by nature, odd.
Amendment No 12 on the permanent marking of imported pet food is particularly controversial for the United States.
Regarding dyeing the raw materials which are to be included under categories 1 and 2, it is laid down that products in categories 1 and 2 are to be marked once they have turned into fat and processed proteins.
Such processed material must then be permanently marked when it comes to imported pet feed, as exactly the same requirements must be set for imported products as for our own products.
Amendment 15 concerns the separation of facilities.
Right from the start, the European Parliament demanded completely separate sites.
I can accept separate buildings if they really are separate - and not just separate parts of one building under the same roof.
There are also a number of amendments which were rejected by the committee and which, for various reasons, should be rejected once more.
We are concerned here with deleting references to biogas and composting.
This regulation does not regulate biogas plants and composting systems.
On the contrary, Article 6.2 says that national legislation in this area should apply until new EU environmental legislation is passed.
The only point of the reference in Article 1.2 is to give the Commission legal justification for requesting scientific statements on biogas and composting.
If we delete household waste, that is, from private kitchens, from the definition of catering waste, we are doing ourselves a disservice.
We know that catering waste is a very serious channel of infection for both swine fever and foot and mouth disease.
I personally think it is quite difficult to ban household waste being used as feed.
It has been a tradition in our European culture for thousands of years but we are now living in a new world and in another time, in which food, feed and ingredients are moved from place to place in a completely different way from 50 years ago, for example, when feed and food circulated in relatively small and recognisable cycles.
Once more I would like to thank my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council for excellent teamwork over the past year and a half.
Mr President, could I first of all thank Mrs Paulsen for the constructive way in which she has conducted the dialogue between the groups to come up with some compromise amendments?
I am pleased that my group has been able to sign all the compromise amendments, with the exception of Compromise Amendment No 25.
We very much support the ban on the use of catering waste in animal feed, not least because the likely cause of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom was the use of pigswill as feed.
I am also pleased to see that catering waste from abroad, such as may come from aeroplanes landing in our country, has been upgraded to category 1.
However, two problems emerge from this situation.
The first is the use of used cooking oil in the United Kingdom as animal feed.
Unfortunately, we will not be able to hide this oil behind the piles of fridges currently found in my own country and I am afraid that much of this oil will find its way into the drains of the country, causing environmental damage and also, I suggest, public health problems as it congeals and solidifies in the sewers of our major cities.
We also have a problem in Germany, where there are centralised plants for treating catering waste, unlike the on-farm situation in the UK, which was not very satisfactory.
Many of these installations are brand new and run according to the highest standards with typical German efficiency.
We should recognise the situation in Germany and Austria and allow an extension on the use of some of these brand new plants.
That is why I am pleased to support Amendment No 10, which was proposed in committee by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and calls for the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal by June 2002 requiring Member States to supply proof that these plants can operate safely.
Compromise Amendment No 25 contradicts this because it calls for a four-year extension on the use of these plants.
If, as I have been advised, the authors of the original amendment were to propose an oral amendment stating that this new legislative proposal could come forward in four years' time, then this would avoid such a contradiction.
That would be a good way forward and my group would be prepared to support such a move.
On the issue of sludge, could I ask the Commissioner to clarify the situation?
We have many slaughterhouses and meat processing plants that discharge effluent into domestic sewage systems in our major towns.
Although this process involves some initial filtration, there is no way that one could describe this discharge as sterile: it contains pathogens of all sorts.
Determining that the sludge from the sewage treatment plants in these large cities had to be incinerated under this directive would place unacceptable costs on slaughterhouses.
The European Union has already been responsible for the closure of many slaughterhouses and, in fact, in many cases, there would be no space for separate sewage treatment facilities.
Therefore, could I ask the Commissioner to make it quite clear on the record that the primary filtration products of these plants would be covered, but that the sludge from sewage treatment would not have to be incinerated and could be spread on the land as before?
Mr President, it is indeed a remarkable situation in which we find ourselves today.
We are speaking about a second reading, which the rapporteur has prepared brilliantly, and I admire the way in which Mrs Paulsen has tried to navigate a course between Scylla and Charybdis, Scylla being the thirteen Member States that have accepted the common position, and Charybdis being the two that have not, namely Austria and Germany.
Austria and Germany did not approve the common position for clear reasons.
Austria has been undertaking schemes involving the composting of biomass and the use of biogases for energy production, schemes which would no longer be possible under the common position. Germany would be prevented from sterilising and reusing catering waste.
When I listen to this debate today, and when I look back on the past few days, it surprises me that the United Kingdom, France and other countries accepted the common position.
I have just heard Mr Goodwill saying that he and his group did not sign Compromise Amendment No 25, which I signed along with all the other compromise amendments.
I signed them because they are compromises.
The ideal world is different.
I have a different conception of the ideal solution too.
But among the sources of the compromise amendment are not only Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's Amendments Nos 10 and 1 but also Mr Whitehead's amendment, which provided for a four-year transitional period.
Mr Goodwill referred to fears in his country that foot and mouth disease had been caused by the use of pigswill as feed.
To my knowledge, this has not been proved.
Swine fever, yes, but as a cause of foot and mouth disease it is new to me.
I had certainly heard this being mooted in the past, but that is only one aspect of the issue.
Another point - and this is part of the compromise, Mr Goodwill - is that if I go back to my own Member State and say that there is a disposal problem with reheated cooking oil, they will tell me in Germany that this poses a dioxin problem which they refuse to contemplate.
We must be very careful.
This is a very fine line we are treading today, and we must avoid the mistakes of the past, when cost issues and disposal problems were often invoked to the detriment of animal health, and hence of human health too.
If I say today that I can support our proposed compromise on catering waste, I must explain part of the background against which I make that statement. Nobody has been able to tell me what happens with catering waste in the other Member States.
In Germany, there are modern high-performance facilities which undertake state-of-the-art sterilisation of catering waste then recycle it into animal feed.
That is a fact.
In other Member States no one can tell me what happens to it.
Some say it is burned.
Nobody really knows.
No one knows the standards, and in private conversation any Member will admit that some of it ends up in landfill sites.
That is precisely what we do not want.
I should like to have a clear set of rules.
In five years' time, if we have legislation banning the recycling of catering waste for any purpose other than the production of biodiesel, so be it; that is what we shall do.
But it must then apply to all Member States.
At the moment, Germany, Austria and other countries are being penalised for their high standards.
If I appeal tomorrow for us to support all the compromise amendments, I shall be doing so because they are compromises.
I must then ask you to be fair and support the compromises too.
Mr President, Commissioner, the matter under discussion is very intricate and complex, and is one that will have a very far-reaching effect on the food industry.
For that reason, I wish to thank the rapporteur: we are grateful to you for your excellent work. In the main this report can be adopted.
I would, however, like to draw attention to one point, and that is Amendment No 15.
There are Member States where processing is on a very small scale.
The requirement, therefore, that different categories of activity should have a separate building is unreasonable as far as these countries are concerned.
For example, in my own country we have two plants, both of which already have clearly separate and properly supervised production lines.
If we were to find ourselves in a situation where we had to construct separate buildings for one more separate production line that would be unreasonable considering the small volumes being processed.
In my opinion the issues mentioned previously in the Council's formulation have been taken proper account of, and I would hope the Council's and the Commission's position will enter into force with regard to this matter.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, for the excellent work she has done to get this regulation on health rules concerning animal by-products through.
I also know that Mr Staes is pleased with the cooperation and the way in which we have been able to reach compromises as well as with Mrs Paulsen's work with the shadow rapporteur.
Thank you for that.
This is a very technical and complicated matter which can be difficult to get to grips with.
At the same time, it goes without saying of course that we must guarantee safe food for the citizens of the EU and, that being the case, we must do so throughout the entire chain.
Therefore, how we treat animals and what we feed them on is naturally important.
I am very pleased about the principles which the European Parliament and the Council have agreed on, in other words that only by-products from animals approved for human consumption may be used as animal feed.
The most important thing is possibly also the ban on re-use within the same species, that is, the fact that we are rejecting cannibalism.
I understand the Council's position in seeking to prohibit catering waste in animal feed.
It is difficult to guarantee safe and risk-free handling of catering waste.
How can we know what mixed household waste actually consists of?
Now we have tabled a compromise amendment, Amendment 22, where exceptions are made for catering waste in category 3, and we submit Amendment 25 in which some Member States are permitted to feed catering waste for a transitional period of a maximum of four years.
I am not entirely happy about this amendment but I am still willing to accept it so that we can get the report through.
At the moment, there is a kind of moratorium on the use of meat and bone meal in animal feed.
This means that the Council could at any time decide to permit the use of meat and bone meal once more.
The Verts/ALE Group has therefore submitted Amendment No 20.
I ask my colleagues to vote in favour of it as it does provide a kind of assurance that the Council must bring the issue up again before any decisions in that direction can be made.
Mr President, at first sight, this report on health requirements for animal by-products appears to be very technical.
It forces us to face a genuine problem for society and to take into account two realities that are not easy to reconcile.
Firstly, the legitimate concern of consumers with regard to the BSE epidemic and the terrifying human form of BSE, namely Kreutzfeld-Jacob's disease. And secondly, the necessary concern for farmers and all employees of the meat industry, whose work is being jeopardised by the frightening - and mounting - burden of restrictions that are being heaped upon them in the name of the precautionary principle.
Despite the fact that, several years ago, the fifth quarter or meat by-products were re-processed and sold, which met slaughterhouses' overheads. We now send these by-products - and quite rightly, I am sure - to be destroyed at great expense.
As a result, meat is constantly becoming more expensive for consumers whilst farmers are no longer paid a fair price for their animals.
The common position, on which we are due to vote, is creating a number of technical bottlenecks, since it is based on an extreme concept of the precautionary principle.
For example, is it a good idea to ban spreading sludge, manure and stercoral matter from slaughterhouses on land and to send 20 million tonnes of this waste to incineration, when we do not yet know how to process the two million tonnes of animal feed that we have?
Is it a good idea to involve several thousand local and regional slaughterhouses in building hundreds of sewage treatment plants and incinerators when BSE detection tests are making swift progress?
We will therefore reserve judgment, Mr President, on this extremely pernickety and excessively cautious text which will place such harsh restrictions on slaughterhouses, that many will be at risk of closing down, with all the consequences that these closures will have on the transportation of animals and the spread of epidemics.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by expressing my sincere thanks to all the honourable Members whose hard work and constructive attitudes have brought us to this point.
It is unquestionable that the prevention of epizootic diseases which lead to food crises is of great importance, not only to the future of European farming but also to the entire population of Europe.
The crucial task now is to find a suitable means of meeting the needs of a multifunctional agricultural system as well as those of consumers.
In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, I therefore call for the preservation of the tried and tested national systems for the disposal and recycling of organic waste.
The collection and use of biogenetic waste for the purposes of composting or for use in a biogas plant are highly commendable from an environmental point of view and must therefore remain possible in future.
In Austria in particular we have found these processes extremely useful.
I should also like to address the extremely controversial issue of recycled catering waste.
The Austrian example shows that application of the highest possible standards of hygiene, coupled with official monitoring, banishes any concerns regarding a possible risk of epizootic disease.
This has been confirmed once again in the recent past.
I would therefore regard a general ban on the use of pigswill for animal feed as an unduly draconian measure.
In addition, we must not forget the investments that have been made in the municipal collection of organic waste and in the officially licensed decoction facilities, investments made in the belief that the future lies in an exemplary system of environmental protection.
In recent years, 250 new decoction facilities have been built in Austria.
I shall therefore lend my support to all compromise amendments that guarantee the continued existence of proven monitored systems for the recycling of organic waste.
I consider it very important that we formulate our decisions on this sensitive subject in such a way that the general public can follow our reasoning.
The public would certainly not want to see the prohibition of an exemplary practice.
Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Paulsen very warmly on her diligence and skill in bringing through another complex piece of food safety legislation.
She always manages to steer between national positions and never loses sight of that corpus of food safety legislation which we are slowly bringing together.
I would like to look at the very wide definition of catering waste in the annexes and in Amendments 22 to 25.
I will leave aside the feeding of carrion birds because I wish to look at a different form of carrion, that is the catering waste represented both by the recycled swill in some countries and by recycled cooking oils in others, including my own.
Catering swill arouses deep misgivings in my country because of the role it played in the recent foot and mouth epidemic.
Cooking oil is seen to be a problem after the dioxin scandals of recent years.
The rapporteur has brought the two together in a complex series of amendments culminating in No 25, which I will support.
I acknowledge her efforts.
The UK's problem, as Mr Goodwill has mentioned, is that we need to have an effective and rewarded system of collecting used catering oils for fuel - not feed - reuse.
That will take time.
If no other outlet is provided, users will dump it in drains and ponds. They will become sumps of noxious material.
One constituent demonstrated to me in the most vivid terms what exactly those consequences will be.
Therefore, Commissioner, we really would like a statement of intent on whether the four-year transition period is achievable.
I hope it is; otherwise, good intentions will founder here for sure and the old saying that the best can be the enemy of the good will be vindicated.
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking my esteemed colleague, Mrs Paulsen, for all the sound and skilful work she has done on this report.
I support most of the content of the report and am pleased that the Commission is prepared to propose transitional arrangements for the cleansing of waste water.
I think, however, that we are going too far in a number of areas.
During the last part-session, we debated Mr Olsson's report on the extent to which the existing BSE decisions had been implemented in the Member States.
That was depressing, and there was not much to rejoice about.
There are too many countries which cut corners, and that creates too many holes in the system for BSE to be combated effectively.
Something needs to be done about this. We owe it to ourselves and, especially, to those countries which comply with the decisions.
I am unable to support the proposed amendments to the regulations governing post-mortem inspection of blood, for which I do not believe there is any scientific justification.
Nor have I been given any estimates of its economic significance for the Member States and the regions, and I fear it would involve major costs for smaller enterprises and, in particular, for slaughterhouses operating on a very small scale.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome the Commission's initiative to introduce uniform European rules on the use of animal by-products.
Optimum control and traceability of animal by-products are vital prerequisites of greater consumer safety.
In particular, I support the amendment which was adopted in committee on the use of kitchen waste for animal feed.
The feeding of untreated kitchen and restaurant waste has often been regarded in the past as a possible source of swine fever and foot and mouth disease.
For this reason it is especially important that all such untreated catering waste which is transported into our countries should be eliminated.
It undoubtedly makes sense to process catering waste in accordance with strict regulations, so that the entire operation can be supervised down to the smallest detail.
Our declared aim in all of this must be maximum safety for consumers.
Strict processing regulations, by which I specifically mean rules governing sterilisation and the destruction of potential pathogens, and firm European regulations on traceability and control are indispensable and reduce the risk of the spread of epizootic diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever.
Consistent checks by producers, but also by farmers, must supplement the system.
The vital thing is that farmers and consumers must be able to rely on the safety of feed products.
This requires a system for the conditional authorisation of catering waste for use as animal feed, a system that can be closely monitored.
This is why I firmly support the amendment tabled by the Environment Committee.
Mr President, Commissioner, I join my fellow Members in congratulating Mrs Paulsen for the work she has done as well as her collaboration.
The aim of this report, as previous speakers have said, is to draw up sanitary rules with a view to improving food safety.
One of the fundamental aspects of this proposal is to ban re-use within the food chain of certain animal products, namely animal carcasses and downgraded animal by-products.
However, the draft text submitted to Parliament at second reading - and I am referring to Article 4 here - indicates that all matter of animal origin collected during processing waste water in slaughterhouses and other premises must be classified as category 1, and this wording and change in the text gives us cause for concern.
A provision of this kind would cause huge problems in terms of storage, collection and disposal, since the sludge from processing waste water during slaughter would no longer be able to be spread on land, but would have to be incinerated, which would add to the millions of tonnes of animal feed that we have to dispose of.
The costs incurred by these new restrictions would force many slaughterhouses and cutting rooms throughout the European Union to close down their business that has become increasingly difficult in the wake of the various crises that we have experienced.
I can only reaffirm that, at local level, the professional workers, employees, citizens and local authorities, if they failed to grasp the scientific justification of this text, would find it hard to understand that, after all their efforts (sanitary measures, tests, slaughtering herds), the European Union is asking them to make a further effort which goes beyond the financial limits that they are able to cope with.
I therefore believe that it is essential that we provide clarification on this matter and that this specific treatment only applies to equipment with specific risks, thus ensuring increased food safety and feasibility for our industries and tradesmen.
We must also step up our research programmes so that we have the most effective techniques possible for the processing of animals that are slaughtered and intended for human consumption and also pursue our other food safety policies to improve traceability, monitoring of imports from third countries and safe livestock feeding, as our priority must be to tackle the root of these problems.
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, there is a popular saying that politics is a dirty business.
Does it become even dirtier when politicians have to deal with such unsavoury matters as pigswill and abattoir waste?
Would it not perhaps be more consistent if we did not deal with these matters at all but simply proclaimed an outright ban?
If we commit ourselves to the search for sensible solutions, does this necessarily make us somehow corrupt or venal?
All sorts of inferences like these have been doing the rounds lately.
I do not believe they have any substance.
The European Parliament has shown courage.
I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Paulsen for her systematic work on this issue and for her close cooperation with our committee.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have had the task of representing the interests of the farming community.
I believe we have successfully integrated their concerns into this common position.
May I also thank you, Commissioner Byrne, for our long conversations and debates. They were no bad thing.
They were fruitful and, besides, they were quite enjoyable too.
Here we are looking specifically at high-quality protein which is to be fed to non-vegetarian animals.
We do not intend to make vegetarians of them, any more than we can induce carrion-eating birds to stop eating carrion.
It would be the death of them.
Similarly, when it comes to human foodstuffs, we want a system that will recycle all the high-quality nutrients.
We cannot adopt a set of rules at the expense of the hungry people in the world, whereby anything that is no longer good enough for us is simply destroyed or abandoned.
We are not legislating on catering waste here; it is merely a matter of the Commission presenting its own legislative proposal, to which we accord the same systematic and meticulous treatment that we gave to meat and bone meal.
I do not understand the position of some people who are saying that meat and bone meal can be fed but catering waste cannot.
Then there are others, of course, who are saying that catering waste can be fed but not meat and bone meal.
So both positions exist.
That is why I tabled my proposal.
Your compromise proposal, Mrs Paulsen, is fine.
Tomorrow I shall move an oral amendment in which I shall alter the time scale in my amendments, which are similar in substance to the compromise; this alteration relates to the time before the entry into force of the proposed regulation.
I believe the alteration will make the amendments compatible, and we can then adopt them as they stand.
We shall then have a sound solution.
Thereafter, Mr Byrne, I hope that, on your initiative, we shall soon have the new version back here on the table. Then we shall engage in some more of the good old cut and thrust, and we shall revel in it.
Politics is not a dirty business; it is actually a most enjoyable occupation!
Mr President, the recommendations under discussion today put forward by my colleague, Mrs Paulsen, are a continuation of the important work she has been so very commendably involved in as Parliament's rapporteur regarding updating the legislation on food safety.
We have been able to respond to food crises in the current parliamentary term in a way that has been both consistent and wide-ranging.
Our common goal is to restore complete consumer confidence and levels of safety.
I would like to say that I agree with the view expressed just now by Mr PesÃ€lÃ€ regarding Amendment No 15.
The traditional, common sense way in which catering waste is used for feeding has for the present unfortunately proved problematic as a result of inadequacies in the processing of feed.
Serious animal diseases have thus been able to spread.
For that reason Parliament now requires the Commission to promptly submit a legislative proposal banning the use of catering waste of animal origin as feed and obliging Member States to provide proof of its safe disposal.
As an exception, the production of feed from catering waste could be permitted if it has been properly sterilised in an officially authorised plant.
Parliament can also feel pleased with how the codecision procedure works and the cooperation established with the Council in the area of food safety.
That is why it is unfortunate that the most prominent element in publicising the work to improve food safety, the establishment of a new Food Safety Authority, has proved such a difficult task in the Council and that the agency is commencing its work in a temporary location.
This is also likely to hamper the recruitment of qualified staff for the agency.
In this respect the Council should be capable of making the right decisions swiftly and showing consumers that the long-term work done to guarantee the supply of safe food is more important that seeking to obtain short-term benefits for individual countries in the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss this report dealing with animal by-products that are not intended for human consumption, we must not speak exclusively of waste products.
The basis for a very specific distinction is provided by the submission from the Commission, which divides the materials into three categories.
They must be separately registered, stored, treated and marketed, and evidence of each operation must be recorded.
The items that must be destroyed and removed from the food chain are quite clearly defined, as are the conditions for their removal and destruction.
We are all agreed that contaminated and inferior material has no place in the food chain.
On the other hand, we can treat and then re-use important nutrient carriers that were properly prepared for their original use.
Strict rules govern the procedure for such recycling.
Here we have the example of pigswill.
To allow the use of pigswill, the Committee on the Environment adopted Amendment No 10 on the recycling of catering waste.
There is pressure to adopt this particular amendment within a short time frame.
The directive on swine fever enters into force on 1 November and imposes a blanket ban on the feeding of catering waste.
And this is why I ask you, Commissioner, whether Compromise Amendment 25 that has been set before us lifts this ban.
A legal loophole must not be created here, because the existing processing facilities produce hygienic feed which contributes neither to the spread of classical swine fever nor to that of foot and mouth disease.
I believe Amendment No 10 was good, which is why the committee adopted it.
It is for this reason that I asked my absolutely clear and unequivocal question about the new compromise amendment on the table.
We should take particular care to ensure that we make clear and unambiguous statements and that we leave no scope for confusing double standards and overlaps between different regulations.
This sort of thing affects small and medium-sized abattoirs.
For that reason, we must support Amendment No 2 to Article 4.
May I reiterate my sincere thanks to Mrs Paulsen for this report?
It is a matter of the safety of our food chain, which is, after all, very closely connected with the health of consumers.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, feeding catering waste to livestock instead of indulging in waste tourism - that is my political demand.
When shall we create an authoritative and objective system of public information in the EU?
In Germany, catering waste is fed to fattening pigs under the strictest of rules.
Confidence in the processing facilities is high.
My country is the most populous in the EU; about a quarter of the entire population of the Union lives in Germany, and there is a correspondingly high output of catering waste.
There is no evidence of any epizootic disease having occurred in our country through the feeding of treated catering waste to livestock.
What are we actually doing to ourselves with this planned ban?
In my view, we have started to place pigs before people as far as food intake is concerned.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has already raised this point, and I too find it monstrous to do this in a world where people are starving every day, where slum children have to rummage about in rubbish heaps for food scraps.
What life of luxury is Europe trying to lead?
This, you may well say, is an emotional argument, but it is extremely important to me, Commissioner, that we restore some rationality to our examination of the feeding of catering waste.
It must surely be possible for us, through our own efforts and with the aid of the media, to present these issues in a rather more objective manner.
The treatment of catering waste must, of course, comply with appropriately high sterilisation standards.
That is the only way to guarantee the destruction of foot and mouth and swine-fever pathogens.
Plants supervised by the public authorities are surely the best safeguard.
Along with the numerous previous contributors to this debate, may I say thank you very much to Mrs Paulsen for the work she has done, but I also hope that we can reach a practicable solution and that we can send out long-term signals from which the feed industry, waste processors and farmers can take their lead.
Mr President, this proposal is the second major component in our defence barriers against BSE.
The other is, of course, the regulation on TSEs.
It is a hugely important proposal, key to the safe processing of the millions of tonnes of animal by-products produced in the Union each year.
The continued absence of a sound, comprehensive and regulatory framework to deal with these by-products is quite dangerous.
First of all, I would like to single out for particular appreciation your rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, for her enormous efforts and tireless work over these months in pursuing a rapid agreement with the Commission and the Council towards early implementation of the proposed regulation.
A great many of the key provisions of the regulation under discussion result from her personal commitment and determination.
I am greatly encouraged that all three institutions are in general agreement on three key principles: the requirement that only animal by-products derived from animals fit for human consumption should be used in feed, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products; the prohibition of intra-species recycling; and the need to tighten certain provisions in order to improve the control and traceability of animal by-products.
However, I regret that, despite the very good progress made on the proposal, the question of how to deal with catering waste remains a main obstacle to final agreement.
The feeding of catering waste carries a major threat of transmission of serious animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever.
For example, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK last year, which caused such enormous losses to both the farming and non-farming community, is reliably known to have originated from swill feeding.
I might also add that the outbreak of classical swine fever in the Netherlands in 1997 was also caused by the feeding of pigswill in neighbouring Germany.
Nobody would wish this to occur again.
Given the huge damage which has arisen from recent outbreaks of these diseases, the insistence of Member States on very high levels of protection is understandable and shared by the Commission.
I am fully aware of your concerns that a total ban may not be appropriate, especially in Member States with strict controls.
However, I am equally aware that the Member States are not prepared to take any risk arising from the authorisation of swill feeding.
They have already decided on a ban in the swine fever directive, despite several opportunities to reconsider the need for a ban.
There are no indications of a reversal of this position.
Parliament must also accept that there are contradictions in any proposal to retain swill feeding.
For example, Parliament is demanding the full traceability of ingredients in animal feedingstuffs and a ban on what might be described as cannibalism.
How can this be consistent with a derogation allowing the use of waste collected from restaurants and hospital kitchens to feed pigs and poultry?
Similarly, how can Parliament ask to exclude catering waste from the strict control rules of the regulation, fearing that these rules would compromise the practice of composting, and at the same time demand that the Commission propose a new regulation on the safe disposal of catering waste?
The Commission, having heard the insistence of 13 Member States on the necessity for a ban, and in the interests of consistency, remains opposed to any relaxation of an outright ban in this regulation.
We must therefore reject Amendments Nos 1, 10 and 25.
We are also opposed to these amendments on institutional grounds, as the insistence on a deadline and on the content of future proposals undermines the Commission's right of initiative.
Furthermore, the disposal and recycling of catering waste is and will be governed by existing and future environmental legislation on biodegradable waste.
Finally, the Commission has already officially declared that it is ready to propose transitional measures, to be adopted by comitology whenever this is justified and appropriate, in order to allow the affected industries time to adapt to the new requirements introduced by this regulation.
I would also refer you to Article 32, which might give further assistance in this area.
Turning to the details, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 and 5 on the requirement of the marking of unprocessed category 1 and 2 material.
Acceptance would require the marking of cadavers, including pet animals, and 1.2 billion tonnes of manure.
I leave to your imagination the potential for the Eurosceptic press to exploit this requirement in order to undermine our credibility.
We also cannot accept Amendment No 9, as detailed and sufficient requirements regarding accompanying documents and record-keeping are established in the annex to the regulation and may be supplemented if need be by comitology.
We can, however, accept Amendments Nos 22 and 23 on catering waste making reference to environmental legislation, as they would ensure that the goals of the regulation are achieved without undermining separate collection schemes.
Therefore, Amendments Nos 17 and 19 are unnecessary and cannot be supported by us.
Amendments Nos 22 and 23 also clarify that the highest risk catering waste from international means of transport should remain subject to the control rules of Article 7.
Therefore, they are preferable to Amendments Nos 7 and 8.
We cannot accept Amendment No 18, aimed at excluding household kitchen waste from the definition of catering waste, as this is would be inconsistent with the existing EU legislation on classical swine fever.
Turning to another important issue - sludge from slaughterhouses - we cannot support the first part of Amendment No 2, as it virtually destroys the effect of Article 4 by removing from the scope of the article material from waste-water systems from all slaughterhouses and other premises from which specified risk material is removed.
It should be noted that the TSE Regulation does not establish any rules in this area.
But as an aside, and in answer to Mr Goodwill, I should point out that I have written to Dr. Jackson on this particular subject.
I have sent a copy of the letter to a number of Members and I will ensure that a copy is sent to you.
It explains the position with regard to sludge and gives the kind of reassurance you sought earlier in your presentation.
We could accept in broad terms the second part of Amendment No 2, which seeks to clarify that animal material collected when treating waste water is a category 1 material only if contains BSE specified risk material.
However, Amendment No 21, which has the same objective but is clearer, is acceptable.
Amendment No 4 cannot be accepted as, when combined with Amendment No 2 or with Amendment No 21, it would be superfluous and confusing.
We cannot support Amendment No 14, which would provide a 3-year transitional period without conditions to apply during this period.
I repeat that the Commission has already officially declared that it is ready to propose transitional measures to be adopted by comitology whenever this is justified and appropriate.
We can support Amendment No 24 aiming to extend the derogation on the feeding of certain animals with category 1 material to endangered and protected species of, for example, vultures.
We cannot accept Amendment No 11, as it would extend that derogation to any endangered or protected species.
We can support Amendment No 20 requiring Member States to submit a report on the implementation of the Regulation, except for the reference to the lifting of the ban on meat- and bonemeal.
This is already comprehensively covered by the TSE Regulation.
Similarly, we can support the principle of Amendment No 13, which has the same objective as the first part of Amendment No 20, subject to editorial change.
Finally, we can accept Amendments Nos 6, 12, 15 and 16 to various articles and annexes, as they are in line with the basic objectives of the Regulation.
I wish also to note that Parliament has not made any further amendments to the second proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 90/425/EEC and 92/118/EEC as regards health requirements for animal by-products.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0459/2001) by Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC on urban waste-water treatment [2000/2318(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, the real reason it has been possible to draw up the European Parliament's own-initiative report on the implementation of the directive on urban waste-water treatment is that we in the Committee on the Environment concerned ourselves with this directive and followed its development very closely.
With this report we have shown that there are serious shortcomings in the implementation of this directive, despite the fact that it has been in force for a long time - it is more than ten years old - and that, furthermore, it is extremely important for all European legislation on water.
We know that many Member States have failed to comply with this directive.
In 1998 there were many agglomerations of more than 150 000 inhabitants that had still not resolved the issue of waste-water treatment.
Many Member States had still not submitted information on the condition of sensitive areas.
Currently, many other cities of more than 15 000 inhabitants are still not treating this waste water in this way.
We know that throughout this time the approach of the Member States has been so carefree, having implemented neither this nor other directives on the issue of water, that I believe Member States have been censured on more than 42 occasions for failing to comply with 17 directives in the field of waste water.
Member States have been censured because they have not provided the information that the Commission asked them for and because, of course, they have not complied with this legislation when they should have, and they failed to comply in full in 1993, 1998 and even in 2000.
But, Commissioner, the Commission also considered that their behaviour towards the European Parliament was unsatisfactory, since the information we were provided with was insufficient and, in some cases, wrong.
I should like to say that, initially, this report had an annex, which, following two debates in committee, we were forced to remove, because the data that the Commission had supplied us with was wrong.
In our view, the Commission has shown neither the necessary strength nor will in this case to demand that the Member States provide data and demand that they comply with this directive.
I wish to say, Commissioner, that when we in the Committee on the Environment requested that this own-initiative report be drawn up, what we really wanted was for you to consider us as your ally, in order to strengthen the binding nature of this directive and to enable the Commission to force the Member States to comply more energetically with the directive.
In this report we ask you to admonish the Member States, to initiate proceedings against those that have not complied and to continue using all legal means within your power, all in order to ensure that this legislation is complied with.
We also asked you, of course, to continue keeping the European Parliament informed, requesting information from the Member States and holding seminars.
Lastly, we ask you to adopt all necessary measures to ensure that, with the proper will to create such legislation, and the willingness to provide as much information as possible, compliance with this legislation can be enforced.
Commissioner, there is currently a serious discrepancy between the enormous quantity of legislation we have approved and which we are continuing to approve but with which, nevertheless, the Member States are still failing to comply, which is why we have before us two own-initiative reports - on nitrates and habitats - by the European Parliament.
These have shown us that the Member States are also failing to comply with other environmental directives.
It is my view that, as European citizens, it is our right to have the Treaties protect the environment.
In the European Union we already have certain principles (such as the precautionary principle and the principle of prevention). We also have objectives, such as the strategy for sustainable development.
We have tools, such as the Sixth Framework Programme and legislation. The European Union is even considered to be the world leader in protecting the environment.
But, Commissioner, if all of this is really nothing but words, nothing but reports, if the Commission does not demand that the Member States comply with this legislation in its entirety, it will be quite useless. You can count on us to be your allies in ensuring that this legislation is complied with, because otherwise, we will lose credibility and I believe that we are here precisely to support the Commission and to prevent ourselves losing this credibility.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 1991 directive on urban waste water is intended to guarantee the construction and maintenance of sewage-treatment works in all large towns and municipalities of the European Union.
Since these measures involve considerable financial expenditure, very liberal implementation deadlines were set.
As my honourable colleague Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez has said, we must conclude today that not all Member States have made use of the time at their disposal; on the contrary, they have engaged in delaying tactics and - regrettably, in view of their failure to submit reports, we must also say quite bluntly - in obfuscation.
The Belgian metropolis of Brussels, which is so keen to call itself the capital of Europe, sets an appalling example in this respect.
The fine report compiled by Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez mercilessly exposes the inadequacies.
Most Member States have not even fulfilled their reporting obligations for the first date in 1998, let alone for the second date in 2000.
That is bad enough.
What is far worse, however, is that the Member States' waters continue to be polluted by untreated municipal sewage.
We are addressing many demands to the Commission today.
It cannot act, however, as long as it does not have the power to do so.
I believe that the large number of default actions and legal proceedings instituted before the European Court of Justice proves that the Commission is doing its duty.
It is unquestionably the Member States that are in the dock.
As Members of Parliament, we too should take action in our own countries.
The call for wider direct powers of on-the-spot scrutiny for the Commission in the Member States, enabling it to intervene in the same way that it can already intervene in the realm of agriculture, is vehemently rejected by most of the Member States.
Be that as it may, if we identify such gross violations by national governments of their obligations to implement European legislation, we must also find out why this is happening.
I should like to mention at least three reasons. The first is the high cost, to which the European Parliament has drawn attention time and again since the directive was first debated.
It is estimated that an eleven-figure sum in euros is needed for investments alone in the 15 Member States.
Current estimates also put the cost of implementing this one directive in the applicant countries at about EUR 30 billion.
The second reason is that many directives require the Member States to submit reports, which considerably increases their administrative workload.
I urge the Commission to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether this task cannot be simplified, perhaps by means of standardised returns.
Some initial moves have already been made in this direction, of course, within this very domain of activity in connection with the various directives for the protection of water resources.
The third reason is that those Member States which have transposed the directive have gone about the designation of sensitive areas in very different ways.
Should the Commission not spell out the precise criteria for the designation of sensitive areas?
That might perhaps make the directive easier to implement as well as having the desirable side-effect of enhanced comparability.
I should be grateful if the Commissioner could respond to these points too.
Mr President, very briefly, this is a very sorry story.
It has been a bad story for some time and it is particularly embarrassing if you are Belgian, of course, or indeed anybody visiting Brussels, because the city of Brussels is one of the cities which has been in breach of this directive for the longest period.
My questions to the Commissioner, which she might like to consider answering either now or later at some time, are, first: does she not agree that the situation in this directive proves the need for a much more thorough impact assessment to accompany legislation such as this?
I recall that when the urban waste water directive went through, the impact assessment was very feeble and never really gave any figures as to the likely costs.
I am told that in the United Kingdom between 1989 and 2005, GBP 26 billion will be spent on upgrading the water system to deal with this directive.
That figure was not known at the time when the directive was brought through - not in my country and not in any country; so the question is: can we obtain better, more effective impact assessments?
Not just cost-impact assessments in terms of a global figure, but impact assessments as to the disadvantage of doing nothing set against the advantage of doing something.
Secondly, I wonder whether I might ask the Commissioner to be very bold, because this really does come down to the question of Mrs WallstrÃ¶m's debates with the Council of Ministers.
One of our problems is not only that the Commission does not produce impact assessments, but that the Member States are not honest about their capacity to put in place what they sign up to.
What we really need is a system whereby each Member State is asked at a Council meeting whether or not it can comply with the legislation that its ministers are about to sign up to.
A very good place to start would be the new directive on packaging waste.
I am sure that every Member State wants to send its minister to Brussels to agree to environmental directives; that is just our problem.
They agree to far too much; they do far too little; and this waste water directive illustrates the problem.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Sornoza on doing this report so well.
We had many problems getting the information out of the Commission, for the simple reason that the Commission did not have the information because the Member States had failed to furnish it.
Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank the European Parliament, and rapporteur Mrs Sornosa MartÃ­nez in particular, for the work which she and Parliament have put into this resolution.
Water is one of the areas which I prioritise in my capacity as Commissioner for the Environment, and I am especially interested in this question.
Treated waste water is one of the most important tools for protecting our water and human health.
I have examined the information on the Member States' implementation of the directive and share very many of the opinions put forward by Parliament in its resolution.
Water quality has improved in larger rivers and many lakes but, nevertheless, the majority of Member States have either not done enough or they have acted too late.
They have also been late in submitting information on the implementation of the directive, which has slowed down the Commission's assessment work.
At the Commission, we have used a number of controls to ensure that the directive is implemented.
These include traditional controls - including legal measures, which can now also include the imposition of fines - and financial support within the framework of the EU's funds.
We are currently taking proceedings against seven of the 15 Member States, and further proceedings will be brought.
The new controls are focused on raising the level of public awareness and on exchanging skills and information.
A year ago, we ran a name, fame and shame seminar.
I have also ordered wide-ranging reports on the implementation of the directive.
This exceeds what the Commission is legally obliged to do.
We think that the reports should be written in a way that is easy to understand and that they should be accessible to the public.
The Commission has already responded to most of the demands in the resolution.
This is the case regarding legal measures to ensure that the directive is implemented, the publication of information on implementation of the directive by the Member States, including details of court cases, the condition that the requirements in the directive must be met if financial aid is to be received, the development of a comprehensive monitoring and assessment system linked to the Geographical Information System and, last but not least, cooperation with, and support for, the candidate countries.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Statement by the President
Before turning to the topic of this morning's debate I should like to make a brief statement in the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council on the grave developments in the Middle East over the past several days.
We have been watching with growing disbelief the violence and reciprocal atrocities that have plumbed new depths of horror in recent days.
Military operations have now reached levels unknown in two decades.
The region, and especially Israel and the Palestinian Territories, seem to be edging frighteningly and inexorably towards an all-out conflagration.
We have a responsibility in our Parliament in this unfolding tragedy to do anything that we can to prevent the holy places being transformed into killing fields.
We must actively support the unanimous call yesterday evening by the United Nations Security Council for an immediate ceasefire.
The EU's High Representative knows that our Parliament stands squarely behind him in his efforts in favour of peace and for a ceasefire.
Equally, I would like to take this opportunity this morning to place on the public record our Parliament's deep debt to the personal courage and unshakeable commitment of the European Union envoy, Mr Moratinos.
He may not thank me for saying this, but I had the opportunity to speak to him at length yesterday about his diplomatic efforts on our behalf to keep channels of communication open with all sides.
He is, for Europe, one of our unsung heroes.
I want to pledge to this House to take any action on behalf of Parliament which has a chance of promoting peace and of trying to draw this region back from the edge.
I have taken steps to invite Mr Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat to seek to break that infernal cycle of violence by inviting them to come to address this House.
I hope they will be in a position to take up this offer.
We would welcome them as champions of peace through the hardest of times.
I, in cooperation with Mr Solana and the good offices of the Spanish Presidency, remain open to the suggestion to travel to Ramallah with the Knesset speaker, Avraham Burg and to meet there with Abu Ala in the Palestinian Legislative Council should circumstances permit.
Because the risk is looming of an all-out conflagration we have to do whatever we can.
In the name of this Parliament, for humanity's sake, the essential appeal I want to make this morning is: please stop the violence, start the dialogue and give peace a chance.
(Loud applause)
Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on having made this statement, which is proof that you are fulfilling your duty.
My group invited two high-profile speakers, one Palestinian and one Israeli, to address us here last night and they described life in reoccupied Ramallah.
They told us how the camps were being bombed and also described the horrors of the attacks in Jerusalem.
They told us how the city of Ramallah was plunged into darkness and bombed at the very moment when President Arafat was receiving Mr Moratinos, and how bombs fell just a few metres from where they were meeting.
I think that you were right just now to recall our decision to invite President Arafat and Mr Peres.
I believe that you are right to remind us of this and to extend the invitation.
We also decided to send a high-level delegation to the area; this was Parliament's wish.
I suggest that we act on this decision and that this delegation be a high-level one, comprising, for example, the presidents of our groups or even Parliament's President.
Mr President, I must first assure you of the Socialist Group's support for your statement.
I would also like to express our support for the resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council. The latter represents a turning point in history because, for the first time, explicit reference is made to the need to recognise a Palestinian state, as advocated by the European Union.
I believe it should be emphasised that the UN, the European Union, the United Sates and Russia need to work together if we are to find a light to guide us out of the darkness of the current conflict in the Middle East.
This message should go out loud and clear, Mr President of the Council, particularly because it is important for the Council of Ministers to present a united front on this matter, and support the work of our representative in the Middle East. Parliament made its views clear through the resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority in the February plenary.
I believe it is now time for the Council to act likewise and agree on a common approach it could wholeheartedly support. It might then be possible to move forward and break the present infernal cycle of violence.
All that remains for me to say, Mr President, is that the initiatives you proposed and which were also part of our resolution, do reflect our common desire.
Mr President, our group, too, thanks you for your statement, and we are right alongside you as regards a peace settlement, or the attempt at one, in the Middle East.
This debate is not about the Middle East, as we want to discuss enlargement, but it is our profound conviction that we will be successful in the fight against terrorism only if we, that is the United States of America and the European Union, support the peace process between Israel and Palestine with equal determination and in the same way, something on which there could be stronger signals from the West, to which we belong.
I am much obliged to you for your initiative.
Mr President, I should simply like to thank you for your words and say that, if ever a delegation did go to Ramallah and Jerusalem, I hope that it would be able to meet not only representatives of the institutions but also some representatives of civil society in Palestine and Israel, because I believe that peace will only be restored in the Middle East if civil society is mobilised.
Mr President, I should like, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to thank you for your support and for what you have said today.
We are in a dreadful situation in which people are being killed every day in these areas: children, young people, the elderly, the innocent.
Moreover, we must do everything to support you and, as a Parliament, call upon the other parties to do something. I think, however, that it is important that, as elected representatives of the people, we take this task upon ourselves and, at this time, express sympathy, as well as the horror and fear that we feel.
I thank colleagues for the endorsement of that statement and of the possible initiatives that we might take.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on enlargement and we are very pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr PiquÃ© i Camps is here today to lead this debate.
Mr President, before turning to enlargement, which is the topic of today's debate, I should like, if I may, to say a few words on the situation in the Middle East.
Firstly, I wish to endorse the statement you just made. It is entirely appropriate and has my full support.
We have long been involved in intense political and diplomatic activity aimed at finding a solution to the current situation in the Middle East and to the violence spiralling out of control in the region.
As is well known, the approach adopted by the European Union and the Council is based on the firm belief that there can be no military solution to the conflict.
I feel we are all agreed on that.
A peace process is therefore the only option, and that process must involve the peaceful coexistence of two states in the region. On the one hand, there is the State of Israel, with internationally recognised borders and the right to feel secure, and on the other a Palestinian State that needs to be viable in every sense, especially as regards its political, economic, social and territorial dimensions.
In the present circumstances, however, our main aim must be to achieve a ceasefire.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity to express my support for the United Nations Security Council resolution, as is right and proper. On behalf of the European Council I would like to add our voice to those calling for an immediate ceasefire.
It would then be possible for us to work together on security issues.
The political dimension could be brought back into the process.
This is essential to reaching a solution.
Economic issues must also come into play, given the terrible living conditions and dreadful situation currently prevailing in the Palestinian Territories.
There is a great deal to be done.
A number of initiatives and ideas have been put forward. I should like to endorse the initiative launched by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.
I believe it represents a good basis for further progress. It would be helpful if it received the support of the Arab League at its summit in Beirut at the end of this month.
It is essential to get the peace process back on track. I should emphasise once again how important it is for the international community to work together to that end, as stated in that Security Council resolution and by a number of speakers in the House today.
We all realise that the United States has to be involved in any solution to the conflict.
Nonetheless, we are also convinced that it does not have to be the prime mover in finding that solution.
The European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations must work together. In addition, the whole Arab world as represented by the Arab League, and certain states in particular, must also be involved in this concerted approach.
It should then at last be possible to convince both sides of the need to put an end to this fruitless cycle of actions and reactions. We are all aware of what the outcome has to be, and this makes the suffering and deaths even more senseless, if that were possible.
I therefore believe we must persevere with this approach. I am very grateful for what you have said and for the support of the House.
We shall persevere along these lines. We are working on a declaration for the European Council to be held in Barcelona the day after tomorrow.
The declaration is being drafted in the clearest, most categorical and specific form possible. I trust that this declaration will be endorsed by other international players present and also that it will be a step towards attaining that longed-for peace which often still seems to be light years away.
Mr President, I should now like to move on to the subject of this first speech, namely the enlargement of the European Union.
It is abundantly clear that the impending enlargement represents one of the greatest strategic challenges the European Union has faced since its creation.
As you are aware, it is one of the key priorities for the Spanish Presidency.
The overriding political importance of this venture was made quite clear at Nice, when a road map setting out our objectives for the half year was devised.
A clear timeframe was then drawn up at Gothenburg.
It was stated that negotiations with all those countries sufficiently prepared should be completed by the end of 2002. The next step was taken at Laeken, when the terms of this final stage of negotiations were confirmed.
It was also stated that if the present rate of progress was maintained, up to 10 countries could be ready. In addition, specific terms were laid down for the conduct of negotiations.
These terms must and will be adhered to, to ensure a successful outcome. On the one hand, there must be compliance with the acquis, and on the other, with the Berlin financial framework.
It is worth emphasising the magnitude of this challenge.
It involves bringing into the Union countries that were military dictatorships with planned economies barely fifteen years ago. I am referring to the countries of Eastern Europe, most of which belonged to a military alliance opposed to the North Atlantic Alliance.
I would remind you again that I am only casting my mind back fifteen years at most.
As a result of the fundamental changes that happened so quickly, this enlargement has taken on its own specific characteristics. It differs significantly from previous enlargements, and therefore has its own particular nature.
In line with the programme, my country's main aim whilst it holds the Presidency-in-Office of the Council in the coming six months is to achieve common positions on the chapters which have fallen to us by virtue of the timetable. It will be for our Presidency to close these outstanding chapters.
I am referring to the budgetary and financial aspects of the common agricultural policy, and regional policy, notably the Structural and Cohesion Funds, in addition to financial and budgetary provisions.
Finally, there is the chapter on institutions.
Obviously, we are dealing with very difficult and complex chapters.
They represent approximately 80% of the Community budget. This in itself is an indication of the size of the challenge we have before us.
No effort will be spared in the pursuit of our aim. One reason is that we are aware that any delay could jeopardise the entire venture.
The debate on these chapters was opened with the Commission's presentation on a communication concerning the financial framework for enlargement. I imagine that further details will follow.
The Commission also presented horizontal documents on regional and agricultural policy.
These issues have already been dealt with in the Council.
They have been debated seriously and in depth. The Commission has now undertaken to present draft common positions during March if possible, or failing that, in early April, depending on the outcome of the discussions.
I have to say that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is favourably inclined towards these documents. We believe that they provide a fair and sound basis for negotiations.
Their content is reasonable, balanced, and in line with the acquis and the Berlin financial ceilings, as agreed at the Laeken Council.
We are now at a critical juncture. Consequently, we shall try to ensure that the possible attempts to reform common policies do not interfere or overlap with the enlargement negotiations, because if they do, enlargement will inevitably be delayed.
The Presidency is fully committed to discharging this responsibility successfully. Nonetheless, as I mentioned earlier, we are aware that these are the most complex and sensitive chapters of the negotiations.
We do not envisage opposition to reforming the main policies on expenditure. Rather, it is a case of stressing the importance of keeping to the agreed timetable, and therefore following a different course from that set for the enlargement negotiations.
In discharging its responsibility, the Presidency knows it can count on the good will of the Member States.
They are all aware of the significance of the task in hand.
We also trust we can rely on the Commission's support.
The Commission has presented the horizontal documents on regional policy, agriculture and the financial framework for enlargement. It has also canvassed the opinions of the Member States.
As I mentioned earlier, the next stage will come within a few days when the Commission presents to the Council draft common positions acceptable to the Member States and negotiable with the candidate countries. I have to say that the Commission is doing an excellent job.
The Commissioner responsible deserves particular recognition. He is present here today and I should like to take this opportunity to thank him for all he has done.
The Presidency also hopes it can rely on support from the candidate countries. They are making a great effort to adopt the acquis and implement it effectively, but they will also be called upon to make an effort to be realistic at the negotiating table.
A preliminary debate has already taken place in the Council in its various configurations: the General Affairs Council, the Agriculture Council and Ecofin, for instance. It has become clear that Member States have different points of view and sensitivities.
That is only to be expected.
Nonetheless, I am convinced that in the course of these discussions we shall arrive at consistent positions we all agree on. They should also be acceptable to the candidate countries because, ultimately, we need to come up with a solution amounting to a fair compromise between a whole range of demands.
In the first place, there is the political priority of enlargement.
Secondly, compliance with the rationale underpinning the negotiations, namely the transposition and effective implementation of the entire acquis.
This applies to everyone, and there is no scope for differentiated systems.
Furthermore, as I mentioned previously, it is essential to comply with the budgetary ceilings set in Berlin.
Lastly, it is important to take on board the reasonable expectations of the candidate countries and respond positively.
I am confident we will all work together to reach such agreement, overcoming the difficulties we are currently experiencing as a result of the sensitive nature of these chapters in the negotiations.
We intend to adopt common positions on these chapters with financial implications and try to provisionally close the chapters that could not be closed earlier because of the specific difficulties involved. In addition, we propose to set in train a range of measures designed to facilitate the process.
Firstly, the committee charged with drafting the Act of Accession and related instruments will begin work.
The committee is to start operations at once, cooperating closely with the candidate countries.
Furthermore, during these six months, the Commission will submit the action plan on compliance with the third criterion for enlargement. This is the so-called Madrid criterion regarding effective implementation of the acquis by each of the candidate countries, a crucially important issue at this stage in the negotiations.
This issue is on the agenda for the Seville European Council in June of this year.
During our Presidency we also aim to open all outstanding chapters with Bulgaria and if possible, with Romania too. Obviously this will only happen if the Commission and the two countries concerned supply the Council with the necessary information and comply with other requirements.
Bulgaria and Romania have certainly made a great effort to move forward. This was recognised at Laeken, and I am pleased to be able to commend them for it in the House as well.
It is important to continue sending out positive signals to these two countries regarding our commitment to their participation in the enlargement process. Hopefully this will come about very soon.
I should like to deal with Cyprus separately.
Reunification is not a precondition for accession, though clearly a solution to the current situation would make things very much easier.
Throughout its Presidency, Spain will fully support the United Nations' efforts to resolve the situation. It is to be hoped that the prospect of enlargement will be an incentive to put an end to the division of the island.
Lastly, further to the Laeken conclusions, the Spanish Presidency will press ahead with the pre-accession strategy for Turkey. The aim is to move to a new stage in Turkey's preparation for approximation to the acquis, taking into account the extent to which the country has complied with the Copenhagen political criteria, and with a view to setting new objectives in the accession process.
We have many important commitments and tasks to deal with during these six months in order to maintain the momentum of the negotiating process.
The ultimate aim is to ensure that we are in a position to conclude negotiations with those candidate countries that are genuinely ready by the Copenhagen European Council at the end of the year.
We are convinced of the importance of bringing the enlargement process to a successful conclusion.
It is morally necessary for Madrid, Barcelona, Berlin or Rome to be deemed as European as Prague, Budapest or Ljubljana. Furthermore, non-enlargement would have very serious implications both for the present Member States of the Union and for those prevented from joining it.
As Spain's Foreign Minister, I am delighted to inform you that eurobarometer's readings put my country at the top of the list of countries whose citizens are most in favour of enlargement. The Government of Spain is certainly fully behind the people on this.
The political situation in Member States where elections are due to take place shortly must not be allowed to affect the enlargement process. The latter must not be affected either by the tragic events of 11 September.
Our joint determination to attain the goals we set ourselves at Nice, Gothenburg and Laeken has to prevail.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish, on behalf of the Commission, to thank firstly you, Mr President, most warmly for your statement on the situation in the Middle East and to make it clear that the Commission endorses the whole of what you have said.
I believe that the present time requires us to demonstrate that all the political institutions of the European Union share common ground and a determination that the violence in the Middle East should come to an end and that common sense must be given a chance.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me now turn to the subject of our debate.
In terms of enlargement, 2002 will indeed be a most decisive year.
The European Councils in Gothenburg and Laeken, and Parliament's decisions on the subject, have given rise to such political momentum and created such a level of response that this process can now be delayed no longer.
Any delaying tactic would now have unmanageable and perilous consequences and could lead to the political and economic stability now achieved across the whole region between the Baltic and the Black Sea being jeopardised.
It is still, then, our objective to welcome all those candidate countries that are sufficiently prepared as new members before the 2004 European elections, and prospects for this are good.
Negotiations are progressing according to plan, and we are adhering fully to the timetable.
The Spanish Presidency's excellent cooperation gives me confidence that, under it, negotiations will be successfully completed on all the chapters - with the exception of the financial package and the 'institutions' chapter - with the ten countries that, at Laeken, were named as potential candidates for membership in 2004.
As envisaged in the road map, the Commission will, in the coming weeks, be submitting drafts of the common positions on the chapters on agriculture, regional policy, budgets and institutions.
Apart from that, we intend this year to open all the outstanding negotiating chapters with Bulgaria and Romania and to present a more developed and enhanced strategy to prepare these countries for accession.
I would now like to deal with a number of political issues which have, in recent weeks, and to some extent in recent days, shown themselves to be potentially problematic or possible obstacles.
I will start by referring to the discussions on the Bene? Decrees.
It is the Commission's view that this is not just a legal problem, but primarily a political and moral issue, a solution to which has for some years been sought by the Commission and by many others in many, many confidential discussions. The Commission takes the view that those Bene?
Decrees that refer to the expropriation of property conflict both with present-day Czech and European legislation, and are therefore obsolete and of no further effect.
It should therefore be our common endeavour to get back to objective reality on this issue and not have the process of enlargement laden down with issues that belong to the past.
An understanding has to be reached which will allow all the parties concerned to maintain stable and lasting relations with each other in a spirit of good neighbourliness and to shape Europe's future together.
The question that is significant in terms of coexistence within the European Union is whether Czech legal practice on the reconveyance of property results in discriminatory effects.
I have noted with satisfaction that the Czech government, for its part, is examining this question, and I also welcome Parliament's request for an independent opinion on the matter.
The Commission, too, is at present re-examining all the legal aspects of this issue.
I am already able, though, to tell you today that the Czech government has declared to the Commission its readiness to act and ask the Czech legislature to change the legal position if it should transpire that present legal practice cannot be reconciled with European law.
Another issue to which we have had to give closer attention this year has been that of the future of the Kaliningrad region.
On completion of Poland and Lithuania's accession processes, Kaliningrad will become a Russian enclave within the European Union.
The Russian government has raised a range of issues on the problems of access, cross-border travel and energy supply.
It is my belief that we have to consider these topics in the overall context of the development of the Baltic region as a whole.
Substantially more than just agreement on a transit order is at stake, and a great deal more than a solution to the question of visas.
As regards transit arrangements and the visa issue, we are seeking an arrangement within the framework of the existing Schengen acquis.
The Commission has already, over the past year, set out its thinking on the issues to be dealt with and emphasised its willingness to enter into dialogue.
Such discussions need now to be continued in a purposeful way within the framework of the existing EU/Russian bodies.
I would, though, like to make it clear that separate negotiations with Russia on the Kaliningrad issue cannot be carried on within the framework of the enlargement process.
We are unable to engage in negotiations on the rights of third parties and, above all, cannot come to any agreements to their detriment.
The decisive question will be how the Kaliningrad region can successfully be included in the dynamic of the Baltic region's development.
The real problem will be the growing socio-economic gulf between Poland and Lithuania on the one hand and the Kaliningrad region on the other, which will ensue if a way cannot be found to make possible Kaliningrad's involvement in the region's increasing economic dynamism.
We must reduce this gap if the spurt of growth that will result from enlargement is not to give rise to social and political tensions in this part of the Baltic region, for the real danger is of the development gap leading to potentially explosive social and political tensions.
Let me add to what has been said on the subject of Cyprus. Last week, I had the opportunity to hold a series of political discussions in Cyprus, notably with the leaders of the two communities, Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash.
I came home from Cyprus thoroughly encouraged, with the impression that both leaders of the negotiating teams in the ongoing face-to-face discussions on a possible resolution of the Cyprus question are striving in earnest and with determination and commitment towards a lasting political solution.
No breakthrough has as yet been achieved, and there are as yet no definite agreements, but I could see that convergence has been achieved to an extent that would have been considered impossible even only a short time ago.
So I want again to encourage both sides to pursue these discussions in a constructive fashion and make use of this window of opportunity to come to a sustainable and durable peace settlement in good time for the accession negotiations to be completed.
I derive particular satisfaction from the fact that both Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash assured me that it is still their objective to reach political agreement by June of this year.
The Commission remains in close contact with the United Nations in order to ensure that any political solution is compatible with the provisions of European law in force.
It is from our point of view crucial that Cyprus, being subject to international law, should be able to act at an international level, speaking with one voice in the institutions of the European Union and should be able to implement and enforce within its own territory the international undertakings that it enters into.
On 30 January, the Commission presented its proposals for a common financial framework for enlargement, our objective being to guarantee the coherence of the negotiations on agricultural policy, structural policy, and on the budget chapter.
Over and above that, we want enlargement to come about under conditions acceptable to all sides.
There must not be second-class membership, nor will there be.
Enlargement must, though, be on a sound financial footing and also manageable in the long term.
In preparing the common negotiating position in the coming weeks, the Commission will be guided by the following principles: Firstly, that the ground rules have been clear ever since the 1999 Berlin decision on Agenda 2000.
The Berlin global upper limits will not be exceeded even if we now accept up to ten new Member States, whereas the decisions taken in Berlin assumed six.
Secondly, the new Member States are, in principle, to participate in all common policy areas, in certain cases only after agreed transitional periods, although it should be noted that such transitional periods may be requested both by the candidate countries and also, in individual cases, by us.
Thirdly, the new Member States are not to be financially worse off after joining than they were before it.
It goes without saying that we cannot tolerate a situation in which those who will be our poorest members will, in the early years of their membership, be paying for their richer counterparts. It is, then, absolutely unacceptable that the new members should be in a net position from the very start.
Fourthly, our proposals are not under any circumstances to prejudice the form that Community policies may take in the future.
That also applies to agricultural policy.
The Commission's proposals do not, therefore, in any way prejudge the next financial perspective for the post-2006 period.
You will be aware that our package is, above all, one of structural aid, as it is in this area that there is the greatest need.
Perhaps I should just quote some figures.
Of the overall package alone, 76% is allocated to structural and cohesion measures and to measures in the rural development area.
Of the financial package as a whole, 76% will take the form of direct investments in the development of these countries.
It is only in the cohesion fund, but not in the structural fund, that we are proposing to increase resources, thus putting the emphasis on projects in the areas of the environment and transport infrastructure, where the need is greatest and in respect of which the candidate countries have, in the course of negotiations, entered into commitments which we must help them to meet.
The Commission considers it particularly necessary to emphasise the development of rural areas in order to actively promote structural measures in rural areas and make use of the opportunity for restructuring.
It is true that, in Berlin, no exact calculations were made as regards direct income aid for farmers in the period up to 2006, but I must point out that the Commission remarked at three points in the memoranda that accompanied Agenda 2000 that the acquis is a unity, that there cannot, in the long term, be two agricultural policy systems alongside each other and that direct aid forms part of the acquis.
We must, then deal with this issue at the negotiating table.
After accession, the new Member States will pay full contributions to the budget, whilst some of the structural and agricultural policy measures will become effective in budget terms only after a certain time delay.
As in previous enlargement rounds, the Commission will therefore provide for the facilitation in principle of lump-sum compensation in the budget.
Practical details of this can, of course, be decided only at the very end of the negotiations.
From the Commission's point of view, the package now on the table is balanced both in terms of policy and content.
The plan is still in place.
Negotiations are progressing at a brisk pace. The next stage is clearly mapped out.
Up until the European Council in Seville, the task in hand will be to work out a common EU negotiating position on agricultural policy, structural policy, on the budget chapter and on the institutional chapter, and the course taken so far by discussions in the Council leaves me confident that that will also be achieved.
In addition, the Commission will be presenting a report to the European Council in Seville on the realisation of the action plans to build up administrative capacity in the candidate countries.
At the end of October this year, the European Council, under the Danish Presidency, will consider the progress reports for 2002 and the Commission's actual recommendations, which will relate to the question of with which candidate countries negotiations may be formally concluded at the European Council in Copenhagen at the end of this year.
This can, at the same time, introduce the concluding phase of negotiations.
Continued close cooperation and Parliament's political support will be indispensable to reach a satisfactory conclusion.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group, that of the European People's Party/European Democrats, supports the general directions taken both by the President-in-Office of the Council and by Commissioner Verheugen.
In saying, at the end of his speech, that Parliament's support is indispensable, the Commissioner was expressing a truth.
We, too, hope that the whole process in which we find ourselves will lead to an outcome that will enable the Council, the Commission, and Parliament to declare themselves satisfied with it and to adopt what the negotiations have produced.
Like Commissioner Verheugen, the President-in-Office of the Council again put the emphasis on timing.
It was indeed our Group that proposed that the negotiations should be conducted in such a way that the first countries to join the EU should be able to take part in the 2004 European elections.
This makes it necessary that we should complete negotiations by the end of this year and by the beginning of 2003 at the latest.
I hope that this will be possible under the Danish Presidency, for the completion of the negotiations would complete the cycle that began when the Copenhagen criteria were laid down ten years ago.
It is also beautifully symbolic in a particular way that the Presidency at this important stage is held by Spain, a country of the South, thus focusing attention on the significance of the centre of Europe and expressing our common political intention that EU enlargement - which of course involves Cyprus and Malta, but mainly the central European states - should not be about the interests of a few Member States of the European Union, but about our common interest, that of all the Member States of the European Union.
There is of course still much work to be done, as we all know.
We should not now give any country a guarantee and tell them that they are in whatever happens; rather, every country must make the effort so that we can achieve satisfactory outcomes at the end of the day.
We know that many chapters still have to be negotiated on.
Whilst hoping for results on them, we also say - and, whilst not being an expert on agriculture myself, I do say this for my own part also - that our farmers have, in the European Union, Agenda 2000 to protect their legitimate expectations, and we see the mid-term review, to be presented by Commissioner Fischler, not as being about various things that actually have nothing to do with enlargement, but we want to safeguard our farmers' confidence as well.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, Kaliningrad has been mentioned, and, Mr Verheugen, I emphatically support what you said.
I recently spoke with the Mayor of Pillau, which is in the Western part of the Kaliningrad region, where there is very great interest in the possibility of direct contact with the Commission in Brussels and a concern that not everything should be done via Moscow, which is a long way away.
