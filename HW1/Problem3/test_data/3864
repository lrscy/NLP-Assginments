Mr Salafranca condemns abuses by left-wing and right-wing groups.
He is right to do so but we do not give any succour to the guerrillas, whose abuse of human rights we condemn, when we say that over 75% of human rights abuses are caused by the paramilitaries and the army.
This Plan Colombia is a plan for war not a plan for peace and tonight Europe rejects it completely.
Mr President, I would just like to endorse everything that Mr Howitt has said.
Plan Colombia is promoted as a means of combating of drug production and trafficking, but since drug eradication and crop spraying started six years ago, the actual coca plantations have almost trebled, which shows that this is not an effective method.
It does not work and it is also an ecological disaster.
Since the drug wars started in the 80s, violence has increased in a terrible way in Colombia.
Seventy-five to eighty per cent of the killings are committed by the paramilitary forces to protect big farmers and oil companies.
The Colombian Government pretends that it is trying to combat paramilitarianism but in fact it is turning a blind an eye to it.
It knows very well that there are clear links between the paramilitaries and the armed forces.
If military equipment is increased in accordance with what Plan Colombia is proposing, it will clearly reach the paramilitaries.
It will increase the massacres; it will increase the disappearances; it will increase the violations committed against ordinary innocent people.
Any plan which includes a military element is not a solution for Colombia.
It just exacerbates the situation.
Many Member States have a major problem with the military component and it is very cynical to say that we want to help the social area when clearly this plan is a military plan.
Mr President, the European Union is finally realising that there are serious social problems underlying the tragic situation in Columbia, specifically the need for the fair redistribution of wealth and land between the few who have everything and the many who have nothing.
Clinton and Pastrana's 'Plan Columbia' , which reinforces military structures for combating drug trafficking, has the effect of preserving this social imbalance, just as the paramilitaries, loyal allies of the Pastrana army and drug traffickers, preserve it.
It is no coincidence that Carlos CastaÃ±o is friendly with the government and is head of the drug traffickers and paramilitaries.
It is no coincidence, while the paramilitaries are murdering peasant farmers and political and democratic representatives, that, under the pretence of fighting drug trafficking, American spray planes are destroying the harvests with fumigation and forcing peasant farmers to leave their villages.
If the European Union genuinely believes in the provisions of its Treaties and its recent Charter on justice and human rights, it must support the social claims of the Colombian people and oppose 'Plan Columbia' , for it is a plan for war, not for peace.
Ladies and gentlemen of the European Union, if no genuine redistribution of land is carried out in Columbia, even European Union aid will end up lining the pockets of the drug traffickers, of the large land owners and multinationals.
This tragedy is about the redistribution of land and fair social justice.
Mr President, as many Members have said, speaking on 'Plan Columbia' , this United States military plan, the European Union must intervene autonomously and independently, pursuing a non-military strategy, promoting and safeguarding respect for human rights, humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms and, most importantly, doing something to improve the standard of living of the local communities.
On several occasions, including in recent months, we have drawn up resolutions on human rights in Columbia, resolutions adopted in this Chamber.
Well then, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this debate to condemn another incident: since 15 September 2000, three Italian citizens, engineers employed by a company which makes sweet-making machines, have been in the hands of the National Liberation Army. Together with these three Italian citizens, there are three other Europeans and thousands of Colombians.
Not only have they been held prisoner for four months, it has not been possible to communicate with them at all.
The Italian authorities are doing everything in their power but there is a certain unwillingness, even on the part of the Colombian Government, to undertake serious negotiations with the National Liberation Army in order to reach a solution.
Now, I feel that we must make human rights our priority, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the President of Parliament to send a letter to the Colombian authorities calling for respect for human rights and urging the government to make every endeavour to ensure, since it says that it is negotiating with the Liberation Army and the other forces, that any agreement reached will, without fail, include the immediate liberation of all the European and Colombian citizens - both Europeans and non-Europeans - who are deprived of their freedom and are prisoners of the militaries.
Mrs Ghilardotti, the Bureau takes note of your suggestion concerning the letter you wish the President of the European Parliament to send, and will inform her of your request.
Mr President, in my capacity as a Member of the European Parliament and Secretary-General of my party, Eusko Alkartasuna, and because of all it stands for in the Basque country, I want to support a peace process in Colombia.
I will not, however, support just any kind of peace process but only one based, in the words of one of the NGOs most closely involved in helping Colombia, on respect for human rights and aimed at genuine sustainable development and social justice for Colombia and the surrounding region.
Endorsing a programme as ill conceived as Plan Colombia will not resolve the conflicts, because it does not deal with their roots. Furthermore, it places us in the ridiculous position of having to draw on funds to cushion the effects of that very plan.
Aside from my serious misgivings about plans such as Plan Colombia, I am bound to point out that parties such as Spain' s Partido Popular and the Spanish Socialist Party are totally inconsistent in their attitude. They are putting forward an anti-terrorist approach here today, which is quite contrary to that required to reach a negotiated end to conflicts.
However, on the other side of the Atlantic they advocate precisely the opposite approach.
Our Spanish neighbours -or at least those who are seeking solutions in Colombia whilst denying them on European soil - certainly seem to be adopting the 'do as I say and not as I do' approach.
Mr President, the discussion we are having this evening in plenary is evocative of the hearing of the Committee on Development and Cooperation that took place back in September of last year.
There is widespread agreement as to the fact that Plan Colombia and these pronouncedly military components pose a threat to the peace negotiations now under way, and will engender an escalation of the conflict in Colombia after more than three decades of civil war, over 300 000 dead, and when we had hoped that it would be possible to engage in dialogue once President Pastrana took office, and resolve the country' s problems, i.e. the conflict.
The point has been made repeatedly today that the world drugs problem must be tackled at its roots.
Naturally I agree with this, but the problem of the conflict in Colombia must also be tackled at the roots, and Europe cannot afford to make the same mistakes as the USA, by believing that the drugs trade is at the root of the intensifying violence and conflict, and at the same time, closing its eyes to the unjust social system and difficult political system in Colombia.
Commissioner, Representative of the Council, last September, Parliament called upon the Union to develop an independent strategy for tackling the drugs problem.
A month later, in October, the Council declared that the Union supports the peace moves and also wants to attend the negotiations.
What we have heard you say today sounds very promising and I believe the Union must continue its work along these lines.
It is farcical to believe that we can resolve the conflict in Colombia by deploying military means in order to fight the drugs trade, whilst forgetting the social and political problems facing this country, and it is also a betrayal of the Colombian people, who have already waited so long for peace and stability in their country.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how many times has this Parliament condemned the murder and war taking place in Colombia?
How many resolutions have we adopted?
That is why I was delighted to hear the kind of statements the Council and the Commission made so eloquently today.
But anyone who believes that Plan Colombia - negotiated by the USA with Pastrana, Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra take note - represents another step in the direction of peace, ought to reflect once again on the fact that it will intensify the war and give succour to the military conflict in neighbouring regions, in other states.
I do not recall President Cardoso of Brazil consenting to this plan or greeting it with enthusiasm.
The role of the European Union here must be to continue to support the peace process and drive it forward, but also to encourage the government in Colombia to restore the rule of law, which is conspicuous by its absence.
There is no real separation of powers, there is corruption - we know all that is there - and it is not the task of the European Union - and I am very grateful to you for making this point - to add fuel to the fire, but rather to play a positive and committed role in this peace process.
That too is our mission.
Mr President, pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure and following the personal criticisms levelled against me, I should like to reply to the remarks made by Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler and Mr Howitt.
I think I made myself quite clear, even though I always make every effort to put my ideas forward as courteously as possible and with every consideration for my colleagues. I always try to refrain from personal criticism.
Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, I challenge you to tell me at which point in my speech I supported the military dimension of Plan Colombia. Please do so.
At no time have supported it and I wish to make it abundantly clear that I am totally opposed to it. Indeed, as Mrs Ferrer stated, my political group totally condemns this plan' s military dimension.
Mr Howitt, I maintain my belief and my statement that President Pastrana acted in the best of faith.
If you feel he acted in bad faith, you should have made that clear before Parliament' s plenary session.
I only need to respond to a few of the speeches.
To Mr Howitt I would say, referring to a press statement half a year ago, that the position of the Commission is the one I have stated tonight.
We have our own plan.
We have our own philosophy and we will cooperate with all parts of society in Colombia to strengthen the role of peace.
We do not need to relate to Plan Colombia.
What we are doing forms no part of it.
To Mrs Sauquillo I would clarify what the planning is on an indicative basis and how we hope be able to spend the EUR 105 million from the Commission: EUR 40 million to projects in the sphere of social and economic development and combating poverty.
This includes a series of decentralised initiatives in the areas of health, education, development of agricultural and traditional production, and coastal fishing.
EUR 30 million in support of alternative development, EUR 25 million in support of administrative and judicial reform and EUR 10 million in actions to support the promotion and defence of human rights.
Over and above this we are envisaging a level of around EUR 10 million per year, part of which we expect to be ECHO activities.
I mentioned the displaced persons whose numbers keep growing, so we have a clear commitment to continue ECHO' s presence there.
We are expecting to stay at the level we have been at in recent years as far as NGO cofinancing is concerned.
This has been at a level of EUR 2.4 million; it could be a little more or a little less.
We have activities amounting to EUR 1.3 million over recent years for programmes to protect the environment and tropical forests.
Many of these activities will be carried out in cooperation with or through different NGOs.
It is essential for us to do this if possible with Colombian NGOs and I will be asking European NGOs when they engage in these tasks to find partners in Colombia as in other cases and create partnerships.
This will in fact strengthen the message that we are trying to get across.
Some other activities aim to stimulate the government to do what we think is right: to concentrate more on poverty, to take more seriously the social aspects of these conflicts.
Here the government of Colombia is the partner we need in our attempts to shape a peaceful development there.
It is not just an issue of whether or not we are using NGOs.
This will depend very much on the subject and activity from case to case.
But the transformation and the strengthening of a peaceful civil society, which is part of the solution and an element in the solution, can only be stimulated by a stronger involvement of NGOs.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
I have received the following motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure:
B5-0087/2001 by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on Plan Colombia and support for the peace process in Colombia;
B5-0088/2001 by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra and Mrs Ferrer, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on support for the peace process in Colombia.
Mr President, I wish to ask for clarification on two points.
Firstly, is it in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and acceptable to submit an alternative motion for a resolution to a motion tabled by a committee?
This is an issue I wish to see clarified.
Secondly, I wish to ask whether this second motion for a resolution stands or whether it has been withdrawn.
I would like clear information on this matter.
Mr Miranda, according to the case law - forgive my use of the term - of this House, alternative motions to the motions tabled by a committee may be submitted.
This in no way contravenes our customs or practices and the political groups' rights of initiative remain inviolate; with regard to your second question, however, I am not in a position to give you an answer at the present time, but according to the information available to the Bureau, nothing has been withdrawn.
I should like to say in reply to Mr Miranda' s question that my political group is indeed considering withdrawing that proposal so as to be in a position to support the amended proposal by the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Thank you very much, Mr Salafranca, for that clarification.
Mr President, just for the record: it is my understanding that, after a careful process of negotiation between the PSE and the PPE, the PPE will be withdrawing their resolution.
If there is any change to that, this Parliament needs to be notified far in advance of tomorrow.
Secondly, to be absolutely clear and not to extend the debate, at no point did I suggest Mr Salafranca accused President Pastrana of bad faith.
But in his attempts to mute criticism of the Colombian Government, I think he thinks we think that President Pastrana has bad faith.
We are not suggesting that.
He has good faith, but his government has not delivered the goods.
Mr Howitt, I am not going to reopen the debate on this issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.45 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Rail transport
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
(A5-0013/2001) by Mr Jarzembowski, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/440/ECC on the development of the Community's railways [C5-0643/2000 - 1998/0265(COD)];
(A5-0014/2001) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings [C5-0644/2000 - 1998/0266(COD)] and on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity, the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification [C5-0645/2000 - 1998/0267(COD)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen - who I see are rather thin on the ground - following tough, but fair, negotiations between the French Council Presidency and representatives of the European Parliament, we, Parliament that is, managed, on the evening of 22 November, to make clear progress in the Conciliation Procedure on the three fundamental directives on railway liberalisation - namely those concerning the further development of the railways, the licensing of railway undertakings and the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity - such progress being towards the further opening-up of the railway sector.
I will summarise the progress made in three points, and I would like to welcome you Madam Vice-President.
We were able to get the Council' s agreement on three points.
Firstly, it was agreed that all railway undertakings should definitively be granted rights of access to the entire rail networks of all Member States for international freight transport, by 2008 at the latest.
In so doing, we ensured that from this point onwards, all Member States will be obliged not just to open the marked-out routes of the so-called new trans-European rail freight network, but also their network in its entirety, to the railway companies from the other EU States.
Secondly, the exemption clause - originally planned by Austria - which would have enabled Member States to evade the strict European requirements emanating from the respective national regulation authority, has been dropped.
As I see it, this means that across the EU, the national railway companies or their associated agencies will be the last ones to be entrusted with the licensing of railway undertakings, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity, or railway infrastructure charging, rather this will fall to agencies of a truly independent nature.
So these are the two crucial components: the opening-up of all networks for cross-border traffic and the establishment of an independent regulatory authority in all Member States, so as to guarantee fair competition.
Permit me just to say a few words about Mr Swoboda' s report. The third crucial component to be achieved in my view, is that we managed, by means of a new provision, to make a start on the long-term goal of applying the 'user pays principle' when it comes to the cost of railway infrastructure usage.
In this way, we have ensured that infrastructure charges can be raised in the long term with a view to cost-effectiveness, so that the construction, maintenance and also development is funded by the user, and not by the tax payer at the end of the day.
In other words, as I see it, we will still need, in the long run, to implement the separation of rail service operations from those of infrastructure management.
But in any event, we need the network to be maintained by the users.
That is why we must make it our long-term goal to cover costs through charges.
As I see it, in taking these three essential steps, we are already breaking down the national, fixed railway structures and creating new possibilities for competition between the railway undertakings.
Parliament has fought for this, in conjunction with the Commission.
The Commission was not exactly enthusiastic to begin with, but it fought alongside us in the end, in a bid to achieve this liberalisation, and I would therefore like to say a special thank you to the Vice-President for her cooperation in the Conciliation Procedure.
I believe that as a result, Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, has established the framework for an attractive railway sector, which will offer a wider range of customer-orientated, cross-border freight services in the future.
After all, what we want is to modernise the railway sector by means of competition, so that, ultimately, more freight is transferred from road to rail. This is because it is absolutely vital, on environmental protection grounds, to get freight off the roads and onto the railways over long distances.
Incidentally, the course taken by the Conciliation Procedure has again borne out the importance of the codecision procedure, and we have only had codecision rights in the transport sector since the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Without the codecision procedure we would not have managed to break down the Council' s position.
If you recall, the French President-in-Office of the Council had believed that following the first reading of the Council' s common position, all negotiations would come to an end, and we would have to accept the situation.
But no, a fair Conciliation Procedure enabled us to make progress and achieve a single market, at least for cross-border freight traffic, with effect from the year 2008 at the latest.
Permit me just to look ahead for a moment. It is simply not enough to only ever produce laws, directives and regulations, nor is it enough just to have them transposed into national law.
My group calls upon the existing railway undertakings - and I see one is represented up on the platform, for which I am grateful - to take the necessary precautions now, so that they are in a position to make use of the new provisions when the European law that we are now in the process of adopting has to be transposed in the year 2003.
Thus, for example, the Deutsche Bundesbahn, perhaps in conjunction with the Dutch national railways or other railways, should truly exploit the opportunity to make cross-border freight traffic a reality.
I believe this is where the traditional railways must really rise to the challenge of pushing through the opening-up of the market that we have created.
If, however, the traditional railways do not exploit the new opportunities presented by liberalisation, then many industrial enterprises will consider doing business directly with small railway companies, using European law.
They will be entitled to do so.
There are 180 licensed railway companies in Germany, and they are licensed to operate wherever they wish, even if they have only operated on a regional basis hitherto.
I therefore believe we should prevail upon all parties concerned, the railway companies and industry, to take the necessary precautionary measures without delay, and make use of the competition, so that more freight can be transferred from road to rail.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yes, it was a difficult birth, but in the end it was a successful birth.
As with any birth, there were people to assist.
Sometimes there are also people who get in the way, but in this case I should like to mention only those who assisted, in particular Commissioner de Palacio, who, as transport commissioner, was a very great help to us in finding a good solution.
I want to stress this in particular, in recognition of her outstanding work.
The French transport minister, too, who at first perhaps tried - unsuccessfully - to intimidate us a bit, in the end reached a very good compromise with us.
I should also like to thank Vice-President Imbeni in particular, who led the parliamentary delegation very circumspectly and very precisely, and also our committee Chairman, Mr Hatzidakis, who backed us in word and deed and showed confidence in the rapporteurs.
I am also saying it was a difficult birth because it took a long time, longer than it should have.
But since it is constantly being said that Parliament is so slow and hesitant and fast track or other procedures are required, I should like to point out that we had the first reading on 10 March 1999, but did not receive the common position until 13 April, over a year later, and that despite the urgency impressed on the committees by Mr Jarzembowski and myself.
But we then quickly dealt with the common position on 5 July and adopted the corresponding amendment that same day.
After that, the Council again took a relatively long time to make its comments.
I should like to stress that Parliament works quickly when it needs to, and especially when there is close cooperation as between myself and Mr Jarzembowski.
It is the Council that always has great difficulty in reaching a common position.
So what does this railway package contain?
I believe there are some very important steps, namely the specific steps it contains, but also the forward-looking stance that goes with them.
Firstly, what I would call a bespoke liberalisation, a liberalisation that is not untrammelled, that does not go beyond what sensible and reasonable experts think, but is purposeful.
I, too, Mr Jarzembowski and a few others, would have liked to have seen something more.
We could have been bolder.
Be that as it may, the first steps have been taken and they should be followed through, because I also believe that what we have in the text here can, should and, indeed, ought to be put into effect sooner than we have agreed, which for me is the minimum.
Secondly, regarding the cost structure.
It is true that, on the one hand, we said, for the short term - and following the Commission' s example - that only marginal costs could be asked for, in other words what an additional train costs on a particular route.
But in the long term the aim must be to cover costs completely.
Of course, this means covering costs not only on rail, but on the road as well.
Proper account must therefore also be taken of environmental costs, which - even if Mr Jarzembowski still does not quite believe it, he is already half convinced - are certainly appreciably higher for road than for rail.
Thirdly, we have not abolished the derogation for individual Member States.
It hurts, but we can live with it, and I think we shall get over it in time.
I shall, too, and I also thank you for your support in getting a particular principle introduced, or reintroduced, namely that, to a limited extent and where there is good reason for doing so, public services can have priority, of course not to hinder the most important part of traffic, namely commercial traffic, freight traffic, which is the most important since that is what we particularly want to shift from road to rail.
We have also managed to get the duration of the framework agreements for railways to use the infrastructure set such that the investments that railway undertakings make will really pay off and actually be made.
Overall, I believe it is a well-rounded package with good provisions.
You might say we can go home content tomorrow after the votes.
We have all played our part.
But not so.
Two things are most important.
Firstly, the Commissioner has helped us in as much as she has quite clearly stated that further steps will be proposed by the Commission.
As I said, I also hope that they will be bespoke and purposeful, which is very important.
The second point, which is also quite important, is that, as I have already mentioned, we must gradually arrive at a system for internalising external costs, i.e. they must be considered for road and rail side by side.
That will do away with some of the distortion that still persists, namely the unfair treatment of rail as compared to road.
Far-reaching changes will not be achieved over night.
So there is no need for hauliers to be afraid.
But the railways will and must gradually be given justice and with it, indirectly, the support that is in fact merely the creation of a situation that is fair.
But the question of labour law and working hours is also important.
Here, too, the treatment is unfair.
Here, too, the Commissioner has promised, and the Council has already decided in principle, to help us to put an end to the unfair undercutting of tariffs and prices in the Member States of the European Union - a particularly common practice by the Willi Betz company - in order to arrive at a fairer system in this particular field with regard to labour law and working hours, another area where the railways are disadvantaged compared to the legal and especially the actual circumstances on the roads.
Of course, there must be investment in the railways.
It is not enough to say OK we now have a fine system, but nobody invests.
This investment is necessary.
I say that especially because of the impending enlargement.
If enlargement means having a lot more heavy lorries on our roads, there will be opposition.
If enlargement means we get a transport system that is a little fairer and also friendlier to the environment, it will meet with greater acceptance.
That is how I understand the railway package that we are proposing today - that we get a transport system that is a little kinder to the environment and a little more just.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, since 1994, when I was elected to the European Parliament, I have heard many a debate on the frightful problems facing the European railways and I imagine that many such debates were also held before I was elected.
Despite the fact that we have known about the problem for years, I think that the compromise now being debated as a result of the conciliation between the European Parliament and the Council is perhaps the first major decisive step towards the creation of a proper new, unified rail transport network and towards much needed liberalisation - much needed in my view, Mr President, because this is how we can support the competitiveness of the European railways, which have been on the decline for years without our being able to do anything substantial about it.
Surely, everyone involved in this issue will want to give praise where praise is due, i.e. to the European Parliament and, of course, the Commission, for the simple reason that they have been urging the Council for years to take the action which it has, I think, now been forced to take - action which will certainly benefit European citizens, consumers, rail passengers and rail freight customers.
I remember that when a compromise was reached between the 15 ministers, the Helsinki Council felt that it had come to the end of the line as far as the liberalisation of the railways and the new institutional framework are concerned.
It is significant, I think, that Parliament, with the Commission's help, has managed to change Council's mind, giving us a far better compromise than the Helsinki compromise.
I do not intend to go into the details, because the two rapporteurs, who know the subject inside out and whom I should like to congratulate on the results of the compromise, have already done so; I should merely like to reiterate how important the clause on further liberalisation of rail transport is and to point out that, generally speaking, there will be no exemptions or derogations for the Member States - unless absolutely necessary because of the nature of the Member States or their position on the map.
I should like to close, Mr President, with a wish: that from now on the Council will operate with greater transparency, that it will talk to the rapporteurs early on, that it will attend European Parliament committees not simply to strengthen the role of the European Parliament but so that faster decisions can be taken, faster than the 16 kilometres an hour which is the present average speed of the railways.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating all those who made the agreement we are discussing this afternoon possible. Firstly the two rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda, then the French Presidency and finally the Commission, more particularly the Commissioner, who is present this afternoon.
She is to be congratulated amongst other reasons because, thanks to her presence on the Conciliation Committee, a number of significant factors were introduced allowing Parliament to emerge with the feeling of having won a specific victory, namely the document we are debating today, and not with the sense of having lost a battle over international passenger transport and national freight transport. Rather, it felt the decision had been postponed for strategic reasons.
I therefore feel we are enjoying a very positive and constructive atmosphere, in which we can tackle tasks such as that before us today.
Undoubtedly, the agreement represents a historic step forward in line with other developments we are currently involved in or are about to embark on and are going through Parliament, such as enlargement and the final introduction of the single currency.
Mr President, this decision does indeed open up the network, and as soon as it is opened, its management and rationalisation will be within our grasp.
We need not concern ourselves about the time-scale of events, because the logic of events will allow us to move forward.
That independent authority is important in the agreement. We are of course referring to the railways, attempting to promote them.
Mr Jarzembowski said that the objective was for the user to pay the cost.
True, that is the strategic objective, but at the moment we need to promote trains and therefore we should not rush things.
At the outset, we need to offer incentives for transporting freight by train. To date, trains have not proved a viable way of transporting freight.
Our freight trains travel 50% slower than trains in the United States and we have not yet been able to make a competitive offer.
We need to improve the freight network, and the companies themselves have to be competitive as regards overcoming the difficulties of rail transport.
Companies must be enabled to find a solution to sending their products from the company to the railway and once the destination is reached, from the railway to the company.
Unless this is achieved, we shall not move forward as we ought. We are all certainly aware that the proposals before us represent a net benefit to the environment.
We must therefore express our appreciation to all those who have made this agreement possible and congratulate Parliament on its unanimity.
Mr President, Commissioner, the compromise reached in the legislative consultation between Parliament and the Council on the development of rail transport is one of the most important results to have been achieved in the transport sector during the Finnish and French presidential terms.
I would like, on behalf of my group, to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda, for their reports on the railway package as well as the Conciliation Committee, for their excellent work, which can be considered to be a breakthrough in this important issue.
Our group is in favour of improved competitiveness in the railways and liberalisation.
The legislative consultation between Parliament and the Council resulted in a satisfactory package that meant the job of developing rail transport could be tackled with vigour.
The development of rail transport will remain on the agenda in the future, as the Commission is promising a second railway package to include further liberalisation and the aspect of safety.
I consider the safety aspects of railways, as with other forms of transport, to be particularly important.
The utilisation of the best technology that promotes safety, and its wider application, must become a key point of focus.
The development of rail transport is vital to solve the problems of traffic congestion.
It will ease the problem of both road and, furthermore, air traffic congestion.
At the same time, however, we have to ensure that the trans-European transport networks also extend to more sparsely populated and remote regions.
As has been stated here, environmental considerations also powerfully advocate the development of the railways.
In the future, we will have to carefully observe how this railways package will be implemented in practice, and there must be further liberalisation in the light of the experience we gain from that.
Special attention has to be paid to the coordination of different forms of transport as well as the overall functioning of the network.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, congratulations.
A great deal of work has been done, and as you know, the Group of the Greens holds the development of rail transport dear.
That applies to both public transport and freight.
Ultimately, we have had to take measures in order to stimulate the development of rail, railway licences and railway infrastructure by, among other things, opting for liberalisation in this case.
I would point out that we have a duty, in view of some forms of liberalisation elsewhere, jointly to keep monitoring safety and the social aspects which are related to liberalisation.
We are, to a certain extent, in favour of efficient transport, but we are mainly in favour of environmentally friendly transport.
I would like to make one critical comment, and that is that the environmental advantages of rail compared to road transport are dwindling fast.
This can be put down to one simple reason.
Parliament has taken decisions on the Euro I to V standards and limit values for a truck fleet which is rapidly being rejuvenated, and it is now up to us to quickly improve the emission limit value and the energy efficiency of rail transport. Otherwise, the advantage which we mentioned a moment ago will no longer apply.
Research has now provided adequate evidence of this.
Against this background, I believe that it is fair to say - we have asked questions and have received answers in this connection - that a great deal of fine-tuning is still required, and I would now like to see the sector make a political gesture.
We have taken the political decision, but we now want to see the sector send us a signal that it is about to launch into further development.
Mr President, my group is keen on removing unnecessary border restrictions in railway traffic.
Moreover, from the point of view of the environment, space occupation, safety and working conditions, we would like to see a great deal of freight, which is currently being transported by road, transferred to rail.
This removal can best be achieved by reaching sound agreements among the EU Member States.
This is why we consented to the agreements made by the Council in December 1999 at the end of the Finnish Presidency.
These agreements provided for through trans-national corridors and for sufficient exemption and transitional provisions in order to lift possible drawbacks in good time.
Unfortunately, the majority of Parliament believed that this arrangement was inadequate and that instead, liberalisation and privatisation should be brought more to the fore.
This opinion fits in with a fashion trend which has led to a neo-liberal stampede against public services, public companies and organised employees, especially in the sectors of postal services, rail and energy supply.
Those were companies that could prove to us that we can organise our economy in a more democratic, environmentally-friendly and less profit-orientated manner, but that are now being forced to attend to the pursuit of profit and competition.
Advocates of liberalisation consider rail as an awkward state monopoly with irritating and demanding trade unions.
But the alternative could lead to chaos and conflict of interests and to new monopolies without any democratic control.
Liberalisation could, of course, benefit private companies that can gain more freedom and more opportunities to tap into fresh income, but that does not guarantee a choice in favour of more environmentally-friendly modes of transport.
Considerable disadvantages could arise, on the other hand, within existing railway companies, for their staff and for the democratic decision-taking with regard to their future transport policy.
Consequently, in this case my group was more on the side of the Council than the majority of this Parliament.
Therefore, if it had been up to my group, this conciliation would not have taken place.
Despite this, I took part in it, taking the view that irreconcilable positions would block a positive outcome, and that it is also not a good idea for the Finnish compromise to be withdrawn.
Although I have voted against the direction previously opted for by Parliament on 22 November, I called on the parliamentary delegation to reach a compromise.
When that was achieved, I abstained from voting out of regard for this procedure, just as the majority of my group will do tomorrow at the final vote.
The outcome of this conciliation will lead to more liberalisation than we deem useful, but less than threatened to be the case initially.
Moreover, I fear that this conciliation package will soon be overtaken by liberalisation plans from the European Commission which go even further, and which my group will be unable to endorse.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, a radical reform of the railways was absolutely necessary, particularly in order to reverse the current trend which is, unfortunately, to do everything by road, with, consequently, a negative impact on rail freight services.
However, beyond this reality, which is certainly used as a pretext, the final proposals in this report go far beyond what we were hoping for.
The only major issue here, though, is not the three, five or seven years that it has taken to obtain this result.
For we still have one major concern and that is the desire that some people have expressed to liberalise the sector completely. This is unacceptable to us.
We should be cautious, as this liberalisation of the transport of goods will have an adverse effect on both local planning and social cohesion, particularly if the service provision no longer has any respect for the concept of a comprehensive rail network and the idea of providing a service for the population as a whole.
Moreover, an important, if not crucial, test for the continuation of the concept of public service will be the opening up of the passenger service market, which some see as part and parcel of the same process.
In short, will this total liberalisation of rail transport services have any consideration for the concept of public service, rather like the case of the postal service?
I fear not, as the principle of profitability will then automatically come to the fore, a principle directly opposed to that of public service.
Ladies and gentlemen, the same applies to the notion of safety.
Of course, the infrastructure must be safe and must be a matter for the authorities, but operators cannot achieve a lawless and fiercely competitive market without the risk of bottlenecks or a serious accident which would compromise everything that has been done.
To sum up, whilst we recognise the need for Europe-wide investment in order to give the rail industry the boost it needs, we are still extremely concerned about this incipient liberalisation.
We hope to see proper assessment made before implementing the next stages, as we are aware there are other options which can and must be explored.
Mr President, it is to 'railway speak' that we owe numerous figures of speech.
For example 'the train has departed' is what we say when we arrive late.
Unfortunately the same can be said of our train.
The package of three proposals for directives concerning the railway infrastructures, to which we will give our assent tomorrow, is long overdue.
The ultimate outcome of the lengthy negotiations within the Conciliation Committee, has in fact come ten years too late.
The statistics bear this out, I am sorry to say.
There has been a massive decline in the amount of freight transported by rail over the last few years, and there is every reason to believe that it will be very difficult to reverse the trend in the foreseeable future.
If we call to mind that we accomplished the single market for freight in 1970, and the internal market in 1992/1993, then since this is now the year 2001, we are clearly going to reach our destination late, added to which, our train is travelling on a go-slow stretch.
Setting a deadline of 2003 for the opening-up of the trans-European rail freight network certainly sounds reasonably committed, as does a deadline of 2008 for national freight traffic, but this is surely sending out the wrong signals.
When you consider that the question of committing eastern freight traffic to the rail has not even been properly addressed then clearly this is yet another area which will set us back.
There are other, better signals too, a green light as it were.
We must not overlook what has been achieved in the way of positive results.
Thus, for example, the creation of independent regulatory authorities does at least give the go-ahead for more competition, and we can only hope that the necessary reforms do not get stuck on the sidings.
The exemption provisions for certain Member States are, after a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing - and not including the small country of Luxembourg - only really for the benefit of the truly peripheral Member States, and at least the project for improving the railways and freight transport is up and running.
Interoperability is the next item on the agenda, and we are currently setting the points for more intermodality.
At some stage it will be all systems go for Europe' s rail passengers, and not just on Europe' s roads.
We must not lose hope and with that in mind I would like to say a big thank you to both rapporteurs and to the Commissioner, whose combined efforts have already been mentioned today and for which they have rightly been commended.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, there is talk in this Chamber of who the winners in this conciliation are.
In my view, it is the citizens of Europe who are the winners.
Once we have successfully implemented this conciliation, we shall also have opportunities to create a better environment in Europe, and in that way we are serving all citizens.
I see the environment as one important reason why we must get to grips with the issues relating to railways.
We know, of course, that road transport is increasing at the expense of rail transport and that it has been doing so for a long time.
We must reverse that trend.
It is also important that we should create opportunities for combining forms of transport so that it is possible, over long distances for example, to use both road and rail transport.
Another problem, of course, has been the high rail charges which have presented obstacles to more efficient railway traffic.
The railways' organisational structure is also at fault.
I think we have achieved a good conciliation we can rightly congratulate ourselves on, even if we might sometimes wish it could have gone further.
Where the marginal cost charges are concerned, I also think this is a good conciliation.
In this way, it will be possible even for long-distance operators to compete.
This is important in Europe, where distances are long.
The regulator, who is to be appointed under the terms of the conciliation and who is to oversee the system, is also an important factor because it is important to create confidence in the railways and in the solution we have now arrived at.
I think, then, that we have a good result and I want to thank everyone involved.
Finally, I hope that we can all make sure that it is turned into a reality.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the era of the railway in Europe is underway, and not before time.
It certainly is high time that we developed Europe' s railways properly and, more importantly, allocated resources to this task.
At last, we can be confident, we can meet the expectations of all citizens and believe that the shift from road to rail is underway.
The conciliation on what is called the 'railway package' will have allowed us to lay the foundation stone.
At the moment, we have to provide substantial investment for railways to meet our expectations and be recognised as the means of transport that produces the least pollution and helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
I shall continue to remind you of the worrying predictions made by scientists regarding the climate change that is, to a great extent, caused by road transport.
Glaciers are being melted at a faster rate than steel rails are hardening in the mould.
Although we welcome the decision made at the France-Italy Summit to build a new railway between Lyons and Turin, the European Union should be far bolder in its infrastructure plans.
In some cases, the question still arises as to whether it is better to build a new motorway rather than considering rail.
I am thinking specifically about the Moselle valley freight tunnel, the so-called 'A32' project.
The European Union must lead the way to ensure that rail becomes the preferred means of transport for all citizens as well as the natural and even the only means of transporting goods.
Mr President, Commissioner, what is positive about this compromise is that obstacles to cross-border freight traffic will be dismantled in the foreseeable future, which definitely improves our chances of being able to transfer freight from the roads to the railways.
Our guiding principle must be to create a truly level playing field on the competition front, through harmonisation and by taking comparable cost components into account.
But then there is more to competition than a debate about lowest costs and highest profits, it is also about striving for sustainability, social competence, user-friendliness, quality and service.
Why should a private-sector supplier be a priori any better at this than one under public ownership?
We have a duty to explain what we understand by general public services, and whether we think they can be provided more effectively by publicly owned operators than private operators, or less so.
I believe that having equal conditions of access for all will not prove profitable in every case.
Private companies must make a profit or else face their demise.
Publicly owned companies can, in fact, sustain losses in areas where this is necessary for social reasons, on account of their redistribution potential.
It will not do for the profits to be absorbed by the private sector and the losses to be borne by society.
What we need is for the public and private suppliers of services in a European internal market to adopt an approach that is in the interests of the common good.
This will require uniform framework conditions.
Experience will show whether the nascent liberalisation of the European railways will mean better services for rail users.
Certain Member States have already implemented more far-reaching liberalisation measures, with very mixed results.
Germany - I am sorry to have to say this gentlemen from the Deutsche Bundesbahn - is a prime example of how not to go about it.
Stretches of track have been shut down en masse at regional level, there have been railway station closures, ever-increasing cycle times, repair workshop closures, and drastic cuts in staffing levels.
This has nothing to do with competing for services to the general public.
Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in common with the vast majority of Members of this House, I too believe that the outcome of the Conciliation Procedure on the reports concerning the railway package has enabled us to take a big step towards opening up the market in international freight transport.
The reports by Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski set the right tone.
The separation of rail service operations from those of infrastructure management is pre-requisite to the liberalisation of the European railways.
I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all concerned for the difficult, but ultimately productive, work undertaken within the Conciliation Committee.
As is apparent from all the other areas that have already undergone liberalisation, competition has a positive effect on the area concerned.
In freight transport, the advantages are tangible and plain for all to see.
If the European railways can improve their competitive position vis-Ã -vis other modes of transport, especially road transport, this will have a positive impact on the environment and will also help solve the serious problems attending road transport.
In order to achieve these goals, and in fact this is logical, competition must not stop at respective national borders.
It must be able to flourish on a Community-wide basis.
Only in this way will the railways become a real alternative.
Parliament has scored a major success in achieving this goal, all be it with transitional periods.
The same conditions must apply to passenger transport as apply to freight transport.
The problems emanating from the other modes of transport - road transport for example - are not just caused by heavy goods vehicles, but also by passenger transport, of course.
The railway will only be able to win back shares in the transport market if it becomes a viable alternative, and what that means these days is an international outlook, quality of service and customer orientation.
If the railway sets itself this major challenge, it has everything to gain, and all of us with it.
Mr President, Commissioner, if we truly want to improve the environment and allow railways to take the pressure off our over-congested European roads, I believe we should pursue three objectives. Firstly, those responsible for managing the infrastructure and charged with ensuring good use of the latter must be completely separate from and independent of service operators and users.
Secondly, the railways must be integrated with other forms of transport to achieve a genuine door to door service.
Thirdly, just as there are toll-free motorways so certain sections of the railway track must be free of charge.
The cost of transporting a tonne of goods should not be prohibitive. Furthermore, if we really want to change the present situation, free up our roads and achieve genuine environmental improvements, the cost has to favour the railway.
Mr President, all of us here are aware that rail transport plays an important role in the proper development of human activities, protection of the environment and sustainable local planning.
That is why I believe that we cannot be satisfied with the results of the conciliation between the European Parliament and the Council.
This compromise perpetuates the race to open up the markets and introduce competition in rail transport services, for goods and passengers alike, in order to satisfy the economic rationale of profitability, instead of meeting the requirements of the users and employees in this sector.
The report approves the plan to liberalise rail transport, and, more particularly, the plan to make infrastructure managers independent of the State.
If this is adopted, there is a risk that rail safety will be jeopardised.
However, there could have been other options.
Even if historical and national differences exist, coordination of public rail transport services on a European level is not an insurmountable obstacle.
Besides, that is what rail workers are calling for.
We must move towards establishing public Europe-wide services within the framework of a common policy...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Mr Jarzembowski observes in his explanatory statement that we have to strengthen rail transport, to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of railways in order to reverse the downward trend of their share in the market in the last 15 years.
He observes that little progress has been made by the Member States in implementing the separation of the rail service operations from those of infrastructure management and we do not see in most countries any effective opening-up of the rail market.
In the United Kingdom considerable credit could well be paid to the former Conservative government for effecting just that, a policy which has been continued by the current Labour government.
However, last October the Hatfield train crash took place in Hertfordshire, part of the eastern region which I represent in this Parliament.
Four people lost their lives and many were seriously injured.
The accident took place on a bend with the train travelling at 115 mph. It appears that the infrastructure authorities were aware of the fracturing of the rail as early as November 1999 and a further report was made in January of last year.
No remedial action was taken.
The British transport minister, Lord McDonald, has announced there will be no be no public inquiry.
However, named members of Railtrack, the infrastructure company, and of Balfour Beatty possibly face manslaughter charges as a result of this accident.
I turn to the Commissioner, who I am sure is aware of the details of this particular accident, which I would point out is not unique within the European Union, and I would hope that she would be able perhaps to dwell on the consequences of the crash.
In the United Kingdom there has been chaos on our railways, there has been plummeting customer confidence in the rail system, remedial work has caused huge financial investment and Railtrack has threatened a delay in work on the Euro Channel Tunnel Phase II programme which is very much part of the integrated European rail system that we all support.
I very much hope that the Commissioner may be able to give some support to the relevant authorities in the United Kingdom.
This is not merely a domestic issue.
It has European ramifications as far as the Channel Tunnel work is concerned.
It may well be that additional support can be given through the TENs programme and I look forward to my discussions with the Commissioner on this extremely serious development.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to express my satisfaction with the final outcome of the conciliation, along with all or almost all those who have already spoken.
It has to be made abundantly clear that this initiative is aimed at saving the rail network, modernising it and adapting it to the new state of affairs. We are hoping that at the dawn of the twenty-first century rail will once again become what it was at the start of the twentieth: a reliable, efficient, fast and - for those times - safe form of transport, stimulating development, and indeed offering guarantees of wealth and territorial balance.
I believe we took a significant step in that direction on 22 November last year.
The decisions we are to adopt today aim to improve the quality of the service.
Contrary to the views expressed by some honourable Members, I believe that the problem with rail transport nowadays is not whether it should be public or private, although it is generally public.
The problem is that it does not work.
Let us be clear about this.
There would certainly be scope for discussing some of the measures put forward here if we were dealing with a rail network which worked.
The trouble is that given the current situation, where a public service is guaranteed by public undertakings with a monopoly in the area of the Member States of the Union, it does not work. It simply does not work in the present situation of compartmentalised and divided national rail networks.
What we are seeking to do is in fact to effect a change - I would go so far as to say a revolutionary change - where the railways are concerned.
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have achieved today through this debate and what I hope we will achieve tomorrow - I have no doubt that you will vote for the agreed text - is not simply opening up the network, but setting up something new and different.
We are setting up a European rail network which does not yet exist, to replace 15 national juxtaposed networks.
It is a revolutionary change, and we need to be aware of what we are seeking to achieve.
Some people have complained that we spent too much time on this, others that we rushed things.
I would like to say that we might well all have liked to move forward faster. However, it is fair to say that in the short time - just over a year - since I took over responsibility for this area, determined progress has been made and the whole process has accelerated.
Furthermore, the codecision procedure has worked very well. In particular, I would like to thank the whole Parliament for the work undertaken, especially by Mr Imbeni and the rapporteurs, Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski.
Nevertheless, I should also like to thank the Finnish Presidency for its contribution at the time, and particular thanks are due to the French Presidency. In that case, the French transport minster was a knowledgeable railway enthusiast.
It was suggested that this would make it harder for us to achieve our aim. On the contrary, it helped us to reach the point we find ourselves at today.
Concerns have been expressed regarding enlargement. Clearly, this will result in the European rail network we are currently setting up being extended beyond the current borders of the Union as they are redrawn.
The key components are opening up the whole network and separating functions, as Mr Jarzembowski has rightly pointed out. However, there is also the crucial and decisive issue of levies.
Many of you, ladies and gentlemen, have raised this issue.
The White Paper will cover the matter of non-discriminatory levies for infrastructure.
In this regard, the conclusions of the Costa report are to be included in the White Paper, and I am grateful to Parliament for this.
I should add that in addition to discussing what has already been achieved and will be completed today and tomorrow, we are going to deal with road transport and the action we need to take for the future.
I must reassure Mr Swoboda that the measures he referred to, aimed at achieving fair competition within road transport and between road transport and other types of transport have already been put forward or are about to be.
In addition, this year we intend to present the directive on rail safety some members of Parliament were concerned about.
I trust I can rely on your support regarding the adoption of the directive on interoperability.
Furthermore, we plan to draw up a communication opening up national freight transport and international passenger transport to the market, as I stated when both of these directives were being processed.
The communication should even be ready before the end of the year. However, in addition to this communication we plan to present a new directive, amending 91/440/EEC, to open up access to the national freight network and international passenger transport.
Furthermore, there will be an amendment to Directive 96/48/EC concerning the interoperability of the European high-speed railway system.
As I said earlier, we will present a second rail transport package before the end of the year, and I hope it will be processed quickly.
Safety is a key factor, as is environmental improvement - both affect the citizens directly. Nonetheless, I should like to share with you some final thoughts on some of the issues that have been raised here.
There has been talk of privatisation, because liberalisation is to take place. It has been said that public services will not be guaranteed.
We must not confuse the issue, ladies and gentlemen.
What we are concerned with today is opening up a trans-European network and a trans-European railway to competition, and ensuring that properly licensed European operators may be either public or private.
Furthermore, nobody is talking about privatisation of any sort.
There is no question of privatising the operators and especially not the infrastructure.
On the contrary, investment in the infrastructure will be called for.
The situation is that in some countries not a single euro has been invested in infrastructure over the last thirty years.
Safety provisions will require that conditions be such that safety can be guaranteed. This applies not only to the rolling stock but also to the fixed infrastructure.
To reiterate my previous remarks, public service is not, unfortunately, properly assured at present, which is exactly why we are striving to improve it.
A moment ago Mr Ortuondo Larrea said that two other issues had to be dealt with: intermodal transport and balancing other forms of transport with road transport.
This very morning I read a press note from one of the employers in the road haulage sector. It complained about the White Paper, regretting that it was too rail-orientated.
This kind of thing is always happening.
The situation we have to cope with is abundantly clear: a 40% increase in demand for freight transport in the next ten years. Not all of that 40% should go to the roads.
It has to be absorbed by forms of transport other than the roads. We must go on assuring growth, quality of life, employment and the welfare of the citizens of the European Union.
This can be achieved through specific measures of this nature.
It will, of course, have to be complemented by a joint study of the various forms of transport, of competition amongst them, intermodality, interlinking, and interoperation. The end result will be a more efficient system which will benefit our economy and our citizens.
Trade relations with certain industrialised countries
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0004/2001) by Mrs Erika Mann, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning "the implementation of projects promoting cooperation and commercial relations between the EU and the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia" [COM(2000) 381 - C5-0455/2000 - 2000/0165(CNS)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner and Members of the Commission, at this late hour, I would like to use the speaking time available to me to give you a brief introduction to the Commission proposal for a Council regulation concerning the implementation of projects promoting cooperation and commercial relations between the EU and the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia, together with my report on it.
Apart from the rather misleading formulation of the title, which mentions the industrialised countries and which does not of course include all the industrialised countries in the world, but only those with which we do not have any free-trade areas, cooperation or partnership agreements, I would expressly like to thank the Commission for its proposal for a regulation.
As I see it, this is not the only area where it has done some splendid work, bearing in mind all the difficult political debates on this issue that have taken place in the Council, and also the cooperation with the European Parliament, which has perhaps not always been easy, no, it has done something else rather wonderful in that is has actually brought the many and varied, small-scale existing projects and programmes to be found in the aforementioned countries together in a single budget line, thereby creating a legal basis as well.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a heartfelt thank you to the Commission for the excellent cooperation we have had.
The Commission proposal for a Council regulation under consideration seeks to create a solid legal and budgetary framework to underpin actions taken under the various bilateral agreements signed between the EU and the six industrialised countries mentioned.
These actions are currently financed from a number of different budget lines and some have to be undertaken as pilot schemes or preparatory actions due to the absence of a legal basis for the budget lines in question.
In producing this proposal for a regulation, the Commission has now created a legal basis.
In drafting the proposal, the Commission aimed to ensure that Member States retain the primary responsibility for export promotion.
Community action is thus restricted to measures that complement the endeavours of the Member States and other EU public bodies, and - as we always put it so nicely - thereby create European added value.
The proposal provides for regular reports to be made in future to the European Parliament and the Council.
We have amended it slightly in several places and we have also inserted the stipulation that the regulation is to expire at the end of December 2005.
In addition, I have tabled an amendment which I hope the Commission and Council will support, requesting the Commission to submit a new proposal as early as the year 2003, in which it might like to outline the overall framework for a new trade policy and philosophy.
This would also solve the dilemma that we are still facing, namely the fact that we have no positive definition of trade policy whatsoever in our Treaty. Instead we only define it in a negative way by excluding what it does not cover.
I would be grateful if the Commission could use this positive definition in future.
I believe the post-Nice Process lends itself extremely well to this, and in this connection I would also ask the Commission to always keep in mind that Parliament is not happy with the current wording of Article 133.
This should come as no surprise to you, Commissioner Patten, rather I assume that, naturally, you are familiar with Parliament' s view of the matter.
Incidentally, I would also be grateful if you would include your position in this new wording, i.e. your position in relation to one of the countries, namely the United States, which you have now set out - indeed you have provided a very comprehensive overview of our relations with the United States.
I would also like the ruminations that are currently taking place within the Commission, especially on the part of Commissioner Lamy - who would like a policy statement to be produced in the sphere of trade policy at some stage - to be included in a review in the year 2003.
The projects, which are now to be financed in concrete terms under this budget line, encompass cooperation projects, business-related training programmes and programmes for promoting trade relations.
These include the above-mentioned programmes concerning the United States, and especially those set up with Japan.
On a final note, I would like to say another big thank you for all the experimental projects you have tested out in relation to the various countries.
It would be beneficial if you could draw conclusions from this, and summarise what you think could be passed on to programmes with other countries, what, in your opinion, may not have proved as successful or what you think does not stand a chance of surviving the post-2005 period.
If you carry out this review, then as I see it, we will have an excellent foundation on which to base a real trade policy and philosophy.
In the light of globalisation and the next world trade round, you will then have established an excellent basis to my mind.
Once again, I would like to thank you warmly for this.
Mr President, a number of existing budget lines have proved useful when financing Community action involving cooperation and trade relations within the framework of the various bilateral agreements signed by the European Union and industrialised third countries.
Nevertheless, the ever-increasing challenges faced by European companies call for a more clearly defined legal framework and for a single budget line. It would then be possible to develop these operations in a more coherent and coordinated manner and bring added value to the activities undertaken by the Member States.
The regulation put forward by the Commission is therefore very timely, and Mrs Mann' s excellent report is even more so. On behalf of my group I would like to congratulate Mrs Mann on her work, thanks to which, the Commission' s proposal is now much more coherent and effective.
My group also tabled a number of amendments to this proposal.
These were aimed chiefly at making decision-making processes more transparent by involving the European Parliament in the programming and definition of the various subprogrammes to be undertaken in the partner countries. Our amendments were also intended to ensure greater transparency for the activities of those involved, both the European Union and the associated countries, in connection with programmes involving cooperation and commercial relations.
In particular, my group has requested the Commission to submit the relevant documentation after decisions have been taken concerning definition of the nature of the objectives of the various programmes and the timetable for invitations to tender. As we see it, this is the only way to improve efficiency and access to these programmes by European citizens and companies.
Lastly, I should like to refer with regret to the fact that Parliament was unable to adopt this report - the Mann report - at last December' s part-session. Had the report been adopted the programme could have entered into force quickly, as planned.
Let us hope that it will, nevertheless, serve its purpose.
Mr President, it is sometimes easier to offer congratulations at such a late hour, but when you have a report like this in your hand, you could offer them at any time of day.
I think Mrs Mann has produced an absolutely outstanding piece of work.
I would like to focus once more on two particular points.
One is the issue of transparency and the other is the problem of a trade doctrine which still endures.
On the matter of transparency, I would urge the Commission, in particular, to throw its weight behind Amendments Nos 9 to 11.
I think that is precisely the line we should be taking, in other words, not only should Parliament be kept duly informed, but since so much has been made of transparency under the European transparency initiative, a fully comprehensive array of documents should also be made available on the Internet, so that they can be called up any time, and can, in their turn, help enhance the credibility of what we all stand for, namely the development of a new Europe.
What is extremely interesting - and you certainly cannot say that of every report - is the justification part that has been appended.
This brings me to the second issue, that of the fundamental organisation of trade policy.
It certainly has not become any easier to get the message across that what trade means to us, when it is properly organised, is increased prosperity, worldwide I might add.
After Seattle and Davos, we have grown increasingly aware that we are dealing with irrational opponents of globalisation.
It is all a matter of having the right rules.
What it comes down to is fine-tuning, and to some extent, to information too.
If only all those who do not have a good word to say about globalisation could recognise, for example, how strong Europe has already become in the sphere of foreign direct investments, as is evident from this report, or indeed in all kinds of other areas.
What we need to do is set about convincing them.
It is to be hoped that the Commission, in particular, will quickly get to grips with these fundamental issues, so that we can submit corresponding programmes setting out the basic principles, well in advance of 2005 and use them to win the public over.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Mann for her work, but she has managed to make a totally technical report out of what is a rather political issue.
In fact, the question of trade and trade relations between the EU and the industrialised countries, particularly the US, is a very hot topic.
So it is a pity that she missed the opportunity to address it in a more political way.
However, the proposal to establish a single budget line could simplify the work of the European Parliament as a whole and increase transparency.
I do not therefore have a problem with her technical proposals nor indeed the Commission' s proposals.
It is a pity, however, that we failed to discuss whether we needed more export promotion and, if so, what for, and to go into this whole question in more detail.
Instead she used the opportunity to expound a rather theoretical framework on trade which is her own rather than anyone else' s.
She also failed to deal with issues such as coherency with development issues and the very strong trade complex that we had.
But once again simplifying the work of Parliament and the Commission is to be welcomed and therefore we will not be opposing this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise in my capacity as Vice-President of the Japan delegation and welcome the new draft regulation, which at last creates a fundamental legal basis, all be it one which will initially only run to the year 2005, for the projects on promoting cooperation and trade relations.
Firstly, I would like to echo Mrs Mann' s commendation of the Commissioner for the excellent cooperation we have had, but I would especially like to join the group of delegates present here today in praising your work, Mrs Mann, because it was no easy task and I know it has been a tripartite business, involving the Commission, the Member States and Parliament.
We must try to find a reasonable basis, because we will only make progress in this matter if we work together.
I believe that we have, in this new draft regulation, a solid basis for a political and economic debate with the industrialised states.
That is why I do not want to restrict it to trade alone.
I believe it is important to achieve a closer association with the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia, and to step up our exchange activities.
This is necessary if we are to press home to people again- including MEPs - the significance of Asia.
I believe there are still some marked differences in this respect.
There are some excellent programmes when it comes to Japan.
I believe the Executive Training Programme in Japan is exemplary and could be adopted elsewhere, indeed there is now a similar project in Korea which is in its pilot phase.
The Gateway to Japan project is also outstanding as a trade promotion project.
Other industrialised countries could emulate it.
Conversely, I believe we delegates should consider taking our example from the relations between the legislative bodies, the American Congress for example, and Asia, because contact between the European Parliament and Asia is not firmly established enough yet.
I therefore believe we should seize on this example, in a bid to build closer relations between the two houses of the Japanese parliament and the European Parliament, and just as the Americans do, working from a legal basis, so should we use the same opportunities with regard to Asia.
Permit me to close with a brief remark. Even though we have adopted this kind of division of responsibility, partly for reasons of experience, on account of the different legal basis, we should be aware, nonetheless, that we have very different styles of working.
Take for example my area, Asia, which keeps me extremely busy.
I believe we should underpin the ASEM Process much more firmly in political and parliamentary terms.
One thing we must be sure to do is hold a conference for parliamentarians before the next ASEM meeting.
So regardless as to what the legal situation is, Europe and Asia must grow closer together.
Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Mann on her carefully prepared work and have great pleasure in supporting it.
The importance, as Mrs Mann has emphasised and the Commission proposed, of a single budget line, is not just about simplifying Parliament' s work.
It is so that we can properly evaluate and vote on what money we are spending on which projects so that the Commission and Parliament can jointly consider what is best value for money and how we need to spend money in the future.
The emphasis Mrs Mann has given to the importance of clarity about the division of responsibility between the Community and the Member States in the field of export promotion is also crucial.
There is some sensitivity about this and clarity about the budget line and the legal base are not only going to help us to do our work in a more logical way but also reassure the Member States that there is a proper allocation of responsibilities.
I want to comment very briefly on two other matters.
I was very pleased as President of the delegation between this Parliament and the US Congress that the transatlantic legislators' dialogue merited a mention in the budget report.
You know, colleagues, how much emphasis this Parliament has put on the TLD.
And Mrs Mann' s report mentioned, among the many other excellent projects, the European Institute in Washington supported by the Commission.
It is just one example, but an excellent one, of how cooperation, not only financial but political, industrial and commercial, can pay very considerable dividends.
I am delighted to support Mrs Mann and as I am finishing my speech with one second to spare, I hope I will receive a bit of applause for that.
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, I too this time must depart from my usual custom and praise my colleague, Mrs Mann, for she certainly deserves it.
In these eighteen months I have been a Member of the European Parliament, I have become familiar with the fact that Mrs Mann is well versed in a number of areas and particularly transatlantic relations; and this report is an indication of that also.
I disagree with Mrs Ahern, who seems to have left the Chamber already, that the report is not sufficiently political.
There are actually very political elements contained, for example, in the explanatory statement, which I, at least, enjoyed reading.
Of course, the tone is not one of party politics.
I warmly support the targeted programme of measures to make the general commercial policy of the EU and its Member States more effective.
Closer cooperation might even be regarded as an inevitability when we take into account the amendments made at Nice to Article 133 and those many speeches which were made during the night at Nice in favour of a solution that would also go much further.
I agree with the rapporteur, too, that the post-Nice agenda should include finding a new approach to the EU' s commercial policy.
The rapporteur' s opinion on the processes of globalisation is also to be supported, and especially her opinion regarding a closer common competition policy, which concerns my own committee in particular - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The deadline set for the Commission to submit proposals to Parliament must also receive our support, as too should the use of the 'sunset' clause in this regulation.
These dates set should not, however, mean that the Commission should not have an ongoing obligation to keep Parliament up to date on the progress of the action programme.
Of all the actions covered by the proposal I would in particular like to emphasise the importance of cooperation projects with the United States of America.
For example, TABD, the TransAtlantic Business Dialogue, has, as far as I can see, worked well and succeeded in preventing trade disputes and bringing about coordinated views in areas requiring a swift reaction.
A good example is the Istanbul World Radio Conference last spring.
Transatlantic trade is still the thread of life as far as the global economy is concerned, and the importance of cooperation in this area must not be underrated.
We have to remember that there is also a strongly political element connected with this cooperation, the basis for which was created in 1995 with the signing of the New Transatlantic Agenda.
Furthermore, Parliament wants to be involved in this work and has therefore attempted to seal its relationship with the US Congress in the spirit of the transatlantic dialogue that my colleague, Mrs Read, also mentioned earlier.
Mr President, I have taken part earlier in the day in two debates on the Middle East and the Mediterranean and now we move on to slightly easier terrain, perhaps, but a very important subject indeed.
Let me begin first by thanking Parliament for the support that it has given to this Commission proposal, firstly by allocating a budget for the implementation of this regulation in line with the Commission' s request for 2001 of EUR 15.6 million.
We are extremely grateful to Parliament for that.
Secondly, I would like to thank Parliament for adopting unanimously, as I hope it will, the favourable report from the rapporteur, Ms Mann.
I take this is as a strong token of Parliament' s broad endorsement of the Commission' s proposal regarding the industrialised countries.
At this stage may I express our warm gratitude to Ms Mann, and indeed to her colleague Ms Read, for their consistent, constructive support for the development of our transatlantic relationship.
Since I am visiting the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia during the course of the next three months, I am very pleased that we have made this progress this evening.
Our relations with the industrialised countries have significantly deepened, and indeed broadened, in recent years.
We are moving away from a narrow focus on trade to comprehensive relationships encompassing everything from the Common Foreign and Security Policy, justice and home affairs, education and culture, environmental issues, science and research and, which I regard as particularly important, people-to-people exchanges.
In the case of the United States and Canada, these comprehensive relationships are already a reality, while other partners like Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and Australia are keen to develop similar relationships.
The cornerstones of these relationships are the common values and the similar interests that we share.
So while we see on the one hand an increasing demand for closer cooperation with some of our most important partners, on the other, we have lacked the legal framework to be able to follow things up.
Indeed, we currently only have legal bases for actions with Canada and Japan.
The latter is limited to market access activities and it expires at the end of this year.
For the United States, we do not have a legal basis at all, compelling us to implement projects under the new transatlantic agenda as pilot projects or preparatory actions which do not require a legal base but which are limited in time to either two or three years.
The Commission proposal under discussion aims to resolve this situation by establishing a solid and common legal base which can underpin our relations with the industrialised countries.
A common legal base is appropriate since our relations with all these countries are based on common values and shared interests.
It is also appropriate because it would enable the Commission to develop similar programmes to the extent possible with all or some of these countries.
In addition, if linked to a single budget line as we have proposed, we would have clear administrative advantages.
We would greatly improve efficiency by aiming for economies of scale and create optimal flexibility.
Improved budget transparency both for Parliament, and I must say for the Council, would also be achieved.
Finally, a common legal base linked to a single budget line is in line with the Commission' s policy of limiting the number of small legal bases and budget lines.
I would like to emphasise the importance the Commission attaches to this proposal.
The benefits of a common, legal and budgetary framework to support our relationships with the industrialised countries are clear.
I am confident that our first report to Parliament on the results of the implementation of this regulation which we present in a couple of years' time will prove that to Parliament' s satisfaction.
Let me turn to the 14 amendments adopted by Parliament.
I am delighted to say that the Commission can accept 11 of them.
Ms Mann and Mr Ferrer, referred in particular to Amendment No 5.
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 refer to the division of responsibility between the Community and Member States on market access and export promotion.
Ms Read pointed out that the Member States are very sensitive to this issue.
Accepting these two amendments would result in a substantial shift away from Member States, well beyond what we agreed for the Japan market access regulation a few years ago.
Although I am not afraid of having occasional disagreements with the Council, I would advise against the adoption of these two amendments.
Amendment No 14 of the Budget Committee would be a derogation from the 1999 comitology decision and therefore is not acceptable either.
At any rate, on that amendment, I do not believe that it is the number of participants in committee meetings that should really matter to us or to Parliament, it is how many of them are reimbursed by Community funds.
This is a horizontal issue which should find a general solution instead of being addressed in every regulation and I hope we can proceed on that basis.
Again, I would like to thank the rapporteur very warmly for her constructive and intelligent help in developing our relationship with some of our closest friends around the world.
We are, in this particular instance, correcting an anomaly and filling an important gap as Mr Jarzembowski pointed out a few moments ago.
So I thank Parliament for their understanding and I trust that it will not take too violent exception to the fact that there are three of the 14 amendments which I would advise against.
Thank you very much, Mr Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Energy efficiency labelling
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0006/2001) by Mrs McNally, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community Energy Efficiency Labelling Programme for Office and Communication Technology Equipment [COM(2000) 18 - C5-0061/2000 - 2000/0033(COD)].
Mr President, this report concerns the proposed adoption by the European Union of the United States' energy star programme as it applies to office and communication technology equipment.
This, colleagues, is not the sexiest title on this week' s agenda, perhaps, but it is directly linked to the future of our planet and to the possibility of even more devastating weather events, mass movements of people and crop failure.
Our irresponsible and profligate use of energy, with its consequential emissions of C02 and other environmental hazards must stop.
Ironically enough, it is in the United States, where the energy star scheme originated, that we have recently seen the absurd spectacle of power cuts in California, largely because of the incredible increase in the use of computers and other office equipment with the accompanying need for air-conditioning within a framework of quite bizarre and unwise deregulation.
Things would have been even worse without the energy star programme.
This scheme, which is voluntary, was introduced in 1992 and is now very widespread.
It has been officially adopted in Australia and Japan for example.
Members may in fact have seen the energy star logo on computers bought in the EU, although this means nothing yet since the technology has to be specially activated, which is done only in the United States.
This evening we are discussing the draft regulation which will implement the US/EU agreement on which we shall vote in the next session.
It is a voluntary scheme and it is hoped that between now and 2015 savings of 10 terawatt hours and 5 million tonnes of C02 emissions will be achieved in the EU through this scheme.
I now enter the world of science fiction and explain that to be energy-efficient, computers must go to sleep, but they must wake up instantly when they are required to do so.
When they are asleep their electricity consumption is cut on average from 100 watts to 5 watts.
Given the number of computers in homes, schools, workplaces, etc., you can see how the savings mount up from the good sleeping habits of those machines.
Until now, the European Union has produced its own energy efficient standards, often mandatory and the European Parliament has taken seriously its responsibility as a co-legislator to see that such standards are sufficiently stringent.
That is why there would be very serious reservations from Parliament about adopting this US energy star scheme if that were to be our only measure and especially if there were no provisions in the agreement for regular review of the results, with the objective, of course, of always being at the leading edge of the relevant technologies.
Luckily that is not the case however, and the Commission is to be given powers to negotiate improvements in the technical specifications.
And it has been made quite clear to the US authorities in a side letter to the agreement that the European Parliament, which would have been a co-legislator with the Council for similar measures at European level, will be consulted by the Commission on matters concerning technical specifications.
In the amendments to my report, we make it clear that further measures are certainly needed, including the glaringly obvious one of switching the machines off sometimes and withdrawing particularly inefficient machines from the market, either voluntarily or, if necessary, with legislation.
I am quite sure that the Council will see the wisdom of these amendments and of the regular and earlier monitoring of the energy star scheme as one, but only one, component of our energy efficient action plan.
We believe the current legal base is the correct one and we join the Commission in their suggestions.
As rapporteur, I would like to thank the Commission for their cooperation and help and of course thank my colleagues, especially Mrs MÃŒller, who drafted a very useful opinion from the Environment Committee.
We all hope that the energy star scheme is a success and we look forward to watching computers throughout Europe going to sleep at the correct time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in general, the Commission' s proposal for a regulation on a voluntary labelling programme is to be welcomed, and Mrs McNally has produced an excellent report on it.
Consumption labelling is, in my view, an important free-market instrument for promoting the use of energy-efficient equipment.
The energy-star label should help to promote energy efficient standby equipment.
The energy-saving potential of this equipment cannot be underestimated, and by introducing such a label the European Union will be providing the impetus needed to encourage people to use energy more sparingly.
Saving energy goes hand in hand with reducing carbon dioxide emissions, as agreed under the Climate Protection Agreement.
I think it is all the more likely to succeed if applied just about globally to office equipment.
This would give us a joint labelling scheme, not only with the USA but also, indirectly, with Japan and some other countries.
In this way, we would be taking account of the global market, which would help remove barriers to trade.
The fields of telecommunications and information technology would seem to be particularly important in this respect.
I think it is of the utmost importance for national experts on energy policy, as well as other interested parties, to be involved in setting up the European Union Energy Star Board, so that national interests can be properly represented.
The Energy Star Board will be required to draw up a report on the market penetration of products bearing the Energy Star logo.
Given the rapid pace of technological development in office and telecommunications equipment, I think yearly intervals would be appropriate.
That is the only way to ensure that the label is only used to distinguish those products which consume markedly less energy than the average for all similar equipment on the market.
Against this background, I urge you to support my opinion, which is appended to this report and which was adopted in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to echo the thanks extended to the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, but also to Mrs Emilia MÃŒller, the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Saving energy and reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are important EU goals.
It is not always possible to achieve these goals without effort and without sacrificing certain comforts, but sometimes it is quite a simple matter.
Sometimes, all it takes is to deploy the technical means, which are already in existence, yet people do not always have the political will to do this with any vigour.
Eleven per cent of electricity consumption in private households in the country I come from, Germany, is caused by standby losses.
Add to that the private and public spheres and the losses total 20 TWh per year, which corresponds to the output of two large power stations that we are simply running for no purpose.
So although no demands are made on the capacity of the piece of equipment, it still consumes energy.
Now of course the easiest thing to do - as Mrs McNally has already said - would be to switch the piece of equipment off when it is not in use.
That would be one way of resolving the problem in many spheres, for example, we should simply do more to encourage the public to get into this habit with their television sets.
But in quite a few spheres, it is no longer possible to switch equipment off at all, and it is particularly important for computers, by their very nature, to quickly fall into 'sleep mode' , as Mrs McNally puts it, and also 'wake up' instantaneously, because you sometimes need to be able to log onto a computer straightaway, and do not want to have to slowly coax it into life.
There are technical problems to be dealt with, but they can in fact be solved by technical means, without wasting energy.
There are new and innovative techniques designed to reduce the no-load losses almost to zero; they just have to be incorporated.
None of this is problematic from a technical viewpoint any longer.
That is why it is a positive thing to be discussing the Energy Star scheme and to label equipment that incorporates these new technical possibilities and is highly energy-efficient.
It is the right way to go, which is why the PPE-DE Group supports the Commission' s proposal, as well as the report by Mrs McNally.
However, I feel we need to go further still.
When I took on the responsibility as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group, I made enquiries of experts in the various organisations, non-governmental organisations, Ministries and in the Commission, but I also asked people who are confronted with this issue on a daily basis, for example a computer dealer who is a friend of mine.
I asked him what he thought of Energy Star and he replied that he thought it was a good thing.
He said there were technical problems to begin with, because the computers went into 'sleep mode' alright, but failed to 'wake up' again quickly enough.
He felt that although we have now solved all the technical problems, no one is interested in whether or not a computer has an Energy Star, and he did not think it was a selling point.
That is why I think we should consider whether or not we should just apply the principle we are advocating here, i.e. giving highly efficient equipment a positive label, or whether we should also aim to rid the market of the worst offending products, which are highly inefficient, and simply refuse to allow them access to the market after a transitional period.
I feel that is something else to think about - Mrs McNally' s report makes the same point - and then we would have a comprehensive energy efficiency programme in this sphere.
Hence my appeal to you to adopt these amendments.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs McNally sincerely for her excellent work, as this issue is a very important one.
We are all agreed on this matter.
The present trend in matters of energy efficiency is not always the best possible alternative, however.
For example, the aim for household appliances should be that all power-consuming circuits should be switched off.
But this is not possible in all cases: modern equipment often lacks an on/off button, as was mentioned here earlier on, making it utterly impossible to switch it off, even if the consumer wants to.
Many machines have a small red lamp that glows constantly to show that the equipment is still on and that it is consuming energy to some extent.
If we imagine the infinitesimally small amount of one watt per hour per appliance in a household this volume of energy consumption is multiplied very quickly.
With just a thousand appliances the figure reaches one kilowatt per hour, and with a million, one megawatt per hour, at which point we are talking about much larger volumes of energy consumption.
On the other hand, a quiescent current has its positive side, when, for example, the air in the room has to be heated.
In the northern regions of the Union, rooms, houses and buildings are heated and the heat produced from appliances and bulbs cuts heating costs.
But then again, in warm conditions, especially in the southernmost countries of the Union, where rooms must be kept cool with air-conditioning, the costs resulting from quiescent currents are doubled.
The general aim must be to promote the use of technology that consumes less energy; for example, the use of glow bulbs in equipment should always be avoided when they can be replaced with LEDs.
Furthermore, there must be more focus on consumer information than is the case at present.
It is difficult for the consumer to appreciate that equipment that is cheap to buy but an 'energy guzzler' will prove expensive in the course of time.
Energy efficiency labelling must be standardised in such a way that all consumers of any age, including children and the elderly, understand how much energy a piece of equipment consumes.
The information must be easily intelligible to all.
Merely to mention wattage means nothing to many people.
The manufacturers of equipment must explain, for example, in the instructions for use, how to save energy using the equipment in question.
Mr President, I must first thank Mrs McNally for her excellent report.
I would also like to thank Parliament for its broad support for this proposal. In the Commission' s view this proposal will make a significant contribution to improving energy efficiency and therefore to controlling demand, which the Green Paper identifies as crucial to assuring a reliable supply.
We are also called upon to reduce consumption and spend less, making better use of what we have available.
In addition, I should like to thank Mrs MÃŒller for her opinion on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
A substantial improvement in the efficiency of end use of electricity is required if we are to meet the European Union' s commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by the year 2010.
Office technology equipment represents a significant percentage of energy consumption in the service sector and offers wide scope for energy saving.
The Commission has therefore put forward the Energy Star Programme as a key measure to reduce the consumption of energy by office technology equipment.
It completes the measures adopted by other end use sectors such as domestic electrical appliances and lighting.
Since 1994 the Commission has been working on the introduction of this programme with the full support of Community industry and independent experts.
The Energy Star Programme is voluntary and makes use of a marketing device: a quality label enabling buyers to identify products which consume energy most efficiently.
Furthermore, thanks to the adoption of the programme the Community will be doing more than introducing a programme for labelling office equipment - which has proved very successful where it has been implemented - and putting in place a viable measure to reduce CO2 emissions. We shall be able to seize the opportunity of applying a standard which is in practice acquiring international significance.
What we are engaged in is important not only for us but because of its impact in other parts of the world.
In this context, I believe it is essential for us to become joint leaders at international level together with the United States.
Mr President, I am aware that Parliament was not very happy with the procedures followed in connection with the conclusion and signature of this agreement.
However, we were bound by the procedures laid down in Article 300 of the Treaty, and I am delighted to note that Parliament feels that the advantages of the agreement outweigh such differences of opinion.
Furthermore, at Parliament' s request, in a letter annexed to the agreement, we have informed the other party, namely the United States.
We shall ensure that Parliament is kept informed of the review of the technical specifications, a point raised by Mrs McNally and with which we totally agree.
As regards the amendments, I am in a position to say that we can accept all the amendments tabled by Parliament, with the exception of Amendment No 9.
The Commission agrees that the energy efficiency of office equipment must be monitored, but it does not feel that we should call for a special unit to be set up, as stated in the aforementioned amendment, if only because the necessary resources will not be forthcoming. I therefore ask you to reconsider the matter, ladies and gentlemen.
If this amendment were omitted, I think we could adopt the proposal at first reading and make faster progress. The final decision rests with Parliament of course.
Please take this into account.
I can assure you that no further resources will be made available, so in the end it will not serve any useful purpose.
On the other hand, we do in principle accept Amendments Nos 5, 11, and 15.
Concerning Amendments Nos 11 and 15, we accept that the Commission should present a report to the Council and to Parliament. However, the Commission feels that the best time to do so would be after three years had elapsed, as was the case for the first assessment of the Energy Star Programme
That concludes my summary of our position.
Once again, I should like to express my thanks to the honourable Members who have taken the floor, and especially to Mrs McNally for her splendid work.
I trust we shall all reach agreement at the earliest opportunity, if possible at first reading.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Recognition of professional qualifications
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0012/2001) by Mr Wieland, on behalf of the Parliamentary Delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directives 89/48/EEC and 92/51/EEC on the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications and supplementing Directives 77/452/EEC, 77/453/EEC, 78/686/EEC, 78/687/EEC, 78/1026/EEC, 78/1027/EEC, 80/154/EEC, 80/155/EEC, 85/384/EEC, 85/432/EEC, 85/433/EEC and 93/16/EEC concerning the professions of nurse responsible for general care, dental practitioner, veterinary surgeon, midwife, architect, pharmacist and doctor [C5-0680/2000 - 1997/0345(COD)].
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs McNally said earlier, her report was not a particularly sexy matter.
I think reports grow less sexy the later it gets, but I do not want to offend Mr Ferri, whose turn it is next.
This draft directive amends and supplements a total of 10 directives, some of which date back to 1977.
The President has saved me some time by already enumerating the professions concerned.
Why did this report require so much care, including a time- and energy-consuming Conciliation Procedure, even though many may perhaps say the honourable Members are acting as though the world is being turned upside down, when it is basically just a matter of detail?
Why did the vast majority of us insist on this Conciliation Procedure?
There are essentially three reasons.
Firstly, apart from architects and, in some respects, veterinary surgeons, they are all health-care professions in the widest sense.
In everyday life, you can seek restitution for loss or damage suffered, but a human being is not a Golf, a Skoda or a CitroÃ«n that you can take to a professional or even an amateur mechanic to tinker about with.
In such cases you can make a claim to make good the loss.
But when it comes to health, the damage cannot normally be made good.
That is why we have compensation for pain and suffering.
From my own practice as a lawyer, I know of no one who would not gladly have repaid such compensation if the damage to his health could in that way have been reversed.
If I may digress slightly, I think the whole procedure is a good example of why the Council ought in future to meet in public.
From Greece to Ireland and from Italy to Finland, our citizens would have been very interested in much of what was said there and would have thought, "What are our governments proposing here? We want better safeguards!"
There is therefore a lot of interest in these matters.
Secondly, and this brings me to my second concern, we have the internal market.
Wherever a diploma has been obtained, we want it to be used in the context of the free movement of people and services.
Of course, the Member State on the other side and the citizen is interested first of all in asking anyone who wants to pack his bags and go to another Member State straight after his exams about the training he has received.
Likewise, if somebody decides to go to another Member State 10 or even 30 years after taking his exams, the citizens and the host Member States want to know what the person has been doing in the last years since his exams.
Has he undertaken further training?
Has he kept himself abreast of developments?
This brings me to my third reason.
Parliament is keen that we should produce readable texts.
I have already mentioned that I am a lawyer.
When I was reading up on this matter, I have to say it was like going from one disaster to another.
What we produce here is basically rubbish so far as the interested public is concerned.
We must produce consolidated texts more quickly in future.
For these various reasons, Parliament accepted 11 amendments with a large majority, and my only regret on going to conciliation was that I did not ask for that majority to be checked, because that would have shown that well over 400 of us were in favour.
I must therefore also thank Mrs Gebhardt, with whom I worked closely to achieve that large majority, and who had confidence even though the conciliation delegation had three EVP members, that being how things turned out by the rules of the House.
I will not bore you with the details - deadlines for transposition, the matter of qualifications obtained in third countries, replacement of the word "similar" by the word "equivalent" and the conclusion of Italian pharmacist studies.
Briefly, three more basic principles.
Firstly, the Commission has said that it will produce consolidated texts in future.
I can only urge all rapporteurs to call for this soon to be done in their own fields, too.
Secondly, lifelong learning.
We must not just keep on talking about it, we must make it a requirement.
I believe we have reached a good compromise.
For reasons of subsidiarity, we have not produced any legislation, but we had our way with the preamble.
Thirdly and lastly, the specialised training course for general practitioners was extended to three years.
France was persuaded to increase it from two and a half to three years, while we have conceded to Member States Belgium and Finland that this special type can also be accepted with a longer basic training.
I can therefore say that conciliation produced a good outcome, and I would ask you to vote in favour.
But I should also like to say that we very much regret that the Commission was unfortunately not on our side from the outset on the points we were calling for and on which the Council finally gave way.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the late shift, anyone who wants to do good work in politics must find the willpower and the patience to persevere.
Mr Wieland possesses both qualities in good measure.
With him as rapporteur, it was therefore almost a pleasure for myself and my colleagues to work towards the outcome that is now before us.
We can be slightly proud of that.
We have managed for the first time to get something that is normally only talked about enshrined in European law. I mean the necessity for lifelong learning.
In the field of medicine, we shall in future not only have rules and criteria for the recognition of diplomas, examination certificates and other attestations of competence.
We are now saying for the first time that passing the final professional examination is not enough, but that training must continue, in the interests of patients in particular, but also in the interests of doctors and nursing staff.
Given the very rapid pace of technological and scientific progress in medicine, lifelong learning in one' s chosen profession is particularly important.
But we must not be content that it now appears in this recognition directive.
Rather, our legislation should be a contribution to making this initial success and with it lifelong learning into one of the mainstays of working life for everyone in Europe.
I should like to mention another point that has always concerned me in connection with the recognition of professional qualifications.
I will dress it up in a question that has still not been answered by this directive: why are we so reluctant to recognise qualifications obtained outside the European Union?
This question troubles me when I see how markets are becoming globalised and how easily we allow capital to move around.
Our citizens are able to bring goods and money with them from every corner of the world, but very personal assets in the form of professional knowledge and skills are not freely transferable.
There is something wrong there.
We must put it right quickly.
I therefore ask the Commission to abandon two arguments when preparing future recognition directives.
First, that it affects only a small number of EU citizens.
Second, that the Treaty provides only a limited basis in law.
Things will go a lot better then, you will see.
Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for his ongoing and diligent work on this issue which may not grab the headlines, but is of extreme importance to each and every one of the people that we represent here in this Parliament.
In particular, the areas that we are talking about in this present raft of recognition of qualifications, are areas where we have experienced huge shortages within the EU in the recent past.
Also there have been cases highlighted where barriers were put in place and people who wanted to move from one Member State to the other could not have the qualifications recognised.
One of the important issues raised within the discussions at conciliation and also within the report itself is in clearing up some of the wording used.
In particular there is the question of replacing the word "similar" with the word "equivalent" .
I am presently dealing with a case in Ireland where someone who has trained as a physiotherapist in one Member State cannot get their qualification recognised in Ireland because of the formal academic aspect even though in every other country in the European Union work experience is recognised as the equivalent of the academic qualifications.
On top of that, there is also a necessity for us to make sure, once the legislation is passed at a European level, that the Member States strictly enforce the legislation and open up the opportunities that are available.
Too often we have seen hidden barriers put in place to prevent people from one profession or another moving to a country to operate.
If we are truly to bring about the idea of the single market, and if we are truly to live up to the principles of the freedom of movement of persons, than we must dismantle these barriers, which we can see are not so much at a European Union institution level but are actually at Member State level and indeed in some Member States at the level of certain individual professions.
We need rigorous enforcement of all legislation so any complaints can be dealt with quickly.
I would commend this report to the House and ask it to support it.
Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to extend warm thanks to the Members of your Parliament who have taken part in the debate, for all the sound work they have done.
In particular, I would like to single out Mr Wieland as the person who drafted the report and who has managed to bring the entire process to a successful end.
The Commission is delighted that the Council and the European Parliament have reached agreement.
The Commission can identify with the result which, after all, aims to facilitate the recognition of qualifications and to improve legal certainty.
With this, Parliament has reached a result with the Council which is in the interest of all those clutching qualifications and looking for jobs elsewhere in Europe.
It will be of great benefit to the mobility of employees, and that is important.
As I already stated, I would particularly like to thank Mr Wieland, but also other Members who have worked with him, for all the sound work they have done in order to reach this agreement.
Mr President, I would like to extend general thanks to your Parliament for the fruitful cooperation with both the Council and the Commission.
Thank you for your kind words, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Multidisciplinary Group on Organised Crime
The next item is the report (A5-0398/2000) by Mr Ferri, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the report of the Multidisciplinary Group on Organised Crime - Joint Action on mutual evaluations [10972/2/1999 - C5-0039/2000 - 1999/0916(COS)]
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Wieland, this resolution of mine may not be as sexy as it could be, for justice is usually naked, or at least, attempts are made to strip it of its effectiveness.
In reality, I see this motion for a resolution as being quite an effective, substantial initial step in that it is practical.
In any case, I would like to start by making the point that the Member States, often out of a misconstrued sense of power, attempt to block what can appear to be a renunciation of sovereignty, particularly in the field of criminal justice.
Therefore, combining Community sovereignty and the sovereignty of the Member States in this area is not easy.
The mechanism for mutual evaluation by the Member States set forth in the 1997 Amsterdam Joint Action Plan, which - albeit somewhat behind schedule - has become operative, allows us to carry out the first stage.
The first five countries have been selected: Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and a Committee of three experts has been set up.
The group evaluating a country may not contain members who are nationals of that country and so the action is, so to speak, quite unrestricted.
These initial assessments have revealed, first and foremost, that there is often a lot of political involvement in legal matters, particularly as regards requests for judicial cooperation on urgent measures, confiscation of property and searches, and this takes different forms, either involving the Ministry of Justice or different judicial authorities from that requesting assistance, etc.
Of course, certain positive elements have also been noted, such as a computer system from the Netherlands known as KRIS, which has been used as a model.
We are, of course, fighting extremely sophisticated organised criminal networks which use advanced technology.
Methods change and so we also have to learn to deal with crime in different ways.
The reports from Italy, Belgium, Spain and Finland are also ready, but as yet unofficially.
However, we hope that there will be a monitoring system for the evaluation mechanism, to be the responsibility, in the long run, of the Court of Justice. Parliament has advocated this on several occasions too.
In actual fact, in this regard, it is most important to stress that a number of approximation rules need to be proposed.
I refer, for example, to dual criminality, which often holds up the ordinary, quicker passage of justice; I refer to the situation where a crime has been committed which is not a crime in the other Member States.
For example, Luxembourg once refused to comply with the requests made by the judicial authority of another country because the act was not a crime under Luxemburgish law.
There are therefore various impediments, and if we do not succeed in eliminating them, judicial cooperation will, in effect, be nothing but a word.
Therefore, in order to make it effective, another resolution has already been prepared on the mutual recognition of final decisions.
I have referred to it in this motion for a resolution as well in order to provide a mosaic, a complete raft of actions intended precisely to make this judicial cooperation more effective.
We all realise the urgent need for an electronic register, a centralised documentation instrument recording at least the final decisions, at least within the Community framework.
Clearly, it would be extremely useful to be able to quickly have the confirmation of final rulings against defendants or criminals who have already been convicted, at a wider level within Europe, but computerisation would already be a good basis - not necessarily on a huge scale - since information technology should now make it possible for us to achieve significant results quickly.
The motion for a resolution calls for relatively rapid intervention by Eurojust - we have verified it on several occasions - and particularly by the so-called European Public Prosecutor who, at least on matters of serious crime - organised crime, telematic crime, white collar crime, Mafia crime, etc. can effectively take the lead.
We therefore call for cooperation from the judicial authorities, public prosecutors and judges of the different Member States as well, which will then become part of the European Public Prosecutor as support at the level of the different States.
In short, it is a proposal supporting the European Judicial Network and what is known as 'good practice' . I would stress this because, when all is said and done, common sense and good practice in applying the various procedures calls, first and foremost, for the direct transmission of requests between judicial authorities.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our guiding objective is the creation of a great European area of freedom, security and justice, in which it is vital that we strengthen the security of European citizens and the fight against organised crime.
Following what was agreed in Tampere, it is crucial that we harmonise national legislation on criminal offences and the applicable sanctions in the field of organised crime.
In other words, it is essential that we focus our efforts on adopting common definitions, incriminations and sanctions with regard to the approximation of legislation in criminal matters.
This evaluation mechanism, which Mr Ferri has just mentioned and which forms the basis of the excellent report that he presented to the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, was instituted on the basis of the action plan against organised crime approved in Amsterdam in June 1997.
This can already be considered, per se, as a significant step forward, reinforced by the establishment of the European Judicial Network and other initiatives to modernise and increase the effectiveness of systems to prevent and combat crime.
Under this evaluation system, although it is envisaged that the Council will adopt the necessary measures after one complete round of evaluations - in other words, three years, with five countries being evaluated per year - we should welcome the decisions taken by some Member States to determine in advance the reforms and improvements considered to be most urgent within their own legal systems, bearing in mind the results of these evaluations.
We are all keen to have the results of the evaluations of the remaining countries, one of which is my own country, Portugal, conveyed to us quickly.
I welcome the fact that the matter that has been chosen for the first round of evaluations is that of delays in the operation of the system for mutual legal assistance and in the treatment of urgent requests for the confiscation of property, with particular regard to procedures used in cases of organised crime.
The emphasis on the problem of delays is particularly positive.
Indeed, we are concerned to see an increase in overall delays in trials and we are fully aware of how damaging this is.
Justice which is delayed or which comes too late is, ultimately, always a negation of Justice itself.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on behalf of my group, I support the analysis, conclusions and considerations presented by the rapporteur, and I also share his concern about the problems highlighted by the Multidisciplinary Group.
I thank Mr Ferri for his work.
In the EU there are 15 different penal codes, a large number of police forces, some of them competing with each other, and 15 legal systems, all deeply marked by their own mentality, tradition and culture.
Until the EU' s criminal law systems are harmonised - something which is to be desired - judicial cooperation will continue to operate through a complex and antiquated system of requests for legal assistance, an emotive term for almost all public prosecutors and judges.
But European cooperation is more urgent than ever.
For example, 77% of all cases of organised crime in Germany in 1998 had an international connection.
There is a great need for the Council to act.
In Luxembourg, for example, the Minister of Justice must give his personal authorisation whenever the banking sector is involved.
The Netherlands use their own classification of urgency instead of adopting the urgency of the requesting State.
The five countries have insufficient staff and inadequate technical and financial resources for dealing with requests for legal assistance.
On the positive side, we can mention the Netherlands' KRIS programme, the Irish system and Denmark' s experience with the Nordic countries.
Where contact points exist within the Judicial Network, there is good experience and results, but the network has no influence over formal requests for legal assistance.
The creation of contact points alone is still no guarantee of the qualitative leap needed in European cooperation.
At some contact points, the willingness to make regular exchanges also left much to be desired.
If the Council is serious about successfully fighting cross-border crime, which simply disregards democracy and the rules of the legal economy, the recommendations of the rapporteur and the committee must be translated into action.
I do not want to go over the details of what Mr Ferri has already said, but it does mean that the candidate countries need to be fully involved in the strategy for fighting organised crime at an early stage.
The Judicial Network must be further expanded, for example with internet pages about the various legal systems, with videoconferencing facilities and, finally, Eurojust should become a meaningful adjunct to EUROPOL and OLAF.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done on a very difficult and complex issue.
He has brought some logic and sense to it but while giving praise, I have some criticisms and some points that I cannot agree with.
On any of these issues we must be very careful that we do not come out in a rush of Christian frenzy, thinking that we are going to solve all of the problems of all of the crime in the European Union simply by setting up another institution or another office with more staff, and coordinating and harmonising more power into a central authority.
There are already examples of where cooperation and coordination work.
We have Europol, and other institutions like this, where different agencies in different Member States working together can achieve results.
We also have the opportunity to assess other Member States and take the best practices from them and use those as a common minimum standard for all Member States.
However, we still have differences of law within the Member States.
We still have different legal systems, for instance.
In Ireland and Britain we still work under the old common law system whereas on the mainland of Europe you have the civil law system.
It is very difficult, perhaps impossible, to marry these two together, so we must always work on the basis of three tenets of how things should operate.
Number one: effectiveness, number two: speed, and number three: justice; and we must not forget the word 'justice' .
People should have the right to defend themselves when they are accused or allegations made against them.
Perhaps it is only a problem of interpretation, but some of the suggestions for the fast-track approach seem to be saying we have to cut through some of the present legal impediments for instance with regard to the right of appeal.
I am particularly happy that Ireland gets honourable mention because of the Criminal Assets Bureau.
I would encourage each and every Member of this House and every Member State to look at how the Criminal Assets Bureau operates in Ireland and how successful it has been since its establishment.
One proposal which I oppose - and we have asked for a separate vote - is on the question of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.
I am totally opposed to a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with its powers extending over the territory of all the Member States.
Finally, sanctioning Member States is a very dangerous area.
We already have experience of how it can go wrong and how difficult it is to reverse.
It is better to rely on cooperation; the carrot works a lot better than the stick.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to congratulate Mr Ferri on the excellent report he has presented, which contains a very astute and clear-sighted analysis of the problems we face in the field of judicial cooperation and presents an ambitious and exacting vision of the efforts required to overcome these problems.
The Commission broadly supports the analysis and the vision laid out by the rapporteur.
We agree, in particular, with the approach that consists of stating that improving judicial cooperation - or even, to use Mr Ferri' s words, "a radically new joint effort" - must never be seen as a weakening of the sovereignty of the Member States. Instead, this should be seen as a tool, and perhaps the most important tool, for making this sovereignty effective in the face of the sophistication and power of organised crime, which today poses an extremely serious threat to the structures of democratic government, to the very functioning of the rules of the legitimate economy and to respect for citizens' rights.
We are clearly on the way to achieving this, but it must be emphasised that this progress has been made not as a result of regulatory instruments - because many of these instruments are no longer in force: for example, the conventions have not been systematically ratified by the Member States - but mainly because, in the meantime, practical mechanisms have been created, such as, for example, the mechanism for mutual evaluation. This has given tangible proof of the need to find a new model and, in certain cases, has already led to Member States introducing the necessary amendments to their own legislation.
This process of professionals in the field exchanging information, whether it is carried out in the framework of mutual evaluation, in contacts within the judicial network or, quite soon, I hope, in the framework of cooperation within Eurojust, is crucial and must be pursued.
Parliament is now being consulted on the renewal of the Grotius programme, which is an important tool for enhancing cooperation between legal professionals and similarly, on the project of creating a European network for judicial training, which will facilitate the development of closer cooperation links between magistrates' colleges in the various Member States.
Of the suggestions and requests made by the rapporteur, I wish to highlight just three aspects: firstly, Mr Ferri referred to the need to amend Article 35 of the Treaty on European Union so that the Court of Justice of the European Communities is given the power to decide whether the Member States comply with their obligations.
This loophole in judicial control is, in my opinion, linked to the nature of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union itself, which remains heavily impregnated with an intergovernmental spirit.
I wish to emphasise that it would perhaps be more productive, at the appropriate time, to call for a more categorical and complete arrangement, either using the working method or the institutional framework method of the 'third pillar' , according to the Community method, which would thus ensure greater control by the Court of Justice, as well as decision-making processes that involve greater participation by the European Parliament itself.
I do, nevertheless, harbour some doubts as to the prospect of being able to adopt measures for punishing Member States that do not comply with their obligations.
One of the measures recommended by the draft resolution is the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, with jurisdiction over the whole Union.
As Parliament knows, at the last Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission proposed that the Treaty should provide for an independent European Public Prosecutor, but with the specific and sole aim of safeguarding the Community' s financial interests.
This proposal was not accepted in Nice and the Commission will certainly take this decision by the Council into account, having already moved ahead with improving the arrangements and means necessary for OLAF to be able to fulfil its duties.
By the same token, we hope that the creation of the Eurojust network will also be something that contributes to this aim, which was not achieved in Nice.
As to the issue of extradition, I wish to assure Mr Ferri that I share the concerns expressed in his report with regard to the simplification and acceleration of extradition procedures, which are, in fact, the theme of the third stage of mutual evaluation.
This is why the Commission has included a specific initiative on the adoption of fast-track arrangements for extradition in its programme for 2001.
I wish to close, Mr President, by stating that I share the concern expressed by the rapporteur that, in this field, all legislative initiatives must be implemented with respect for individual rights and fundamental freedoms and that this respect for citizens' rights and freedoms is inextricably linked to the fight against organised crime.
At a time when the Union has proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is our duty to seek to act in such a way that the progress made in the field of judicial cooperation, the mutual recognition of judgments, the coordination of crime-fighting activities by the police and the courts and the simplification of extradition procedures accord with the principles that we advocate and that they are not achieved at the expense of the rights of individuals.
The construction of an area of freedom, security and justice cannot by achieved by using the lowest common denominator where respect for citizens' rights and freedoms is concerned.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I did not rise to speak yesterday at the beginning of the sitting, but I do wish to clarify an issue concerning something said by the President of this Parliament.
With regard to the tabling of the so-called Antiterrorist Agreement in Spain, the presidency of this Parliament stated that this was signed by various associations and unions, and the Church was mentioned.
I wish to state, for the information of everyone here, that this is not the case, despite the pressure exerted by the Government and the Socialist Party.
This statement has not even been signed by organisations that support the government in Madrid and, with all due respect, I must say that this situation, which is discussed here with such frequency, the situation of the Basque country, is complex and it requires efforts to maintain dialogue. This is what was requested, for example, in the manifesto that I submitted to President Fontaine, signed by four thousand intellectuals and others involved in culture in Catalonia.
Lastly, I wish to say that the situation is so complex and is so finely shaded that even Mrs Fontaine' s own party is standing in municipal elections in France, in Bayonne, in Biarritz and in Anglet, in coalition with Basque nationalist parties, including Mr Gorostiaga' s party, which is no favourite of mine, but which I imagine is not a favourite of Mrs Fontaine' s either.
Mr President, last Saturday Marie-JosÃ© the last Queen of Italy and daughter of King Albert of this country died.
She was a recognised democrat and historian.
Sadly she did not live to see her exiled son and grandson allowed to return to their homeland.
Thus her funeral shamefully could not take place in Italy as they would not be permitted to attend.
This Italian constitutional article has no place in modern Europe and is in clear breach of the freedom of movement provided for under the European treaties.
I have three times attempted to gain the support of this Parliament in condemning this law.
The issue is being decided at present by the Court of Human Rights and will not go away.
I call upon the Italian government to use the opportunity afforded by the sad death of Queen Marie-JosÃ© to fulfil its legal obligations to the European Union and grant the two male princes the same rights as every other Italian citizen and let them go home.
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgent procedure
Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I wish to express our rejection of this emergency procedure, which the Council requested of Parliament on 18 January and which asks us to deliver our opinion before 14 February.
Our committee has given a commitment to process this legislative proposal as rapidly and as diligently as possible, whilst adhering to the legislative procedures that have been laid down, according to which the vote will take place on 13 February in the Strasbourg part-session, as has already been scheduled on the agenda.
I wish to take this opportunity, Mr President - because lately these last minute rushes have become a regular occurrence - to say that the Commission and the Council are given considerable notice, a whole year' s notice, of Parliament' s timetable, which should give them - and us too - sufficient time to work on processing these proposals.
We were consulted too late, on 7 December to be precise, but even so, we appointed Mr Nicholson as rapporteur and he presented his draft report immediately, the following day, which was 8 December.
As I say, we plan to vote in committee on Monday 5 February and debate the report in Parliament' s sitting of Monday 12 in Strasbourg, in order that the vote can be held on 13 February and thereby meet the deadlines that we have been set.
I simply wish to point out that we have shown nothing but good will and have shown ourselves to be completely willing, but we do not want to be asked the impossible and, even less, to do our work badly.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
Progress of EU and Member State measures to combat BSE
The next item is the Commission statement on the progress of anti-BSE measures taken by the EU and Member States.
I am pleased to have the opportunity to update Parliament on the most recent events in relation to BSE.
Many of you were present when I spoke to the Agriculture Committee last week.
Nonetheless, let me very briefly summarise the main events of recent weeks.
Important new measures came into effect on 1 January.
These included the ban on meat and bone meal and the testing of all animals over 30 months destined for the food chain.
The Commission wrote to Ministers for Agriculture on 4 January and asked for replies to an extensive questionnaire on the implementation of BSE-related measures.
A working document summarising the responses was circulated to the Agriculture Council on Monday last.
The opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee on a number of BSE-related questions from the Commission was published on 17 January.
This set the agenda for the Agriculture Council on Monday.
Following the usual, very lengthy discussions, Member States agreed on the following main orientations. A ban on mechanically recovered meat.
The heat treatment of ruminant fats for inclusion in animal feed and the removal of the vertebral column, the backbone, from cattle. All three of these orientations follow directly from the previous discussions in the Council on the measures necessary to restore consumer confidence.
They are also based on the opinion of the Scientific Committee.
I intend to present proposals within the next several days on all these issues to the Standing Veterinary Committee.
They will, of course, result in further controls and potentially very significant costs.
However Member States are prepared to accept virtually any measure to ensure that beef is now safe.
It is surely a matter of very great regret that this determination to tackle BSE has taken so long to emerge.
Only seven months ago, the Commission failed to obtain a qualified majority to ban brain and spinal cord from food for human consumption and from animal feed.
Equally, not all Member States implemented a ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants in a satisfactory manner.
I would like now to turn to the proposals which the Commission will put to the Standing Veterinary Committee.
Firstly, the one relating to mechanically recovered meat.
The Commission will shortly consider a proposal to ban the use of mechanically recovered meat from all bones of ruminants of all ages.
There is a case that material from bones other than the skull and vertebral column or from bones of young animals is safe.
However, this involves important control problems and in the circumstances it is believed a total ban is necessary.
I might add that the use of mechanically recovered meat is increasingly repugnant to consumers.
The processed meat industry has also called for this ban.
The proposed measure should therefore be very welcome to both industry and consumers.
On the question of rendered fat, the Commission will propose that ruminant fats to be included in ruminant feed should be pressure cooked in addition to the current requirement that they be ultrafiltrated.
The Commission will equally act on the opinion that such ruminant fats should only be sourced from discrete adipose tissues when fed as milk replacers to calves.
We also need to reflect however if these changes can be properly enforced.
For example, might there be control problems in distinguishing between different fats.
If so, is there a need for a need for an outright ban on the use of ruminant fats in ruminant feed?
If so, how do we ensure that the replacement fats are safe?
One final point on the issue of ruminant fats: it is surely incredible to the public that there should be higher standards relating to the use of ruminant fats in animal feed than applies to their use in food for human consumption.
However that is the current situation and I intend to put this right.
On the vertebral column, the Commission intention is to require the removal of the vertebral column where there are doubts over the effectiveness of the ban on meat and bone meal or whenever it cannot be demonstrated that animals are highly unlikely to be incubating BSE.
This is in keeping with the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee.
Again, however there are important issues which need to be addressed.
Where should the vertebral column be removed.
If it is done at the abattoir, the most easily controlled location, there are implications for the storage and transport of beef carcasses.
There are also risks of microbiological handling due to the increased handling involved.
If instead removal is required at the butcher or retail outlet, there will be control problems in the recovery and the destruction of the bones.
Similarly we need to be aware of the impact on consumers.
A strict implementation of the Scientific Committee recommendations would require removal of vertebral column in animals aged over twelve months, as is currently the case in France.
This will entail a ban on certain cuts of meat which are very popular - T-bone steaks and bistecca fiorentina for example.
Finally, which Member States should be exempt from the requirement?
Should for example Member States like Austria, Sweden and Finland which continue to be BSE-free be exempt?
These are all issues which the Commission is urgently considering and will address in its proposal.
I hope that these observations help to highlight the very complex issues which arise for what might appear at first sight to be a relatively simple measure.
I am aware that the issue of controls is a concern.
In this respect, the replies of Ministers to my letter of 4 January is reassuring.
All Member States now insist that they are giving top priority to the secure implementation of BSE-related measures.
The Food and Veterinary Office will continue its programme of inspections in this regard.
Finally, as a further incentive to improve compliance, I am considering a proposal in the very near future to require Member States to present monthly reports on their implementation of BSE control measures.
The UK and Portugal are already required to provide such a report under the restriction measures on their exports of beef.
I believe it has been invaluable in ensuring that controls are actively implemented.
It should therefore, I believe, be replicated at Community level.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I know, Commissioner Byrne, that serious action is being taken in a bid to make preventive consumer protection a permanent feature of EU policy.
I know that many of these very far-reaching decisions are needed because past mistakes are still catching up with us.
May I state clearly for the record here that BSE owes a great deal to government failings, to gross negligence in the United Kingdom and to multiple acts of negligence on the part of the Commission up to 1996 - I can honestly say that I know of no-one who got it right in the fight against BSE.
Government failings are the main issue; errors were noticed too late, decisions were taken too late and when decisions or bans were introduced, there were not properly controlled.
That is still dogging us.
That is why the measures which you have presented, Commissioner, are without question right and proper and we call on the Member States to do their very best to implement them as quickly as possible.
However, may I also state for the record that Parliament called back in November for all animals over 18 months old to be tested and, Commissioner, I see a danger here.
If, with the removal programme today, the thrust of the resolution is test or remove in the sense of preventive consumer protection and several Member States test all their animals, while others test or remove, then by the end of the year the statistics will be meaningless and we must avoid that at all costs.
We would therefore welcome your comments on this.
I should also like to ask you to clarify the problem of third countries as quickly as possible, because here too there is a huge risk from infectious materials brought in over past years.
Here too, the question of uniform consumer protection arises.
Then we also take account of the financial aspects.
We risk destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, which is why the Commission must also see if, as in France for example, we can spread the financial burden equally and fairly between everyone in the form of a surcharge, a meat tax or by charging value added tax on agricultural products, so that a reasonable solution can be found to the problem of disposal.
We must do everything, including under the financial programmes in the agricultural budget, in order to make it 20% or 30% cheaper to get animals to market, for example through sectoral agreements, otherwise we shall simply never get a grip on the situation.
(Applause)
Mr President, we are in exactly the same situation as we were six years ago.
I believe that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is due to speak after me; that means that all of us who have basically concentrated on little else in our work over the last six years except BSE are back again.
The European Parliament has been calling for much of what the agricultural ministers have now decided - half willingly, half unwillingly - for over six years now.
Mr Byrne intimated as much.
What was done then about removing risk material?
All the Member States tried to obstruct and block for as long as possible.
If, Mr Byrne, as you now say, the question of removing the vertebral column is a problem, then they are again dragging their feet.
What is the matter with them?
For the moment we must consider the vertebral column to be risk material, in all Member States.
It must be removed, it must be removed in the abattoir and it must be treated as risk material.
And there is an end to it.
Not here a little loophole, there a little loophole!
I have learned in my eleven years in the European Parliament that progress here moves at a snail's pace.
It is a fact of life.
We have moved forward at a snail's pace.
That is fine as long as we move forward.
I have nothing against that, but I would like to move a wee bit faster here, because now is our chance: we are surrounded in the Member States by jittery meat markets and, as a result, we have got jittery agricultural ministers, jittery finance ministers - everyone has got the jitters.
Unfortunately, it is also affecting farmers and the meat processing industry and the feedingstuffs industry, which I always mention in the same breath as everyone who did not exactly go out of their way to do anything about improving quality in the past.
So if we look at these compliant meat markets and see that here is our chance, the chance to push measures forward, then we must decide exactly what sort of measures we need.
They obviously include, as you have just said Mr Byrne, extending the definition of risk material, so that we can, at long last, ban all mechanically recovered meat.
Of course, we could have done this years ago, but it must all be banned, not just a bit from the skull and a bit from the vertebral column like last time.
We must get rid of it all; we no longer need it in an affluent society like ours, that is obvious.
What else do we need to do?
We need to do the same with animal fats.
We cannot differentiate between animal fats or gelatine on the basis, for example, of whether or not they reach the human food chain or whether or not they are used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
That is out of the question.
Fats must be sterilised by pressure cooking. End of story!
No other method should be allowed now.
We must minimise the risks, that is obvious.
You said something quite wonderful, Mr Byrne and I should like to pick up on it.
How do we handle derogations in the Member States for the vertebral column, fats and so on?
What do we do about the Member States which are BSE-free?
That is when I lean back in my chair and think to myself: here we go again.
I have heard it all before in recent years.
Exactly which Member State is BSE-free?
And may I ask: how do they know? Do they look inside the animals' head?
And if they can do that, perhaps they can tell us exactly what is going on.
We too want to do likewise.
Until such time as the Member States introduce comprehensive testing, and we know how slipshod testing can be, until such time as everything is tested comprehensively, including - and I agree with Mr BÃ¶ge here - the animals taken from the market, then we shall never have a complete picture; until such time as there is comprehensive testing, we shall not know if Finland, Germany, Austria or Italy are BSE-free.
And until we have that information, we shall treat all Member States the same, end of story.
Then we shall see which Member States block everything again and we shall publicise the fact.
I wonder just which Member States think they can hold out now.
There is no time left to address all the points, but I must, nonetheless, touch on what has been my favourite subject for a long time: we can pass the best legislation here in the European Union, but what use is it if it is not controlled in the Member States?
I believe that there are too few veterinarians in all the Member States, too few food inspectors, too few on-site inspections.
Which is why I call on you, Mr Byrne, to force the Member States to report to you on how many veterinarians they have, how many food inspectors they have, when and what they control and what they have done in the past.
I welcome and thank you for your monthly reports!
Mr President, first I would like to state quite briefly that we are now dealing with such a colossal issue that nobody can afford to blame anyone in any event.
