What we need is a radical overhaul, as the Commissioner proposed.
We should not vote for lesser price cuts and increased compensation and less quota cuts than those proposed by the Commission.
We should not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers.
All ACP producers were being offered the same.
Large amounts of CAP funds are already available to EU farmers.
Let us not forget that sugar producers, processors and refiners are not the poorest people on this planet.
I agree that we need to monitor imports from the less-developed countries in order to prevent fraud and guard against triangular trade, but quite honestly, we are talking about tiny amounts.
EU sugar production of 17Â million tonnes will not be distorted; there will not be a market imbalance because of LDC imports.
Amendment 61, on the Everything But Arms Agreement, should be opposed.
What we are trying to do to the least developed countries is unacceptable.
We should follow the line that Mrs Kinnock has given, making sure that, whatever we do with these reforms, the developing world is not jeopardised.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar is one of the most major reforms to the common agricultural policy to be undertaken in the life of this Parliament.
It is a balancing act on a high wire extending between, on the one hand, the demands made by the WTO, the obligations arising from the âEverything but Armsâ initiative and the panelâs decision, and, on the other, the producers of beet and cane sugar and the economic interests associated with them in Europe.
The Commission, represented by Commissioner Fischer Boel, Parliament and, above all, the Council bear the brunt of responsibility for this high-wire performance.
Some 350Â 000 farming families and well over 100Â 000 workers in the relevant economic sectors of the EU are affected by it.
Many sugar beet farmers and worker in sugar factories still want to know why it is so necessary to reform, and on such a massive scale, a sugar market organisation that has stood the test of decades.
The answer is a very simple one: it is because the international commitments made long ago mean that, in the absence of reform, the future of beet and cane sugar cultivation in the European Union will be very much in doubt after 2009.
Reform of the common market organisation for sugar gives us the chance to keep a great deal of production in Europe, even though it will result in painful reductions in income for sugar producers.
It is unfortunate â as MrÂ Fruteau indeed said â that, following the Councilâs agreement of 24 November, the Commission and the Council of Ministers gave the impression that that had put the seal on the sugar market organisation.
The fact is, though, that this agreement was no more and no less than a declaration of intent on the part of the Council.
It is only when the ministers next meet, on 19 February, that the Council will be able to adopt the sugar market reform.
I am glad to see that the Council of Ministers has, to a significant degree, taken on board the demands we made in our motion for a resolution on 10 March 2005.
For example, the Commission envisaged price reductions of up to 50% in the price of beet sugar.
A majority on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted a reduction of 30% in the price of white sugar; the Council agreed to 36%.
In its proposal, the Commission envisaged 60% for compensation payments, while the Council wants to increase them to 64.2%.
It is also heartening to see that the reform is to run until 2014/2015, and that there is to be no transfer of quotas from one Member State to another.
It is at this point that I would like to thank the new German Agriculture Minister, Mr Horst Seehofer, who, shortly after being sworn in, promptly played a significant part during negotiations in the Council in getting the Commissionâs proposals changed to the benefit of the European Unionâs beet and cane sugar cultivators.
It is above all in the restructuring fund that improvements are needed.
The Councilâs plan is that at least 10% of the funds provided for restructuring will be used for agriculture.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is calling for at least 50% to be used for the creation of alternative means of agricultural production, and, when it comes to the final decision on that in the Council, I ask you, Commissioner Fischer Boel, and the Council, to take account of the way this House votes.
It is evident from Russiaâs use of gas supplies to Ukraine as a means of political blackmail that we have to seize every opportunity to make the European Union just that bit more independent in energy matters.
It is within the capacities of European agriculture to use agricultural land no longer required for food production to produce energy in the form of biomass.
The Commission and the Council must support economically viable energy production by using the restructuring fund to provide start-up finance, and must do everything possible, to enable a stop to be put to the so-called triangular operations, to which reference has already been made.
In my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like, in particular, to thank the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Daul, and the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, for their outstanding cooperation on the report on the reform of the common market organisation for sugar.
I also wish to thank all those other Members who have made a constructive contribution to this report.
When, on Thursday, we vote on the reform of the sugar market, this House will be sending out a signal and demanding that the Commission and the Council change their declarations of intent, even if only in a few respects.
Â Â  â Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, for the maturity and efficiency with which he presented his proposals and for his cooperation with the political groups and all the parliamentary committees.
Unfortunately, however, I must point out that the Commission and the Council have decided to review one of perhaps the most important markets without barely waiting for the decisions by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Do you imagine, Commissioner, that the way in which you have handled the issue promotes substantial interinstitutional cooperation?
Of course it does not.
Do you today have at least to make a show of good cooperation with the European Parliament?
Which of the European Parliament's proposals do you intend to accept?
Have you been instructed and do you intend to exert dynamic pressure on the Council in this direction?
The review of the sugar industry is a premeditated crime for rural areas and for the European industry and of dubious results for developing countries, especially the less developed countries.
Already in numerous regions, including my country, Greece, demonstrations have started by sugar beet producers and workers in the sugar industry â including the Greek sugar industry â due to the significant repercussions which a reduction in the order of 36% will have.
You said, Commissioner, that you aimed to make the European sugar industry viable in the European Union.
Are you exaggerating or have you got the wrong figures?
Both predictions and results show that the sugar industry will shrink or disappear and producers with it.
We are therefore calling, within the framework of close cooperation and a mild adaptation of the new market, for certain proposals which are expressed as proposals in the Fruteau report.
First, substantial compensation for loss of income, mainly for the small-scale producers who will be hardest hit by the reduction in aid.
Secondly, material activation of the Reconstruction Fund, as the basis for substantial consultation with all producers and workers for the preparation of integrated operational programmes and restructuring programmes in a bid to stop areas being abandoned.
Thirdly, aid of EUR 80 per hectare for areas sown under energy crops and an increase in the overall number of hectares allowed from 1.8 to 2.8 million.
This is important, because efforts are being made to switch to more environmentally friendly forms of energy.
Fourthly, the possibility of national aid for producers for a transitional period and the provision of a percentage of between approximately 30 and 50% of the sum given for the restructuring of industry to producers themselves, provided of course that they continue to cultivate other crops.
Of course, what this means, Commissioner, is that you undertake to safeguard the sugar budget during negotiations on the financial perspectives.
Otherwise, it will be cheque returned to drawer which, in the wake of the Commission's poor organisational skills, will reinforce the lack of credibility of the Community institutions in the mind of European citizens.
Â Â  Madam President, first and foremost, I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Fischer Boel on this reform.
It was an ambitious proposal that the Commission put forward, and the compromise subsequently adopted by the Council is an excellent one.
The result is clear: more free trade where sugar is concerned.
Over the next few years, the worldâs poorest countries will be given free access to the European market, and the price of sugar will be reduced to something closer to its price on the world market.
I am annoyed that Parliament has made its contribution too late.
In spite of many calls to get things under way last year, we are now in a situation in which we have had our day, as the decision has already been made in the Council of Agriculture Ministers.
That does not mean that the European Parliament has made no impression on the reform.
On the contrary.
Quite a few features of the reform reflect the wishes expressed by the European Parliament.
For example, the section on restructuring reflects our desire to strengthen those regions in which sugar cane production is crucial.
I am very pleased that we have, at long last, adopted a reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar, which has existed largely unchanged for 40 years.
By means of this reform, we have taken a good long step in the right direction: towards something that is more in the way of a market economy.
However, I should like us to go still further.
It is not enough to bring about free trade with countries outside the Community, as the fact is, of course, that we do not have a free market within the EU.
Only once we have removed the national quotas so that production occurs in the places that are best for it and where it is most profitable shall we be able to talk in terms of having a free internal market.
There are quite a few features of the reform worth emphasising.
Unfortunately, time does not permit me to do so.
I want particularly to mention the proposal for increasing the use of biofuel and the production of ethanol, in which I believe we must invest a very great deal as quickly as possible.
That is something that, fortunately, a number of Member States are doing.
Meanwhile, others are procrastinating and have not yet begun investing.
It is not only sugar cane but also other crops that can be cultivated in areas previously given over to sugar cane and that can be used for biofuel which â environmentally, economically and in terms of supply â will be an important part of future energy production.
The biggest battle in the campaign to create a basis for biofuel must be fought with the Member Statesâ finance ministers, who are a little too keen on the tax revenue from oil and on the contribution it makes to the state coffers.
Irrespective of how justified it may be, the reform â including, in particular, the reduction in prices â will have harmful and far-reaching consequences for some of those poorest countries in the world that cannot cope with free competition in the world market.
Given the very high price of sugar in the EU, we bear a very large share of the responsibility.
It is therefore an urgent matter for us to appropriate adequate resources for the restructuring faced by these countries.
Finally, I wish to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Fruteau, for his constructive cooperation.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, we are agreed that sugar reform was necessary.
The market organisation for sugar had become perverse in terms of the quantities and budgetary resources concerned: after all, exports exceeded quotas by 5â6Â million tonnes, which led to a disastrous dumping effect.
The benefits gained by the ACP countries who were able to supply us with a proportion of their sugar on our terms were counteracted by the collapse in prices to which we contributed by means of this dumping on the world market.
Although we were in agreement, two different approaches were proposed.
On the one hand there was the idea of using quotas to return quantities to reasonable proportions and giving countries in the developing world, including the least developed countries, more involvement. On the other hand there was the Commissionâs approach of starting to liberalise this organisation, cutting prices and promoting rationalisation in these fields â a solution that would culminate in full liberalisation.
We argued long and hard in committee â although there is no point going into details about this now, nor would there be time.
Having noticed that there was considerable opposition within Parliament, the Commissioner proceeded to bypass our institution and, together with the Council, to conclude the matter without any regard for Parliament.
She knew that she could afford to do so because, firstly, she could assume that Parliament had no power of codecision and, secondly, because she had handed out presents to those whose interests were affected by this sugar market organisation.
The most generous gift â the restructuring aid of EURÂ 6Â billion to industry â then produced a change of heart in the interest groups.
That is how she managed to carry her reform through.
The only issue that still generates a great deal of opposition is the question as to how these restructuring funds will be managed.
We have presented proposals for this.
The scenario where farmers receive only 10% and where it is not compulsory to make business and regional development plans in which social and environmental criteria or the workers play a part, is unacceptable.
My group will therefore, be proposing that this issue be referred back to committee, to enable us to negotiate it with the Commissioner and to achieve something for the farmers and the regions.
If we let it go through as it is, no one will lift a finger.
I hope that the other groups will follow our lead.
Â Â  Madam President, the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar is giving rise to grave concern both in the ACP countries and in the outermost regions.
That concern is particularly keen on the island of RÃ©union, where sugar cane is still the main crop.
The mobilisation of the players in the sugar-cane sector has not been in vain.
It has brought appreciable changes to the initial reform plan.
We note these positive changes and pay tribute to the work done by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur.
We must not deceive ourselves, however.
The measures proposed to mitigate the effects of this reform are temporary and as such merely palliatives designed solely to win acceptance for a reform the effects of which may ultimately be disastrous.
The outermost regions share the same fate as the ACP countries in this respect.
We cannot let them believe their future is assured.
It is all the less secure because there are many uncertainties about what will happen afterÂ 2013.
Apart from the inadequate Community compensation, what national compensation will there be and, more importantly, will it continue beyond 2013?
This concern is all the more legitimate because the HongÂ Kong summit suggested there will be a new debate starting in 2009 with implications for the European budget, including the common agricultural policy.
When we know that a stock of sugar cane represents seven yearsâ harvest on average, after which it must be replanted, it is easy to see that these uncertainties may undermine the confidence required to meet the replanting targets hitherto supported by the European Union.
Ultimately, the question is how the sugar cane sector can be saved.
Madam President, I will conclude by saying that, faced with this situation where our plantersâ future is not assured beyond the life of a cane stock, it will be impossible for us to approve the report that is before us.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Madam President, the methods being employed to reform the sugar market run counter to the strategic goals of the EU and of the common agricultural policy.
The EU subsidises the dumping of BÂ sugar surpluses onto the markets of third countries.
This is expensive, and it leads to a distortion of international trade.
Sugar production limits should be imposed primarily on countries with large BÂ quotas, and it should be these latter that bear the cost of the reform.
After all, AÂ quotas serve to meet Member Statesâ own needs.
Combining A and BÂ quotas would therefore mean that many Member States would risk no longer being self-sufficient in sugar.
It would also mean that those countries that have played no part in bringing about this overproduction crisis would incur unjustifiably high restructuring costs.
When viewed in the light of the reformâs goal, this proposal is unjust and illogical.
The cost of solving the overproduction problems caused by a small number of Member States will be covered by others, in particular the new Member States, which after all have much lower BÂ quotas.
Why should they have to do so?
The old EU Member States have been allocated a BÂ sugar quota of 2.7 million tonnes, whereas the new Member States have only been allocated 0.12 million tonnes.
Environmental concerns have also been passed over in the reform that has been proposed.
Farmers will be forced to intensify their production of sugar beet and to concentrate it in selected countries and regions, all for the sake of increased competitiveness.
What does this have to do with environmental protection?
This reform will also work to the detriment of social, economic and regional cohesion.
It will result in even more farms going out of business and in redundancies at sugar factories, which runs counter to the Lisbon Strategy.
The proposed reform of the sugar market is based on a strange concept of solidarity, for which we unfortunately have the Commission and certain governments to thank.
The sugar market reform under discussion stands in contradiction to the common agricultural policy.
Once again, it is becoming apparent that this policy is commonâŠ
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have always maintained, both in committee and in Parliament, that the Commissionâs haste in pushing through its proposal â to the extent of breaking institutional and Community rules â was suspicious to say the least.
The reason for such haste seemed obvious: after the World Trade Organisation negotiations, the Commissioner would certainly find it more difficult to gain approval for a reform characterised above all by major price cuts and partial compensation for losses.
Madam President, while agreeing that reform is needed, my group has always demanded that it should not only bring in the necessary changes, but above all not lose sight of the essential aim of keeping the sector internationally competitive in the medium and long term.
We have therefore been opposed to the Commissionâs proposal right from the start, because it aims at concentrating production in certain Member States by sacrificing the less suitable, weaker areas; thus only some areas will have to pay the price of the inevitable overall cut in European production.
Fortunately, the Council has mitigated the Commissionâs original proposal, partly by introducing the chance for Member States to grant production-linked aid, up to a maximum of 30%, although the compromise achieved is not fully satisfactory and will still penalise the sector too much.
At this stage Parliament must, in any case, accept the responsibilities conferred on it by the Treaties and adopt its own position.
Although it will be very difficult to reopen a debate that is now closed, when the Council comes to formally approve the reform, it must consider the possibility of including some of the vital amendments proposed by Parliament to improve the text.
These include, for instance, maintaining the intervention system until 2010; varying compensatory aid according to production; making it mandatory to allocate at least 50% of the restructuring aid to sugar beet and chicory growers, to offset their loss of income; and reformulating the conditions for access to the restructuring system through the signing of a trade agreement with the sugar beet and chicory growers.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I recommend that you do not approve the three reports dealing with the reform of the sugar regime.
This is a reform that works against the growth, rural employment and economy of the least developed regions of the European Union and, as such, against the Lisbon Strategy as well.
The reform is not improved sufficiently even by the better amendment proposals contained in Mr Fruteauâs reports, and it will lead to the European Union losing its unique chance to play a leading role in the liberalisation of agrarian trade within the WTO framework.
This is highly regrettable, because the assumption of a leading role in this issue would enable us to achieve our objectives in negotiations on the liberalisation of trade in non-agricultural commodities.
The main problem is that, rather than relying on natural market forces to correct the current over-bureaucratised regime, the reform employs a new array of untried, non-market and complex administrative restrictions.
Neither quantity nor price regulation, for instance, are used in the trade in more important commodities, such as flour or cereals.
The need for a different type of reform is further prompted by the profound changes in the economics of bioenergy.
For these reasons, I have already submitted proposals for a market-based regulatory system to the relevant authorities.
On the question of the Fruteau reports, the House should give its support, in particular, to the recommendation of the AGRI committee, under which the Council would never be allowed to conclude a final political agreement without consulting the European Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your support.
Â Â  Madam President, I first wish to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Fruteau, and MrÂ Daul, as Chairman of the Committee, who, through their cooperation, have produced an excellent report on the issue of sugar, and one which we will have no trouble voting in favour of this week.
Although this sugar reform is vital, however, the question here is also how this process is to be undertaken and how farmers will experience it in the different Member States, and especially whether farmers in the Member States will think that they are being treated fairly in this respect.
For example, in my country, Finland, there was fear for a long time that the original Commission proposal on this subject would end sugar cultivation in our country entirely.
That would certainly have happened if the Commissionâs original decision had come into force.
Now in Finland another sugar plant has to be closed by virtue of the impending decision and Finland itself has to pay a subsidy to its producers.
There is no way anyone can say that Finland has gained from this, but now it is important that you, Commissioner, assure Finnish farmers as well as farmers in the other small Member States that in future, agreements will be kept to and that all countries will be able to engage in farming.
This way needless fears can be dispelled.
Another issue is that it has been said in public that the decision has now already been taken and that Parliament can no longer do anything about it here.
This is the wrong impression to give, and I hope, Commissioner, that you will reassure us that in all matters relating to agriculture, Parliament will always be heard in good time and that there will always be cooperation.
Then our citizens will have confidence that this system actually works.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.
I think the text is appreciably better than the Councilâs compromise text, because it points out a way to achieve much-needed reform without drastically penalising the agricultural sector and its production, particularly in the less favoured regions.
The Council compromise gives cause for concern above all because of the repercussions it would have on less suitable areas, even though the cuts in aid have been substantially reduced, while the four-year extension certainly remains an unsustainable cut-off point.
Commissioner and representatives of the Council, what I am asking â so as not to dwell on matters already dealt with by other Members â is for you to appreciate the considerable understanding shown by the committee and its Chairman, Mr Daul â the whole committee in fact â regarding the change in procedure that led to the informal compromise, in order to provide a more suitable negotiating position at the WTO.
I also ask you to return the favour of Parliamentâs understanding by accepting the proposed improvements to the text, which are sure to be adopted by this House, particularly so as to allow for transitional state aid in the least favoured regions and to readjust the compensation paid to farmers, especially from the restructuring fund.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Fruteau for having prepared these three particularly important presentations on reform in the sugar sector.
As early as last November, the Council agreed on the common principles of the organisation of the sugar market and the directions for reform.
That was a very important decision, welcomed by us all; first, because it demonstrated our ability to agree on issues that are important to the entire Community, which unifies the Union and, second, it has strengthened our negotiating position in Hong Kong.
We have shown that the Community not only articulates ideas, but is also able to take specific actions.
The Community comprehends and consistently prepares to meet the challenges of globalisation.
It is a shame, of course, that the agreement was accepted by the Council without having consulted the European Parliament, which represents the interests of the European people.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the way the reform has been designed and planned is very important, but its implementation is of even greater significance.
Therefore, restructuring is a cornerstone of all three reports.
In Lithuania, the major sugar manufacturer is the Danish company Danisco Sugar.
It operates factories not only in Lithuania, but also in Sweden, Germany and Finland.
It is evident that the proposed reform will encourage to maintain the most efficient factories while decommissioning those operating at a loss.
However, what we need to do is take into account the interests of the employees, as well as those of raw material growers, and ensure that they are not abandoned.
Therefore, the reform must, first and foremost, facilitate the production of alternative products and create new businesses, and not only arrange an exit from the market.
Austria and Finland promised to complete the reform by the end of the year.
The reform will only be a success if it takes into account the interests of all market players.
Â Â  Madam President, whenever it is stated that the ACP countries will suffer if the EUâs chaotic sugar arrangements are abolished, the underlying agenda is always protection of the EUâs own production.
If the ACP countries are to suffer as a result of these arrangements being abolished, it is of course because, with our absurd trading system, we have kept them in conditions resembling those of slavery, and if slaves are freed without being helped to cope successfully, they are obviously in a worse situation than before.
We should help the ACP countries to develop sustainable production.
It is grotesque that we only give them a pittance, when we richly reward our own sugar producers and sugar industry.
The sum of EURÂ 200Â million proposed by Glenys Kinnock is an absolute minimum.
There is a lot of money to be saved by phasing out the common organisation of the market in sugar, so such compensation is amply affordable.
We should also be very pleased about the fact that many developing countries would benefit from the liberalisation of the sugar market.
The social and environmental problems that are demonstrably to be found in many places must be solved through the ILO and the environmental conventions.
We must support those forces that are endeavouring to have the relevant requirements implemented, for example in Brazil, and, above all, we must have those requirements accepted by the WTO as obvious trading conditions.
Â Â  â I am sorry but today's debate, as far as Parliament's opinion on the sugar industry is concerned, is a mockery, given that the Council has decided and the national governments are planning to implement the harsh, anti-farming decision under which thousands of small and medium-sized holdings will be wiped out, sugar factories will close and the workers will join the ranks of the unemployed.
Already in Greece farmers and workers are demonstrating.
The decisions in the new regulation drastically cut quotas and institutional prices and abolish intervention.
They come under the philosophy of the new CAP and constitute tools which aim to reduce resources for farming and channel them to the repressive policies of the European Union on the pretext of terrorism.
At the same time, the decisions by the WTO demonstrate that farming â and, of course, sugar â have come under the guillotine in order to favour the interests and profitability of European industrial capital through its increased, unimpeded penetration into developing countries, so that it can exploit them better.
The rapporteur is trying with his proposals to delay the repercussions somewhat.
Unfortunately, a quick or a slower death for the sugar industry ...
Â Â  Madam President, like the last speaker, I too wonder why we are considering these proposals.
Surely the Council made a decision on 22Â November and it is now a .
However, if Parliament is determined to have its say, we should remember that the sugar regime has existed virtually unchanged for almost 40Â years, and yet here we are trying to introduce wholesale change almost overnight.
It is a sick system which has badly needed reform for many years. However, the draconian solutions being proposed â that is, the medicine for the sickness â are likely to kill the patient in the process: it is estimated that the new regime will cause the loss of 100Â 000 jobs in Europe and put an end to sugar farming in countries such as Greece and Ireland.
It is also likely to do incomparable damage to the economies of many European former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean, which were major beneficiaries of the old regime.
I am also painfully aware that my own constituency in the east of England contains a major part of the UKâs sugar farming.
I recommend that a proper study of the effects of the new regime should be made without delay.
Never let it be forgotten that our actions affect human beings out there in the real world, beyond our cloistered environment.
It is a shameful indictment of this centralised bureaucratic form of government that it has taken so long to act, even then only under pressure from the WTO, and that so many people will suffer as a result.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, the reform of the sugar market that we are considering today is a pseudo-reform that is dangerous, unjust, dishonest and antisocial.
It is dangerous because it will result in the EU becoming dependent on sugar supplies from the rest of the world, which will be to the detriment of our continentâs food security.
It is unjust because the subsidised exports of BÂ sugar that cause so many problems were primarily the brainchild of France and Germany, yet it is the EU as a whole that pays the price, and the new Member States that suffer the most.
Instead of eliminating export surpluses, the proposal strikes at the heart of sugar production throughout Europe.
Only a few years ago, the large sugar companies in Poland paid a very low price for factories that had been privatised.
These same companies will now receive several times more money for closing the factories down.
This is merely one example of why the reform is dishonest.
Finally, the reform is antisocial because it ignores the plight of thousands of farmers and sugar factory workers who will lose their livelihoods, and who will find it hard to find new jobs.
This pseudo-reform is worthy of the title , like the gangster film.
The large sugar companies will make hundreds of millions of euros by relocating their businesses outside the European Union.
We should reject this pseudo-reform for Europeâs sake.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, the common market for sugar had largely been working well since 1968, as borne out by the figures: we were producing 20 million, consuming 16 million and only exporting four million, as against Brazilâs figure of 13 million.
Free trade devotees tell us, however, that European sugar has created economic diabetes among the poor countries.
Accordingly, in order to eradicate poverty in the sugar cane world, sugar must be eradicated from the Europe of sugar beet.
This outlook has led to three Community regulations, along with a 36% price cut â and the accompanying drop in revenue â and the opening up of the market in 2009 to triangular trade in sugar via the Balkans or the least developed countries, to the benefit, of course, of the large operators.
The upshot of all this is clear to all.
Despite MrÂ Fruteauâs laudable efforts, we are set to become sugar importers, the European taxpayer will have to foot the bill for a series of indemnities to the ACP and, after 2015, Europeâs agri-food industry will be shoved aside.
Furthermore, given that by 2015 China and India are set to be huge agri-food importers, Brazil will be feeding Asia while Europe is out of the picture.
Just one question, Commissioner: why, 20 years on, do you dislike the small farmers of EuropeÂ ...
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to express my particular thanks to the rapporteur for his work.
I can support this compromise, which was reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development following intensive discussions and negotiations; but at the same time we have to be aware of the impact these three reports have on European agriculture in general and beet farmers in particular, and on the sugar industry.
The sugar sector is an example of the extent of the WTOâs influence on the economies of individual States, and also on that of the EU as a whole.
The Agriculture Committee has succeeded in moderating quite a few of the Commissionâs proposals, and I think that the result is most acceptable.
I hope that the final negotiations between the Council and the Commission will see a good deal more of the Agriculture Committeeâs demands taken on board.
The cultivation of energy crops offers farmers at least some opportunity to find alternatives to sugar-beet growing and to promote non-food production â which is vital and also forward looking.
Following the reform of the CAP, European agriculture has to undergo its next major reform very soon.
We must nevertheless accept that we live in an interconnected world, and that stubborn insistence on the status quo is certainly not a viable alternative.
The Agriculture Committee is of the opinion that, in future, there must be the possibility of obliging the Council to wait for Parliament to take its decisions before taking its own decision.
This was an exceptional situation, in view of which I support the procedure.
I hope that, in the final reckoning, we shall continue to have beet farmers and an active, attractive sugar industry, in the future.
Â Â  Madam President, in November, the Council decided to reform the European sugar sector by reducing prices by 36% over four years, and paying compensation of more than EUR 7 billion to the European sugar sector.
It is important that some of this compensation should go not only to the farmers and industry, but also to the workers who are likely to lose their jobs as a result of the reforms.
They should not be overlooked, and I should like to hear the Commissioner commit to support for retraining them, thus allowing them to find appropriate employment.
I am behind the Councilâs decision not to delay any longer free access for sugar from the least developed countries under âEverything But Armsâ.
This is about people for whom, certainly when prices plummet, sugar exports are of vital importance.
We must deliver on our promises and open up our market in 2009; we have procrastinated long enough.
I regret the Councilâs decision not to bite the bullet as far as abolishing C-sugar is concerned. Since C-sugar distorts the world market price, it would be better for us to look for alternative end uses for possible surpluses, such as energy production.
I would like to ask the Commissioner if he can guarantee at this stage that C-sugar will be abolished.
I can understand why you have decided to introduce a 25% regulation in order to counter triangular trade, but can you confirm that this investigation, if it reaches beyond 25%, is intended only to counter triangular trade and not to flag other issues?
Can you confirm that it will not have a delaying effect?
Commissioner Mandelson said yesterday that it is true that we need 200 million if we are to be serious about helping the ACP countries.
Mr Fruteau was right to say that 40 million is unacceptable.
It is unclear where that money is to be found.
It should be new and fresh funds.
Can you promise that the Commission will in any event make every effort to find those 200 million per year and that this will not be at the expense of Category 4 development budget?
The fact is that that really would be funding the poorest countries from their own pocket, and that is the wrong type of solidarity.
Â Â  Madam President, all we can say is that this debate is a bit too late in the day.
The Commissioner, whom I would like to congratulate on the fact that the bulk of her ideas have been adopted by the Council, was tactful enough to say that Parliament had had a great deal of influence.
Although I should like to congratulate Mr Fruteau on this, I realise that what we will decide in a resolution today or tomorrow will have little effect on the final outcome.
I too felt that the sugar reforms were necessary.
We have come in for some criticism from the WTO panel; we now have a weapons agreement which we must adhere to and allow for.
The farmers in the Member States are getting a raw deal, as are the farmers in the ACP countries.
I agree with the many who stated that sugar will not be the key product for the ACP countries; just as important will be the energy production.
We have the technology â which is already being applied in Brazil and elsewhere â by means of which sugar cane is directly converted into alcohol.
I would encourage the Commission to give the ACP countries maximum support in this process, for it would be preferable to use sugar cane for energy production in those countries, provided, that is, that they are in the tropics.
Another problem has meanwhile cropped up.
If I have been reliably informed, the European market will soon be flooded with a surplus of some 2 million tonnes of sugar. That is because exports have dropped and the harvest has been good.
There is still a large supply of intervention sugar and it looks like in the first year, the level of participation in the restructuring process will be lower than expected.
I would like to put a quick question to the Commission. What does it intend to do in the short term about this surplus of 2 millions tonnes of sugar?
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, the sugar reform, as it is currently before us, will be pernicious to poor developing countries and ACP countries that are now losing their access to the market or are given lower prices for their products.
As far as I am concerned, every agricultural reform that harms developing countries is a bad one.
This reform also deals a lethal blow to the incomes of thousands of farmers and workers in the sugar industry, and the absence of a proper social plan to mitigate it turns this into a worthless exercise.
Finally, this reform does not benefit the European taxpayer in any way because it is budget-neutral.
Given these three considerations, we can sum this reform up as a disaster.
There is no question that the European sugar policy should be reformed, but not in a way from which only major food producers benefit.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, todayâs debate has raised many questions, in particular with regard to the impact the reform will have on the new Member States.
The question we should be asking is whether something extraordinary has happened to the worldâs sugar trade or sugar production in the two years since the EU underwent its last enlargement to justify such a sudden change in sugar policy, and the answer to this question is ânoâ.
I mention this because the effects of this reform will hit the new Member States hardest.
It is not uncommon for farmers in these countries to have invested all their savings in their farms, even though they have been treated unfairly.
I would remind the House that farmers in the old EU Member States receive three times more in land subsidies than those in the new Member States.
This reform has no doubt been several years in the making, which means that the public in the new Member States was intentionally misled, or even deceived, at the time of accession.
Implementation of this reform will be further proof that the idea of European solidarity and genuine assistance for the new Member States is an illusion.
Genuine assistance means giving the new Member States a real chance to develop their economies, rather than granting them subsidies on a short-term basis.
One or even several countries can be outvoted, but the Polish public is opposed to a reform of this kind, and objects to being constantly cheated.
I too would be happy to do without an EU that is run along these lines.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Fruteau for his accomplished work of such considerable scope.
Sugar has always been and, I believe, will remain a strategic product.
So the ongoing struggles in relation to the rules and regulations of sugar production and trade are not accidental.
We must not forget that a considerable part of the EU economy is related to this product, from agriculture to industry, with people working in all the sectors.
These people create a large part of the GDP; they earn their livings, provide for their families and raise children.
Thus, in pursuing the reforms, we have no right to disregard those people, our citizens.
We cannot ignore their interests or allow any threat to their employment and income.
And that is exactly the threat that I see.
It is a pity that whilst submitting the proposal, the Commission paid little regard to the opinion submitted by the European Parliament.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur tried to improve the proposal, but I am not sure they fully succeeded.
I tend to think that the reform is much more beneficial to developing countries and the transnational companies hiding behind them, or large businesses, rather than to the most vulnerable circle of the EU community, that is, farmers, factory workers, and in general, residents of the rural areas.
Therefore, in my opinion, the submitted proposal, even though largely improved by the Agriculture Committee, is inappropriate, unfair and insensitive; and it will strike hard at millions of rural residents who already live poorly as it is.
Â Â  MrÂ DidÅŸiokas, you are talking too quickly, and reading out your speeches too quickly, and you are not the only one.
The interpreters cannot keep up with you, and so time is wasted.
It will be of much greater benefit to what you want to convey if you speak either more slowly or without a prepared speech.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, as we know, from as early as 1968, Europe has sought to ensure that it is able to meet its own sugar needs; that is to say, that it is in a position to satisfy demand by means of its own production wherever possible.
As with many good intentions, this went wrong along the way and undoubtedly began to constitute a problem.
Our sugar-beet farmers simply do not stand a chance of competing with the hot climate and low wages of the tropics â although it has to be said, of course, that our sugar is not produced using either slash-and-burn or child labour, nor is it transported halfway round the world, which undoubtedly protects the environment, too.
Allowing beet farmers to produce ever greater surpluses and sell them on the world market at subsidised prices, so to speak, and thus making them competitors to all of those who could actually produce sugar far more cheaply, created a system that was bound to collapse sooner or later.
Yet instead of slow, sensitive regulatory intervention to avert the worst-case scenario, the response was to look the other way for decades.
The last straw seems to have been the agreement with ACP countries on the re-export of their sugar, which was subsidised to the tune of EURÂ 800Â million.
This is a most peculiar kind of development aid.
Previously, subsidised EU sugar exports were regarded as immoral; now they are illegal.
We shall have to work hard, therefore, to ensure that our farmers, our sugar factories and the workers in these factories emerge unscathed, as far as possible, from this mess of our own making.
Â Â  The debate is suspended until 9Â p.m.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0676/2005).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Interpol, which is an admirable and valuable organisation, and which is situated on European Union territory, has a number of databases â on stolen documents, on stolen works of art, on wanted criminals, on fingerprints, etc. These databases are available to the law enforcement forces of the world.
Is the Commission satisfied that the operation of these databases is fully in accord with the data privacy laws of the Union?
Â Â  . The Commission supports cooperation between Interpol and European Member States as well as EU bodies such as Europol.
At the same time, as pointed out in the 2004 Commission proposal for a Council common position on the transfer of certain data to Interpol, applicable data protection rules must be respected.
This was confirmed by the Council common position of 24Â January 2005 on exchanging certain data with Interpol. It notably concerns lost or stolen passports.
It underlined that the conditions of the exchange shall be agreed with Interpol in order to ensure â and I would like to stress the following â that the data exchanged will respect the data protection principles that lie at the heart of data exchange within the Union, particularly with regard to the exchange and automatic processing of such data.
I should add that the control of personal data by Interpol shall be ensured by the rules on the control of information and access to Interpolâs files.
In particular these rules establish a commission for the control of Interpolâs files and govern the composition, role and functions of that commission.
The current chairman of the commission is Mr Hustinx, who is currently also the EU data protection supervisor.
Â Â  I wish to ask a supplementary question.
I want to thank the Commissioner for his very careful reply and, although I am taking Italian lessons, I appreciate the fact that he gave it in his very good English.
It is a complicated reply, and therefore difficult to take on board.
However, I noted that he referred to the Council position of January 2005 covering stolen passports. That is clearly in order.
However, I wonder whether he could assure me that the other databases I mentioned â on works of art, wanted criminals and fingerprints â are also satisfactorily covered by the Council position?
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the honourable Member for his supplementary question as well.
The Council has laid down very clear guidelines and the Commission will monitor compliance with these rules, which will apply to all the databases on which Interpol works.
I refer in particular to certain key principles regarding data protection: who is entitled to access the data; for what specific and predetermined purposes; how long can data be retained; and, above all, who will be entitled to use them and in what circumstances?
As you know, we have recently put forward a draft framework decision on data protection under the third pillar.
This is the very first proposal of this kind, and it further expands the field of data protection in the context of police cooperation.
Â Â  . Mr President, the management of water resources in the area of the Mediterranean is a challenge for us all from the point of view both of the quality and the availability of water.
The problem of water shortages in the Mediterranean is intensifying due, on the one hand, to the increased demand for water in certain sectors and areas and, on the other hand, to the repercussions of climate change.
As regards climate change, I would like to comment that, from a scientific point of view, it is difficult to maintain that isolated cases of droughts are directly connected to climate change; nonetheless, we know that climate change contributes to more severe phenomena which are manifesting more and more regularly and over larger geographical areas.
We requested and have received a report from the EU Joint Research Centre on the links between climate change and water, water shortages and droughts.
In general, protection of our water resources is one of the priorities of the environmental policy of the European Union.
In fact, the European Union has radically restructured its policy in the water sector with the relevant framework directive.
In this way it sent a political message well beyond its territory.
One of the basic principles of the European Union's policy in the water sector is cooperation between the regions in various Member States which share common water resources.
For this purpose, the so-called EU Water Initiative was adopted, within the framework of which the European Union and its Member States have undertaken to achieve the Millennium Goals as regards the water sector.
Following this, the Commission launched a joint procedure between the framework directive and the EU Water Initiative, a procedure which Greece headed for the part of the initiative concerning the Mediterranean.
The aim of this cooperation is to facilitate the application of policies of proper administration of water resources in the Mediterranean countries, by adhering to the principles of the Community Water Framework Directive.
Consequently, with the Member States of the European Union and third Mediterranean countries working together, working groups have been set up, one of which will address the issue of water shortages, and guidelines will be drafted by the end of this year, which will be addressed both to the countries of the European Union and to the other Mediterranean countries.
Measures will also be proposed to prevent and manage water shortages and droughts.
Water is one of the priorities of the short-term environmental action plan, known as SÎÎÎ¡, which is being applied at regional level.
Monitoring SMAP actions forms part of the programme and there are reports available for most of these actions.
A detailed evaluation of the programme will be scheduled this year and the results will be at your disposal.
So far, evidence from the application of SÎÎÎ¡ is positive and is contributing to the promotion and exchange of experiences and best practices, especially in the water sector.
Under the SÎÎÎ¡ 2 programme between 2000 and 2005, two of the eight projects â with a Community contribution of EUR 6.2 million â directly concerned water management.
The next generation of the SÎÎÎ¡ programme, SÎÎÎ¡ 3, will focus on the preparation of overall coastal zone management plans and will make provision for technical assistance to be provided to the Member States' governments.
Already various relevant plans are at the signature stage and are expected to last three years from January 2006.
Â Â  â Commissioner, thank you very much for the information you have given me in your reply as regards EU policy within the framework of the 25 countries and its cooperation with third countries in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, especially within the framework of the Mediterranean basin.
I wanted to ask if you currently have more detailed and more specific information available on the question of the guidelines which the European Commission will issue as regards public and private investment within the framework of Barcelona II, because the water sector is a very important sector for the quality of life and equal development which we want to achieve in the Mediterranean basin.
Â Â  . To be specific, I should like to say first of all that we have various means of financing available both for the countries of the European Union and for neighbouring countries.
Basically, they are: the Cohesion Fund, the Regional Development Fund, the Rural Development Fund and so forth. However, there is also money for neighbouring countries.
Of course, all this depends on progress with the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013.
We also have a series of measures available both to European and to neighbouring Mediterranean countries from the EU Water Initiative, especially the initiative for water in the Mediterranean and, also, a series of directives for best practices which, of course, will have the relevant financial support.
Â Â  Commissioner, in its 2004 report, the European Environment Agency stated that the temperature in Europe had increased by one degree above the average for the rest of the world.
Has the Commission looked into the establishment of a European Drought Monitoring Centre?
Another consequence of the drought is the devastating fires.
Has the Commission looked into any financial aid for preventing fires and alleviating their effects in the rural areas in question?
Â Â  . Indeed, the European Environment Agency, in a report which it filed two months ago, noted and emphasised that environmental priorities for the Mediterranean area include drought and the prevention and management of drought situations and water shortages, which hit countries such as Portugal and Spain in particular this year.
As regards the drought in Portugal and Spain, the European Union Cohesion Fund provided funds to adapt and support measures already financed some time ago in order to deal with similar weather phenomena.
As regards long-term measures, the European Union will fund Spain with more than EUR 1Â 300 million to support the new Spanish plan on the management and use of water.
In future, special attention will be paid to measures to prevent and manage droughts and water shortages.
I must also stress that the Environment Agency emphasised in its report the importance of other emergent threats in the area of the Mediterranean, especially for ecosystems, from changes in temperatures and rainfall in the area, which have various consequences.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this afternoon, we discussed the security of energy supply with CommissionerÂ Piebalgs.
What role does the Commissioner see in this Water Framework Directive for renewable energy, which, of course, represents a quite fundamental future strategy for the security of our energy supply?
Â Â  . Renewable energy is one of our priorities at the moment.
We have a green paper on renewable energy, which we are trying to promote by various means.
We also have targets for the European Union for 2002 and 2020.
We have not succeeded yet, but we hope to achieve those targets through the various means and measures we are proposing.
To this effect, we have the second phase of the European climate change programme, which promotes renewable energy sources, and we are proposing a series of measures in support of such energy sources.
At the same time, the Commission is currently discussing a strategy for biofuels, which provide a means not only of securing energy resources within the European Union, but also of answering the problems that will be created for farmers by the new agricultural policy, as well as limiting greenhouse gases and dealing with other environmental problems.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to Parliamentâs resolution on the Member Statesâ implementation of Directive 96/71/EC on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services.
Social partners from all sectors were involved in discussions on the resolution, and asked to provide further information in the form of an extensive questionnaire.
The latter was also forwarded to the administrative bodies of the Member States, which is the follow-up procedure for all Parliament resolutions.
The Commission lent its support to a research project carried out by the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers on the practical impact of the Posting of Workers Directive, which was followed up by a conference.
The end result was a draft second report on the implementation of Directive 96/71/EC, which covers the same issues as Parliamentâs resolution.
The Commission services are currently in the process of finalising this draft report, and it will be adopted in the near future.
The Commission has played an active role in both implementing the Directive in practice and improving cooperation in the field of information provision by working together with a group of specialists from the Member States.
One of the outcomes of this groupâs work has been a code of conduct, along with guidelines for cooperation and multilingual documents for informal exchanges of information.
The aim of these latter is to facilitate communication between contact points and monitoring bodies.
In addition, a dedicated website has been launched on the posting of workers, which contains key information in three languages on the legal framework governing the posting of workers and links to related documents and websites set up by the Member States that cover problems relating to the posting of workers.
The website also provides the public with access to a list of contact points and monitoring bodies, which means that official bodies and individuals can find out about the appropriate contact points in the various Member States.
I have been informed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has decided to draft an own-initiative report on the impact of Directive 96/71/EC on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services.
A hearing on this report will be held on 26Â JanuaryÂ 2006.
I will be very interested to learn the outcome of this hearing, and I would welcome the opportunity to cooperate with Parliament on this key issue.
Â Â  Thank you for your reply, Commissioner Å pidla.
I should like some clarification on whether the report, which you indicate as being finalised, is the report dated 15Â November 2005 that has already been circulated in draft form to the social partners.
If so, would you undertake to circulate this report to the Members of the European Parliament, in particular to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs?
Would you not agree that the experience to date of the Posting of Workers Directive indicates that amendments are required in order to clarify the application of that directive to the delivery of services from third countries, such as Turkey, and also from some other Member States?
I am thinking in particular of the Vaxholm-Laval case, which is clearly a challenge in my view to the operation of the directive.
Finally, could you indicate what statistics you have with regard to the number of posted workers and labour inspectorates in the various Member States and the effectiveness of those inspectors?
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the document to which MrÂ DeÂ Rossa referred is indeed the report I mentioned.
The document that has been distributed to the social partners is the original text, which we are still working on, and our assumption is that it will be discussed with Parliament.
I shall now move on to the subject of statistics.
Statistical information will be included in the report, although some of the details still need to be finalised, since interpreting statistical data is always an extremely complex task.
For the time being, the Commission does not believe that any legislative amendments to the Directive are needed.
What is needed, however, is better enforcement of the Directiveâs implementation in practice, and I have outlined some of the measures that the Commission has already taken to this end.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his clear statements.
Am I right in assuming that he does not consider the setting of quotas for third-country workers to be the right course of action for the European internal market; and that, when he works on the proposals for the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive, he will actively take into account the French study that concludes that the existing system provided for in the directive is not working in the Member States?
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to admit that I was not able to identify the report to which MrÂ Schwab was referring from the quote he used.
I will be able to provide a more accurate answer after I have checked the quote for myself.
Access for workers from third countries is a policy which is embodied in EU legislation, and which applies to all the Member States.
If the honourable Member wishes to discuss amendments to the rules on third-country workers in more detail, I would of course be more than happy to do so.
Â Â  I would thank the Commissioner for his answer and am pleased to see that the Commission will cooperate with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs now that we are dealing with the issue in an own-initiative report introduced in connection with the Posting of Workers Directive.
The fact is that it has become apparent â especially from the messages that have come from the Commission concerning various signals pertaining to the Vaxholm case â that the Posting of Workers Directive is not nearly so crystal clear as might be wished.
The intention, of course, is that posted workers should be allowed to work under roughly the same conditions as people in the country to which they have been posted.
My question is as follows: is this directive adapted to all labour market models within the EU or only to those governed by legislation and collective agreements declared to be universally applicable?
Do you think it is adapted to the Scandinavian model, which involves collective agreements that are not declared to be universally applicable and under which each company is negotiated with separately?
Or is a change needed whereby that particular labour market model would also be included?
Â Â  .Â Â Â No opt-outs were provided for any of the Member Statesâ systems when the directive was debated and adopted, and it therefore applies universally.
I can well imagine that interpretation of the directive is far from simple at times, since it incorporates a global concept of the European Union and covers all the different forms of labour relations.
As far as the Commissionâs basic approach to this matter is concerned, you will be aware that the Laval case is pending before the European Court of Justice, and so I have no choice but to say that it would be wrong for me to adopt a specific position.
Generally speaking, I can say that in principle the Commissionâs comments should not call any Member Stateâs social model per se into question.
They should, however, unfailingly uphold the principle that the economic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty can be combined with the various social models.
In other words, the directive was intended from the outset to provide protection to posted workers at a level that is appropriate for the given Member State.
Interpretation may be problematic in certain cases, as I said before, but this is the principle which underpins the Directive, and which applies to all the Member States.
Â Â  Commissioner, could you just clarify for me, in your comments regarding the Vaxholm case, that you are not in a position to comment?
Is the Commission not, in fact, permitted and indeed obliged to make a submission to the European Court of Justice with regard to its view on the issues at stake in that case?
Has it not in fact been asked by the Court to make such a submission?
Â Â  Mr De Rossa, although this is not strictly speaking a point of order, if Mr Å pidla is able to answer this question in 15 seconds, I shall give him the floor.
Â Â  . As you will be aware, and as I said a few minutes ago, the Laval case is currently pending before the European Court of Justice, and the Commission services are at present preparing the Commissionâs comments.
In principle, these latter should not call any Member Stateâs social model per se into question They should, however, unfailingly uphold the principle that the economic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty can be combined with the various social models.
As previous speakers have already noted, there need be no contradiction between the two goals of supporting fair economic competition and guaranteeing protection for workers.
It is self-evident that any social model that is implemented must comply fully with the goals and fundamental principles of Community legislation and that it must observe these latter, in particular when it comes to such principles as legitimacy of aim, objective justification and proportionality.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is in the process of preparing an opinion that will form part of proceedings before the European Court of Justice.
As I have already said, it is impossible for me to go into details at this point in time, and indeed it would be wrong for me to do so.
Â Â  .
Thank you for the question, in response to which I can state that the Commission has absolutely no plans to harmonise direct company taxation.
As is outlined in the Commission communication of 25Â October 2005 on the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission intends to carry out the necessary preparatory work towards a common consolidated tax base over the next three years, with a view to presenting a Community legislative measure by 2008.
The Commission does not intend to propose a harmonised corporate tax rate, which is just part of the overall area we would like to harmonise.
As regards vulnerable areas of less populous Member States, it should be borne in mind that, under Community state aid rules, Member States have to respect strict conditions when providing for preferential tax regimes in favour of companies undertaking investments in assisted areas, under national regional state aid guidelines for promoting the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas of the European Union.
State aid rules remain applicable to any state measures which may be enacted in the context of a common consolidated tax base initiative.
The preparatory work by the Commission has not yet reached the stage of examining the impact of a common consolidated tax base on different regions within Member States.
Any legislative proposal submitted by the Commission after this work has been carried out will, in any case, be accompanied by an appropriate impact assessment.
On the other hand, I should point out that the common consolidated tax base has been identified as an important tool for helping the Community achieve the Lisbon goals.
It will help to reduce compliance costs and to encourage cross-border activities, which will lead to a higher rate of economic growth and employment and a higher level of competitiveness across the whole of the European Union.
Â Â  â Commissioner, your reply satisfies me completely.
I should like to ask you to comment on the question of small and medium-sized enterprises, by which I mean whether they will be taken into account by the Commission as a special group within European enterprises as a whole.
Â Â  . My answer is a definite âyesâ.
The Commission considers the SMEs to be a special group which is to be supported as it provides a large number of jobs.
According to my judgement, the common consolidated corporate tax base will give a special advantage to the SMEs, which are in a less favourable position than the multinationals.
So, if there is one group which will profit from the common consolidated tax base, it will be the SMEs.
Â Â  . On 13Â December 2005 the Commission welcomed the ruling of the Court of Justice in the MarksÂ [amp]Â Spencer case on cross-border loss relief.
The Court has interpreted the principle of freedom of establishment for cross-border loss relief in a way that is in compliance with the logic and philosophy of the single market and in a way that is supported by the Commission.
The Commission has to continue its efforts to eliminate all obstacles preventing companies from reaping the full benefits of the internal market.
The Commission therefore intends to come forward with a communication in the near future in which it will outline its views on cross-border loss relief.
This communication will go beyond the specific case of MarksÂ [amp]Â Spencer and focus on the economic aspects.
The Commission knows that this is a difficult subject as Member States are rightly concerned about the need to protect their tax revenues, but at the same time it is clear that it cannot accept that obstacles to the internal market continue to hamper companies from making investments and creating growth and employment in line with the objectives which it has set itself as part of the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  â Commissioner, you have not answered my question.
The Marks [amp] Spencer case highlights double tax dumping.
We have different rates and different approaches between the Member States to the taxation of multinational companies with parent companies and subsidiaries within the framework of the European Union.
The ruling by the Court of Justice perhaps highlights rather than deals with the problem.
I ask you again: what does the Commission intend to do in order to limit tax evasion by large multinational groups and stem the loss of public revenue to the Member States?
Does it intend to take any legislative initiative?
Otherwise, why do you talk of Economic and Monetary Union?
Â Â  . The Commissionâs interpretation of the ruling of the ECJ on the Marks [amp] Spencer case is fully in compliance with the ECJâs ruling.
The problem in that case was that while United Kingdom law permits loss relief inside the United Kingdom market, the same is not permitted in the case of other companies or branches of Marks [amp] Spencer in different Member States â one in Germany and one in Belgium.
The ECJ ruling, in compliance with the philosophy of the internal market, was in favour of Marks [amp] Spencer and the Commission fully supported that.
The Commission wants to study carefully the budgetary consequences of such rulings and try to take the initiative to have better coordination within the tax policy of the Member States: if not harmonisation, at least coordination is needed in order to avoid such problems.
To conclude, I want to refer to the first question concerning the common consolidated corporate tax base, which would solve the problem.
The difficulty is that, as I have already said, in the best case, if everything goes smoothly and well, we will come up with the legislative proposal no earlier than 2008, so we still have two years in which to provide some temporary solution.
Â Â  . The sector study referred to by the honourable Member was commissioned by the Commission in 2004 from Wik Consult in order to assist ongoing work on the gradual opening-up to competition of the European postal market.
The views expressed in the study are those of the consultant.
The study is merely one of several elements that the Commission is considering in looking at various options and their possible consequences.
In addition to the regular consultation with stakeholders and notably an online public consultation currently under way, the study actually serves as a platform to engage in a transparent and open debate on the conditions for enabling the further phasing-in of competition in the postal market.
It is the understanding of the Commission that the approach taken by the consultancy on the issue of the uniform tariff and the frequency of delivery was an attempt to give more flexibility to the public postal operator in order to sustain a viable and efficient universal service in the long term.
The current Postal Directive 97/67/EC, as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC, does not impose a uniform tariff but requires a minimum frequency of delivery of five days a week.
The Commission can assure the honourable Member that on all aspects of the postal reform in the European Union, including both the issues mentioned, it will try its best to strike the right balance between the necessary degree of harmonisation at EU level and those conditions to be fixed at Member State level, which would reflect the very different characteristics of each national postal market.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I should like to be given an answer to my final question: that about whether thought had been given to what the consequences might be for inhabitants of sparsely populated regions.
This perhaps mainly affects ourselves up in the Nordic countries where there are many miles between different households and villages.
Â Â  . As I said in my reply, this consultancy study will form only part of the Commissionâs thinking.
The purpose of this particular consultantâs report is to inform the Commission on its thinking and it does not prejudge the Commissionâs final decision on these matters.
The honourable Member may rest assured that this forms only part of our overall deliberative process and does not in any way commit the Commission to making a proposal one way or the other.
Â Â  I am happy to say that it is not the only consideration, because lots of us use the post and would like it to be delivered each day rather than just once a week.
But there is also uncertainty in terms of the actual post offices that will be distributed throughout rural Ireland as well as rural Europe.
Can the Commissioner comment on what the Commission is thinking in relation to those services â other than the post â that are offered, and when a decision might be made by the Commission so that there will be more clarity?
Â Â  . As the honourable Member may know, the Commission must come forward with a report, before the end of 2006, on the direction which it considers the liberalisation of the postal market should take.
All the reports and consultations effected form part of our deliberative process in arriving at such a decision.
As Mrs McGuinness will be aware, the liberalisation of the postal market has been in progress for some time, and it is as part of that process that the Commission must bring forward its report on the direction to be taken.
The question of universal services is a key part of its deliberative process.
It is, of course, a matter for Member States to organise their arrangements regarding rural post offices as they see fit and in line with their own requirements.
Our specific role as the Commission is to consider that of the opening-up of the postal market.
Â Â  Will the Commissioner pledge that he will not seek to allow a system to be put in place that will bestow a second-class service on rural communities?
What specific steps does he have in mind to safeguard against private entrepreneurs creaming off the easy and the profitable aspects of the postal services, whilst leaving rural residents as the poor relations?
With regard to the recently introduced deregulation in the United Kingdom, does the Commissioner have any plans to monitor that, or any comments to make upon it?
Â Â  . The point raised by the honourable Member will form part of our thinking in whatever proposals are put forward by the end of 2006.
And, yes, I am very conscious of the importance of a universal service and particularly the importance of such a service to rural parts of Europe.
Â Â  . ArticleÂ 23 of the proposal for a directive on services in the internal market does, as the honourable Member says in her question, codify existing rights to patient mobility.
The case law of the Court of Justice has established that, subject to certain conditions, patients have the right to have the cost of healthcare received in other Member States assumed by the social security system in their own Member State.
Patients are, without prior authorisation, entitled to get reimbursement for non-hospital care received in other Member States.
For hospital care, prior authorisation may be required before a patient can go abroad to receive health care.
Authorisations must be granted when the necessary care cannot be given in the patientâs Member State within a medically justifiable time limit.
Before the proposal for a services directive was tabled, the Commission carried out a study on the implementation of the rights of patients in the Member States.
The conclusion was that âEuropean citizens are encountering unjustified or disproportionate obstacles when they apply for reimbursement, from their Member State of residence, of costs for non-hospital treatment incurred in another Member State, or for authorisation for assumption of the costs in the case of hospital treatmentâ.
For an individual citizen, the right to receive treatment in other Member States and to have the cost covered by his or her own social security system is probably one of the most important benefits of the internal market.
These are the reasons for the Commission to propose the inclusion of health services in the scope of the services directive and for proposing a specific provision on the assumption of health care costs incurred in other Member States.
The Commission has also been actively involved in the work of the high-level group on cross-border healthcare and patient mobility with a view to establishing how best the framework for guaranteeing and promoting patient rights in the single market can be developed.
This work has shown the clear benefits of cooperation between Member States on health and healthcare related issues, of which the reimbursement of costs is just one aspect.
A number of Member States are concerned about the effects cross-border care and patient mobility may have on their national health budgets.
In the absence of a clear legal framework, we will continue to be confronted with developing ECJ case law.
Pending the vote in this House on the first reading of the proposed services directive, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the position on certain articles, but I can confirm that where Member States impose disproportionate or unjustified restrictions, the Commission will act, including by launching infringement procedures.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to thank the Commissioner for his well thought out answer.
He rightly said that legal certainty that health care costs incurred in any Member State will be covered is a key benefit, and one that is of fundamental importance for the free movement of citizens and services within the European market.
There is one question I should like to ask, if I may, as a former minister for health and head of a large teaching hospital.
Is the Commission aware of the fact that the Services Directive represents a key opportunity to lay down clear conditions and legal provisions concerning the reimbursement of non-urgent health care costs to citizens of the 25Â Member States, without the principle of subsidiarity being violated?
Furthermore, is it aware that it has already become untenable for the European Court of Justice to continue acting as the guarantor and interpreter of legislation on this issue, or for it to be possible for such a role to be performed by a high-level group that engages in ongoing discussions, yet has no legislative power and cannot provide any legal certainty?
Â Â  . As I said in my reply, one of the reasons for the inclusion of health services in the scope of the Services Directive was to deal with some of the issues raised by the honourable Member.
However, as the honourable Member will be aware, the debate on the Services Directive in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in other committees has thrown up a number of other issues, and the Internal Market Committee voted in a particular direction.
At next monthâs part-session, the first reading of the Services Directive will come before the House and amendments will be debated.
Therefore, there are many conflicting viewpoints among parliamentarians on this issue and there are conflicting viewpoints among Member State governments on the scope of the Services Directive to include healthcare costs.
As I have said on this issue and on any others relating to the Services Directive, I remain open to hearing the concerns and opinions of all stakeholders.
Â Â  I wish particularly to thank the Commissioner for his excellent answer to MrsÂ RoithovÃ¡âs question, and I wonder if the Commission might help bring about some understanding of these issues by producing basic data showing that this is an area in which genuine added value can be obtained.
By this I mean that cross-border care could constitute added value for people, that we could obtain better specialist health care and that patients could obtain better care of higher quality, sometimes at lower cost but, above all, in a more efficient way.
I am completely convinced that the Commission could come up with data which would help us.
I wonder what the Commission thinks about helping bring about a better debate on these issues.
Â Â  . As usual, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld makes a very compelling argument for her case.
However, as I said in reply to Mrs RoithovÃ¡, there are differing views on this issue.
I await the outcome, in the first instance, of the vote in the European Parliament next month and the various amendments that have been proposed in this and other areas.
Certainly Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld makes some very compelling points, but there are other views also.
Â Â  . The honourable Memberâs question can be split into two parts.
The first issue is whether the Commission intends to clarify further the criteria governing the use of ArticleÂ 296 of the Treaty.
The second, more specific issue is the Commission assessment on the rules to be applied to research, study and experiment contracts in the field of defence.
On the first issue, we recently outlined our proposals for future initiatives to improve cross-border competition in defence procurement.
Our communication of 6Â December announced the adoption in 2006 of an interpretative communication on ArticleÂ 296 in the field of defence procurement and the start of preparatory work on a possible defence procurement directive.
Those initiatives are based on the results of the consultation launched with the green paper of 2004.
The contribution of Parliament to this debate, voted on 17Â November, explicitly supports the Commission in its initiative.
The interpretative communication will give guidance on how to use ArticleÂ 296 of the Treaty, which allows Member States a derogation from internal market rules and from Directive 2004/18 when their essential security interests are at stake.
This provision has to be applied on a case-by-case basis and cannot be interpreted widely.
It is for the Member State that seeks to rely on this provision to provide evidence that the derogation is justified and proportionate to the objective pursued.
A possible directive would coordinate procedures for defence procurement in cases where the derogation under ArticleÂ 296 is not applicable or where a Member State chooses not to take advantage of it.
It would provide new, more flexible procurement rules, better suited to the specific nature of the defence sector.
The adoption by the Commission of a possible proposal for such a directive is subject to the results of the impact assessment which will be carried out in 2006.
The Commission is not in a position to give an assessment of the facts described by the honourable Member in the second part of the question.
ArticleÂ 296 of the Treaty has to be applied on a case-by-case basis and according to the specific circumstances of each case.
However, the principles that should be taken into account when establishing the rules to apply can be briefly outlined.
On the one hand, it is worth noting that public procurement in the field of research, study and experiment benefits, under certain conditions, from specific derogations within the existing directive and within the Government Procurement Agreement of the World Trade Organization.
Defence contracts of this kind can also benefit from derogations within the Code of Conduct set up by the European Defence Agency for the ArticleÂ 296 area.
On the other hand, the question of government ownership of the share capital of potential contractors, and the consequences in terms of the rules to be applied, is not an issue to be addressed on the basis of ArticleÂ 296: this is linked to the âin-houseâ derogation, as established by the Court of Justice.
However, according to this case law, the derogation only applies in cases of 100% ownership.
Â Â  â I should like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his transparency and comprehensive reply to my question.
I think that concern about the question of transparency of public procurement and public defence is an issue which preoccupies the European economy in general, but I shall bear in mind the Commissioner's explanation that he will clarify the derogations from Article 296 of the Treaty on the basis of the relevant decision by the Court of Justice, especially the stage of the procedure during which public arms procurement contracts are awarded.
What we need to know â and urgently â is how the Member States are to intervene with a consultation mechanism in relation to procurement as a result of research and technology.
Â Â  . The honourable Member, Mrs Batzeli, reminds us of the advantages of having transparency in this particular area of public procurement.
However, as she will be aware, Article 296 allows considerable discretion on the part of Member States as to how they organise such activity.
Hopefully our recent communication of December 2005 and what we intend to do in cooperation with all stakeholders will open up that area even further.
Â Â  I believe it is important to have a single European market in the defence production and procurement sector, which is vital for the future of the European Union.
I believe that the Commission â in the past at least â has given an unreasonably generous and wide interpretation of Article 296.
Could you say whether you would narrow that interpretation in future?
Most importantly, if you do not have it, will you do an estimate at Commission level of the costs of not having a single market in the defence sector, in terms of the costs of purchases from overseas that might have been purchased in-house and the costs of having a fragmented and divided defence market in Europe with batch production rather than mass production?
Â Â  . I understand that the sum total of defence budgets in the EU is in the order of EURÂ 169Â billion, of which about EURÂ 82Â billion is for procurement.
Therefore, as the honourable Member implies in his question, any opening-up of the market in this area could lead to very substantial savings on the defence budget of many Member States, which would be much to the betterment of the public finances in all those Member States.
So there is indeed considerable potential in this area.
On the other hand, if we are to open up this particular market even further, there must be cooperation among the Member States as to how to proceed.
I wish to put these facts on this Houseâs record just to show the amount of money involved in this area.
Â Â  Questions Nos 28 to 30 will be answered in writing.
How does the Commission assess developments in the Ukraine during the past 12 months, and what strategies has it drawn up for 2006 with a view to bringing this important and entirely European country closer to the EU?
Â Â  . Thank you for the question.
The European Neighbourhood Policy has brought and will continue to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union.
Our cooperation with Ukraine can be seen as most successful.
The European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan adopted in February 2005 has proved to be an essential and efficient tool for encouraging reform through deeper political cooperation and closer economic integration between the EU and Ukraine.
Following the Orange Revolution, a renewed willingness on the Ukrainian side to boost EU-Ukraine cooperation could be observed.
The implementation of the Action Plan by Ukraine in the course of 2005 can be assessed positively.
At the summit with Ukraine in December 2005, President Barroso confirmed progress by Ukraine in political and economic reform.
Progress in the EU-Ukraine relationship could be registered on economic integration; granting of market economy status by the EU to Ukraine; cooperation in the key sectors of energy and transport; a memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation; justice and home affairs; the opening of visa facilitation negotiations in parallel to negotiations on a readmission agreement; as well as in the area of foreign and security policy, namely, the launching of the EU border assistance mission on the Transnistrian segment of the Ukraine-Moldova border.
However, important steps remain to be taken by Ukraine in the implementation of the Action Plan, in areas such as the rule of law and in particular on the economic side: the fight against corruption; adopting relevant legislation for WTO accession; and improving the business climate.
The Commission hopes to build on the additional impetus given by the summit â the first with a Ukrainian Government fully committed to reform â to the development of our relationship with Ukraine.
In February 2005 the EU committed to initiating early consultations on an enhanced agreement between the EU and Ukraine as soon as the main political priorities of the Action Plan have been addressed.
That commitment remains valid; when we are able to do so depends on Ukraine and perseverance in the reform process to tackle outstanding issues.
The March 2006 parliamentary elections will be an important test of Ukraine's continued commitment to democracy and will be essential in opening further perspectives in the relationship with Ukraine.
The future relationship will be based on several essential conditions: the success of the political reform, respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, and WTO membership, so as to fully integrate Ukraine into the world market.
This will also open up prospects for the establishment of a free trade area between the EU and Ukraine.
The way ahead lies in a close partnership with Ukraine, based on common values and the objective of economic integration, as well as strengthened cooperation in a number of areas.
The policy of constant progress and small, continued and common steps in the EU-Ukraine relationship has proved to be successful over the past year since the Orange Revolution and will allow us to tackle the challenges ahead.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, on the one hand, I regret the absence of CommissionerÂ Ferrero-Waldner â I do not think that that is right, as her name appears on the agenda â but, on the other, I am glad that the Austro-Hungarian cooperation in the Commission is working so well.
I have two brief questions for the Commissioner.
Firstly, what aid, in the form of staff and funding, does he regard as conceivable for the coming year to prevent the reform process in Ukraine failing or toppling once more â as, indeed, certain neighbouring states obviously believe it will?
Secondly, what specific action is the Commission taking to improve the transport links between the European Union and Ukraine, and to develop common infrastructure concepts to strengthen Ukraineâs energy and transport links to the west?
Â Â  . I am afraid it is too early to answer these questions.
Perhaps Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has something in mind, but as far as the Commission is concerned, we have not reached the point of being able to answer this question because, first, political and economic reforms are needed to get Ukraine closer to the European Union.
Then comes further and deeper cooperation.
Â Â  I should like to put a question to the Commission.
The fact is that, today, the European Parliament has almost unanimously adopted a very powerful report on human trafficking.
We have given a very great deal of attention to this issue, and we have also addressed it in the contacts we have had with Ukraine.
With todayâs decision, Parliament is giving its position a higher profile.
I should like the Commission to give particular attention to this issue, which has received an incredible amount of support today here in the European Parliament.
Â Â  . I think that it will take a long time to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union and it will be a long road.
Using my personal experience as a former foreign minister of neighbouring Hungary, I can say that Ukraine has come a long way, and since the Orange Revolution there is now no major question that Ukraine wants to get closer, that Ukraine wants to be a democratic country, wants to be a market economy.
Nevertheless, it is still has a long way to go before it completely complies with EU norms and principles.
We have two options. Either we can be too demanding and push Ukraine away from the European Union, or we can be more tolerant, more cooperative, and bring Ukraine closer, bearing in mind that the domestic political situation in the country is not that simple.
Ukraine is now facing general elections that will be a test of democracy in the country, whatever the outcome.
What we have to take into consideration is not the outcome of the election, but the democratic nature of that event, which will be a test for Ukrainian democracy.
Â Â  . Thank you for the question.
There are strong reasons for concern about the situation in Sri Lanka.
The year 2005 was a bad one for the peace process.
The assassination of Foreign Minister Kadirgamar, the electoral boycott enforced by the LTTE in the north and east, and the numerous killings in the east and in Jaffna have put the ceasefire in jeopardy.
The failure of the post-tsunami operations management structure, the mechanism within which the government, the LTTE and Muslim representatives were to decide jointly about tsunami reconstruction in the north and east, has also been a heavy drawback, creating huge resentment among the Tamils.
What we are seeing now is a dangerous spiral.
The Sri Lankan military has now lost more than 60Â soldiers in indirect attacks by the LTTE in Jaffna and other parts of the north and east.
So far, the government has acted with a remarkable sense of restraint, but this cannot last forever.
The European Union, and the Commission in particular, plays a strong part in the peace process.
Sri Lanka is a personal priority of the Commissioner responsible for external relations, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
She went there last March and fought hard to obtain an agreement on P-TOMS. She still feels this would have made a major difference.
The EU passed strong messages to both sides throughout the year.
In particular, the EU declaration of September 2005 announcing that high-level delegations of the LTTE would no longer be received in EU capitals was a major signal that, while seeking a balanced approach to the conflict, the EU would not tolerate further violence from the LTTE.
The Commission has also been instrumental in raising the profile of the co-chairs.
The Commissioner responsible for external relations personally attended three of the four co-chair meetings held in 2005.
Indeed, two of them were held in Brussels.
The Commission continued to support Norwayâs facilitation through public, as well as private, messages throughout the year.
The Commission also supported the idea that the next co-chair meeting should take place in Sri Lanka close to the fourth anniversary of the ceasefire agreement.
The Commission will intensify its efforts into the next year.
Two priorities have been set for the Commissionâs action.
Firstly, the Commission will work towards an even stronger role for the co-chairs, including direct visits at ministerial level.
The Commissioner responsible for external relations herself intends to return there in February, hopefully with all the co-chairs.
She wants to be able to speak to Mr Pirapaharan in person and pass him the direct message that Europe will react very soon if the LTTE shows no sign of change.
Secondly, now that P-TOMS have failed, the Commission is working on an alternative base to deliver reconstruction to the north and east.
It may seek to work more locally, say in one or two districts, to compensate for the absence of a larger consensus between the key players.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for his detailed response.
I have one issue that I wish to raise, following on from today's mine attack which resulted in the deaths of two civilians and the injury of 12 soldiers.
That is the latest in a month of bloodshed.
Given that both sides have agreed, in principle, to review the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, is the EU, as co-chair of the peace process, planning on taking this opportunity to push for a human rights declaration signed by both the government and the LTTE in order to put the protection of fundamental human rights at the heart of the peace process?
Â Â  . Thank you for the supplementary question.
As I am not the Commissioner responsible I can only give my personal view, and not that of the Commission, on this new development which the Commission has not had time to discuss.
However, it would seem to me that an initiative such as the one you suggest as a possible option is fully in line with the Commissionâs policy on the situation in Sri Lanka.
Â Â  As the subject is covered later in this part-session Question No 33 will not be called.
As the author is not present, Question No 34 lapses.
We note with concern that the democratisation process in Colombia is constantly being disrupted by disturbances in the country.
We are also concerned about the continuing human rights violations there.
The armed conflict is escalating and drug-trafficking is continuing on a large scale.
This constitutes a serious obstacle to development and peace in Colombia.
A number of Swedish voluntary organisations send personnel to Colombia to work on peace projects and projects to defend the rights of local and indigenous people, including land rights.
This should be seen against the background of the fact that, as in many other Latin American countries, large corporations are expanding rapidly, as, particularly, is palm oil production by them.
Will the Commission propose any special measures to support the democratisation process in Colombia?
Â Â  . The Commission shares the concern of the honourable Member regarding the continuing human rights violations and the persisting threats to democracy in the regions of Colombia affected by the longstanding internal armed conflict.
Therefore the EU strategy for Colombia mainly aims at supporting comprehensive peace initiatives, with the strong involvement of local communities.
It is thus the intention to directly contribute to the strengthening of democracy with an integrated set of instruments.
Among these, over the period from 2001 to 2005, more than EURÂ 16Â million was committed for Colombia from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, for 53Â projects supporting human rights and democratisation, and which have been implemented or are still under way.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I asked this question precisely because Colombia is in the process of becoming the scene for our second largest refugee disaster.
Where Colombia differs from other countries is in the fact that land there is still in the hands of local and regional landowners.
That is why there is still an opportunity to help the local population and to ensure that people are allowed to retain their land.
This factor will of course be what is important when we try to solve this conflict.
Thank you very much for your answer, and I naturally hope that we shall jointly make progress in these peace initiatives being taken by the EU.
Â Â  . I do not wish to take the floor on that, as I am not aware of the problem that the Member raised.
Â Â  . The Commission follows with interest the attempts by institutions and individuals in ASEAN countries to establish a human rights mechanism.
The Commission supports those efforts and other human rights issues through various cooperation programmes in several ASEAN countries.
An EC-sponsored ASEAN-wide human rights conference will be held in Manila in 2006.
We are encouraged to note that for the first time an ASEAN summit called for the release of political prisoners in Myanmar.
ASEAN leaders also agreed to dispatch the foreign minister of Malaysia, the current chair of ASEAN, to assess the democratic process during a visit.
While those initiatives by ASEAN are positive, we should remain cautious about the prospects of immediate changes in Myanmar and especially about the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.
Â Â  Â Â Â Commissioner, progress has indeed been made, at least in terms of the call that has been made for human rights to be respected in the country formerly known as Burma.
I do, however, have a question, or rather a request and a proposal, for the European Commission.
It is my belief that the Commission should monitor the situation on an ongoing basis, naturally with Parliamentâs help.
Truly international pressure, brought to bear by Europe as well as Asia, is our only hope of achieving any concrete results.
I would urge the European Commission to take an ongoing interest in this issue.
Â Â  . Thank you for your proposal, which I will certainly forward to MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner.
I think that the possibilities available to the European Union, which is not in the region, are more limited than those available to ASEAN, for instance.
I think ASEAN could do more, but your proposal is certainly worthy of consideration.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  Â The next item is the debate on the following reports by MrÂ Fruteau, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Fruteau on the effort he has made to improve the Commissionâs proposal, which represents a u-turn in what has been the European Union's policy on the sugar sector since 1968 and which, furthermore, is going to put an end to sugar beet cultivation in many regions of the European Union.
Although this has been mentioned many times, I would like to comment on the lack of respect that the Council has shown towards this Parliament by reaching an agreement and communicating it to the media before hearing the opinion of this Parliament.
The gentlemenâs agreement that has always existed within the institutions has been violated.
Given anti-democratic gestures such as this, we should not be surprised that the citizens do not believe in the institutions and vote as they do and as they will continue to do.
With regard to the political agreement that the Council has reached, it is closer to the Commissionâs proposal than to what the European Parliament is going to vote on tomorrow.
I shall just refer to prices. You have agreed a reduction of 36%, while the Commission proposes 39% and we in Parliament are going to vote for a reduction of 30%.
I would also like to express my disagreement with the discrimination against the countries with a production share lower than their consumption and do not therefore produce the surpluses that in theory make this reform necessary.
These countries are being penalised, while an extra quota is being provided for the large producers of C sugar.
Finally, everybody talks about producing biofuels as an alternative to the sugar beet that is going to be taken off the market, but how and when are the means going to be provided?
I do not imagine that you believe, Commissioner, that with a million and a half hectares for energy crops and a subsidy of EUR 40 per hectare we can respond to the needs of the huge number of farmers who are going to lose their livelihood.
Â Â  Mr President, the decision of the Council is brutal for the European, and therefore the Hungarian sugar industry, and hence it cannot be accepted.
The European Parliament cannot allow the decapitation of the European sugar industry.
If this brutal Council regulation remains in place, in 15 yearsâ time sugar production will be limited to two European Union Member States: France and Germany.
This could be avoided if the excellent, thorough and balanced report of rapporteur Jean-Claude Fruteau is taken on board, but even the version proposed by Mrs Fischer Boel would be more beneficial for European sugar producers.
The position of the European Parliament is that the price cut should be 30 percent, lower than the percentage specified in the decision of the Council, and compensation should be higher, of 100 percent if possible.
It is also important to make sure that the transitional period does not exceed four years.
Area-based aid should be linked to partial production, and this should be included as one of the conditions.
This will be my request to the Commissioner.
A more moderate price cut, together with the conditions mentioned, would grant more chances of survival to sugar beet production and sugar industry in midfield Member States, such as Hungary.
Unfortunately all five Hungarian sugar factories are owned by foreign, French, German and Austrian sugar beet growers, who may decide to restrict production to their own countries. This would present a risk for a country with an economic production at average European levels, such as Hungary.
This is why I am asking my fellow Members: let us correct the wrong decision of the Council.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the cost of sugar, currently Europeâs most subsidised agricultural product, is three times higher than the world price â an unfair and unacceptable situation indeed, and the reason why I think that sweeping reform was, and is, inevitable.
One question that arises is whether the Commission proposals go far enough.
In my view, what is being overlooked is the sugar sectorâs structural problem, namely a general overproduction.
Far more sugar is already being produced than consumed.
This situation will get worse as the price drops, which will only benefit major producers and distributors.
In the final analysis, it is the agricultural industry that pockets the savings, while the small farmers receive less for their yields from sugar beet.
Ultimately, the consumer ends up paying the same price for a kilo of sugar.
It is, in particular, the poorest countries that are at risk of being the victims of this reform.
Preferential treatment has created local sugar crops, often small-scale with a minimum outlay, in various ACP countries.
Those countries cannot possibly compete without further European support. Hence the importance of the Kinnock amendment to free up an annual amount of EUR 200 million for the ACP countries.
In fact, Mrs Kinnockâs other amendments also deserve our support.
Failure to deliver on the commitments in the framework of the âEverything but Armsâ programme will seriously damage our credibility in respect of the LDCs.
Moreover, this reform invites a discussion about a general abolition of all export subsidies, as recently promised in Hong Kong.
I will conclude by summing up that sugar reform is necessary, but not if it is sweet for major producers while leaving poor farmers with indigestion.
Â Â  â Mr President, as we stated in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we are very concerned about this sugar reform and about the positions that the Council unfortunately adopted ahead of this debate.
Our proposals in committee stressed the promotion of the principle of food sovereignty and safety, and the protection of farmers and the industry in regions and Member States experiencing difficulties.
We also advocated an increase in production quotas, in countries in which there is a production shortfall in relation to consumption, as in the case of Portugal.
Accordingly, we proposed, and continue to advocate, an increase in production quotas at the Coruche factory in Portugal to 120Â 000 tonnes of sugar beet, in order to guarantee economic viability, jobs and sugar beet production, given the good conditions in Portugal and the major shortfall in sugar production in relation to consumption.
Â Â  Mr President, they say it is better to give a fishing rod than a fish.
If we are going to shut down sugar production in Ireland and in the EU, we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers, even if just to salve our own conscience.
But are we crazy?
Why are we shutting down sugar production when we desperately need to find alternatives to petroleum fuels?
Why are we paying to have empty fields and rusting equipment when we need sugar production more than ever?
Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
On the one hand, we are warning of the disappearance of oil and promoting alternatives; on the other hand, sugar â one of the viable alternatives â has been made to disappear.
One hand does not seem to know what the other is doing.
How can we accomplish anything?
While we are planning our own compensation package, let us remember third countries like Mauritius, which are being devastated by our sugar reforms.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, liberalisation of the sugar market is a complex problem, and one that requires our particular attention.
The European Parliament demonstrated its awareness of this fact by adopting a resolution on the future reform of the common market organisation for sugar on 10Â MarchÂ 2005.
Unfortunately, the European Commission ignored this resolution.
In JulyÂ 2005, it presented three proposals for regulations that undermined the meaning of the resolution that the House had adopted.
Parliament was ignored for a second time on 24Â NovemberÂ 2005, when the Council adopted a final version of the reform without asking the House for its opinion, and in the face of opposition from the Polish and Greek Agriculture Ministers.
This has led to us being presented with proposals that violate the principle of European solidarity, and whose aim is to ensure that the sugar market is reformed at the expense of smaller countries, in particular the new EU Member States.
A further aim is to ensure that European sugar production is concentrated in Germany and France.
The proposed solutions will work to the disadvantage of farmers and sugar factory workers, and to the advantage of the large sugar companies.
The individual and the principle of partnership have fallen by the wayside in this reform.
The new Member States have privatised their sugar factories, yet the vast majority of such factories in Poland were taken over by foreign owners at a mere one third of the price that they will now be paid for stopping production.
The situation is similar in many other countries.
For these and many other reasons, I would suggest that all three proposals be rejected, and that a new reform be drafted that would in keeping with Parliamentâs resolution of 10Â MarchÂ 2005.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I am fully aware that ever more far-reaching reforms of the common agricultural policy must be and will be carried out.
It is an unfortunate fact that these new reforms will work to the disadvantage of farmers, and that as usual the new Member States will suffer most.
This is yet another example of the unjust terms upon which we joined the EU.
It will be no secret to the Commissioner that the reform of the sugar regime currently under way will not win her any friends in Poland.
She should understand our point of view, however, and pay due attention to it.
As the rapporteur said, our attention should be focused in particular on the men and women who earn their living from sugar production.
The planned compensation should be targeted mainly at workers in sugar factories and at farmers, rather than at the owners of such factories. This is all the more true since the majority of sugar factories in Poland are under foreign control.
The transfer of production quotas from one country to another should be prohibited in order to avoid speculation.
This reform of the sugar market is yet another wasted opportunity.
Instead of acting as an expression of solidarity between EU Member States and with developing countries, it will result in insufficient aid for poor countries and fresh points of contention between Member States.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, there is an urgent need for a reform of the sugar market, since the present regulation governing quotas, prices and export subsides expires on 30Â JuneÂ 2006.
Yet changes of the kind that have been proposed to us are unacceptable.
The view held not only by myself, but also by the majority of sugar beet farmers in Poland, is that the only word that can be used to describe these changes is scandalous.
The political compromise that has now been reached by the Council is intolerable.
It has even been claimed by Polish sugar beet farmers that the reform of the EU sugar market was delayed on purpose until after the new Member States had joined, so that sugar production in the EU could be scaled down at their expense.
The European Commission has said time and time again that CÂ sugar quotas destabilise the market.
The WTO panel ruled against us, and we were unsuccessful in our appeal.
Yet the compromise reached by the Council of Ministers provides for an additional 1.1Â million tonnes of CÂ sugar for the Member States that produce most of it.
There is an astonishing lack of consistency in the measures taken by the European Commission and the Council.
Even though the goal of these institutions is to limit production, they have proposed an increase for countries producing large quantities of what is known as CÂ sugar. We received several Christmas presents along these lines, but it is a shame that Father Christmas was not as generous to all the other countries.
How do the Commissioner and the Council explain the fact that only selected countries will receive additional aid?
How have these countries been selected?
The cost of all these Christmas gifts, which will take the shape of more generous restructuring payments, will be met by other, much poorer countries, including Poland.
I would ask the Commissioner whether the reform of the sugar market amounts to nothing but haggling, or whether it is based on consistent measures that will ensure that the European sugar market is competitive.
I would ask Parliament to adopt the amendments that I have tabled with a view to improving this reform of the sugar market, at least in part.
Let us hope that the Commission and the Council take note of them.
There is still a chance that they will do so, and I would be very grateful if they did.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate and subsequent vote will finally bring to a close more than a year of work in this Chamber, and I should like to highlight Mr Fruteauâs constructive approach, and express my backing for his reports.
Rather than being the end of the road, however, this moment marks the start of a process of development in the sector.
Turning to you, Commissioner, I should like to say that the trend towards viewing the market as the be-all âand end-all has had devastating consequences, although we have helped somewhat to mitigate those consequences.
If such a reform is, rightly, deemed inevitable, that is already cause to be wary of its effects. This is because, since the positions of the Council and Parliament came closer together, it has revolved around a drastic price cut of 36% in four years.
Deregulation via price works in the interests of the large producers, which can continue to grow to the detriment of the environment and exploit even further an under-paid workforce outside Europe.
It is also in the interests of the major users, who will buy sugar a great deal cheaper on the world market without this being reflected in the price of the end product, thereby maximising their profits.
That is their definition of development, not to be confused with our concept of development.
On the other side of the coin, deregulation via price is damaging to the small producers here in Europe and, even more so, in the ACP countries and the least developed countries, who will sell their sugar for less and may even have to stop producing, without any viable alternative source of income.
Nor will this be of benefit to small consumers: there are strong indications that they will not be paying any less.
In Europe, moreover, some countries will stop producing and others will carry on with some difficulty, both for producers and for firms and their employees.
I should like, if I may, to introduce a particularly Belgian flavour at this point. I would welcome the possibility of restructuring in the chicory sector with a view to producing inulin, for which prospects are good.
I tabled some amendments in this regard and I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for accepting them.
With regard to the Council, which is set to meet in February, I hope that greater prominence will be given to the amount of aid earmarked for farmers and to the conditions that firms seeking restructuring aid need to meet.
I shall be keeping a close eye on this.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on the sugar COM has been called a historic agreement and a brave and bold decision on a situation that has remained crystallised for too many years.
It has been said that action was needed today because it implies being able to find the necessary funds to carry out this painful but absolutely essential restructuring and to guarantee not only compensation for the farmers concerned, but also the long-term sustainability of the sector.
This new policy will encourage trade and will strengthen the European Unionâs negotiating position at the WTO meeting to be held in Hong Kong next month.
With this reform, the European Union will certainly be an attractive market for developing countries, to which they can export their sugar, although I personally believe that we shall lose a great deal in terms of quality and consumer health guarantees.
In this respect, Commissioner, perhaps we need to take a tougher, more prudent and more cautious line.
Lastly, this agreement will enable the European Union to offer its ACP partners financial assistance to adapt to the changes, but it will certainly end up simply protecting France and Germany, as always.
While expressing my great appreciation for the work done by the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I do not wish to linger over the terms of the agreement, which are now familiar to everybody.
Once again, however, I must point out the extent to which the role of the European Parliament has been undervalued, in that all too often it has been bypassed by the Council and by the Commission itself.
While hoping, therefore, that the amendments to improve the text are accepted, I want to say how baffled I feel, since there has been no attempt at all to take a bolder stand on the CAP in order to ensure that the European Union has the energy independence that it needs, by focusing on alternative energies or energies integrated with oil, such as energy from biomass, as Professor Prodi maintained as well.
By transforming biomass, we can achieve earnings that far outweigh the losses on sugar.
Is the Commissioner aware of that?
Is the Commission?
I believe it would be worthwhile for the European Union to invest in the biomass transformation sector which, incidentally, is a technology that produces hydrogen directly.
Two tonnes of dry biomass, in fact, produces the same heat as one tonne of oil, but while the potential cost of biomass is EURÂ 200 per tonne, oil costs about EURÂ 400 per tonne.
Let me give you an example: Italy would save about EURÂ 12 billion and Europe EURÂ 120 billion.
With that we could implement a policy that combines the goals of reform with those of social justice in the best way possible and without unexpected and excessive trauma.
We could adopt proactive, positive measures for the environment, for farmers and for the producers themselves, without promoting a benefit culture and, what is more, without losing jobs.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, today we are debating three reports tabled before Parliament on the reform of the sugar market.
As a representative of a new Member State, Poland, I should like to raise two grave concerns about this reform.
Firstly, the reform has been made necessary by the excessive amounts of sugar exported by two countries in particular, namely Germany and France.
These exports amount to nearly 2Â million tonnes, and it is France and Germany that should bear the cost of this reform by significantly reducing the amount of sugar they export.
Since Poland exports a mere 90Â 000Â tonnes, it can only limit its production within these constraints.
Secondly, sugar production limits have been imposed on sugar factories rather than on farmers in Poland, unlike in other EU Member States.
The majority of sugar factories in Poland were bought out by German and French investors, who paid around EURÂ 200 per tonne of production limit.
Given that they will be compensated to the tune of EURÂ 730 per tonne of abandoned production, the owners of such factories will receive nearly four times more than they paid.
What is more, they will still own the industrial assets, or in other words the buildings, land and machinery.
I should like to address these two grave concerns to the Commission and to the Council, as well as to the Commissioner, who is present in the Chamber today.
All of these latter believe that they have come up with a first-rate idea for a reform of the sugar market.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we all agree that the sector needs to be reformed in order to make it sustainable, in line with the latest reform of the CAP and with the EUâs international obligations.
Despite these new objectives, however, the reform proposed by the Commission would cause serious problems for Europeâs farmers, not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar.
I therefore endorse Mr Fruteauâs report, along with the work carried out by the various political groups in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I feel sends out a very clear message to the Commission and the Council.
In addition to the capping of price reductions to 30% in the common organisation of the market in sugar, I wish to highlight Amendment 3, on support schemes for farmers, which refers to the possibility of Member States continuing to enjoy production-linked subsidies, at least to some extent.
This will help prevent the rapid disappearance of the sugar sector in the regions most under threat from this reform.
I would say, however, that the Commissionâs proposal was drawn up more from the point of view of the processing industry than that of agricultural producers, and more from the perspective of the interests of the major surplus producing countries than that of the smaller countries which do not even produce enough sugar beet to satisfy consumption, as in the case of Portugal.
The mainstay of sugar beet production in Portugal is a factory that produces some 70Â 000 tonnes of the 300Â 000 tonnes consumed across the country.
In other words, it is not countries like Portugal that are unbalancing the international market with surplus production.
Nevertheless, by safeguarding the possibility of the restructuring fund supporting those giving up on part of the quota, we will be helping the sugar industry in some countries, such as Portugal, and shifting it away from the agricultural sector towards sustaining the processing side of the industry.
Lastly, I should like to express my objection to the way in which the Council has approached this subject, from an institutional point of view.
It does not matter how many times we hear that what we have is a political agreement and not a formal decision, the truth is that at a time when Europeâs citizens have expressed their concerns about the amount of transparency in the European institutions, this is not the best way to move forward.
It is not simply a matter of following the interinstitutional agreement to the letter.
We also have a duty, as politicians directly elected by the citizens of Europe, to demand respect, both ethically and politically, for the institutions.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome MrÂ Fruteau's reports and I would also pay tribute to the way he has gone about his work.
It would be fair to say that we do not have identical views on the reform of the sugar regime, but I would like to think that we are now much closer at the end of the process than we were at the beginning.
Like the rapporteur and previous speakers, I think it is a pity that the Council chose to reach a political agreement in advance of the debate in this Parliament.
I think it shows a lack of respect for this House.
Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the Council has recognised and supported the need to end the artificial support for the sugar sector and to make the European sugar regime more competitive in the world market, and I believe that the 36% reduction will make us WTO-compatible.
It is not as radical as the 39% that the Commission proposes, but I think it brings us into line with WTO rules.
The four-year implementation that the Council also recommends gives our producers a chance to adjust to the new realities.
Where I would like to see more action is in two specific areas.
Firstly, in relation to CÂ sugar. We should have a clear commitment to abolish CÂ sugar, which clearly distorts world trade and could still be a subject of dispute at the WTO level.
So IÂ shall support AmendmentÂ 80 on Thursday, as I hope will the House.
IÂ warmly welcome the EURÂ 7Â billion compensation that has been given to European producers and I recognise that they need that support.
However, like other speakers in this debate, I regret that we are not being as generous to ACP producers.
The 18Â ACP producers currently have stable earnings of around EURÂ 250Â million a year from the sugar regime.
The Commission proposal was for EURÂ 190Â million a year between 2007 and 2013, which was good but not generous enough.
The problem is that the Council agreement of 16 and 17Â December does not meet the EURÂ 190Â million that the Commission proposed, and as the budgetary authority in this, along with the Council, Parliament must press for EURÂ 190Â million a year, if we are to be seen as genuine about our Millennium Development Goals objectives.
Finally, I would like to add my voice to those who say that using sugar as a biofuel is a potential way forward and a potential new market for sugar.
The technology exists; it needs to be improved and adapted; that needs research and technical support, and I hope the Commission will look again more generously at that aspect of reform and do more to assist the wider use of sugar, both as an environmental measure and as a way of compensating European sugar producers for the loss of revenue they face from these proposals.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank Mr Fruteau, not only for his work to date, but also for sticking with this marathon session; and I also thank the Commission.
I think we should all get a clap on the back.
Rather than repeat some of the comments made about these reforms, I just want to say that I have some concern about the severity of the price cut.
I have urged this before, as an alternative to using a quota cut as a mechanism to control supply.
I have particular questions for the Commission.
Perhaps the Commissioner could give me an answer.
In relation to the levy to be deducted from processors, could the Commission say whether, if a country â and I am speaking of Ireland â grows beet in 2006, the company has to contribute to the restructuring levy this year, should it intend to stop production in 2007?
It is a crucial issue and it will decide whether or not we grow beet this year â perhaps the last season for beet growing in Ireland.
My second question relates to a comment the Commissioner made earlier in the debate when she said that the 10% which is being set aside under the restructuring scheme for growers could be increased by Member States in particular circumstances.
Perhaps the Commissioner might outline what those circumstances might be.
Without using all of my time, because we may all be tired and perhaps emotional, I shall just say, with regard to the developing world â and I share the concerns of others here in the House â that in reforming sugar we have upset the developing world, because we are offering it access to our markets at much reduced prices.
What it wants is access at high prices, because that is the only way that it can grow and prosper.
Those who have called for this to happen should think about what they have now succeeded in achieving.
Lastly, I hope the reforms do what the Commissioner says they will do: give us a competitive sugar industry.
Alas, I think that for Ireland it will mean that we will have no industry at all.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, MrÂ Fruteau, deserves thanks for his committed work, which enabled the achievement of what was, after all, an acceptable compromise.
He was not helped, of course, by the fact that the Agricultural and Fisheries Council had taken a preliminary decision.
Although we do not have power of codecision in this field, this decision can only be tolerated in the light of the 2005 WTO negotiations.
The compromise that has now been reached remains a tremendous challenge for those affected: within the EU as well as the ACP and least developed countries.
Even though the affected parties will receive compensatory payments, there will be losses of income one way or another.
In future, many sugar-beet-growing regions in the EU will not be able to grow as much sugar beet for food purposes or, in some cases, any at all.
The Commission should follow the lead taken by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this regard and examine the possible scope for increasing the funds per hectare available for non-food crops.
In my view, the key proposals of the Agriculture Committee are similar to those of the Agricultural and Fisheries Council.
I hope that the compromise is adopted in the end, as it will give beet growers planning security and enable sugar-beet production in the EU to continue in future in spite of severe cuts.
Sugar-factory operators also share responsibility, however.
Their task is to implement the regime of the future market organisation in such a way that viable socio-economic solutions can be devised in cooperation with the trade unions and staff representatives.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, as you are no doubt all aware, sugar cubes are a Czech invention, and so as a Czech MEP I should like to make a number of comments on the proposal to reform the Common Organisation of the Market for sugar, if I may.
The first comment I should like to make is that I welcome the attempts of the European Council and of the European Commission to reform the EUâs sugar policy.
The policy as it stands is utterly ludicrous and costs taxpayers and consumers too much.
This state of affairs must changeÂ as soon as possible and the market as a whole must be deregulated and liberalised.
Secondly, the fact that the sugar regime is being reformed only after the EUâs policy was ruled unfair by the World Trade Organisation is deplorable, and everyone in the EU should spend some time reflecting on it.
Why are we incapable of liberalising our own markets, and why do we have to be forced into doing so by other countries?
After all, free trade and free markets have brought nothing but prosperity to the European nations throughout their history, whereas economic protectionism brings nothing but poverty.
Yet it would appear that advocates of protectionism are well represented in this House.
I am fundamentally opposed to their views and I will not vote in favour of their amendments.
The sugar regime must be reformed as soon as possible.
The third point I should like to make relates to the fact that a sugar refinery operated in my home town from 1890 until 1994.
The reason it went bankrupt was the opening up of the sugar market after the fall of Communism in my country.
The sugar refinery in my home town of LysÃ¡ nad Labem went bankrupt because it was unable to compete with the subsidised sugar refineries in the European Union.
In the course of the 1990s, more than 50Â sugar refineries in the Czech Republic went bankrupt or were closed down for this reason.
The people who worked in them lost their jobs and received no compensation, and the refinery owners and sugar beet farmers received no compensation either.
It is now the turn of the sugar sector in the old EU Member States to undergo the same process of market adjustment.
The compensation that has been proposed is extremely generous, which should make such adjustment a simple task.
I am therefore in favour of the reform of the sugar regime, and indeed I believe that it could go further.
Our experiences in the Czech Republic show that such a reform is both feasible and manageable.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to highlight the efforts made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to be able to reach an agreement amongst all of the political groups, which is not at all easy given that the Commissionâs initial proposal was aimed more towards the disappearance of sugar cultivation than its reform, without taking account of the resulting social cost.
I therefore believe that this intense year of work has been worthwhile.
Secondly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, whose three regulations have incorporated moderation, balance, solidarity and, above all, a realistic approach to the future of the sector, not just the 21 European Union producer countries, but also the ACP and least-developed countries.
I would also like to add my voice to the many criticisms heard in this House at the fact that the Council should adopt a political agreement without awaiting Parliamentâs report.
We hope that this will not have set a precedent for future reforms.
Finally, after so much work, I would like to refer to the double speak that some Members have been indulging in from the outset â I feel that I should point this out now that we have come to the end â voting in favour of the Fruteau report in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and then, when they get back to their country, criticising everything about it.
Some of us have been working to reach agreements, to bring positions closer together, in order to achieve what in the end has become a reality.
Despite everything, we believe that the current situation is much better than the situation at the outset; we do not like the reforms, we have never liked them, but we must recognise that we have improved on the difficult initial situation.
I believe that this is the moment to send a clear message from this European Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is always better as a rule to build rather than destroy.
It is preferable to do things with an eye to future generations rather than to the next elections, because we will always be proven right in the end and the strategy of confrontation without arguments which has taken hold in my country will not bring about any positive solution.
I shall end by calling on Parliament to support the Fruteau report, which is a good report and which may improve the Council's agreement, and, if it is strengthened by this Parliament, we will be able to move forward towards a better future for the sector.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the new sugar regime being outlined will be particularly unfortunate for growers.
In many areas this means an end to the cultivation of sugar beet.
The closure of sugar factories will send farmers and industrial workers into unemployment.
Unfortunately, the first demonstrations have already started in my country.
We must set as our objective the survival of our farmers on their farms.
We do not need any more urban drift.
If we want to replace sugar beet with energy crops, we must be more generous with our aid.
Besides, we owe it to the environment, because energy crops mean that we are protecting the environment, although the ACP countries will not fare better in the future under the new regime.
Commissioner, you are a sober, honest and able person.
You work with Mr Fruteau, who has made very good proposals, you work with the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Daul, you make improvements, you make brave proposals, you demonstrate to those who criticise you that you are not here as a formality and that everything has been decided, but that you want â truly and constructively â to listen to Parliament.
In this way you protect the European Union, the European Parliament and European agriculture.
Otherwise, in many disadvantaged areas of Europe we shall see farming disappear, villages abandoned and the ecological deterioration of Europe.
For heaven's sake, I do not think that is what you want.
Â Â  Mr President, sugar reform is first and foremost a social problem for farmers and workers in Europe and in the developing world.
For social justice to be successful on a world scale, the European market has to be opened up.
This reform is inevitable and painful, but if you have to jump through fire, you may as well make a good job of it.
The Commissioner succeeded in making an enormous leap, the Council managed a smaller jump and this House would like to take a somewhat smaller jump still.
Workers and farmers are worried, though, and are right to demand strong social guarantees.
In that sense, the restructuring fund is vital.
Thanks to the pressure we have exerted, we now have a bigger restructuring fund, which is important.
We would like the fund to grow even more, for workers want more than retraining.
They want alternative employment when their factories close down.
Bio-ethanol is a solution, provided it can be produced using low levels of energy.
More funding is needed for research into this.
Only in that way is a social and sustainable future for the sector possible. Only in that way can the sector accept this reform.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a change, I should like to speak in favour of the current process of reforming the common organisation of the market in sugar, albeit with a very specific eye on sugar in the outermost regions.
While the EU is committed to cutting back sugar production to bring it into line with world trade rules, the French overseas departments are on a diametrically opposite course, which consists of further increasing production in order to ensure that sustainable jobs are maintained and created, and that the fragile balance of both farming and industrial operations is preserved.
As regards the Commissionâs proposals, it can be said that RÃ©union, Guadeloupe and Martinique are pioneers in adapting their sugar cane sector.
This is firstly because their level of production have remained well below authorised quotas, and they are thus not part of Community overproduction, and secondly because, in the past thirty years, factories have gradually merged.
Accordingly, it is no longer possible to envisage either stopping or cutting back activities without upsetting the whole balance of the sector.
Sugar cane has become a valuable commodity, capable of producing not only sugar but also energy, using bagasse or indeed natural manure.
In the overseas departments, multifunctionality in agriculture is not merely some theoretical project, it is a reality.
Moreover, it is precisely because they were pioneers that the overseas departments cannot go any further.
Whereas the Commission and the Council have refused any further financial concessions to the departments, France has been authorised to implement provisions paving the way for state aid to be granted, in addition to the Community funds, via the political agreement in the Council ahead of the WTO summit in HongÂ Kong.
There could be compensation for price cuts, with some leeway for increased production, which would return some sense of stability and visibility to a sector that has endured two years of uncertainty.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fruteau, on his efforts and would formally ask you, Commissioner, to retain the provisions in the Councilâs compromise on sugar in the overseas departments in order to ensure the sectorâs future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sugar reform was one of the most complex Community policy dossiers.
Before finding political agreement, the Council should have taken Parliamentâs opinion into consideration, in order to strengthen cooperation among the European institutions and to provide solutions commensurate with our expectations and the impending challenges.
The outcome that has been achieved is, however, positive and moderately satisfying.
I believe that Parliamentâs contribution to the establishment of the compromise was vital.
The own-initiative report adopted by this House last March provided a number of decisive pointers for drawing up the new proposal.
The emphasis that this House placed on the social impact of the reform, with the establishment of a restructuring fund for the industry, is an essential part of our position which has been taken up in the agreement.
It is certainly a painful reform, but it is inevitable if Europe is to meet its international commitments and at the same time ensure that the sector has a sustainable, competitive, long-term future.
The compromise that has been reached is much more balanced than the Commissionâs proposal in June and it provides for a series of positive measures: the chance to retain a proportion of coupled aid for those who continue producing; the support measures for sugar beet growers; the attention given to the regions penalised by the dismantling of the industry; and the creation of a diversification fund.
The reform thus avoids totally abandoning production and its social and employment repercussions will be much less disastrous than we feared.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, this is not the first time that Parliament has made known its opinion on the reform of the sugar regime.
I was one of the Members who voted in favour of the resolution we adopted last year.
Among other things, this resolution called for the quota reduction measures to be reconsidered, in particular in the case of the new Member States.
I am delighted that the Commission has revised its original strategy and proposed a reform based on a reduction in the guaranteed price of sugar that will meet competitive sugar producers and sugar beet farmers halfway.
I have certain reservations about the report we are discussing today, however, since it calls for a smaller reduction in the price of sugar than that to which the Member States agreed in December.
This agreement itself was the result of a compromise that was achieved by toning down the harder-hitting proposal by the Commission.
Firstly, it should not be forgotten that we suffered defeat at the hands of the WTO.
We must therefore meet the requirement to open up our sugar market by 2009.
In this connection, I can only wonder at the exaggerated amount of attention being paid to the interests of the least-developed countries.
On the one hand, these countries would like the price of sugar to be reduced in markets outside Europe, but on the other, they want prices to remain high on the European market, to which they have privileged access.
Secondly, I should like to stress that reducing the price of sugar over a longer period would work to the advantage of less competitive businesses, and help perpetuate distortions in the sugar market.
It would not only be competitive sugar producers who would lose out, but above all European consumers, since they would be the ones paying most of the cost â quite literally â of a more moderate fall in prices.
At present, they have to pay three times more for sugar than consumers in other parts of the world.
Is it acceptable for them to continue subsidising an extensive protectionist system every time they buy a product containing sugar?
We should remember that the main purpose of the European Union is to remove barriers to mutual trade, not to perpetuate and strengthen them.
We should therefore prove that we are a truly European Parliament, and that we are not afraid of implementing market mechanisms, in the fields of sugar production and sales.
Â Â  Mr President, the political agreement reached by the Agriculture Ministers â including the Spanish Socialist Minister, for which she should have been dismissed â will undoubtedly be adopted at the end of the month among points A of the agenda, that is to say without any debate whatsoever.
There is no need, everything has been debated.
Unfortunately, the discussion we are holding today in the European Parliament will have no impact on the final decision.
In the future, we must prevent Parliament's voice from being ignored again in such a blatant manner, particularly on decisions with such significant economic and social importance.
To this end, however, the European Commission must not use any excuse it likes to ignore the opinion of Parliament, as it has done on this occasion.
I would like to make it clear, in case there is still any doubt, that this report, which will be put to the vote on Thursday, is a very long way from the political agreement reached by the Member States, with regard both to sugar prices and to compensation for farmers or the Member States' freedom to maintain part of the coupled aid, which in the agreement amongst the 25 in the Council is not taken up.
Parliamentâs report distributes the efforts for reducing production in a fairer manner, by removing the additional allocation of a million tonnes previously known as âCâ.
These are just a few of the examples that we may find if we compare the different texts, but the list would get very much longer if we were to carry out a detailed analysis of the agreement.
In short, we do not like the reform, we did not like the European Commissionâs reform because it was horrible.
Nevertheless, the agreement that is going to be voted on in this Parliament on Thursday seems to us to be the least bad option.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have listened carefully to the debate.
Its intensity is a sign that quite a lot is at stake.
However, it is also a sign of the commitment with which you have engaged yourselves in the process of making this new reform.
Let me first deal with the amendments.
I believe that I have found in them a lot of common ground with my own views.
I shall start with the proposed new common market organisation.
You have argued that the safety net is necessary during the restructuring period ending in 2009-2010 in order to limit undesirable market disturbances.
I can accept that. I can therefore endorse the substance of Amendments 2, 29 and 54.
In order not to encourage overproduction and subsequent building-up of stocks, it will be necessary to set the intervention price at a level considerably lower than the reference price of the following campaign.
Intervention will also have to be limited to a certain maximum quantity.
Finally, I think that during the restructuring period we need to dispose of all management tools, including private storage.
You also argue that as long as our international commitments are respected some quantities of quota sugar should or could be exported.
For the sake of the market balance, this is an idea that I can live with and thus I accept in principle Amendments 20, 39, 49, 51 and 68.
Many of you have mentioned bioethanol.
I share your analysis that future energy production could become a outlet for Community beet.
Along these lines, I can support Amendments 11 and 42, raising the political profile of bioethanol in the reform package.
As you are aware, the Commission is working on a whole set of political initiatives.
On 1Â February we shall adopt a proposal on the promotion of biofuels based on agricultural raw materials.
I am also aware that MrÂ Parish is currently working on a Parliament resolution on exactly the same subject.
I think we need to take this debate when these contributions have been adopted, rather than to take it now within the context of the sugar reform.
I must underline that I am very interested in coming back to this debate as it is very important.
I share the view that we need to address the specific problem arising for those growers who practise autumn growing.
This is specifically a problem in the Mediterranean countries.
That would require a provisional extension of the quota without restructuring levy for the marketing year 2006/2007.
The Commission can thus agree with the principle of Amendments 23 and 69.
I can share your concerns as regards the income of beet growers, and consent to the relevant part of Amendment 31 concerning the removal of the additional 10% flexibility for the sugar price.
On industrial sugar, I can accept the substance of Amendment 43.
Strict and complex rules that are difficult to monitor should be avoided.
There is also a series of technical amendments that were already accepted in the technical discussions on the Commission proposal.
Other amendments cover minor issues that could better be settled in the framework of the implementing rules.
I am not in a position to accept the other amendments on the reform of the COM.
Let me now move to the draft regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes.
I can support the principle of increased flexibility for Member States in the context of the compensatory payments and therefore accept the substance of Amendments 5, 6, 8 and 11, adjusted as necessary.
Building on my vision to underpin the development of bioethanol production in the Community, I can also live with the notion of Amendment 7, whereby sugar beet for purposes other than sugar production could be grown on set-aside land.
Amendment 4 and Amendment 13 present a compensation system based on the amount of sugar produced from beet from each individual farmer.
I am in favour of the proportionality principle of this reform, for instance, by advancing higher levels of compensation to Member States facing severe reductions on their quotas.
However, the draft report proposes a system that would differentiate payments based on the volume of the sugar beet produced.
Such a system would create enormous practical difficulties for a very limited added value, which would go against the shared objective of simplification, and I therefore cannot accept it.
Nor can I accept the other amendments.
Finally, let me refer to the draft regulation establishing the restructuring funds.
I can endorse the idea underlying Amendments 4 and 14, whereby beet growers can benefit from a part of the restructuring aid.
However, given the very different conditions faced by Member States, a minimum of 50% would be too high.
Let us not forget the many obligations that need to be dealt with through this restructuring fund.
There are some environmental, and some social obligations that are very important.
If we were to impose a minimum of 50%, there would be cases where we would have difficulty in meeting these different obligations.
Therefore I cannot accept it.
As mentioned already in my opening statement, a of 10%, with the possibility for the Member States to increase this percentage, seems much more appropriate.
Mrs McGuinness, this is addressed specifically to you: I would never dare interfere in the decisions taken by the Member States to decide at what level they would agree on this compensation percentage.
Likewise, I can support the principle set down in Amendment 5, and the relevant part of Amendment 10, relating to the extended flexibility for industries ceasing sugar production and moving to alternative sectors, such as the production of bioethanol.
The same applies to the notion of the partial quota surrender which is in Amendment 7.
The social element is already well covered in the proposal and additional administrative requirements would only slow down the restructuring process.
Therefore, I am of the view that Amendments 6, 9 and the relevant part of Amendment 7 should not be accepted.
