The Pensioners' Party is absolutely in favour of this report and, above all, wants Europe to regulate and strengthen pension funds based on capital formation, which are surely better than pay-as-you-go funds, which individual governments have not known how to manage properly.
I regret, however, Mr President, that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in which we discussed it, did not accept a Fatuzzo amendment calling on Member States to intervene in the event of the collapse or insolvency of pension funds.
I hope it will be successful in the next version of the directive.
Mr President, I welcome the Karas report and the compromise amendments which we agreed.
I was particularly pleased that the amendments seeking to abolish the lump sum payments that are very common in British pension funds were dropped.
There are an awful lot of people in our countries today who are very concerned about their pensions.
They feel that their pensions are under threat and insecure.
Two of my constituents interrupted their holiday to come and see me last week in the European Parliament because they were concerned that what we would vote through would jeopardise long-held pension plans that they had made in the last 10 years or so.
European legislation should not be adding to the uncertainty that people feel about their retirement.
Extra products should enhance pension security, not undermine it.
The compromises we reach today will go some way towards doing that and make sure that everyone in our countries retires on a decent pension.
. (FR) In the vote on the Karas report on institutions for occupational retirement provision, the French Socialist delegation voted in favour of the motion for rejection tabled by the GUE/NGL Group.
We believe that the funding of retirement pensions should be based on the principle of contributory schemes.
Furthermore, the text submitted to us at second reading is not acceptable and the subsequent proposals of Commissioner Bolkestein and the amendments voted for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs do not sufficiently improve the balance of the text.
Institutions for occupational retirement provision cannot be treated as mere financial instruments - they should be thought of as a form of social protection.
It is not a question of encroaching on the prerogatives of the Member States in the social field, but of the will of the European Parliament, the body representing the citizens, to stress the social importance of the text.
Since the first reading, we have fought to have the basic principles of biometric risk, regular information for participants and control of these institutions integrated into the text.
Today, on the sole pretext of avoiding having to go to the conciliation stage, the rapporteur, with the complicity of the Commissioner, is prohibiting this House, a co-legislator, from defending the interests of the citizens.
We reject this forced takeover.
.
(PT) As we all know, given the demographic changes that have taken place in the countries of the Union, it was decided, at the Lisbon Council, and in the wake of the action plan for financial services, to create a Europe-wide internal market for occupational pensions, and the utmost priority was attached to this issue.
On the basis of the principle that 'particularly where a major part of retirement provision is already provided by a pay-as-you-go system it is necessary to encourage additional contributions to retirement provision based on capital formation', the proposal for a directive is intended to facilitate the further expansion of occupational pensions as the second pillar of retirement provision, a Europe-wide organised internal market, which must contribute to greater efficiency, transparency and security within the second pillar.
Although the report tends to interfere with the labour and social legislation of the Member States, by proposing the regulation of pension funds at European level, not only for the capitals market but also for the social security systems of their beneficiaries, I have in the final analysis supported it, since it expresses the correct options for this field which, incidentally, are being adopted by the Portuguese Government.
.
(DE) I mistakenly voted against Amendment No 38, tabled by the GUE/NGL Group.
I am, however, in favour of rejecting the common position on the grounds that it is completely unsatisfactory.
The markets being shared out within the WTO between the monopolies and the heavyweights are not restricted to industrial and agricultural products; they also encompass services.
Discussions on the conditions for allowing foreign capital to move into transport, telecommunications, energy, banking services, water distribution, health, education and culture are drawing to a close, in a total lack of transparency, in complete keeping with the principle that everything can be bought and sold.
The target: the less developed countries, which the multinationals are ready to bleed dry and the necessary precondition: the privatisation and liberalisation of any remaining public sectors.
The Communist Party of Greece is radically opposed to this process.
We condemn the greed of the monopolies, the plundering of national wealth, the savage exploitation of the workers, with miserable working conditions and attacks on social benefits.
We also condemn the hypocrisy of all those proclaiming that the liberalisation of trade, the opening up of the markets and the abolition of all obstacles to the unaccountability of big business will lead to development.
We defend public ownership and administration of the basic sectors of the economy, both in our own country and in every country of the world, and we are fighting for a quality public health service and state education and for the unimpeded development of civilisation, with respect for each nation's individual characteristics.
Is the WTO an organisation for dismantling public services?
That is the impression given by the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).
Although Article 16 of the EC Treaty clearly defines the role they play in the social and territorial cohesion of the Union, public services are being sold off at a cheap price.
Postal services, energy, railways, this is happening to all of them.
And when will culture, education and health services be subjected to competition?
I would like the mandate given to Pascal Lamy, the Union's negotiator, to be clear and extremely well-defined.
Because we are talking here about the common principles and values to be defended - equality of opportunities and equality of access - and not a mere commercial negotiation.
The mandate given to the Commission should be decided unanimously by the Member States, and not by a qualified majority.
It should also be public.
Nobody has been able to see its content, not even the national parliaments, who have not been able to debate it.
And it is they who have voted for the creation of public services.
Only a few MEPs have been allowed access to the mandate document, in a room especially prepared for that purpose, with note-taking formally prohibited.
This is a wonderful example of the democratic deficit.
We have voted against Parliament's resolution which gives the Commission a mandate to negotiate a liberalisation of the trade in services, within the so-called GATS round.
This mandate has been agreed on a far too vague a basis, the Commission will exploit it widely as usual, and the people will be rendered a little more helpless by those same people who claim to make them 'stronger'.
Our fears are all the greater when we see that the Convention presided over by ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing intends to include trade policy amongst the exclusive competences of the Union, dealt with by means of a qualified majority, and to remove the exceptions (cultural and audiovisual services, education, social services and health services) which Article 133(6) of the EC Treaty stated should be dealt with by means of unanimity.
We believe such a development would make GATS even more of a trap for us.
It is also noted with some amusement that the French Government has protested and has called for unanimity on these 'very sensitive' issues to be maintained.
However, should these areas be considered more sensitive than others, than the production of water or nuclear engineering, for example?
If unanimity really ensures such good protection, why is it demonised in all European affairs?
. (FR) The trade agreements advocating deregulation and the liberalisation of international trade mean that an increasing number of areas of public services are being handed over to the market, to competition, in other words, to satisfy the appetites of private interests.
This is a disastrous development for the vast majority of society.
It is a real attack on the working classes.
It should be emphasised, however, that this is taking place with the agreement of the governments, and even at their instigation, even when they pretend to stand apart from the WTO or other similar bodies.
The problem is not only the preservation of cultural diversity, even though it can legitimately be stated that culture should not be a commodity.
How can we accept, however, that health care and education, which are essential social areas, should be placed in the hands of stupid market and competition laws?
How can we accept this for water, electricity, postal or rail services and other socially important sectors?
We want to speak out against this entire development and we oppose any opening up of public services to competition and the quest for profit. We oppose any attack on employees in these sectors and any job losses.
The liberals and conservatives of all kinds (and colours) who have signed a joint resolution have caused the failure of all the attempts to defend cultural diversity and reject the commoditisation of culture.
All the amendments of the GUE/NGL Group in this regard were rejected.
That is why, like the members of my delegation of the republican, radical, pro-citizen left, the GUE/NGL Group and a very few other socialist MEPs, I voted against this 'PPE-PSE-Liberals' resolution.
This type of Europe is not the European Europe for which I have fought for 40 years.
I am sorry that, on a subject which is so important for the future of European citizens, we have to be content with a resolution procedure.
A Commissioner should only speak on behalf of the European Union after having negotiated their mandate with the elected representatives.
The Constitution should take account of this democratic deficit if it is to succeed in bringing Europe closer to its citizens.
As the amendments proposing a new political direction for the text have been rejected, I am voting against the resolution.
Public services should not be part of negotiations. A moratorium suspending any new agreement would allow for a genuine impact assessment with regard to the other market services.
Some claim that the developing countries have asked for these agreements.
They have no choice but to privatise their public services, as the level of their debt prevents them from receiving any loans intended for the development of public services, in particular, water.
The WTO should no longer be the Trojan horse of a form of liberalism that has proved its limitations and its inability to improve the quality of life of the majority of the world's citizens.
Trade at international level is essential, but it must be conditional on adoption of and compliance with environmental and social rules.
. (FR) As is often the case in the European Parliament, the joint resolution tabled on GATS by the right (PPE-DE), the liberals (ELDR) and the socialists (PSE) is a mixture of positive and negative proposals (public negotiations, defence of cultural diversity, etc).
The general line of the project is clear, however: to pursue the liberalisation of services and strengthen the role of the WTO within the framework of unequal globalisation.
The joint resolution defends the theory, which is contradicted by the facts, that the process of opening up market services is beneficial to everyone and states in recitals A and C that its objective is to convince poor nations that the success of the WTO is essential for the economy of every country, rich or poor.
Instead of calling for the suspension of the round that began in Doha and a moratorium on GATS negotiations - conservative measures without which it would be impossible to exercise democracy - it advocates greater liberalisation in a number of sectors, including telecommunications and maritime transport (Articles 3 and 8).
The authors of the joint resolution are aware of the general concern caused by GATS.
However, nominal precautions cannot conceal the fact that the adoption of this resolution would represent one more step towards the commoditisation of services.
We voted against it.
. (FR) Services and, in particular, public services, are the key issue, not only because they represent two-thirds of European GDP, but also because they affect the very heart of the identity of a people and their culture.
So should we privatise and commoditise the world's public goods such as health, literacy, knowledge and water?
According to the WTO, the answer is yes.
Everything is a commodity.
According to the European Commission, the answer is also yes, but a whispered yes, because, ideologically, Brussels subscribes to the philosophy of the 'libertarians' who believe in selling everything, even the police, the army and humanitarian affairs, through ECHO.
People pretend that they want to preserve cultural diversity.
It seems that culture and audio-visual media cannot be treated as commodities, while agriculture, which is the foundation of civilisation, has been in the hands of the market since the Uruguay Round.
It has also been said that no liberalisation offer has been made by Europe in the fields of health, education or audio-visual media.
However, US intellectual 'fast food' chains are already buying a university in Madrid.
The audio-visual media of Berlusconi, Bouygues and Murdoch are a commodity.
There is also water, which the former Director-General of the IMF, Mr Camdessus, says is a major factor in corruption, particularly in France with Lyonnaise des Eaux.
The confidential nature of the negotiations, the uncertainty regarding the services concerned and the hair-splitting regarding the distinction between globalised trade and nationalised regulation makes GATS an agreement made behind the backs of the people.
The explanation that Commissioner Lamy gave on Monday 10 March at the beginning of the debate on the commitment of the EU to the GATS negotiations sounded reassuring.
The European socio-economic model must be retained, government monopolies remain possible, it is not a question of compulsory privatisation or liberalisation and all the commitments that the EU enters into are temporary, so that they do not have a permanent influence on internal political considerations.
The reason for regulating such matters in the World Trade Organisation context is that bilateral contracts outside this organisation lead to more arbitrariness, uncontrollability and circumstances beyond one's control.
In spite of this explanation the fear being articulated by the US and by the developing world is that the position of the EU is quite a different one.
The EU is said to want to give companies from its own Member States access to activities such as water distribution and possibly even water collection that within the EU are still predominantly in the hands of publicly owned enterprises.
The availability of drinking water for the poor is said to be under threat.
Can we now speak of the EU being much tougher on the outside world than on its own Member States and inhabitants?
The concluding response from Mr Lamy sounded less reassuring than his beginning.
For me this is a reason for putting supplementary questions to the European Commission shortly.
If all the amendments from the Left are rejected, I will vote against.
Mr President, it was a matter of huge satisfaction, I am sure to yourself as well as to myself, that the resolution on the crisis in the fishing sector was carried by such a vast majority as 508 to 7, with 27 abstentions.
That really does represent a ringing endorsement by the European Parliament of the need to take decisive steps to give assistance to an industry which is in crisis and nowhere more so, as you well know, than in Scotland at the present time.
I recently visited Eyemouth in the south of Scotland and will shortly visit both Oban and Campbeltown on the west coast.
These are communities gravely affected by this crisis, but even worse is the situation in the north of Scotland.
If we cannot do things adequately to help that industry it will collapse.
Thus even when the cod stocks are restored, there will be no viable industry to go out and catch them.
This is a vital part of a sustainable diet for Europeans in the future.
We must have an adequate fishing industry.
We must support it properly and, if we put up the money, our government in the United Kingdom must take it up.
It has been said that they will not go cap in hand to the Commission looking for money.
This is not cap in hand.
The money is willingly being offered.
Let it be taken up.
In February 2001 when this Parliament discussed cod stock recovery measures, the Nicholson report clearly stated and I quote: '? the Commission's current proposal for a further closure in 2001 can only be accepted with the greatest reluctance ?
However, if 2001 is a repeat of 2000, then no one should be surprised if fishermen lend their support to calls for emergency aid along the lines of that enjoyed by the agriculture sector for so long and by fishing fleets in other parts of the Community'.
Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans cannot disregard the social and economic consequences which they will have.
Recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry.
2003 is a repeat of 2002 is a repeat of 2001 is a repeat of 2000.
Fishermen are now demanding emergency aid to compensate for losses incurred by coastal communities as a result of cod conservation measures, and I for one support them.
The utmost respect must be paid to the need for social, economic and regional cohesion and the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of those regions highly dependent on fisheries.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) Once again, fishermen disagree with the Commission.
The Commission seems to be using cod as a guinea pig to test the new tool that it has managed to impose on the Council as part of its regeneration plans for endangered species: limiting fishing.
The use of this tool is, of course, likely to be extended: there is already talk about hake and sole in the Bay of Biscay.
The Commission's proposal on cod is based, as ever, on the most recent opinions of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which is made up of several partners outside Europe and which has taken up many controversial positions in the past.
It is indisputable that some stocks of cod are, in many areas, in a vulnerable situation.
However, by holding fishing solely responsible for that situation, the Commission risks condemning fishermen without replenishing the resources.
The reason that we are abstaining on the Stevenson resolution is solely because it advocates applying codecision to the CFP, which, in our opinion, does not need further uncertainty and unpredictability.
Apart from this, we do, of course, support this resolution.
Mr President, this document deals with employment strategy and social policy.
I voted for it, naturally, but I should still like to make a point.
I often hear it said by certain enlightened and important economists that employment strategy cannot be divorced from pensions strategy.
If one talks about increasing employment in Europe, one should also be talking about reforming pensions for those in work.
I must emphasise, however, Mr President, that one should call a spade a spade and say what one thinks.
When people talk about a European employment strategy, they are trying to increase the number of jobs in Europe, but when they talk about a European pensions strategy, unfortunately, they are talking about reducing and cutting pensions.
It is time people explained what they actually mean by what they say!
Unfortunately, recent employment statistics for the European Union paint a very black picture.
Employment rates are dropping in both Greece and Germany.
Substantial measures must be taken at once to increase employment.
First, if war in Iraq is averted, this will stimulate investment both globally and in the European Union, where it will impact on employment.
Secondly, relaxing the Stability Pact will encourage government intervention to foster growth and employment.
Thirdly, employment indicators need to be set so that, as with economic indicators, the Member States' unemployment policies can be monitored and reinforced.
Fourthly, measures are needed to coordinate taxes on SMEs and combat social exclusion and undeclared employment, none of which alone will suffice, at least not in the restrictive sense referred to in the motion for a resolution which I voted against.
The explanatory statement for this report welcomes the drop in unemployment at European level.
However, there is no reason to welcome the figure of 13 million unemployed that the text gives, which is certainly underestimated and which, moreover, fails to take into account those who have to settle for precarious and badly paid employment.
Moreover, for several months, the number of unemployed has again been rising in all the countries of the Union.
How could it be otherwise, when the most powerful industrial groups on the continent are announcing considerable reductions in their workforce and closing their factories one after another?
In these circumstances, talking about employment strategy, to quote the title of the report, might appear quite unsavoury to the millions of employees who are being thrown into poverty purely so that the companies making them redundant can give their shareholders higher dividends by paying fewer salaries.
We voted against this text because its philosophy is that it is the sovereign right of employers to decide whether or not to keep jobs, while it is clear that, without corrective measures forcing companies to use their current or past profits to maintain jobs and salaries, the number of unemployed will continue to rise and poverty will continue to increase.
. (FR) The commitment made in Lisbon to a European future characterised by a quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater social cohesion seems to be highly threatened by this report, if it is amended today in the ways proposed by Mr Mann.
Those amendments, which have been reinserted for the plenary sitting, entirely undermine the work done by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to restore balance to the rapporteur's text in favour of an employment policy that it not only concerned with increased flexibility and reducing tax pressure, but also and above all with establishing quality employment for all as quickly as possible: training and education must therefore be the pivots of our policy, and second-rate jobs and other unqualified jobs must disappear.
The report thus amended ignores the principles of solidarity and social cohesion, which are essential and objective principles to achieve for anyone seriously seeking to establish a new employment strategy, a generous strategy that places the person at the centre of all its concerns.
I can therefore only oppose the report amended in this way, as it adopts neo-liberal principles in advocating an employment policy that ignores the person.
. (FR) Paragraph 23 makes a useful reference to the European social model.
This model should be developed in order to safeguard social standards that are attractive to the rest of the world.
Giving employees the possibility of having a share in business assets is a path that we must take and that should bring about fresh proposals from the Commission to take effect in particular in the Member States, by using the system of tax exemptions.
In this context, the use of tax exemptions in high-employability sectors (public works, services, hotel and catering trade, etc.) should be integrated into the European social model.
.
(PT) We welcome the fact that the report, with the proposals for amendments appended to it by the PPE-DE and Liberal Groups, has been rejected.
We contributed to its rejection by voting against not only the most negative amendments but also against the final resolution.
We thereby prevented the adoption specifically of the proposals that insisted on:
greater flexibility in current legislation in the labour field, which would lead to those seeking employment being offered various types of employment contracts and working time regulations;
criticising the fact that the provisions relating to the internal market have not been fully transposed in all Member States, which explains why there is a lack of adequate competition.
As you can see from these few examples, the report's approach was to insist on speeding up the implementation of neoliberal policies. I am therefore happy that Parliament has rejected it.
On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, we voted for those parts of the Mann report which encourage entrepreneurship, and we believe in supporting the work of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which on some estimates account for up to 70% of all employment in the EU.
Our vote is in line with the need for those running SMEs not to endure unnecessary tax burdens or inappropriate regulation.
I fully support the report in saying that the innovation and information society will play a key role in making the EU competitive and more research should be channelled into these areas.
Efforts are being made to resolve the problem of unemployment by stepping up the neo-liberal monetarist policies and persisting with the financial prudence which were responsible for the current recession and high unemployment in the first place.
Under the misleading heading of 'sustainable development and full employment' coined in Lisbon and despite increasing inequalities, the Member States are being called on to complete structural reforms which share out unemployment, make flexible forms of work the norm, create uncertainty and job insecurity and reduce wage costs in order to safeguard sustained growth in profits for big business.
Widespread long-term unemployment which, at over 10%, has been the scourge of the working classes for years, is now twinned with widespread temporary and limited forms of employment.
Demographic change and the sustainability of the funds are being used as an excuse for proposing that people work into later life, as part of an 'active ageing' policy, and for subverting the insurance and pension system.
Increasing investment will not solve the problem as most investment is in technological equipment which cuts rather than creates jobs.
We are opposed to EU policies in keeping with the Stability Pact and the Lisbon process because they do not meet the needs of workers, farmers and small and medium-sized businesses, they are designed to undermine workers' rights and they dance to the tune called by big business.
.
(PT) Unfortunately, this report has not been approved.
I would say that, through trying to reach a balance between so many conflicting points of view, the report ended up losing its own balance ...
I myself felt obliged to abstain from the final vote, because I felt that it went too far on fiscal policy, running the risk of placing harmonization in conflict with the autonomy of the Member States.
Nevertheless, I must praise the intense work and efforts made by Mr Mann and I fully support the idea of promoting new initiatives for the strategy for employment and social policy in the European Union, in line with the Lisbon Strategy.
The rapporteur suggests approaches that deserve to be supported and followed up.
I fully support the emphasis he gives to family protection, to set as guidelines for employment compatibility between work and family, pursuing a policy that is more favourable to children and families, or to make work more attractive to older people.
I would also reiterate my position on the greater speed with which initiatives must be implemented in the fields of vocational training, lifelong learning, and in Community incentives in the field of research, where success stories in the various Member States should be more widely shared.
Following the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit, we have always stressed the need for a balance between quality and quantity.
We have therefore made some real progress, and we must combat the scourge of unemployment.
However, we need to be on our guard in relation to social plans, company restructuring, relocations and mass redundancies.
We cannot be content with the precarious situation being experienced by an increasing number of our fellow citizens.
Parliament has a real duty to guard against these things.
Mr Mann has given the opposite message, which is unacceptable, by presenting us with an entirely neo-liberal profession of faith.
We now need a real battle against poverty and in favour of employment.
We do not accept casual, unqualified jobs, and we do not accept employees being placed in a precarious situation.
On the contrary, we need to place the emphasis on training and qualifications, and support the most vulnerable.
We need to be very vigilant on the employment of women, and we need to enable young people to enter the employment market with hope.
We do not want the markets in the service trade (GATS) to be deregulated and opened up unchecked.
We will not sacrifice all our social heritage which has been acquired at such a high price.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure).
. (PT) Given the current situation of employment, caused in particular by the relocation of undertakings whose priority is profit, without any consideration for the importance of the 'function of work' to social development, to the mental wellbeing of workers and their extended families, the European Parliament as the institution representing the people of Europe, absolutely must adopt a strong stance on a global strategy to promote employment and its corresponding social policy in the European Union.
We are in favour of a European social policy that runs through all other development and growth policies pursued by the Union.
Mr President, even in the broad economic policy guidelines, which talk especially of balancing the budgets of the individual countries of the European Union, there is no mention - and although I voted for the report I am concerned about this - of what should be done to remedy a country's budget whenever a budget is said to be weighed down, scuttled or ruined by the large number of pensioners whose pensions are paid out of the country's budget.
I ask you, then, Mr President, although I am specifically addressing the Heads of Government and the Council: do we want first to set how much pension we should pay citizens and then spend what we have left, or do we want first to spend the whole State budget and then, if we have anything left - I repeat, if we have anything left - throw the scraps to the pensioners?
. (FR) While stressing the importance of respecting the provisions of the Stability Pact and stepping up the reforms adopted in Lisbon, the GarcÃ­a-Margallo report remains deaf to the criticisms and strong disagreements that are being heard increasingly loudly from public opinion.
It remains blind to the increase in unemployment, mass redundancies and sudden closures of companies.
What crime have the employees of Metaleurope committed?
What sort of 'stability' are we talking about when lives are shattered for the sake of being 'consistent with monetary policy'?
We always hear the same old thing: liberalisation of the markets requires sacrifices!
Instead of this, I would have liked the EU to aim for a genuine pact for employment and growth, based on satisfying the needs of the people, increasing salaries, a real policy to create jobs and wealth.
I can therefore only oppose the report's approach of 'not calling into question macro-economic stability', which means that employers receive public funds and can shut companies down, without being accountable for it.
I cannot support the invitation to 'further liberalise services of general interest (...) namely postal services, telecommunications, gas and electricity, rail and air transport, and broadcasting'.
.
(PT) This report does not address the fundamental issue of the problem of demand in the EU and makes no assessment of the economic and employment guidelines that addresses the current economic crisis and the increase in unemployment.
The cause it suggests is the 'rigidity of the European economy', which prevents it from 'reacting swiftly to external shocks'.
The problem lies in what rigidity we are talking about.
We do not use the word 'rigid' of current monetary policy, which sets the same requirements for interest and exchange rates for countries with differing needs and different levels of inflation, thereby reducing regions' ability to react to asymmetric economic events. This ability is further weakened by the Community budget, which does not make up the shortfall in Member States' redistribution and solidarity needs.
We do not call the budgetary policy contained in the Stability Pact 'rigid', even though this determines levels of public investment, including the application of the structural funds, and endangers crucial public services and areas that are vital to innovation and productivity, such as investment in education, health and research and development.
The report insists on greater flexibility in pay and in the labour market, which contributes to pay disputes and to job instability.
It wishes to see greater flexibility in the products market, in particular by pursuing the approach of privatising, liberalising and deregulating the markets.
Hence our vote against the report.
This report adopts the anti-grass roots policies of the ?U, which subvert the rights of the workers for the benefit of the monopolies.
It fully supports the application of the Stability Pact, speedier structural reform of the job market, reduced wages, an increase in the retirement age, full liberalisation of services of public interest, especially postal services, telecommunications, energy, transport and radio and television broadcasting and calls for lower taxes on businessmen.
It openly maintains that the slump on the job market and the failure to fully apply flexible forms of work are one of the main causes of unemployment.
For the sake of balancing the budget, which is the alibi used for constant cuts in social spending and the privatisation of public utilities, big business is being empowered and called on to complete the dismantling of insurance and pension systems.
The clouds of war are gathering, imperialist infighting is getting worse and an end to the recession is nowhere in sight (the Commission is forecasting practically zero growth of -0.1% to 0.5% for 2003), and yet the main concern is to strengthen the competitiveness and profitability of the European monopolies.
We are opposed to these anti-grass roots policies and we stand by the workers in their fight to reverse them.
. (FR) The only aim of this report is for Parliament to unconditionally support the Commission's plans.
Apart from the inevitable catalogue of good intentions - promoting the spirit of enterprise, increasing investments in human resources and research and development - which we can only support, the report is a perfect illustration of the Pavlovian mindset that governs this Parliament: the Commission only has to act as the high priest of European integration for Parliament to automatically agree wholeheartedly with it.
The same applies to the desire to make the Commission the economic government of Europe, and to the desire to liberalise services of general interest and network industries, primarily postal services, telecommunications, gas and electricity and railways.
While greater economic convergence between the economic powers of the Member States is clearly desirable, in order to be viable it must operate with respect for their authority and by doing so be a natural result of free economic competition between the Member States, not of technocratic decisions that ignore national realities.
.
(PT) I acknowledge the importance and the timeliness of this own-initiative report by the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs, both because of the troubled current geopolitical context (which requires a clarification of objectives and of the direction to take), and because of the debate that needs to be launched on vital issues such as the low levels of public and private investment, low productivity growth, the trend of falling rates of employment and the ageing of the population.
Furthermore, it is important, in this context, that we all give due consideration to the impact of issues such as the excessive indebtedness of individuals and undertakings, our over-dependency in energy and the impact of China and India's entry into the world of industrial production.
Although the report does not refer to these aspects, they are nonetheless medium and long-term concerns, for which Europe's citizens are calling for 'bold measures from the EU's decision-makers'.
Lastly, because I do not share the unreserved devotion to the politically federalist and boundlessly liberal vision of the European Union which underlies the rapporteur's analysis, I decided to abstain from the final overall vote.
The Trentin report welcomes the extremely satisfactory implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, which was, nevertheless, criticised not long ago as being somewhat stupid by the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi.
In the face of an economic slowdown, the report is of the view that the most appropriate response is to implement structural reforms, which we know will only stifle endogenous growth, which it mentions elsewhere in the report.
Like the GarcÃ­a-Margallo and dos Santos reports, on which we are also voting, the Trentin report promotes intelligent application of the Pact and the adjustments that this involves.
However, it combines intelligence and stupidity in an incoherent approach that is trying to make things compatible with each other that are not.
Clearly the structural reforms mentioned mean more precarious employment, globalised pensions and further privatisations.
Faced with the rise in unemployment, the alternative is to simply abandon the Stability Pact for a policy focused on job creation through a major change in the way profits are distributed.
As we see no trace of such a possibility, we have voted against this report, which is only proposing inconsistent patching up of the Pact.
.
(PT) I congratulate Mr Trentin on his excellent and timely report on the annual assessment of the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes, which I fully support, especially with regard to the need in the current context to review the criteria for monetary and budgetary rigidity imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact and by the stability and convergence programmes, because this rigidity has stifled economic growth in the European Union, has failed to provide a response to the high levels of unemployment and inequality and has not ensured sustainable development.
I also wish to highlight the need, whilst meeting the objectives of reducing the budgetary deficit and public debts, to include certain indicators in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact that can be adapted to the differing national situations, especially to those of the cohesion countries.
This report is faithful to monetarist and federalist doctrine and defends an even more rigid interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact, which does not at all live up to its name.
This is not so much about learning from what is happening before our eyes but about taking action against those Member States who are guilty of not submitting to the obligations of a text that now constitutes a vice that is holding back economic revival in an unsustainable way.
Above all, it is clear that the absolutisation of the Stability Pact is not only motivated by purely economic considerations, but is now a truly political aim.
Surely we can all see that budgetary balance is not simply seen as an economically commendable objective, which is simply common sense, but has been raised to the status of a dogma that no one should go against, on pain of endangering an entire structure (EMU) built for primarily political motives (establishing the first genuinely federalist European structure)?
This is why the rapporteur, rather than analysing the current economic situation, insists on placing more emphasis on the strictness of the Stability Pact, particularly by increasing the Commission's autonomy in monitoring the Member States.
That approach is unacceptable.
.
(PT) I have voted in favour of the dos Santos report, which I felt achieved balance in stating that the Stability and Growth Pact, as a valuable and crucial instrument for Economic and Monetary Union, must also contribute effectively to implementing the Lisbon Strategy.
We therefore need to consider a way of making the SGP more flexible by introducing more sophisticated criteria.
I also felt that the suggestion that we must select and distinguish certain types of expenditure, particularly public expenditure, warrants support in the wake of the communication by the European Commission intended to guarantee 'high quality public expenditure', so as to ensure that the dynamic created by public investment is achieved, and results in a guarantee of sustained growth.
I simply wish to observe that in addition to SGP-related issues of an accounting and mathematical nature, which the rapporteur addressed in an exemplary way, there is a psychological aspect to the economic fabric that must be closely examined: meeting the commitments arising from this establishes a new level of responsibility for all and any economic operator, whether it be the State or a private entrepreneur.
Only this framework of effective responsibility can make an objective contribution to our being able to make solid progress towards achieving the most dynamic economic area in the world, based on knowledge and able to guarantee sustainable growth with more ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(PT) Following up the observation that 'two years of disappointing economic performance have triggered a slack in the proactive policies pursued in reacting to the threat of recession and the upsurge in unemployment', it is actually important to look at the mechanisms available to us in order to respond effectively to the requirements arising, as a matter of fact, from the commitments that have been given, in particular under the Lisbon Strategy.
I also think that we must take the opportunity to include amongst the criteria and objectives approved in the Stability and Growth Pact certain indicators facilitating the more flexible governance of this Pact, adapting it to the various specific national situations and at the same time upholding the objectives of reducing the budgetary deficit and public debt.
Achieving these objectives, and I am also referring here to the dos Santos report, is of enormous importance, because these establish a new degree of responsibility, which is an extremely important message to send to economic operators.
I have consequently voted in favour of this report.
I voted against the report when item 15 was voted down by the political Left (with 266 votes in favour of doing so and 237 votes against).
Item 15 'calls for the Stability and Growth Pact to be scrupulously adhered to, and for all attempts to soften the Pact, thereby jeopardising the long-term stability of the European currency, to be resisted'.
The fact that item 15 has been removed makes room for laxity in the Stability and Growth Pact. Instead, strict compliance with objective and measurable criteria should be required.
The removal of item 15 opens the way for European finance ministers to increase public expenditure in times of recession and in situations in which there are budget deficits.
There is a danger of this leading to increased inflation, a loss of confidence and a less stable EU currency.
I voted against the entire report - which was nonetheless adopted on the basis of 359 votes in favour, 79 against and 50 abstentions - because it would entail a relaxation of the Stability and Growth Pact and undermine the Swedish constitution.
I voted in favour of item 5 to the effect that a possible introduction of the euro should be subject to a referendum.
Sweden will not be forced to enter into economic and monetary union if the majority of voters support the Swedish krona.
It is worth noting that this item was adopted on the basis of 486 votes in favour, 3 against and 8 abstentions.
I voted in favour of removing item 4, that is to say against the Stability and Growth Pact's being implemented in 'a more flexible way'.
In practice, this item would entail a relaxation of the objective criteria in favour of vaguer, politically negotiable criteria.
Unfortunately, this item remained in place.
The euro requires clear and stable rules.
The decision means a reduction in confidence in the euro as a currency.
I voted against item 10 to the effect that EC law takes precedence over Swedish law, even before Swedish legislation has been amended.
The purpose of this item is to make it possible to introduce the euro as a currency without Swedish legislation's having been amended, that is to say before the elections to the Swedish Parliament in 2006.
The item would mean that the rules governing the way in which the Swedish constitution is amended would be circumvented by EC law.
Mr President, we are talking about the finances of the countries that have adopted the euro.
I voted in favour, I am for the euro, but - today, now, before I wish everyone, including you, Mr President, the interpreters and the ushers, 'Bon appÃ©tit' - I should like to highlight something.
It would be good if the governments of the countries that have adopted the euro took care - something they have not done so far - that unscrupulous traders, profiteers who only think of themselves, do not raise the prices of consumer products that are bought by citizens, workers and pensioners, that is, people on fixed incomes.
Indeed, taking advantage of the fact that in the changeover from the national currency to the European currency, the euro, people are not yet used to the value of the new money, as is certainly the case in Italy and I believe also in other countries in the European Union, there has been a disproportionate rise in the cost of products that are mainly bought by the least well-off, especially pensioners and citizens with what is, I regret to say, a modest income.
Parliament is once again acting as a cog in the machine of urgent demands from the college in Brussels.
The majority in Parliament are free to desire 'an intelligent and flexible application of the Pact in the manner proposed by the Commission', or to support it when it arbitrarily initiates accusatory proceedings against Member States that cannot conform to a zealous interpretation of the provisions of the Stability Pact, but personally, I cannot go down that road.
Although I think that the intended adjustments made by the Commission, which recognise that the budgetary deficit has both a structural component and a component linked to the economic cycle, are indeed well founded in that they strengthen the growth element without endangering the stability element, I cannot, however, forget that this spectacular u-turn is part of a more general strategy aimed at making the Commission the economic government of the Union.
It goes without saying that I cannot accept such a possibility.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, page 17 of the Minutes details what was said and done in yesterday's Question Time, which was announced on the screens only after it had begun three-quarters of an hour late.
It should have been my turn half an hour after the beginning of Question Time, and, although I ran down here straight away, my question had already been dropped, as none of those down to put questions in the first half-hour had been there.
I then asked that my question should be allowed anyway, as it was the question immediately following it that was being dealt with, but the President stuck to the rules with extreme rigour.
I would just like to say that you should either stick strictly to the rules - which means that you start Question Time punctually - or else, if you are going to be sloppy anyway, you have to exercise some liberality in these matters.
That is the first thing I wanted to say, and I ask you to see to it that I do not get the standard reminder telling me that I should have been present at Question Time, for, if I do, I will have to reply to it in somewhat personal terms.
Now for the second point that I wanted to mention in this context: Mr Puerta, who was presiding yesterday, promised me and Mr Salafranca, who had the same problem, that we would get written answers - which represents a deviation from customary practice - and I would ask you to ensure that this promise, at any rate, is kept to.
Thank you, Mr Posselt, for your comment, which has been noted so that the necessary action can be taken.
(?he Minutes were approved)
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the military mission of the Union in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The President-in-Office of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, Mr Papandreou, has the floor.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin this statement, if I may, with a few words about a good friend of mine, Zoran Djindjic, the prime minister of Serbia, who sadly has been assassinated.
This is a shocking incident because we have lost a friend, we have lost a European ally, we have lost someone who was fighting for democracy and stability in the region, the region of south-eastern Europe and the Balkans.
I should like to convey my personal condolences to his family, his wife and children and, of course, the Serbian nation as a whole.
We share their pain. ?his tragic incident today has not only shocked us, it has reminded us that we, the European Union, remain committed to efforts to bring about stability, efforts to bring about peace and efforts to bring about progress in this region of Europe, a region which has been through hard times over recent years, with endless upheavals and ethnic conflicts, a region in which democracy has taken root in every country but is still in its infancy, a region in which, thanks to cooperation between the European Union, the international community, the UN, the United States, Russia and numerous others, spearheaded by Europe, we have managed to set stability and development in motion.
However, this incident shows that we still have a long way to go.
As President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to point out that the operation we are discussing in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia highlights our role in and our commitment to this region, our commitment to helping this region move towards Europe and, above all, our commitment to stability and peace in the region.
This operation is important on several counts.
First, it will help to pave the way for long-term security and stability in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity and the inviolability of its internationally recognised borders.
Secondly, this operation will help enhance the role and profile of the European Union in this country.
It will, if you like, reinforce this country's progress towards European integration within the context of the Stabilisation and Association Process.
It will facilitate the application of the framework agreement.
Thirdly, it will be the first practical test of the European military crisis management mechanism and the second step, following the policing mission in Bosnia, in putting the European Union's operational capability into practice.
Consequently, preparations and the operation itself need to be completed with the utmost care.
Our credibility, the credibility of the European Union, hangs in the balance.
Fourthly, this is the first practical application of cooperation between the European Union and NATO in the crisis management sector and implementation of the related permanent arrangements, which we expect to be completed very quickly.
The European Union has taken over this operation subject to two basic preconditions.
First, permanent arrangements between the European Union and NATO must be completed and concluded and, secondly, a request must be submitted by the official authorities in the country in question.
As far as the first precondition is concerned, permanent arrangements are nearing completion.
Almost all the relevant draft texts have already been agreed by ???? and transmitted to the European Union.
We shall make any comments or observations needed on our part and expect to have the texts ready for signing by the two organisations very shortly, in all events before the month is out.
As far as the second precondition is concerned, we already have an official request from the government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia asking the European Union to take over this mission and all the parties involved have welcomed the initiative in question.
The Greek Presidency has included the takeover of this mission in its basic priorities in the ESDP area and is therefore making every effort along these lines.
We should also point out that our taking over this specific mission and possibly other missions in the Balkans, such as the SForce operation in Bosnia, does not mean that the involvement and presence of ???? and/or the United States has come to an end.
On the contrary, we shall continue to work in close cooperation and we need to make it clear to all sides that this cooperation is continuing and that we shall be working together for the stability and security of the region.
Similarly, as we shall be taking over from ????, rather than starting a new operation, we shall need to work closely with the alliance in order to ensure there is a seamless takeover and continuity.
We shall, of course, need to take over within the specific permanent arrangements agreed, in order to safeguard the autonomy of both organisations.
As far as progress is concerned in the light of what I have just said, I should like to comment briefly on the main milestones so far in preparing for this mission.
The Council adopted the general idea of the operation on 23 January and the related joint action on 27 January.
The institutional framework for the operation and, more importantly, the funding arrangements, are in place.
The Political and Security Committee decided which third countries would be invited to participate on 4 February.
They are the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Iceland, Norway, Turkey and Canada.
On 7 February, the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe was appointed as operation commander.
It was decided that operational headquarters would be at S????. The French force commander was also appointed, given that France has been elected to act as framework nation.
On the same day, the initial military guideline was issued to the operation commander.
The operation commander has submitted a draft operational plan, including the rules of engagement administration and control structure and a statement of resource requirements, to the Military Committee.
On 18 February, the Political and Security Committee therefore decided to set up a Contributions Committee.
Finally, the conference to set up the force was held on 20 February and the conference to appoint the force staff was held on 25 February.
A number of outstanding issues have yet to be completed; the permanent European Union/???? arrangements I referred to earlier have to be officially concluded, especially the agreement needed in order to release the NATO assets and capabilities which will be supplied to the European Union so that it can carry out this mission, the operational plan has to be approved and adopted, staffing arrangements have to be completed, the operational budget has to be approved, an agreement has to be concluded with third participating countries, correspondence on the operation needs to be exchanged with the former Yugoslav Republic, an agreement on the status of the forces has to be concluded with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, exemption agreements between the Member States involved in the operation have to be concluded, correspondence needs to be exchanged with the OSCE about relations with its observers, ???? has to pass a decision ending the 'Allied Harmony' operation and the Council has to pass a decision inaugurating the operation.
This decision will set the exact date on which the operation is taken over.
It is expected to start officially before the end of the month, as soon as the outstanding issues I mentioned have been taken care of.
Before closing, I should like, if I may, to comment on the objective, duration, size of the force and command of the operation.
The objective is to maintain the international military presence in order to prepare the ground for a stable security environment which will allow the government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to apply the Ohrid framework agreement.
It is expected to last about six months.
The end of the operation will depend on when the basic objective is achieved.
The force numbers 487 men, including 212 staff positions.
The structure and control of the operation are vital to the command of the operation.
The Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, Admiral Feist, who will head the European operation in the FYROM, recently reported on this in detail to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I do not want to bore you with the details; however, I would simply like to mention that it has been decided that the operation in FYROM will be carried out using NATO assets and capabilities; consequently, the planning will be as decided in Nice.
The Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe has been appointed as operation commander, and the European Union operational headquarters will be at S????.
As I mentioned, the operational plan has already been drawn up and submitted to the Military Committee of the European Union, and S???? and the Military Staff of the European Union are working in close cooperation.
In order to ensure optimum coordination of activities between the European Union and ????, and especially between the forces of the European Union in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and ???? forces, which will mainly be stationed in Kosovo, a command base has been set up in the European Union, at the NATO base in Naples in Italy.
As I said, France has been elected as the framework nation for the operation and will have the lead role in directing the operation.
Brigadier-General Maral has therefore been appointed as force commander.
However, ???? will keep a supreme military representative at allied headquarters in Skopje and the two staffs will therefore work in close collaboration.
I should like to close this briefing on a note of optimism; I trust that, despite the difficulties, which were only to be expected, the European security and defence policy has now come of age.
And now that it has come of age, the crisis management mechanism built up over the last four years can be implemented.
This first operation is, I think, particularly important.
We welcome this initiative on the part of the European Union, because the presidency was able to overcome obstacles to cooperation between the ESDP and NATO during the previous six months of the ESDP.
We are looking forward both to the positive implementation of these decisions and to really being able to bring peace and stability to this region of south-eastern Europe, especially in the wake of incidents such as today's tragic incident.
Mr President, I wish to begin by associating myself wholeheartedly with all that the Foreign Minister has just said about the murder of Prime Minister Djindjic.
I should like to extend my sympathy and, I am sure, the sympathy of the House to his family and friends and to all democrats in Serbia.
Clearly we must not allow this assassination to set back the remarkable progress which has been made by Serbia in rejoining the European family, not least thanks to the bravery of men and women like Mr Djindjic.
In about one and a half hours I am supposed to be flying to Croatia.
This means I shall miss the end of the next debate, which will be left in the capable hands of Commissioner Bolkestein.
Tomorrow evening I had planned to fly to Belgrade.
Obviously, if it is still convenient for the authorities, I would like to do that and to express the solidarity of Parliament, the Commission and the Union as a whole with the government and people of Serbia in what is an extremely worrying time for them.
The first European Union military operation is, as the Foreign Minister has said, about to start operations in the Balkans.
It is an historic step for the European Security and Defence Policy.
After the Copenhagen decisions we are now moving towards a wide-ranging set of arrangements with NATO - described by the Foreign Minister - which will enable our strategic partnership with them to go hand in hand with the entry into operation of the ESDP.
The decision taken by the Council in January to embark on a joint action opened a new chapter in the history of our integration, and it is not surprising that this chapter will have its first lines written in the Balkans.
This historic dimension justifies fully the debate we are having today on the basis of the motion for a resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
All of us remember the tragic events which took place in south-east Europe at the beginning of the nineties.
Faced with a situation no one would have thought possible in our continent, the European Union had to develop new tools to strengthen its capacity to prevent and, if necessary, deal with any similar crises which could potentially endanger our security and which certainly offend our deepest values.
It is therefore not by chance that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to be the setting for this new step forward by the European Union.
The context of this operation is no longer the imperative to put an end to the civil conflict and to separate the fighters.
It is rather the continuation of the build-up of a closer relationship between the Union and a country which is moving towards the European Union and which needs our support to consolidate the stability without which it will not be able to progress along this path.
I would like here to remind the House that only two years ago the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was on the edge of a civil conflict, but thankfully turned its back on war when an agreement was reached between the conflicting parties.
During my first two years or so as a Commissioner I visited FYROM much more than any other place.
In one period of just over a year I was in Macedonia almost ten times.
A substantial and sustained commitment by the European Union - political as well as financial - supported the process.
Thus we offered both a European perspective to the country through the Stabilisation and Association Process and through increased financial support.
A few figures can illustrate how substantial our financial assistance package has been.
More than EUR 30 million was allocated in 2001 through the CARDS programme and the Rapid Reaction Mechanism, while nearly EUR 7 million was delivered in humanitarian assistance.
These funds have been focused on de-mining, housing reconstruction, local infrastructure rehabilitation, confidence-building measures and institutional reforms required under the Framework Agreement.
This effort was quickly followed up by the adoption of a multiannual programme which, under CARDS, earmarked EUR 130.5 million for democracy, the rule of law, justice and home affairs, and economic and social development.
These efforts have been paying off.
The last few months have shown that political life is returning to normal, based on the implementation of the Framework Agreement and on the Stabilisation and Association Process.
It is true that the security situation is still fragile.
Last week's incident, which tragically cost the lives of two Polish NATO officers, has been a further illustration that a continued international security presence is needed for the coming months in order to consolidate peace and security in the country and to underpin the implementation of the Lake Ohrid Agreement.
This assessment is shared by the government, the President, the main political parties and international players.
Here I would like to address some of the concerns which may have emerged regarding the scope and the objective of the European Union military mission.
Even if the European Union operation will only be of limited size, let me state clearly that I do not consider that this has ever been a useful criterion against which to evaluate its worth.
It will be a visible sign of our commitment to safeguarding stability in this country.
Secondly, we do not need to have second thoughts.
Our objectives are clear.
As rightly pointed out in the motion for a resolution, the planned European Union takeover of the NATO military mission will be a further demonstration of the European Union's commitment to peace and stability in the country and in the region.
It is fully consistent with our policy to contribute to the long-term security of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Let me just remind the House of the comprehensive package of financial assistance given by the Community in the security sector, under the justice and home affairs heading.
Between 2002 and 2004 EUR 31.2 million have been earmarked for this purpose.
This encompasses two crucial elements in particular.
The first is support for the country to manage its borders through a comprehensive integrated border management programme, which includes creating an effective border police corps.
The process of improving border security and management has a strong component of regional cooperation, and so the European Union is currently working closely with NATO and the OSCE to support the efforts which the countries in the region have started to make themselves.
The second element is support for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in developing a comprehensive strategy for the reform of its police service, to make it a well-trained, multi-ethnic and community-based public service.
In the view of the Commission, the European Union operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will contribute to consolidating a stable environment conducive to the implementation of reforms that will facilitate its future integration with the European Union.
In this perspective, I have no doubt that a limited and focused EU military intervention can only reinforce progress towards full civilian and democratic control of the reforms under way.
This morning, we spent some time dwelling on an area of foreign and security policy where - I shall be diplomatic - we have not made as much progress as we would have liked.
However, we have to recognise that in some parts of the world - most notably in the Balkans - Europe has in the last few years got its act together.
You only have to compare the humiliations and bloody mayhem of the early 1990s, when Europe was unable to deal with awful problems on its own doorstep, with our success in the last few years in shaping policy and in helping to lead the countries of the Balkans towards the European family.
We know the journey is not an easy one and today's tragedy reminds us how much work there still is for us to do.
As I have said in this House before, it would be a terrible mistake if we were to think that the problems in the Balkans, or in Afghanistan for that matter, were done and dusted.
We still have to focus, concentrate and be generous with our time, assistance and experience in helping those countries down the road towards eventual membership of the European Union.
Whatever the tragic setbacks, I am sure that they will attain that objective in the years ahead.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too would like to express my sorrow at the murder of Mr Djindji?.
Whatever disputes and disagreements we may have had with him in individual cases, I do believe that he stood for greater democracy in his country and for a courageous policy in times that made such a thing very dangerous, and that he earned our profound respect by doing so.
We should also see this as imposing on us the obligation of making an ongoing contribution to stability and democracy in the region.
I believe that what we are discussing today is one of the steps to that end.
This morning, we demonstrated what a poor position Europe is in when it comes to issues of war and peace.
In the Balkans, we have learned from the mistakes of the past, and the European Union has taken on greater responsibilities.
Our taking over, for the first time, a military operation in that region in the name of the European Union - small though the operation may be - shows that the European Union is going down a new path and indicates how our capacity to act will develop in this, admittedly small, area.
I believe we should take this as a favourable assessment, and so I would like to thank those who have been involved in making it possible.
The members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are, however, keen to see this debate on plenary's agenda, because we take the view that it is not acceptable for the European Union to decide on a military operation in the name of the European Union without formal consultation with the European Parliament, which is the directly-elected forum for Europe's peoples.
As you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have received information, but it has been received through invitations we have extended and requests we have made.
Nothing has been done, though, to accede to Parliament's requests for a proper information procedure, on which basis Parliament might be provided with the information that would facilitate its involvement.
Even though the operation in Macedonia involves only a small contingent of some 300 troops, it is the very first military operation in the history of the European Union, and it marks an important precedent.
Right now, the European Union is planning a substantially larger operation for 2004, which will involve taking over NATO's SFOR missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
We therefore have a fundamental demand to make of the Council, which is that it should inform and consult Parliament about the mandates for future Petersberg missions before they are mounted. This would be in the spirit of Article 21 of the Treaty and of the joint statement on the financing of the CFSP, adopted as recently as last December by the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
Military operations by the European Union, such as are currently planned for the Balkans, differ in one very important respect from missions undertaken by NATO.
NATO is a military alliance pure and simple, whereas the European Union is not.
Petersberg missions by the European Union will always be mounted in tandem with the EU's involvement in the region affected by a crisis, whether such involvement be political and diplomatic, or economic and financial.
Cooperation between civilians and the armed forces under the flag of the European Union will always be an important dimension of the overall mission.
That is why it betrays a lack of thought for the Council to believe that it can dispense with Parliament's formal involvement when intergovernmental military operations of this sort are mounted, and that is why we demand that we be involved and informed at an early stage, and in a completely transparent way.
Item 6 of our resolution lists the questions that we could discuss at an early stage of such missions, such as, for example, with what mandate and with what objectives the mission is being undertaken; what relationship exists between the troops in the regions under EU and NATO command respectively; how they cooperate with other organisations active in the region, such as the UN and the OSCE; how these missions in Macedonia and, next year, in Bosnia and Herzegovina fit into the overall framework of the stability and association process in the Balkans, and within what framework the joint costs are expected to be incurred.



Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the answers given today by both of you to the questions in most of these areas have been extensive, but, as I have said, that is not the correct form or the most suitable way; this should have been done already, through other channels, on the initiative of others, and at another time.
In saying this, it is not my intention to criticise what you have said today, but to take a critical view of the procedure, of the time, and of the place.
In the future, EU missions will always have the marked character of being both civil and military, and they will operate in crisis-hit regions in which the European Union has already made political or humanitarian commitments, or in which, once a crisis operation is over, it will be involving itself in reconstruction and development.
Now that we are beginning, cautiously, to take on responsibilities in military areas too, that is what is special about the European Union - and what sets us apart from a purely military alliance.
This first mission in Macedonia sees us - even Parliament - breaking new ground.
It is for that reason that the Committee on Foreign Affairs' resolution proposes that we should, in the coming months, send a fact-finding delegation to the theatre of operations, in order to enable us MEPs to get our own picture of how the European Union's first military mission works.
Even if the Council has not officially consulted us, we in the European Parliament will not divest ourselves of our responsibility for giving the soldiers from our Member States the parliamentary support that is their due and, in so far as we are able to do so, supporting the mission as a whole.
Thank you very much Mr President.
I would of course like to associate myself with the President-in-Office of the Council's remarks, Commissioner Patten's, and also Mr Brok's, about the tragic events that took place in Belgrade this morning and I support all the expressions of sympathy to Mr Djindjic's family and of course to all Serbs who are undoubtedly very shocked by what has happened there this morning.
Let me also express the hope that this will not lead to disruption of the efforts towards greater stability in Serbia and in the former Yugoslavia as well.
Let us return to the matter we are debating today.
While the Iraq issue is putting the European Union under great pressure and the discord appears great, the European Union will shortly be beginning its first military operation under its own flag in FYROM.
And within the wider Europe the Union is now itself taking direct responsibility for an important peacekeeping operation.
That this is happening in Macedonia is logical because of the great political efforts of the European Union in recent times, which have led to better relations within the country itself, in particular with the Albanian minority, and which have therefore also led to greater political stability.
The military mission must of course help make these positive developments permanent.
It has taken a while to conclude the mandate of the mission because the European Union cannot of course undertake this mission without the support of NATO and cooperation with it.
It was therefore a question of finding the right formula with regard to the independent nature of the operation.
This experience shows that we have to keep working on improving the European Union's own capacities so that there will come a time when the European Union can handle such an operation on its own.
The step that is now being taken is in itself important for the country in question, but as has already been said, it is also a first exercise for the European Union and the lessons from it will be learned.
In this case it is a matter in particular of practical cooperation with NATO, but also of a future larger-scale operation, in Bosnia-Herzegovina for example.
Conflict prevention is one of the most important basic principles of European security and defence policy.
It is now being put into practice 'militarily' for the first time by an operation according to the rules.
It is part of a broader package of political and economic measures in support of the stabilisation process in the region in question. It is therefore important that the requisite publicity be given to the mission.
It is after all an important step in the development of a common security policy about which the public should be better informed, by such means as, for instance, the work of this Parliament of ours.
I hope that a successful mission will also provide a stimulus to maintaining the necessary tempo in setting up the rapid reaction force and in the development and implementation of a more coordinated arms procurement policy.
The resolution rightly focuses considerable attention on the question of democratic legitimacy or rather the absence of it.
It is indeed disappointing to learn that in this unique instance Parliament has not really been consulted.
This could be better organised in future.
The European Parliament is after all one of the European platforms for the monitoring and assessment of such peacekeeping operations.
Mr President, progress towards stability in Macedonia is a real example of how cooperation between NATO, the EU and the US can have very beneficial effects.
Commissioner Patten is absolutely right to say that the European Union has got its act together to a considerable extent in the Balkans.
I also congratulate the coalition government in place since last September.
Let us hope that Macedonia has indeed turned a corner and that the Ohrid Agreement will be fully implemented.
A military presence is still necessary to deliver a secure atmosphere and the EU mission can and should carry out tasks such as weapons collection and training.
For the EU to undertake its first military operation is a truly significant and historic milestone.
Mr Brok is quite right to insist that it should not happen without consultation with the European Parliament.
The fact that the finalisation of the details has been held up by wrangling over intelligence sharing between NATO and the EU is said to be purely a technical issue.
It is illustrative of the interdependence between the two and what we have at stake in making this agreement work.
It is right for the EU to take over from NATO and a convincing demonstration that we are serious about playing a larger security role.
The internal problems facing Macedonia are not limited to military security threats, there are many policing challenges and the cancer of corruption and criminality, often violent criminality, is undermining the state.
There are murky links between organised criminals and political extremists and in a neighbouring country, as we have just heard, the murder of Prime Minister Djindjic may be evidence of those links.
There can be no economic progress or investment while lawlessness is rife.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia wondered who would invest, build and hire new people in a country with constant shootings, a country in one third of whose territory travel after dark is not recommended.
He is absolutely right: there is a very close link between security and the growth of the economy.
I would like to mention again the problem of the name.
The President-in-Office and the Commissioner use the formulation of FYROM - the former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia.
I refuse to do that.
I wish these negotiations over the name could get somewhere - they seem to drag on.
Finally, I would like to urge those Member States that have not yet ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, to get on with it.
This would send a very good signal to Macedonia.
Mr President, in the shadow of the debate about a looming war in Iraq and in the light of the growing scepticism about the prospect of any kind of common European foreign policy at all, there is a danger that many people are going to lose sight of what the European Union has actually managed to achieve in Macedonia.
I mention the traditional means: diplomacy, the prevention of conflicts and, when that succeeded, investment in the reconstruction of both infrastructure and institutions.
From today or from very soon the European Union, is going, at last, I would say, to be able to add a third means to this and that is the sending of servicemen under the EU flag.
In the whole debate about the possibility and desirability of a European foreign policy the mission in Macedonia is often dismissed as insignificant, a mission that means nothing and from which we must not draw undue conclusions.
I do not agree with this viewpoint or with this dismissive gesture.
I think that the Macedonian model, where the European Union has been able to deploy all its diplomatic, financial and military capabilities, can be an example worthy of imitation in many countries of the world.
Of course it was only a small-scale conflict.
Of course it is only a limited military presence, but the fact that the EU is now able to use the whole range of options is a symbolic big step forward which - once again, in the shadow of the present debates about Iraq - we are in danger of forfeiting at our peril.
In addition to the fine words about what can be done, two warnings. These have already been referred to by my fellow Members.
We in the European Union cannot continue in future to send servicemen without any parliamentary control whatever being exercised.
All of us present here know that it is impossible either for national parliaments or for this Parliament to influence the mandate and the progress of this mission, or of future missions.
We cannot go on this way.
Let us be honest, it is and it will be a hugely difficult point.
I would therefore in any event like to ask Mr Papandreou, on behalf of the Council, to pursue the widely shared view here in Parliament that this is certainly a good start, but will only be a good start if it is followed by greater parliamentary control, preferably by the European Parliament.
If that succeeds, if a start is made on that and if that is accompanied by a better financial policy and better control of the means for such operations, then that really will be a breakthrough, my fellow Members, without parallel.
Then the European Union will finally be able to intervene with a wide range of options, preferably to prevent conflicts and if necessary to manage crises.
Allow me to conclude with a few words about the dreadful murder of Prime Minister Djindjic in Serbia.
This murder clearly shows that the problems there are still far from being resolved and also makes clear that the efforts of the European Union are still needed on Serbia's tortuous, oh so tortuous, path to democracy.
I therefore fervently hope that the Commissioner will be able to go to Serbia to put to the Serbian Parliament his message of solidarity with the democratic forces in Serbia.
Let us actually hope that in Serbia the traditional means, that is diplomacy and reconstruction, will suffice and that we do not need to move to the use of this new means the EU has at its disposal.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this operation in Macedonia has just been presented as an historic phase in the commitment of the European Union.
I think that we need to set our sights slightly lower than this ambitious presentation.
First of all because, in terms of quantity, it is relatively small.
It is a mission involving, if we have rightly understood, 500 men, including those in command.
Then, because we have not been able to reach an agreement on extremely precise objectives.
We are not even capable of agreeing on the name of this country, and I am pleased to be speaking before the Greek Foreign Minister.
I would ask why we do not allow the country to use the name that it had when it was a Federal Republic as part of Yugoslavia, as it is clearly understood that the name would not imply any territorial claim or alteration of the borders.
Finally, and most importantly, there is no real clear goal for the presence of our forces and we have not been told under what circumstances the mission would come to an end, because the causes of conflict are always there, in particular the gradual Albanianisation of an area that was previously largely populated by Slavs.
In short, contrary to what the Committee on Foreign Affairs purports, the mission is not really taking over from NATO.
It will be led by the supreme command of the Allied forces in Europe from its headquarters, SHAPE.
It is using NATO resources.
It seems that, as the United States need their troops in the Middle East, they are sub-contracting this operation, which is now of secondary importance, to their European vassals.
I do not think that this is really something we should welcome.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my own group, too, I would like to express our profound sense of bewilderment at the death of Mr Djindji? and to take this opportunity to say that events such as these always forcefully bring us back to the question of whether the establishment of peace in this region really has advanced as far as we hoped it had.
Apart from that, Mr Gollnisch, I take the view that our taking over from NATO responsibility for the mission in Macedonia is an historic event.
Even though the unit involved is a very small one, this still creates a precedent, in that structures and possibilities are being created on which we will later be able to build.
It is for that reason that I believe this to be an important step on the road that leads to a European defence policy.
For the first time, the EU is taking on responsibility for the military side of peacekeeping in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
What functions do parliaments have to perform in operations of this kind?
It is one of the principles of democratic politics that military operations may be mounted only with the mandate of a directly elected parliament.
For Macedonia, these mandates were provided by the national parliaments.
If European defence policy is to develop further, mandates will in future have to be given by the European Parliament, and so, our primary expectation of the Council is that it should do what has already been demanded of it and, this very day, meet this need by providing truly comprehensive information and, secondly, we expect the Convention to give parliamentary control a clear, unambiguous and permanent place in the future constitutional treaty.
Those in positions of political leadership must ensure that the troops on the ground are not exposed to unnecessary dangers - and what gives rise to these?
They come about as a result of the wrong orders being given or of inadequate leadership and equipment.
This consideration leads me to put a number of questions to the Council, and also to the Commission.
For a start, what difference will it make that American troops are no longer to be deployed in Macedonia?
Might not the loss of certain capacities expose our soldiers to danger?
My second question concerns the way in which decisions are implemented.
Are you confident that the decisions taken by the Council will then be implemented by way of NATO, and that, when decisions have to be implemented without delay on the ground, these lines of command really do function as quickly as will be required of them?
Thirdly, I turn to costs, on which I have questions about both the civilian and military sides of this mission.
It is my view that both the Convention and the new constitutional treaty will, in future, have to make it possible for the military costs of the mission, as well as the civilian ones, to be borne by the Budget of the European Union.
I would like to conclude by saying that we have seen in this morning's debate on Iraq just how inadequate the European Union's foreign and security policy can still be at the present time, but, at the same time, I would like to give voice to the hope that, at any rate in the European Union's immediate vicinity, where the essence and heart of Europe - of which the Balkans are part - are at stake, we may continue to demonstrate the European Union's capacity to contribute to the maintenance of peace.
Mr President, I too am utterly at a loss to understand the murder of Mr Djindji?, the prime minister of Serbia.
Only a few months ago, I was able to have a long conversation with him in his official residence in Belgrade.
Despite all the criticisms that could be levelled at him - as they can at any statesman - he was a symbol of economic progress, political reform and also of cooperation with the tribunal in The Hague.
He took significant steps to bring Serbia closer to Western fundamental values, not only in terms of its political system, but also of its society.
Whatever it is in Serbia and Montenegro that lies behind this assassination, this demonstrates how precarious the situation there is.
In Macedonia, too, the position remains unstable, as, indeed, we saw at the time of its elections, even though the new coalition, with its collaboration between the Albanian and Macedonian Slav forces - it is always difficult to find a way to express that - has so far proved to be thoroughly durable.
Even former combatants - whose inclusion I had strongly criticised - are, at least for the time being, very convincing in their declarations of willingness to work together, at least in theory, and to play a part in parliamentary life.
There is also a precarious situation in the surrounding areas, as the killings in the Presevo valley remind us.
Peace has not yet been established.
The assassination of Mr Djindji? has yet again made that abundantly clear to us.
I also very much endorse the progressive Europeanisation - yes, let us call it that - of current security policy and of the military intervention in the Balkans.
Whilst there are a number of things of which we are right to accuse America - some other charges laid against them may be misguided, but many are justified - we must ourselves take on responsibilities in our own backyard.
That is why I regard this course of action as absolutely right and crucial, trivial though it may at present appear to be.
It is also advantageous that this is being done in a country in which there is no crisis at present, one where there may be sporadic conflicts, but where it is also possible to make a good job of the task in hand.
I would like to follow on from what Mr von Wogau said by again emphasising that those in command locally must have sufficient flexibility for their operations, as this is not just about a military unit coming into the situation, but about that unit supporting the population and helping them to coexist with one another and resolve disputes peacefully, without their degenerating into conflict and certainly not by resorting to force of arms.
For my final point, there is something of which I feel I must remind you: foreign policy also presupposes that we possess good and effective instruments with the appropriate capacity.
Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, you are aware of that.
Let me just list the ways in which the European Union is currently represented in Macedonia, which is a small country: it is represented by the Presidency, by a representative of the Commission, by a High Representative, by the Agency for Reconstruction, and now also by a military unit.
If these all work well together, then that is a good thing, but I really do ask that you should consider how we might tighten up our instruments somewhat in order, instead of giving a small country the impression that we do not ourselves know where we are going, to be able to get our foreign policy accepted by using one shared European language and shared European resources.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no European security and defence policy existed until 1999, when it was one of the fruits of the lessons we learned in the Balkans.
There, we had the experience, in 1999, during the Kosovo conflict, of being able to speak with one voice after a decade of discord; if, though, the United States of America had said that this was a European matter that we had to deal with ourselves, we would not have been in a position to do so.
That is why this joint response force has to be built up by 2003, and the fact that we will then be making a start, albeit with a small mission, is, I believe, an important step in terms of European integration policy, whilst underlining at the same time the fact that it is being taken in cooperation with the Americans and with NATO, rather than in opposition to them.
It will, during this stage, be increasingly important to have due regard to the European Union's institutions and to remain within the bounds of its institutional structures.
In was with this in mind that, on 25 November 2002, in the course of the Budget procedure, Parliament and the Council agreed on a statement on the financing of the common foreign and security policy, which statement, firstly, stresses the point that Parliament is to be informed about all basic options under the common foreign and security policy and their financial implications.
To this day, the Council has not once complied with that requirement, but this is to be done in future, with a summary being presented, in its own dossier, to Parliament by 15 June.
Another point is, though, that the Council is not only to do this once a year, but is to promptly state the amount of the prospective costs involved in any and every specific decision in the field of the common foreign and security policy entailing expenditure.
This is a new measure agreed on in November.
After some hesitation, we are glad that the Greek Presidency, during the most recent consultation with Parliament, undertook to make available to Parliament all the information that had initially been withheld, including that on costs and personnel.
I see this as an important decision and as complementing that on the political principle of involving Parliament.
We are well aware that, even though the Western European Union has since been integrated into the European Union, its Parliamentary Assembly continues to exist, the argument for this being that the national parliaments have to keep on meeting together on a regular basis, as the European Parliament does not yet possess rights of control.
This example shows how we are already involved in this area.
Building on this and, in the event of future missions, such as the taking over of the SFOR mandate, informing this Parliament in due time, is an important step, and what Mr von Wogau said about giving this its own firm place in the European constitution is something I can unreservedly endorse.
Mr President, Commissioner, the first military mission of the European Union coincides with an historic moment and, I regret to say, possible further destabilisation in the Balkans, which shows just how fragile the fabric is.
The Serbian leaders have recently been surrounding themselves with high-level security, in the knowledge that the greatest danger is just when steps towards normalisation start speeding up.
Sadly, it has not worked.
The murder of Zoran Djindjic has, amongst other things, implications for the tabling of certain amendments to the resolution we are about to put to the vote.
I think the two-month period requested for the European Community for initial monitoring of the results of the mission is too short.
In another context, this morning, when speaking about the European Union action, Commissioner Patten said that military and political intergovernmentalism is ineffectual, and he added more or less that it produces incoherent initiatives.
That is clearly the case and we should take it into account.
Now, however, we have gone into Macedonia and, for better or for worse, we must clarify certain points and discuss them in this House.
We have learnt something during the last hour and perhaps we shall learn something later on that we do not yet know.
I should like to know, for instance, how the command structures work, from the base up to Brussels, the relations between departments in NATO and in the European Union, how costs are shared and, naturally, to what extent collaboration with the Macedonian Government and army has been thought out and put into practice.
Military expenditure is the responsibility of the national parliaments, but the European Union should manage the financial operations on joint bases and Parliament should then perform its monitoring role.
Mr President, when I spoke this morning in the Iraq debate I drew attention to the self-interested agenda of France, a nation for which I have great affection, but whose foreign policy has some very dangerous elements.
One of its key aims is to remove American involvement in European security.
The primary instrument of this policy is ESDP which otherwise sensible European states have been hoodwinked into supporting.
They have been given a false prospectus.
Ironically I blame Mr Blair just as much for this because it was he who gave the green light to EU defence policy at St Malo in 1998, and a month ago he compounded his error at Le Touquet.
The existence of this separate ESDP has undoubtedly been a factor in weakening the coherence of the NATO alliance, contributing to the recent very damaging disagreements.
Now, and without adequate consultation with the United States, the European Union is preparing to take over the NATO mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and apparently plans to assume the military responsibilities in Bosnia.
It is predicated on the bizarre idea that if we set up separate EU decision-making structures, distract NATO's Deputy Commander by giving him two sets of political masters to serve, and stick different flashes on the arms of the same troops in the Balkans, NATO's capabilities are somehow reinforced.
By the way, for Mr Gollnisch's information, there are only 30 American personnel in the Macedonian force, and none of them are combat troops.
To add to this charade, in order for the European Union to raise its flag on a military operation it has to rely on NATO for its operational planning and for reinforcement or extraction if the relatively soft operation in Macedonia should turn into something more dangerous.
But the tragic events of today underline how very combustible the situation in the Balkans remains.
Having created an unnecessary and artificial military divide, the EU and NATO have had to spend two years on negotiating and arrangements to enable the European Union and NATO to find a way of working together.
The fact is that the EU's Ruritanian takeover of the NATO operation in FYROM will not contribute any additional military assets.
It merely opens the opportunity for political division between European and North American allies at the very time when they should all be sitting around the same table.
How much simpler if France were merely to rejoin the integrated military structure of the alliance and then everyone would be happy.
Instead of building divisions into the western alliance, both the North Americans and like-minded Europeans must make the necessary political and material commitments to revitalise NATO as the primary instrument of western security.
We need to bring Europe's military contribution back into the NATO fold and start rebuilding the common western strategic culture before it is too late.
My thanks to the honourable Members for their comments and opinions.
I should like to start by saying that, as far as procedure is concerned, the Council fully respects its obligations under the Treaty to inform and involve Parliament in CFSP issues.
We believe in the important role of the European Parliament and in transparent, informative relations.
That is precisely why I am here today as President-in-Office of the Council and why Commissioner Patten is here today; to report in detail to Parliament on the planned operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, before we take up our duties.
I should like to address Mr Brok, whose comments I have taken on board, and assure him that we shall examine every possibility under the provisions of the Treaty for more efficient and more appropriate briefings to Parliament and of course, for responsible briefings to the citizens of Europe via Parliament.
I agree with Mr Wiersma that the political and military operation we are undertaking will be an important test for the European Union, which is precisely why we are taking every precaution to ensure it is both credible and successful.
In reply to Baroness Ludford, I agree with much of what she said; the problems in the Balkans are not at an end and, as Mr Patten said, the European Union has indeed managed to formulate a strong, single policy for the region.
There are no differences between us, between the Member States or the other basic institutions of the European Union, as regards the strategy or, I think, the application of that strategy.
I think this shows that our common foreign policy has come of age, in this region at least, and will be important as we develop it further.
I should also like to emphasise that the problems in the Balkans are very complicated.
The issue of organised crime, to which Baroness Ludford referred, cooperation with the ?C??, the rule of law, corruption, regional cooperation, the necessary networks, transport, energy, IT; all these are vital to the stability and development of the region and to the region's common progress towards the European Union.
Both the Commission and the presidency are organising the Thessalonika Summit along these lines, precisely with the objective of continuing and furthering progress in these countries towards integration into the European family and generating new momentum, a new contract between us, if you like, whereby we require them to make stable progress and to focus on European preconditions and real progress, with specific measures, specific reforms and specific changes and, as Baroness Ludford said, to address problems such as organised crime and can, for our part, confirm the prospects we offered them at a number of summit Councils of becoming members of the European Union at some point in the future.
I should also like to say something in my capacity as Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs.
As far as the name is concerned, none of us is happy with the name the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
However, what I would say is that this name is the product of compromise and negotiation within the UN and the UN has adopted this as the official name of this country and international organisations have adopted this as a temporary name.
This name does, of course, need to be finalised as quickly as possible and negotiations are in fact under way at the UN. I quite agree and would like to say that we are ready and willing to continue and step up negotiations with the other side, in order to satisfy sensitivities on both sides and find a solution which, as I said, satisfies both sides.
In reply to Mr Gollnisch, however, who said something that is not wholly accurate, that the name does not imply any territorial claim, I would say that, unfortunately, the whole problem is that historically, the name was used for territorial claims.
Unfortunately the idea of 'Great Macedonia' existed until recently and hence the term 'Macedonia' had clear connotations of changing borders and assimilating territory from neighbouring countries.
Fortunately, this has been dealt with; we have gone beyond this historical aspect at least.
More importantly, there has been a spectacular improvement in bilateral relations between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over recent years.
We invest more than anyone else in FYROM and we have consistently supported its territorial integrity, prosperity and progress towards Europe during every difficult stage it has been through over recent months and years.
I agree with Mr Swoboda that Mr Djindjic took courageous decisions as regards both the ?C?? and democratic reform and, recently, as regards Kosovo; discussions were due to begin not on the final status of Kosovo, but on important practical arrangements between Belgrade and Pristina, between Mr Djindjic and the leadership in Kosovo.
I think that, following his death, we should make a commitment to continue to support the forces of reform, the forces of democracy in Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro and help them move towards Europe.
I should also like to point out, in response to Mr Swoboda, that luckily an example is being set in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of proper cooperation between the institutions of the European Union. There is proper coordination between us, as I am sure Mr Patten will agree, and not only between our internal institutions, but also between the European Union and the United States and other organisations such as the ?SCE and the Council of Europe.
This proves there is a need for multilateral cooperation, for close cooperation in dealing with crisis at international level.
Where we have this sort of cooperation, this sort of coordination, we are, I think, more efficient.
I have taken Mr Laschet's comments on the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union on board.
I too am in contact with the upper echelons of the Western European Union and these are issues that will be discussed during the debate on the future of Europe.
I should also like to comment on two or three questions raised by Mr Laschet, Mr von Wogau and Mr Van Orden about our cooperation with the United States and European Union/NATO decision-making mechanisms and the danger of operations.
First of all, the European Union's decision-making mechanism, the ESD? mechanism, is being tested for the first time, especially as regards military operations.
However, we have every faith in the efficacy of our agreed procedures and the fact that this first operation will be carried out using NATO assets and capabilities has helped to speed up the decision taking, as has the fact that one Member State - France - has been selected as the framework nation, thereby safeguarding the unity and command structure of the operation.
As regards the military operation and any dangers inherent in it, naturally unavoidable dangers are inherent in any military operation.
However, as far as this specific operation is concerned, as I said in my statement, we shall continue to cooperate with ???? and there are plans to use NATO reserves if the situation deteriorates.
The ???? staff in Skopje will continue to operate, as will KFOR Rear.
This being the case, and given the assessments made so far, we consider the risk to be relatively low.
Finally, to the funding of the mission. As you know, spending on defence is not covered by the Community budget and the operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will therefore be funded by the Member States.
Of course, it would be useful if future operations under the ESDP could be funded from the Union budget, but that requires institutional reform.
On that note, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for listening.
Rest assured that I am at your disposal, time permitting, and I fully intend to keep you abreast of any procedures, decisions or developments in this area.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have received a motion for resolution on this issue (?5-0157/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the Commission statement on the transfer of personal data by airlines to the US immigration service.
Mr President, if you agree, as indicated on the board, this Commissioner - who is less knowledgeable than his colleague - could begin the debate and then my colleague Commissioner Bolkestein will continue, as this issue touches on both our competences.
I repeat what I said at the outset of the previous debate, and offer my apologies to Parliament that I will have to leave early, though my distinguished colleague will be here until the end of the debate.
I explained in the last debate that I am due to fly to Croatia and Belgrade later this afternoon and, not least because of the tragic events today, I know that Parliament will understand that.
Let me now turn to the business in hand.
The Aviation and Security Act, passed by the US Congress on 19 November 2001, is one of a series of laws introduced in the United States after 11 September 2001, with one overriding aim: to enhance national security, in particular through transport security measures.
The basic aim is to prevent terrorist acts by detecting potential perpetrators before they enter the country.
In this context, the United States Congress has required that carriers make passenger name record information available to US Customs upon request.
The Commission shares the security concerns of the United States.
Nevertheless, the United States measures have raised concern with regard to the respect of Community and Member States' laws on data protection.
Airlines operating flights across the Atlantic risked being caught between two sets of incompatible measures and suffering severe losses as a result of penalties the United States threatened to impose, including fines and even the withdrawal of landing rights.
Passengers - between 10 and 11 million a year - would have also suffered from the disrupted air traffic and from the time-consuming 'secondary' checks that the United States planned to introduce at point of entry.
Moreover, airlines not in compliance risked being seen as higher security risks, with potential consequences for significant falls in passenger numbers.
The stakes, therefore, were very high and the consequences of not acting would have been extremely serious.
We had to ensure, as far as we could, that the important interests of European Union citizens in preserving their right to privacy was balanced against the need to protect many thousands of jobs in our airlines and associated industries like travel agencies.
I want to assure this House that, right from the outset, the European Commission has done its utmost to try to engage the United States in a discussion on how to find a solution compatible with both sets of legislation and one that would ensure legal certainty for all concerned.
The European Commission has assumed its responsibilities and in recent weeks undertook difficult discussions to overcome a stalemate created by the United States initially taking our concerns lightly and not responding to our questions.
In fact, the European Commission had raised this issue with the United States on numerous occasions, with particular emphasis since the US Customs Service issued its interim rule of 19 June 2002, containing the concrete implementation methods.
As a result of these efforts by the Commission, the United States first postponed the entry into force of the new requirements until 5 February and then agreed to waive the imposition of penalties on non-complying airlines until 5 March.
Following a high-level meeting on 17 and 18 February on access to personal data contained in passenger name records, both sides issued a joint statement which sets out the steps that need to be taken to reach a mutually satisfactory and legally certain solution to this issue.
Further talks took place on 4 March, as a result of which the United States has given additional undertakings with respect to the handling and protection of sensitive data.
I am also aware that questions have been raised as to the legal basis for the action undertaken so far by the Commission.
This, as my colleague Commissioner Bolkestein will explain in more detail, seems to be founded on a misunderstanding.
There has been no 'agreement' and no 'decision' so far.
Instead, we have engaged with the United States authorities in an intensive dialogue aimed at obtaining the necessary guarantees regarding the proper handling and use of the data concerned by the US side.
Both sides are now committed to continuing their discussions in order to find a more legally secure solution.
The possibility of such discussions is provided for in the Data Protection Directive, as the initial and necessary steps towards the adequacy finding provided for in its Article 25(6).
Following comitology procedures, the draft Commission decision will then have to be discussed by this House before being finalised.
In the interim, we have obtained from the United States a provisional set of undertakings on how they will protect the personal data they access and a specific commitment not to make use of any sensitive data for profiling purposes.
Before passing the debate to my distinguished colleague to provide honourable Members with further details on this issue, I would like to ask this House to recognise the considerable efforts made by the Commission and the positive results we have achieved so far - even if these still have to be finalised - and I hope Parliament will join forces with us in obtaining from the United States the necessary data protection guarantees for European citizens so that a permanent solution to the problem can be achieved.
I should like to make one final personal remark.
The whole House recognises how the events of 11 September produced a real feeling of vulnerability and shock in the United States.
The House will recognise the concern in the United States to put in place measures to ensure that further terrorist attacks are less, rather than more, likely in the future.
Like a number of honourable Members, I come from a country which has also had to take steps to deal with terrorist threats.
That said, I hope that we can engage the United States at a much earlier stage in the policy-making process in discussing these security issues.
If we can have a dialogue earlier in the process, it will be easier to avoid the sort of political difficulties that we have had from time to time over the last year.
There should be no difference between us at all on the importance of putting in place security measures which are recognised as being reasonable by both sides.
It would be easier to do that if we could talk more openly and earlier about these sorts of measures.
Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to assure you that it was not the intention of the Chair to exclude you from taking the floor.
However, we were informed that owing to constraints of time you had to leave earlier.
Mr President, this is of course a Commission statement, but on a very important issue, an issue with political implications.
It concerns relations between the European Union and the United States, where a legislative solution is required, as Commissioner Patten said, and where the Council needs to be involved in any such legislative solution.
Do you not think that the Council should be present at this issue and should be able to express an opinion, if it so wishes?
Mr Alavanos, I have, of course, noted your comment and we shall investigate exactly what is going on.
However, it was agreed at the outset that the Commission would make statements on this issue.
Mr President, I should like to add the following to what Commissioner Patten has just said.
The new American law requiring airlines operating flights to, from or through the United States to grant electronic access to their passenger name records raises a number of policy issues: firstly, the fight against terrorism; secondly, the right to privacy; thirdly, the ability of our airlines to compete; fourthly, the security and convenience of legitimate air travellers; fifthly, the relationship between Europe and the United States in general.
It is necessary to pull all these strands together and to strike an appropriate balance.
It is also necessary to be practical and not theoretical.
My first message is that we should work together for an outcome that achieves the best possible results, responding to the need to combat terrorism while respecting data protection in practice, without damaging the commercial interests of our airlines and without inconvenience for legitimate air travellers.
The Commission very much welcomes the opportunity to address Parliament on this matter.
Underlying the technical issues are some fundamental questions about security and civil liberties which all democracies have to ask themselves.
Discussions amongst elected parliamentarians on such issues is essential.
The motion for a resolution before Parliament criticises the Commission for not informing and consulting Parliament sooner.
The Commission accepts this reprimand.
It had no intention to conceal.
It was more a question of when to bring this matter to the attention of Parliament and in what form.
We only have a short time.
Rather than making a lengthy factual statement I will draw the attention of Parliament to two documents which the Commission has made available.
The first document is the joint statement which is the agreed account of the outcome of talks between senior officials of the Commission and US Customs on 17 and 18 February 2003.
The second document is the statement by US Customs of 4 March which gives undertakings as regards the handling of sensitive data.
It is necessary to correct a misunderstanding.
As my distinguished colleague Commissioner Patten has just said, many reports referred to an agreement or a decision.
I stress that there is no agreement, there is no decision.
It follows that, at this moment, there is no legal basis.
There have been discussions and the US side has given certain assurances.
This is the first step in the process.
Both sides are committed to finding a more legally secure solution in due course.
These discussions are necessary.
Why are they necessary?
Because of information received about new US requirements, the Commission found it necessary last November to inform EU airlines and the related reservation systems that it was not clear whether they could provide the information required by US law without being in breach of their data protection obligations under EU law.
In order to answer that question, it was necessary to obtain information from the US side, in particular as regards the use of the data and the conditions under which they would be processed.
Unfortunately the American side was very slow to respond to these requests for information and they only started to take our concerns seriously in December 2002.
In the absence of discussions with the United States, the airlines - as Commissioner Patten has already explained - would have been left in an impossible situation.
They would have faced a whole range of penalties, starting with the practice of secondary inspections of arriving passengers.
That indeed had already started.
That meant very long delays at arrival points for hundreds, if not thousands, of legitimate travellers.
That is an option, but is it what we really want?
It is certainly not what the airlines wanted, and there was every likelihood that these airlines would have complied with American requirements anyway.
I strongly agree with Members who expressed the view in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on Monday that the American way of proceeding by unilateral action and threats of penalties is unacceptable.
But not having discussions with the American side would have left them with the data and no means for the European Union side to influence their handling of it.
It would have left the airlines open to either US or Member States' enforcement action when they - the airlines - are the wrong target.
If we want to bring pressure to bear it should be on those who can deliver a solution - and that is not the airlines.
Our aim has thus been to open up a process of dialogue through which we can influence US practices and obtain assurances from them that will ensure that data is adequately protected.
The Commission considers that the outcome of the February talks was positive for data protection for the following two reasons.
Firstly, we secured US agreement on the further steps to be taken to reach a mutually satisfactory solution that would and can provide legal certainty to all concerned.
The second reason is that the United States made a number of significant, unilateral undertakings of immediate application.
For example they made undertakings on what data they would not use and how they would handle the data they do use.
They confirmed in particular that their data gathering would be limited to flights to, from or through the US.
Clearly we need more time and information from the United States before we can say that we have a solution.
We can only be satisfied when we have an arrangement which provides a maximum amount of legal security for all concerned.
There are in the meantime transfers of data.
Are such transfers legal?
Only the courts can answer that question in a definitive way, but I would like to make two points in this respect.
Firstly, the airlines have to meet their obligations as data controllers and they must inform passengers fully, in line with Article 10 of the Directive, and obtain their consent for the processing of sensitive data in line with Article 8.
Secondly, legality has to be examined from the angle of the need for adequate protection for data that is transferred to a third country.
Transfers may however benefit from one of the exceptions in Article 26(1) of the Directive.
For example, certain transfers may be necessary in order to fulfil a contract with a data subject - in other words the contract to fly the passenger to the United States.
Since such an exception could be challenged, however, this solution lacks legal security.
Moreover, although exceptions may be legal for specific transfers, they offer no guarantees that the data will subsequently be protected.
Article 25(6) of the Directive, on the other hand, provides for a finding by the Commission that a third country ensures adequate protection for transfers of personal data from the European Union.
An Article 25(6) decision by the Commission is therefore much to be preferred to relying on the exceptions to the adequacy rule because it means that the data go on being protected.
The prospect of such a decision and the legal security that it brings allow the Commission to engage the third country concerned in discussions about the protection provided, and hold it to ensuring a high standard.
Moreover, Article 25(6) decisions always contain safeguard clauses which can be triggered if protection does not in practice match up to the standards expected.
They can also be unilaterally abrogated if necessary.
Finally, an Article 25(6) decision is a Community procedure, producing a result that is binding on all Member States.
It is very much to be preferred to leaving Member States to act in dispersed order.
It is worth mentioning that one or two Member States have or are planning measures very similar to those in place in the United States.
On my own behalf and also on behalf of my colleague Mr Patten, I should like to invite the House to take a positive view of the Commission's actions of 17 and 18 February.
The American side has committed itself to a process which recognises our legitimate interest in their data protection practices, under which they subject their arrangements to our scrutiny according to our standards.
That I think is a major step forward.
Of course the United States still must provide the elements needed for the Commission to make such an adequacy finding.
As a comitology decision, an adequacy finding under Article 25(6) is always brought to Parliament before being finalised, as was also explained by Mr Patten.
I certainly look forward to discussing this further with Members of Parliament on a future occasion.
Mr President, I wish to thank the two Commissioners for their statements and say to Commissioner Bolkestein that his acceptance of the reprimand that, as he himself says, we gave the Commission, does him credit.
The fact remains, however, that the debate we are now holding should have taken place long before 5 March, the date of the entry into force of the measures adopted by the United States making airlines that schedule flights from the European Union to that country fulfil the obligations imposed by US legislation to transfer passengers' personal data to the immigration services, as has been said, with these airlines facing stiff financial penalties if they fail to comply.
Commissioner Patten, we share the concern of the United States following the events of 11 September, but we also wish to say that we have an obligation to demand compliance with European legislation, specifically Directive 95/46/EC, which protects the transfer and use of personal data - in this case, of around 11 million passengers who make transatlantic flights every year.
Article 25(6) of this directive even lays down a specific procedure for the transfer of data to third countries and, on this occasion, Commissioners, we believe that this procedure has not been adhered to.
We also have a duty, of course, to protect the interests of the airlines, which have to comply, on the one hand, with the obligations imposed by US legislation and, on the other, with the principles of Community legislation.
In the current situation, the airlines are facing considerable uncertainty.
I therefore wish, Commissioner, first of all to convey to you this Parliament's unease at your belated - from my committee's point of view - reaction to this issue, which also leads us to doubt the legality of the actions referred to in the joint statement issued by senior officials of the European Union and the United States Customs Service on 17 and 18 February.
This statement, Mr President, Commissioners, even provides for - and I find this most surprising - an exception to be made to the application of our legislation in light of the United States' wishes.
I wonder how this is possible.
On the other hand, the Union's national data protection authorities now have their hands tied because, if passengers complain, they must apply the European directives in force and are obliged to impose penalties on the airlines.
We will, therefore, have to find a quick way out of this situation of uncertainty, by defining a clear framework for action and by reconciling the legitimate demands of the United States with respect for European legislation.
For this reason, the dialogue that has taken place to date within the administrations' services must be conveyed urgently, given the transparency required, to the institutions' political representatives and formulas must be quickly found for enabling the data that must be transferred, and the conditions in which they will be processed by the United States' agencies, to be clearly defined.
It is absolutely essential, at the same time, to inform the citizens that their data might be transferred and should this happen, to obtain their consent because, Commissioners, this is what Community legislation requires.
The ideal situation would be for the US authorities to be able swiftly to define their data protection standards, the adoption of which is already provided for in US legislation, and for the Commission to be able then to state that the necessary data can be transferred under the conditions laid down by Community legislation. This is also a requirement laid down in Article 7 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I therefore call on the Commissioners responsible to make up for lost time and I rely - also on behalf of the committee which I have the honour to chair - on the Commission's willingness to study with all due attention and urgency the texts that have been submitted to us on the basis of Directive 95/46/EC.
We should also like to be informed, starting from today, of all meetings and of every stage in negotiations on this matter, not when the decision is about to be adopted, to ensure that we can cooperate and work together with the Commission, as we have been asked to do.
Mr President, I fully agree with what Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar has said.
We are aware of the United States' security requirements but, Commissioners, it is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which the Commission is committed to upholding, which sanctions the fundamental right to protection of personal data, and it is the 1995 directive, proposed by the Commission and approved by us, that lays down the rules for the protection of that data.
That directive stipulates that the Commission, through a specified procedure that it lays down, must ascertain whether the third country offers adequate protection for data transferred to it regarding our citizens and, if not, that it must open negotiations, find solutions and submit its assessment to the scrutiny of the European Parliament.
In the case we have here, the transfer of passengers' personal data by airlines that fly to the United States, as required by the US authorities on the basis of laws passed in 2001 and 2002, presents serious problems of compatibility with European legislation, particularly as regards the possibility of direct access by the US customs to our airlines' reservation systems and passenger name records.
Amongst other things, I must point out that the data to be acquired - through that direct access - could also contain information of a financial nature or of a medical, religious or ethnic nature which might also refer to persons other than passengers bound for the territory of the United States, that the data might be transferred to other bodies without the consent or control of those it refers to, and that US law only protects US citizens.
In this situation, the Commission failed to inform Parliament - as it has admitted - it failed to inform the European citizens prior to the date, 5 March, when the demands on the airlines enter into force, and it did not fulfil its obligation to check whether suitable protection exists in due time but has relied on statements by officials and press releases to convey the promise and reassurance of future interventions.
Thus, a fundamental right of European citizens is now at risk.
The airlines and national authorities that safeguard personal data are placed in a situation of legal uncertainty, exposed to prosecution for breaking national laws and to the risk of serious financial damage.
The Commissioners who have competence in this area must accept their responsibilities straight away and obtain a temporary suspension of the effects of the laws in question; they must request formal and verifiable guarantees, obtain the opinions provided for by the directives and submit a decision to the European Parliament under Article 25 of the directive.
Otherwise, I believe the European Parliament will have to consider appealing to the Court of Justice to ensure protection for the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein invited us to take a positive view of the Commission's action in the 17 February joint statement.
I am sure the Commission was motivated by a genuine desire to rescue European airlines from being stuck between a rock and a hard place, in that if they complied with Community law on data protection they would be grounded and refused US landing rights, whereas if they gave into US demands they would fall foul of data protection authorities.
However, the Commission made the wrong call, not least in consulting neither the European Parliament nor, previously, the National Data Protection Commissioners' Article 29 Working Party.
It is disingenuous to try to claim that it is not an agreement.
It is called a joint statement and it is also referred to in the text as an understanding of both sides which will be implemented.
That, in plain English, is surely an agreement.
However, it does not deliver legal certainty and the Chairman of the Article 29 Working Party has contested the assertion by the Commission that EU data protection authorities may not find it necessary to take enforcement actions - that is for breaches of the Data Protection Directive - against airlines complying with the US requirements.
This is a stunning rebuff to the Commission.
He said in essence that National Data Protection Commissioners and courts were not free to suspend application of relevant laws just on the say-so of the Commission.
That must be right. It is a reminder to the Commission that if it will not be the guardian of Community law, then others have to be.
The political groups are in wide agreement on this matter.
The only point of contention is the amendment calling for the Commission to secure suspension of the US demands until there is a decision on compatibility with the Data Protection Directive, which means an Article 25(6) decision.
The PPE-DE Group has not signed this amendment, and I understand they believe it would leave the airlines exposed.
However, the Article 29 Working Party has stated that they are exposed anyway to sanction for breach of data protection legislation.
Therefore it is academic.
The text of the statement makes it quite clear that the Data Protection Directive applies, because it states that US customs will access the data in the territory of the Community.
The basic problem is that the US has no data protection laws.
This is a problem for the Europol Agreement and the EU-US Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement.
There is huge concern about the balance between security and civil liberties being tipped too far towards security in the United States.
In the light of various apparent miscarriages of justice recently in the US, the lack of control on use of data by other law enforcement agencies is of great concern.
We need an Article 25(6) decision after consultation of this House.
The Commission may have tried its best, but it did the wrong thing.
Mr President, I wish to tell the House that, 10 days ago, Professor Venios Angelopoulos of the Athens Polytechnic travelled to JFK airport in the United States and disappeared.
He disappeared for five hours because he was being interrogated by the FBI.
They grabbed him with no explanation whatsoever and they let him go with no explanation whatsoever.
There was an outcry in Greece about the how, why and wherefore until the citizens of the European Union, the Member States of the European Union and parliamentarians gradually found out that the European Commission and the United States had already come to an agreement on the transfer of personal data on people travelling to the United States.
And that is not all.
The United States are allowed to access data systems, passenger files recording the date the seat was booked, the travel agency, ticketing information, credit card number and expiry date, itinerary, previous files on the passenger containing details of previous trips, religious or ethnic information based on their choice of meal etc., who they accompanied, where they stayed, how they communicated with other people and their medical data, as well as frequent flyer programmes, which also contain a wealth of data.
How can this be?
Who do the United States think they are?
The international police?
And where does this leave the European Union?
Why does the European Union have data protection laws?
How can we stand by while the United States imposes fines on airlines for wanting to apply the laws of the European Union?
How humiliating is that?
The European Parliament calls on the Commission in its motions - and the Commissioner said nothing about this - to put an end to this, pending harmonisation with the laws of the European Union.
I think we should apply Rule 91 of the Rules of Procedure, as we have had no response from the Commission, and institute proceedings before the Court of Justice.
Mr President, the right to privacy is not sacrosanct, it is a basic right but it can be violated if there are important issues at stake, if it is effective, if it is proportional and if there are guarantees against misuse.
I can tell the Commission now that as far as I am concerned blackmail by a third country or long waiting times for air travel do not count as important issues.
This will really have to be solved another way.
Privacy is not an obstacle, but an essential part of security.
Dealing carelessly with the privacy of our citizens jeopardises the basic trust of the people in their government and in the constitutional state and then we are worse off.
For my group it is logical that the United States wants to know who is setting foot on its territory and in this context we can of course talk about the exchange of data.
But then agreements must also be made about what data we exchange, which authorities have access to them and how long they may be retained.
US Customs may pass the data on to other authorities that are concerned with combating terrorism.
The interest on the American side in the personal data of aircraft passengers cannot, however, be seen separately from their efforts to bring about a Global Computer Surveillance System.
The United States, as my colleague Mr Alavanos has just said, wants to track the travel patterns of citizens, their credit card purchases, and so on, worldwide.
Now the Commission is really pleased because the Americans have made a solemn undertaking not to use data about religion and health.
What does that mean?
Does it mean that while they do have access to these data, they have simply undertaken not to do anything with them?
Do you really believe, Commissioner, that if the American authorities have these data and if they think that it is useful for their system, they are really not going to use them?
Even meal preferences can say something about a person.
I myself have been vegetarian for years and years, even on aircraft.
Now, all of this is going to be recorded and analysed.
For people who do not like this, a European Commission spokesman had good advice.
'The choice is clear,' he said, 'either you do not go to the United States, or you go for the sandwich option.'
Do you, Commissioner, endorse this advice, and do you also think it so enormously funny?
In itself it fits in well with your liberal remark of a few moments ago that passengers must in particular be well informed about sensitive information that is gathered about them.
Now the small print on an aircraft ticket is one thing, but do passengers really have any other option?
I would like to hear what you have to say on that as well.
Mr President, I would otherwise like to associate myself with the many comments of my fellow Members about the precise technical and legal problems with this.
We for our part say that the exchange of data must stop immediately.
European rules apply here on the European continent and if we are going to make agreements about changing these rules, then the partner with whom we are making these agreements must also respect our rules, our basic principles.
This is how it works in a partnership between well-meaning countries.
Commissioner, I will focus on procedure first: you say it is not a question of a legislative act, a Community act.
The problem is that it seems to us at least possible that that act, those joint statements - first the February ones and then the March ones - give rise to legal effects, actions, exchanges of data and information that have taken place because of those meetings and those statements.
The joint statement issued by the two parties in February already mentions the fact that the most sensitive data should be - and are - processed in accordance with European Union legislation.
This statement is also an assessment of the data transfer procedures, a conclusive assessment; it has legislative force and, indeed, serves to legitimise an exchange of data that already exists.
The same is true of Paragraph 4 of the Commission recommendation to the national data protection authorities, according to which it is not necessary to take enforcement measures against airlines that are not complying with the United States' requests.
This is another recommendation that has legislative force and effect: the Commission is saying 'Do not intervene!' regarding those airlines that are transferring data in compliance with US legislation.
I therefore believe that there is at least the possibility and the suspicion that this act should be considered a legislative act, against which Parliament can appeal to the Court of Justice.
I also believe this procedure might help the Commission and the European Union themselves to strengthen their own position in a dialogue that should be conducted on equal terms, between parties of equal rank, between a market of 250 million people and a market of 350 million people, because we have to consider very seriously the fact that, right now, collecting these data and transferring them to the United States cannot be in compliance with Community law.
Contrary to what the Commission said in the joint statements, the collecting of data that is intended for commercial purposes and the subsequent use thereof for security or intelligence purposes constitutes in itself a breach of the principle of necessity and the principle of proportionality laid down by Community law.
This, in fact, creates a situation of so-called generalised surveillance, which is definitely against Community law, and not just might be or something we must check up on to see whether it contravenes the law.
What is needed, then, is to open formal, official negotiations to see what agreement, what compromise can be found, but it is not possible to resolve the issue pre-emptively by thus attributing de facto legitimacy to a transfer of data that has already begun.
This is why Parliament must continue down this road, and I also believe it will strengthen the Commission and the Community institutions.
Mr President, this is an unfortunate situation, of that there can be no doubt.
Sensitive personal data on citizens of the European Union can be transferred to the authorities in the United States, with no guarantees whatsoever, and our citizens are clearly concerned about this.
At the same time, the United States have taken a threatening stand.
They are threatening to take measures against our airlines if they fail to do as they are told, which is hardly what one expects from friends and allies.
This is just the latest in a series of incidents over recent years, especially lately, incidents which often have what might well be seen as comic-tragic overtones.
For example, as we have seen in the case of Iraq, numerous European countries are now at the point where they have more in common with powers such as China and Russia than with the United States, with which we basically share the same values.
Consequently, at some point, both sides will have to sit down, we and the Americans, and talk seriously and on an equal footing about where this relationship is going and what we can do to save it before it implodes completely.
Now, on this particular issue, criticism is being levied at the Commission which I endorse in large part, although I must say that, in my personal opinion, I do not believe that there was any intention on the part of the Commission to support the Americans.
Its intention was to take certain steps in order to deal with a difficult situation it was facing.
In all events, what I want to see is this problem resolved as quickly as possible in a way that is, first, legally correct and, secondly, legally secure with respect to the rights of the citizens of the European Union.
I think that this approach, Mr President, is far preferable to the immediate suspension of the interim agreement between the Commission and the American authorities that several political groups have called for in their proposed amendment.
If we automatically suspend the agreement with immediate effect, I think that we will be doing ourselves more harm than good, to tell you the truth, not to mention European airlines, which will be denied landing rights in the United States.
So let us find a legally secure solution as quickly as possible, let the Commission act along these lines, even at this late stage, perhaps by correcting any mistakes made, and let us leave it at that.
Mr President, Commissioners, this Parliament has reacted after the attention of President Prodi, President Simitis and Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar was drawn to the matter by a source as authoritative as the chairman of the Article 29 committee.
The Commission, on the other hand, tells us that these are simply misunderstandings.
I must say that, now that these misunderstandings have been cleared up, I am even more concerned.
I come from a Member State which knows that measures to combat terrorism must be established, but which also knows - only too well - that this must be done within strict respect for legality and for the law unless we wish to hand final victory to the terrorists.
You tell us that the airlines are being pressured by the action of the United States Administration, which is forcing them to breach European legislation.
If this is the case, the airlines have the right to claim protection from their authorities, as do, it goes without saying, the Union's citizens.
The Commissioner says that no agreement or decision has been reached and that, therefore, there is no legal basis for such action.
Commissioner, this is precisely what we are complaining about; this is precisely the question we are asking: what has been done to give the United States the idea that they can undertake unilateral action?
What have we done to allow this to happen?
You ask us to take a positive view of the Commission's actions by saying that data protection - a right recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights - and the loss of jobs or the penalties that airlines might suffer must be seen in a balanced way.
I genuinely believe that this is an acceptance of blackmail and I find this situation surprising.
Is the European Union unable to respond in a reciprocal way, to say that some things are not acceptable and might face countermeasures?
I have the impression that what we are seeing reflects the attitude of a female character from a Spanish novel who, convinced that she lives under the absolute authority of her husband, is happy because he beats her 'no more than usual'.
In my view, this is unacceptable and this attitude must change.
As most of the groups in this House are calling for, we must stop implementing decisions that have been taken, either by the Union together with the United States or by the United States alone, and attempt this time to conclude, with the means of pressure available to us and with our legislation - which must prevail - an agreement that ensures the secure processing of our data and correctly inform Parliament and, above all, our citizens, of this agreement.
Mr President, the Commissioner has said that there is no agreement and no decision, but there is an interim rule.
My question therefore is how long can such an interim rule be valid and how must we view it?
Protection of personal data is a fundamental right under Article 7 of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.
It is probably also going to form part of our European constitution.
So this is a very serious matter.
All this is also laid down in our directives and in particular Directive 95/46/EEC.
It also contains exceptions that we could meet.
But as far as I have read these exceptions, I have to say that the transfer of data to the US is systematic and does not fall under the exception of Article 13 of that directive.
It is also the case that the data in question are so all-embracing that you cannot say that they are not relevant and not excessive and therefore cannot fall under Article 6 of that directive.
In addition, Directive 95/46/EEC says in general that the transfer of personal data to a third country may only take place if that third country offers an adequate level of protection.
In my opinion this has not been satisfied either.
I have listened carefully to the Commissioner, who has said that he has done his best to find a balance between maintaining privacy and protecting the airlines.
I have some sympathy for that, but I nonetheless believe that he has gone the wrong way about it.
There is no democratic legitimacy and agreements have been concluded that could not be tested by the representative body.
That is totally wrong.
At the moment my position is that the measures in their present form must be suspended.
The Commission's representative - Mr Bolkestein, I believe - mentioned at one point the issue of whether Parliament might not take a positive view of the Commission's actions.
I am just as incapable as my fellow MEPs of expressing such a positive view.
The idea of doing so strikes me as being something of a bad joke, since such energetic kow-towing to unreasonable demands on the part of the American authorities has rarely been seen.
The big picture in this matter is, of course, specifically the United States' relations with the surrounding world.
What we are discussing here and now bears no direct relation to the use of military technology to kill other peoples, but it is all part of the same picture.
The demands put forward by the American Government are clearly inconsistent with the legal requirements derived from current legislation, first and foremost Directive 95/46/EC on the principles of data protection.
As is apparent from quite a few of the statements put forward by the Article 29 Group, the heart of the matter is that this data is not merely to be used in the interests of air safety, but for the purposes of what is referred to in the United States as public order, that is to say as a component part of the United States' war against terrorism conducted under the banner of the end justifying the means.
There are, however, a number of legal principles involved here that we cannot dispense with, and the Commission's efforts to uphold these legal principles are pitiful.
What is described in the paper from the Article 29 Group is certainly alarming.
Data is passed on not merely to immigration authorities but to other federal bureaux.
It is, then, no longer specifically protected, as it ought to be according to American legislation.
I might add one question and one answer.
The question, raised by the Commissioner, was as to whether this matter could be sorted out using a comitology procedure.
That would be absurd.
In my view, the matter necessarily revolves around an agreement pursuant to Article 24 - cf. also Article 38 - of the Treaty on European Union, which unfortunately means that Parliament is made redundant since it has no influence upon decisions of this kind.
All the more reason, then, for informing the public in advance.
Mr President, Commissioner, there can be no denying that especially since the events of 11 September stronger measures have been needed to combat terrorism, but it should equally go without saying that any measures that we implement need to have a legal basis.
The United States on 5 March enacted a law that has indisputable consequences for the citizens of the European Union, for data protection and for EU legislation.
The US enacted this law without concluding the necessary bilateral or multilateral negotiations and without entering into an agreement with the Union.
This - as you yourself indicated, Commissioner - has led to a problem with the airlines, which are caught in a double bind.
If they do not pass on any data, they have difficulties over landing rights, leading to business problems.
But if they do pass on the data as required, they run the danger of infringing EU law and being taken to court.
So a horrendous problem has arisen here.
This procedure is quite simply unacceptable.
The Commission is not, however, immune from criticism here, because it has been aware of this issue for 15 months and has had ample time to tackle this problem, to consult Parliament and to seek appropriate solutions.
An opportunity has been missed here - yesterday was the first time we were informed of this.
We now find ourselves in the position of debating something that has been in force for some time now and which involves data on our citizens being transferred to the United States without our having any real guarantees about how this data is used in practice.
Something else I am critical of is the fact that the negotiations have not been held at political level but that officials have been given the remit of reaching agreement on this, and that this has then virtually been presented to us as the legal basis for all these processes, and the citizens of the European Union have been expected to put up with this.
This too is totally unacceptable.
What we expect and indeed demand is that those responsible should be held to account for allowing a situation in which data is now being passed on from the European Union without any legal basis.
We in the PPE-DE Group are also calling for the scope for an action in the European Court of Justice to be investigated, and we are demanding in particular, and with immediate effect, that anything that has been illegally enacted and is now in force should be rectified.
However, we also expect that cooperation with the United Nations in the fight against terror should continue, but on a proper legal footing.
We all know that we can only win the war on terror by means of international cooperation.
We are therefore committed to cooperation with the United States, but let me make this clear once more - only if our rights are defended!
Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we have witnesses here today to hear us - their visit to the European Parliament will have served a useful purpose.
All the citizens who are listening to us today are taxpayers and in the final analysis they are the ones who finance officials' salaries and some of them are following our debates with a certain sense of irony.
And, Commissioner, it is the Commission's third-tier officials in particular who ought to be aware that they bear an enormous responsibility in Brussels, and that they also have to protect the interests of Europe's citizens.
It is already clear that we need to fight terrorism.
I myself am each year the budget rapporteur of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and we give Commissioner Vitorino everything he needs for the war on terror.
None of us will refuse if the measures proposed are reasonable.
Especially since 11 September we have been aware of the need for vigilance on our planet and the need to take appropriate measures at any given time.
On the other hand - and I say this as someone from Germany - data protection is not just something that you can surrender if you consider it important that the European Union should not become like America.
It is our task as Members, as representatives of the people, to take our electors' and our citizens' interests seriously and to defend them.
We are not just talking about the airlines' interests here.
We are talking about the interests of people who will soon find - without their knowing anything about it - that every detail of their lives has been handed over to the American security services, without ever having approved that and without knowing how this data will be used.
Up to now they have always assumed that constitutional arrangements apply in the European Union and that data about them is sacrosanct.
What I would now like to know is this: how will we be able to convince these citizens in the future if the American authorities, who are giving no guarantees at all, are in a position to use or abuse their data as they wish?
Mr President, Commissioner, once again I wish to contradict the previous speaker.
He needs to get a sense of proportion.
Germany's airlines and those of other countries are informing the public about the new situation, and telling them that if they wish to fly to the USA, they need to agree that this data should be passed on.
Nothing is being hushed up here, the public is being told about this.
Yes, it is evident that that is not enough, but you are acting as if the public were being deceived by the airlines, and that is simply not the case.
I shall try to look at this whole issue from the standpoint of the airlines and their passengers for once.
Because of the general recession, Europe's airlines were already in trouble before 11 September.
The events of 11 September and the period that followed caused enormous problems not only for all European airlines but also for airlines in the US.
As you will have read over the last few days, even American Airlines may have to file for Chapter 11 protection.
So the airlines find themselves in an extremely difficult situation. This will also have an impact on airports and on employment.
It therefore has to be said that there is no point in disrupting air traffic between the USA and Europe over the next few weeks because of arguments of principle.
We need to ensure that we can find a constitutional and practical solution to this problem.
Nor can I allow to go unchallenged the insinuation made by some Members that the US authorities will willingly misuse data on European and other citizens that comes into their possession.
You need to bear in mind that before data protection was introduced in Europe, the Americans already had far more stringent data protection arrangements than we have, combined with strict rules about passing on data to third parties.
So to that extent the allegation that the Americans would regularly misuse data passed to them is quite simply mistaken.
What we do of course need, Mr Bolkestein, is clear answers from you.
How do you intend to achieve legal certainty that the US authorities will only receive data needed to fight terrorism and no other data?
How do you intend to ensure that the Americans - and this also applies to company data - are only given the data they need, as opposed to data they can use to outmanoeuvre our businesses, our airlines and so on?
You need to guarantee that by means of unambiguous agreements with the Americans.
That is the reason for my two other questions about the extent to which you are prepared to negotiate with the Americans. Which of the two possible legal solutions you have identified do you actually intend to pursue now, and how long will that take?
I believe that in the present difficult situation faced by the airlines we cannot afford effectively to provoke an interruption of air traffic between the US and Europe.
Mr President, the fight against terrorism is necessary, but not all means are permitted.
That is a very simple basic principle.
You cannot play games with democratic legitimacy and the credibility of politics.
If under the guise of the fight against terrorism the European Union were to permit excessive violation of citizens' rights, we would be sliding towards the breakdown of the rule of law.
If, as the previous speaker appears to be advocating, we lean too far in our sympathies for the airlines' difficulties, then we shall also be seriously off beam.
This is the way things would go if Parliament were to acquiesce in the agreement between the Commission and the United States.
That according to Commissioner Bolkestein it should now all of a sudden not be allowed to be called an agreement does not make things any better.
After all, the European Commission has overstepped the mark in this dossier and that is especially disappointing of Commissioner Bolkestein, who this very week has very cheerfully announced his candidacy as member of the European Commission for a second term - remarkable.
The European Commission, as I said, has overstepped the mark.
In the first place it has failed to keep to its own plan to test its own action in advance against Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In addition, as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is under an obligation to uphold existing European legislation, in respect of data protection in this case.
As earlier speakers have already explained in detail I shall not repeat it everything is inconsistent with everything else.
Instead of performing its duties properly, the Commission has acted like a mayor in time of war, yielding to American pressure - also known as blackmail - in order, supposedly, to prevent something worse happening.
This action lacks any legal foundation, is completely non-transparent and uncontrollable.
If the Commission had demonstrated greater political courage and had brought in Parliament in good time, a decent debate could have taken place regarding the scope within the fight against terrorism and the limits of data transfer.
The Commission must therefore retrace its steps and take action to defer the agreement's entry into force.
If the agreements are properly tested against the European rules, a proper agreement can be concluded rather than this half-baked effort that jeopardises legal security.
I am therefore especially pleased that in the resolution we shall be voting on tomorrow we shall also be opening up the route to the European Court, because it is not the first time that the Commission has tried to sidetrack Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are living in times in which the United States of America persists in adopting undesirable unilateral initiatives.
It is unacceptable for that country to impose measures on airlines unilaterally and on pain of severe sanctions.
As a matter of fact, I think that the Commission and the Council must take a careful look at whether this type of measure is entirely compatible with international agreements and conventions on air traffic and transport.
As various speakers have emphasised, primarily the committee chairman, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, our airlines are facing a dilemma, which is on the one hand that they are obliged to comply with Union data protection rules, specifically Directive 9546 and, on the other, they are obliged, due to this US legislation, to forward this data on passengers flying to, from or within the United States, in the knowledge that if they fail to do so or do so incorrectly or incompletely, they will be hit with severe sanctions, which could range from losing landing rights to having to pay substantial fines.
I agree with all the speakers who have emphasised that something is wrong in the relationship between the Commission and Parliament.
It took fifteen months for the Commission to submit the matter to Parliament.
It is also clear that the joint declaration by officials of 18 February does not establish a derogation for Community law and therefore does not provide a legal basis for airlines to authorise access to their data.
Consequently, airlines face a real risk of being taken to court, as a result of complaints from passengers whose personal details have been forwarded to the US authorities.
The directive on data protection lays down that personal data can only be forwarded to third countries if adequate protection is in place.
Have the United States given us sufficient guarantees that this data will be protected?
Guarantees must be provided for a definition of the reasons, for restrictions on the use of these data, for the conditions and restrictions on forwarding and sharing data, for protecting data from unauthorised access, for the duration and conditions of storage, for national measures for the protection of sensitive data, for passengers' means of recourse to review and correct data kept by the US authorities and, finally, for conditions of reciprocity.
I hope that this matter will not be omitted from the next EU-US summit, due to take place on 25 June and that the European Union will adopt a forceful stance on this.
Mr President, we all reject and condemn terrorism and its criminal acts.
We support the US objective of preventing and combating terrorism and we roundly condemn the appalling acts of 11 September 2001.
These acts were intolerable for their blind violence and because they affected innocent citizens.
