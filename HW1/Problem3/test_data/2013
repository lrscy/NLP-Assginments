I say to the Council that, unfortunately, the EU countriesâ response to victims is often to close the door.
There is the case of two Ukrainian doctors who risked their lives to expose local Ukrainian businesses that market organ tissue from 20-week-old babies, purchased, birthed and kept alive during the painful harvesting process.
After attempts on their lives, the doctors escaped to Ireland last September.
They are still in a holding centre with no assurance of being granted asylum and facing the possibility of deportation and death.
I will not support proposed amendments that would change this constructive report by introducing yet another human rights abuse â abortion â into the already abusive situation of war.
One abuse cannot justify another.
A woman who has been abused by a rapist needs help and protection, not more death and destruction.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as citizens of the new Member States we are fortunate enough to be able to say that we are no longer directly affected by the problem of human rights, which is a major issue and the subject of our debate today.
Human rights are no longer being violated in our countries in the way they were for 50Â years, firstly during German occupation and then under a Communist regime.
Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that human rights are still continually and grossly violated all over the world, and this is something of which we should be thoroughly ashamed.
The motives behind these violations are quite basic, yet they are intolerable and there should be no place for them in the world today.
One of these motives is religion, with Catholics being persecuted in a great many countries.
In modern-day China, for example, Catholics are deprived of any rights, and the same is true in a great many other countries.
The burning of churches and related events in Indonesia must surely still be fresh in your minds.
Another motive is nationality.
I find it astonishing that a country like China can persecute people it calls its own citizens, especially given that these people are not in fact Chinese citizens.
The people of Tibet are actually entitled to a country of their own.
I find it equally astonishing that the world can stand by and watch, and that there have even been calls to lift the embargo against China.
This embargo has no real effect, of course, but it testifies to our moral beliefs, and we should act in accordance with such beliefs in this instance.
As far as Chechnya is concerned, I find it incomprehensible that Russia can now be considered a political partner like any other, when this is a country that not only murdered a moderate Chechen politician, but also acted in a barbaric manner by refusing to give up his body, and said that he had been buried in an unmarked grave because he deserved nothing better.
Similar instances of countries acting like outlaws by persecuting their own citizens can be seen in Cuba and Belarus.
This was also what happened in Darfur, and yet the world does virtually nothing in response to events of this kind, although I am of course aware that these issues have been discussed in this House.
Persecution of this kind is equivalent to hunting Pygmies with the sole aim of treating them like common game, and it is an extremely serious problem.
In colonial times, countries took responsibility, to a greater or lesser degree, for ensuring that order prevailed in their colonies.
Today, however, we are frequently confronted with what amounts to conspiracies between entrepreneurs.
The latter corrupt local rulers in order to exploit the former colonies in a way that surpasses even the exploitation they suffered in colonial times.
These entrepreneurs are not subject to any kind of checks by their home countries. In fact the opposite is true, as they have the backing of these countries.
In view of this, I would ask for an investigation to be opened into the following case, which has been covered by the press.
A case has been filed with the Paris Military Court regarding the complicity of French soldiers in the genocide and crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda in 1994.
Institutions such as the European Parliament have a duty to act as guardians of fundamental human rights, and to monitor the worldâs largest countries in order to ensure that they are not collaborating in these gross violations of human rights.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, human rights are a live issue in Europe, not only in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
This is a point we must stress in connection with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, because human rights are being violated in countries that border the EU.
These violations are not going on in remote and exotic places. They are going on next door to us, in the very same Europe we live in.
A second key issue is the fight against terrorism, as the latter is the greatest real threat facing the international community.
What is needed is solidarity between EU Member States, yet this is currently lacking, for example with regard to the âblack listâ of terrorist organisations.
This is one instance where there is a real need for the united Europe to speak with one voice, instead of the large Member States of the old EU looking out for their own interests.
In my opinion, the report should have highlighted the fact that religious minorities, and especially Christians, are being persecuted in certain African and Asian countries.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking our colleague, Mr Coveney, for all his hard work on our Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004.
A remarkable part of this report is dedicated to the countries in Eastern Europe that might in the future become members of the EU family, namely Ukraine, Moldova and even Belarus.
I wish to stress some points which are of great importance for improving human rights in that region.
As part of the European Parliamentâs delegation, I had an opportunity to observe parliamentary elections in Moldova.
Although the election results have been recognised by the international community, it is clear that the elections did not meet certain obligations with respect to a fully competitive electoral process, especially in relation to fair access to the media and impartial coverage of the campaign.
In addition, arrests of opposition MPs and other actions against peaceful demonstrations constitute clear violations of fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression, association and assembly.
Even a meeting of international observers with the President of the country and ânumber oneâ on one political partyâs electoral list was used for his partyâs campaign.
Another important point is to call on Ukraine and Moldova to crack down on smuggling to, from and through Transnistria and to develop effective anti-corruption programmes for the customs, border guard and tax services, as well as the police.
On the election day, we observers from this House were not allowed to enter Transnistria, but it was clear that people in Moldova and Transnistria in particular had to face all the negative implications of that situation.
Last, but not least, we should again remind Russia to withdraw its so-called peacekeepers and ammunition from Moldova and specifically from Transnistria, as without this precondition our recommendations to fight corruption, organised crime and the illegal export of weapons will remain gestures of our goodwill but will not become a reality.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing a new wave of democracy in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and Africa.
The elections in Ukraine demonstrated the huge potential of civil society in the countries bordering the EU and in those in which the European Union serves as a basic point of reference in political, economic and cultural matters.
Evidence of this democratisation can be seen, , in the adoption of a constitution and the holding of elections in Afghanistan, in the free elections in Palestine and Iraq and in the major public demonstrations in Lebanon, as well as in the steps that have been taken towards liberalisation in other countries.
In Belarus, which is one of the EUâs neighbours, the public is rebelling against authoritarian forms of governance, and a democratic breakthrough can be expected in this country too in the near future.
One of the European Unionâs current priorities should be to help civil society in Belarus in its struggle for fundamental human rights and democracy.
We are seeing improvements in the human rights situations in a number of countries.
In DecemberÂ 2004, Uzbekistan issued a decree granting an amnesty to 5Â 400Â prisoners.
In AugustÂ 2003, Uzbekistanâs Parliament, the Oliy Majlis, adopted amendments to the penal code which mean that torture and other forms of inhuman treatment are now deemed to be crimes for which individuals may be prosecuted, at whatever stage of the criminal process they are committed.
At the same time as demanding the release of all remaining political prisoners, the European Parliament should call for the independent judiciary to be strengthened and for further reforms to be carried out in the field of human rights, whilst acknowledging the efforts Uzbekistan has made in terms of measures to prevent torture and to improve the situation of detainees.
We should also welcome the fact that steps have been taken to end press censorship in the country.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my respect to the rapporteur for the report that has given a detailed account of the human rights situation in the world in 2004, and the position of the European Union on the issue.
Today, many people turn with confidence to such important global institutions as the EU or the UN when they feel to be victim of or witness to abuses.
Let me, however, stress that in those situations where peopleâs rights are the most flagrantly violated, the victims often lack the strength or the resources to be able and know how to defend themselves or point attention to them.
This is why it is so important for the European Parliament to follow, in cooperation of its various committees, not only the drafting of the conventions and their ratification status, but also their implementation.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child was signed and ratified by almost all the countries of the world. I am, however, convinced that there are a number of European countries where the rights of children do not receive adequate attention.
Yesterday, at the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I made an attempt to insert a reference to Article 32 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to Mr Bowisâs report on patient mobility, but my suggestion was not supported by my distinguished colleagues.
Can someone tell me how the situation really is with the implementation of important documents?
Â Â  Mr Coveneyâs report exudes strength, is balanced, and, if Europe wants to prove its reputation in the world as an exporter of human rights, it will do well to adopt this report in its entirety as its key asset in foreign policy and also for the coming conference in Geneva.
I should like to mention three points from it: first of all in my capacity of Vice-Chairman for the delegation in Central Asia.
The report is right to put its finger on the sore spot in a number of countries, Uzbekistan, in particular.
I know that the Uzbekistani Government claims there are no political prisoners, but you can also get politicians behind bars on a different charge, which has happened, and has not been resolved as yet.
This is, in fact, also evident from the Council of Europeâs report further to the most recent parliamentary elections in Uzbekistan.
The second point which illustrates that international pressure can be effective, is the situation in Kyrgyzstan.
What matters now is for that region to be taken seriously and monitoring to be continued.
The third point concerns the freedom of the press in Kazakhstan.
Only recently, Irina Petrushova was locked up on account of possible offences completely unrelated to her work, except that she happens to be the most prominent journalist for the opposition newspaper in Kazakhstan.
We in this House must continue to put countries like those under pressure, because we have a great deal in common with them; they can take a step forward and we can help them achieve this.
My final point concerns the situation in Iran and that countryâs way of dealing with people who do not adhere to the main religion, in this case Islam.
It was found once again recently that Hamid Pourmand, a former army colonel, had been sentenced to death, his only offence being that he is a Christian.
For that reason, he should not have served in the army, although his religious conviction was known.
An appeal from this House, in this specific case where a death sentence is pending, is of the utmost importance.
I should once again like to congratulate Mr Coveney, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will take this report very seriously as an asset in our foreign policy in the field of human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, as the European Parliament is the chief guardian of human rights, it is necessary to examine what issues the report deemed important and worthy of consideration.
I welcome the approval of the amendment which ensured that human rights issues in the Western Balkans were dealt with under a separate heading.
As the leader of the Hungarian Socialist delegation and as the president of the Intergroup for historical national minorities, constitutional regions and regional languages, I find a major shortcoming in the reportâs treatment of national minority rights abuses which are not given due emphasis despite their importance.
Although national minority rights abuses are observed in a few instances, in the case of the Western Balkans, they are not even mentioned.
It is absurd to think that problems in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina or Serbia can be settled without assuring national minority rights.
I see two fundamental problems: one of perception and approach, which simplifies national minority rights to human rights.
Although we cannot speak of minority rights without human rights, the assurance of human rights in itself does not guarantee national minority rights, which require additional rights as well as special modes of practice and preferential treatment.
Another predicament is that the EU lacks minority protection standards and an adequate monitoring system, as these are not part of the .
The position is paradoxical, since, in the case of the new Member States, the situation of national minorities was part of the 1994 Copenhagen political criteria for joining.
Continuous monitoring of the national minority situation by the Union had a very positive effect on national minority issues in the new central European Member States.
Why do not we do the same with regard to this report?
Why is not there a separate section for national minorities among the thematic issues?
I therefore suggest that a whole chapter is dedicated to national minorities in next yearâs annual report.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the European Union can be proud of the fact that it places such a high premium on defending human rights throughout the world, and in fact this is one of its main calling cards.
In days gone by, while we were still behind the Iron Curtain, we would listen eagerly to the voice of the free world.
This voice reached us over the airwaves thanks to radio stations such as Radio Free Europe, the BBC, France International and the Voice of America, and it gave us hope that one day we would witness the dawning of freedom and civil liberties.
In the same way, our wish now is for all those suffering persecution for their views or their religious beliefs, and all those held in bleak prisons by dictators under various pretexts, to hear that they have not been forgotten by this House, which lies at the very heart of Europe, and that we are demanding their release and an end to persecution.
I should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done.
At the same time, however, there are a few comments I should like to make on the report.
ParagraphÂ 12 calls on Moldova and Ukraine to resolve the Transnistria issue, yet it is obvious that no final and complete solution will be found to the problems surrounding this self-proclaimed republic unless Russia is involved, as the latter is backing Transnistria.
A number of Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor have been in jail in Libya for five years following absurd accusations that they knowingly and intentionally infected 450Â children in a Benghazi hospital with HIV.
The Commission should demand the release of these prisoners, who have been sentenced to death and whose appeal is due to be heard in a monthâs time.
I should also like to call on the Commission to pay particular attention to the discrimination suffered by Christians and Christian churches in Muslim countries.
Eritrea is the only country mentioned in the report as a place where Christians are persecuted, and no reference at all is made to their fate in Sudan.
I propose that the Commission should prepare a detailed report on the situation of Christian churches in the Middle East, Africa, China and Turkey.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with the view that this is the arduous story of an impossible report, which relates to an issue of increasing interest, both to the citizens and to the international bodies, and I would like to refer expressly to the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, in his report âIn larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for allâ.
This is the story of an impossible report, and we must express our gratitude to Mr Coveney, of course.
It is impossible because it will always be unbalanced â it deals with the entire world â inconsistent â we only have to look at the paragraph on Venezuela for example â and furthermore, every year it is original â because we are not consolidating any of the positions this Parliament has adopted in previous reports.
Its usefulness is very relative, Mr President, but nevertheless, this report says some very important things.
I believe we must redefine the European Parliamentâs position on this report: many of the positions adopted by Parliament in other reports and resolutions have no connection whatsoever to our annual report on human rights.
Our parliamentary work must focus mainly on making contributions to the report already produced by the Council and in that way it would be possible for us to influence the human rights situation in the world effectively.
Finally, and despite the fact that we have been through a very long and very complicated process of achieving a consensus amongst the political groups, I would like to address the Members on the right of this House to ask them to show consistency or responsibility, or if they like, simply compassion, and to support our position on women and girls who are raped, victims of abuse during situations of war or conflict, who need protection before and after they are attacked, and many of whom are made pregnant by their attackers and who must have access to voluntary termination of the pregnancy.
Do you not think so, ladies and gentlemen?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make a few remarks on dual standards and practices in the European Union institutions.
EU standards mean the erosion of standards as principles.
In many important cases it is difficult to conclude what has higher priority in our spectrum of common values: real respect for human rights or cheaper gas, gas that is likely to erode our principles and, in the end, Europe.
To the repeated remarks of my colleagues that Russia is very important, my response is: yes, but the truth is more important.
I am not going to criticise the great work done by Mr Coveney.
I congratulate him.
I am only concerned that the common mood of erosion has given rise to gaps or appeasing manoeuvres in so many of our documents.
There is often a conscious or subconscious concern not to be too explicit, not to be too hard, not to irritate people even if they are wrong.
Is anybody here concerned about the 40Â 000 Chechen children killed during the Russian military operation?
Do colleagues appreciate the barbaric humiliation inflicted on the body of the assassinated legitimate president?
We do not dare to state simple facts: that Russia is not yet a country of shared values, that it is a country whose government allows unfair business practices in its desire to join the WTO.
For many of us, the priority of peace in the Caucasus became a principle indirectly promoted by Russian diplomacy: the integrity of the cemetery.
We are in favour of it not giving any chance for the candidates for the cemetery to avoid such an enforced happy end.
Â Â  Mr President, nearly everyone has offered their congratulations to the author of this report and I can only add my own.
In reality, it is logical that within such an extensive report, which addresses issues in 70 countries, there may be ideas about which people will not be in complete agreement.
In contrast to what has been said by a succession of Members from the European left, however, I should like to point out a few brave positions adopted by the rapporteur with regard to major economic and political powers, towards which this Parliament all too often adopts an ambiguous and diplomatic stance, in a cynical attitude of , it could be said, to protect foreign trade.
I am referring to China: the Commission and the Council have announced their willingness, if not actually their intention, to abolish the arms embargo.
It is true that some progress has been made with regard to human rights, and it is true that China remains a prominent figure in the fight against terrorism, and that it is exerting useful pressure on North Korea to stop developing nuclear weapons.
That is not enough, however, and the report recognises it.
Above all, I should like to add that there is no need to allow China to exploit existing disagreements between the European Union and the United States on that issue.
I am also referring to Russia, which, in the tragic Chechen crisis and in its running of the country in general, cannot resist adopting measures that have little in common with our own vision of democracy.
The report also adopts a clear and precise position on this issue.
I will conclude by wholeheartedly endorsing the idea that, in my view, lies at the heart of this excellent report: no economic or commercial consideration should ever lead the European Union to deny or downplay the existence of human rights violations.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
The reason why this Houseâs reports on human rights are important political statements is not that they are binding in law, but that they make a political impact and that conclusions can be drawn from them.
Much of what is in this report â and this is what is weak about it â cannot absolutely be described as having to do with human rights issues.
Let me give a number of examples.
We all regard Kyoto as an important issue, but it does not exactly have much to do with human rights.
Social rights are important, but they belong in another category.
They are not human rights in the traditional sense of the word.
The right to an abortion is not a human right; it is a violation of a human right.
More to the point, it is not for the EU to tell any country what to do about it; the rule of subsidiarity applies.
Let me take this further by quoting Brecht.
In his âThe resistible rise of Arturo Uiâ, he wrote: âThe womb he crawled from is still going strongâ.
By that he meant the anti-Semitism and racial hatred preached by Hitler and the Third Reich.
We cannot be indifferent to anti-Semitism in Russia, particularly when it is propagated by the political class.
When 20Â members of the State Duma call for Jewish organisations to be banned from Russia, we have to respond, and, likewise, we have to understand that Russia has also been behind the terrible fighting and violations of human rights in Chechnya, and that politics underlies much of what appals us in Beslan and elsewhere.
While suicide bombings are indeed murder, they are also carried out in response to political circumstances and causes.
We must not expect too much of reports on human rights, even of those originating from this House.
It is an unfortunate fact that human rights alone will not bring about the political solutions that are needed.
Not only that, but nor must we apply double standards.
It is not acceptable that we should refuse to allow a country like Croatia to enter negotiations with the EU because of its lamentable failure to arrest a general who is suspected of human rights violations, while at the same time opening negotiations with Turkey, which â as we can read in press reports â is continuing to be extremely dilatory about implementing the Copenhagen political criteria.
I do not want to hold the Turkish Government responsible for the countryâs most popular reading matter turning out to be Hitlerâs âMein Kampfâ â of all things â but you do have to wonder what is going on.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a remarkable report: broad in its sweep and penetrating and positive in so many of its observations.
The tragedy is that its very breadth confirms how widespread human rights problems still are throughout the world and how vital it is that those of us who care about such issues must make sure our voices are heard and that they prevail.
I wish to highlight just one issue as raised in paragraph 49, on human rights issues in Kashmir.
I congratulate the rapporteur on the way he has worked with all political groups on this sensitive subject.
I am happy to accept his compromise wording but I would still like to have seen references not just to the region of Kashmir but also to the sufferings of the people of Kashmir.
This is after all a people issue.
The previous paragraph, number 48, makes clear that the largest functioning democracy in the world is India, a country that I much admire.
In my judgement, this should inspire India to assume greater moral leadership in the subcontinent and this means working not just with Pakistan, but with all stakeholders to ensure that human rights abuses are resolved with urgency.
Yesterday the President of Azad Kashmir came to the Parliament to open an exhibition at the start of EU-Kashmir week, the first time there has been such an occasion.
As a Vice-President of the all-party group on Kashmir in the European Parliament, I said then and repeat now that the people of Jammu and Kashmir should take great heart from the fact that this group is genuinely all-party and genuinely represents all nationalities, and that this Parliament remains committed to ensuring that their voices can be heard loud and clear here in this Parliament.
We must all look forward to the day when, with our support, the voices of the people can be heard equally loudly and equally clearly in the land of their fathers.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to focus on the paragraph in the report that relates to Belarus, a country which, according to the report, increasingly resembles an island in the midst of Europe.
Members of the opposition have been kidnapped and murdered, elections rigged, demonstrators imprisoned and the press gagged.
On top of all of this, the authorities have recently banned citizens from studying abroad without their consent, and imposed restrictions on trips to work legally in other countries.
Polish citizens are also being given the opportunity to experience the âblessingsâ of this kolkhoz-style Communism at first hand, as several of them have had their lorries and cars confiscated for transporting three cartons of cigarettes.
I find it quite astonishing that we can stand idly by, and even draft European principles of cross-border cooperation, when not a day passes without us hearing of fresh violations of human rights in a country that is a direct neighbour of the EU.
Only yesterday, more than 40Â demonstrators were arrested for attempting to commemorate the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.
The efforts of the Commission and the Council have merely served to hold back the process of transformation in Belarus, as nearly six months have passed since Parliamentâs resolution on the matter, and precisely nothing has happened.
Projects intended to promote civil society have got stuck at the stage of analysis, discussion and ordered debates at countless seminars and summit meetings.
The Commission does not believe that funding radio stations to broadcast from neighbouring countries would provide added value.
In other words, it does not perceive any benefit in values such as freedom of the media, or in providing a source of information other than the Belarussian propaganda.
There is now talk of pursuing a common policy on Belarus with Russia.
In this connection, I would ask what kind of human rights we would be able to protect in Belarus by cooperating with Russia, and how we would be able to protect them.
Would this entail waiting until the hysterical dictator has wronged even more of his fellow citizens?
Alternatively, should we leave it to the Americans to come up with a solution to problems in a country bordering the EU, merely because we are more interested in what is going on in Madagascar?
Â Â  Mr President, like the report, your debate confirms and illustrates how very sensitive your Parliament is to the problem of human rights.
It in fact reflects the great sensitivity of the vast majority of Europeans to this problem.
Many Europeans are actively involved in promoting human rights, in fighting to defend them wherever in the world they are violated.
Young people especially are particularly interested in promoting human rights.
I therefore think that the message you are sending with this report, and also with this debate, must first of all be a message to young people to show them that the Europe that is being built is a Europe that conveys its human rights values to the world.
I believe Europeâs image in the world is closely associated with this human rights message.
I also agree with those who have said that in themselves human rights alone cannot be the answer to every political problem.
A human rights policy cannot replace a foreign policy.
Any foreign policy worthy of the name, however, one that is based on values, must give an important place to the defence of human rights.
As President-in-Office, that is the message I take from your Parliament, from your report, and I think all the Member States, like the Council, will be attentive to what you have to say.
It is true that there is no single solution and there is no easy solution.
We cannot treat different situations in the same way, but the basic message remains the same everywhere and the Council must also make that message, which your Parliament has expressed, its own in the policies it puts into effect.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like, on behalf of the Commission â as Mr Schmit has just done on behalf of the Council â to congratulate the rapporteur and the European Parliament once again on this debate, which has demonstrated to those of us who have attended and participated in it the immensity of the challenges facing us today in terms of defending and protecting human rights in the world.
The issues we have dealt with have ranged from the fight against terrorism to the violation of the rights of minorities, and they include a whole series of violations of human rights at many levels.
You have mentioned many countries and many regions of the world, from practically every continent, and we all agree that we have a great responsibility as representatives of the European institutions and of the will of Europeâs citizens to do our duty and to realise our desire to protect human rights and incorporate their defence into all of our policies, and, in particular, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, into our foreign policy.
I would therefore like to confirm the Commissionâs commitment, and Mrs Ferrero-Waldnerâs commitment in particular, to intensifying the dialogue with Parliament and with the Council, with a view to consolidating the approaches set by European policy in this field and by the suggestions and recommendations expressed by Parliament in its report, and would repeat that, in relation to each and every issue that requires a response, the Commission will do so in writing and its response will be available to you as soon as possible.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  . â This report contains a great deal of hypocrisy and a number of untruths.
There is no shortage of examples, such as the way in which the report omits the persecution suffered by the Kurds and the Turks and the breaches of the fundamental rights of the people of Western Sahara, and the way in which it refers to Venezuela and Cuba.
I should particularly like to highlight Venezuela and Cuba, in light of my recent experience in these countries.
I went to Venezuela on two occasions last year, and was there at the time of the recall referendum, won by a landslide by President ChÃ¡vez.
It was clear to me that the Venezuelan Government had had difficulty in gaining access to the media, in particular to the various private, opposition-controlled television stations; indeed, the European Parliament delegation was a victim of this.
Point 84 of this report is unacceptable, given that it is, in fact, the Venezuelan Government that is seeking cooperation with its neighbouring states.
I also visited Cuba recently, along with a delegation of Members of three different political groups in Parliament.
It is appalling that point 78 of this report does not contain one word about the US blockade of Cuba and that it singles out this country for special treatment and overlooks all of the consequences of the permanent US blockade.
Â Â  â The next item is the Commission statement on Roma in the European Union.
Â Â  . Honourable Members, the Commission wishes to thank the European Parliament for having included this item on its agenda, and to acknowledge the key role Parliament plays in protecting the rights of minorities, including the Roma.
The presence here today of MEPs that belong to the Roma community serves to highlight the importance of this role.
The fundamental rights upon which the European Union is founded include the principle of non-discrimination.
The Roma must be given the chance to participate fully in economic, social and political life, and so we must work together to overcome the centuries of prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion they have suffered.
This is an immense task, and it will require us to take coordinated action in a number of fields, in particular those of education, employment, housing and social services.
The responsibility for finding a solution to these issues will mainly lie with national bodies and with regional and local authorities, as the latter are where the Roma are most likely to be represented.
Although both civil society and the Roma themselves have an important part to play, the situation of the Roma is a European issue that calls for an EU solution.
This solution may take various forms.
The Commission is actively monitoring the situation of the Roma in both the European Union and the candidate countries.
As part of the preparations for accession, the situation of the Roma and of other minorities is assessed in relation to the political criteria.
The Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre pays particular attention to this issue when carrying out research into manifestations of racism and xenophobia in the European Union.
A binding legal framework has been established by the EU with the aim of combating discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin, and Community regulations currently in force prohibit direct or indirect discrimination in employment, education, social protection, property matters and services.
The Commission is working to ensure that these regulations are transposed into national law, and it also backs cultural and educational measures, including special measures for organisations working with the Roma.
The European Union provides substantial funding for measures promoting inclusion of the Roma community.
During preparations for accession, over EURÂ 100Â million was allocated under the PHARE programme to projects targeted at the Roma, and the Commission actively helps national bodies to utilise structural funds to promote inclusion of the Roma and other disadvantaged groups.
Several other Community programmes encourage exchanges of experience and support specific projects in the fields of employment, education, vocational training and research within the EU and in a number of third countries.
The Commission is keen to ensure that the situation of the Roma is taken into account in all EU programmes and policies that could be significant in this context.
To this end, a group has been set up comprising representatives of all the relevant Directorates-General, with the aim of exchanging best practices, coordinating policies and engaging in dialogue with participants from outside the institutions.
At the groupâs latest meeting, an exchange of information took place with an MEP from the Roma community.
The Commission also cooperates with other international organisations working to promote inclusion of the Roma, and is in regular contact with the Council of Europe, the OECD, the World Bank and other major players.
The European Union set itself ambitious goals in the Lisbon Strategy relating to the creation of more jobs, social cohesion and sustainable development.
The fact that a large number of our fellow citizens are socially excluded because they belong to the Roma community threatens our ability to achieve these goals.
Combating the social exclusion of the Roma in the name of fundamental rights, social cohesion and the social and economic development of the EU is a task for all of us.
The Commission wishes to thank Parliament for its support and efforts in this connection.
Â Â  . Mr President, Roma people living inside and outside the boundaries of the EU have been exposed to daily discrimination for centuries.
Pervasive anti-Roma sentiment in Europe and daily discrimination thwart our full and equal participation in the social and economic life of Europe, and of the countries we deem our homeland.
Several international organisations have launched programmes within the last few years with the aim to reduce anti-Roma discrimination and to help the Romasâ full social integration.
However, there has not been a standard European guideline or answer to these pressing issues.
The European Parliamentâs five-party motion for a resolution and Commissioner Vladimir Spidlaâs current standpoint on the subject establish milestones in this regard.
This resolution witnesses various political forces united in mutual commitment to jointly combat the prevailing anti-Roma sentiment and structured discrimination, it urges equal opportunities in the fields of work, education, housing, healthcare and participation in political life.
Following EU accession, social discrimination against the Roma continues in the new Member States, even as it does in the existing ones.
This alone confirms that the EU institutions need to continue their roles of constant monitoring and examination of human rights.
The forceful manifestation of Roma rights in Europe must mean that the Copenhagen political criteria are uniformly implemented in the existing and the new Member States and also in the Candidate Countries.
One of the most pressing issues facing the disadvantaged Roma minority is finding employment.
Reintegration of the Roma workforce is of great importance, and short-term, introductory measures must be taken in order to expedite Roma employment.
Fifteen percent of the recently increased EU population is affected by poverty, and 9% live in long-term and extreme privation.
These indicators reveal a much worse situation in the case of the new Member States.
It is also apparent that there is a significant number of Romas among people living in long-term extreme poverty and the rate of unemployment in the Roma population often hits or even exceeds 80%.
Achieving the strategic goals of Lisbon would undoubtedly have a positive influence on the life of Romas and conscious, determined political integration would definitely promote the success of the Lisbon strategy as well.
The Lisbon strategy will not attain its goals unless definite steps are taken and real effort is made to advance Roma integration into mainstream society.
The European Commissionâs stronger and stronger political commitment must manifest itself in real action guided by professionalism, and also in the establishment of a coherent minority protection system, which promotes, in every aspect, the integration of the European Roma population.
The European Parliament must act as a minority-oriented institution, and along with civil organisations and the governing bodies of the Member States, it must work conjointly with the Commission as its primary ally.
We hope that the EP resolution on the situation of the Roma people in Europe will serve as a professional basis for the European Commission and also for national governments taking measures in this regard.
Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues from all five parties and our advisers and civil organisations for taking an active part in drafting this resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the Roma have been present on European soil for many centuries, since they arrived in Greece in the fourth century.
Although no census of this population has been made, their number is estimated at around eight million scattered throughout Europe.
The Roma are victims of discrimination, marginalisation and segregation in all fields of public and private life, including access to the civil service, education, employment, health services and housing, not to mention when crossing borders and in access to asylum procedures.
That discrimination is no longer a problem for the Roma alone, but is of concern to all Europeans, and we must show solidarity to improve their living conditions.
We must of course strongly condemn all discrimination to which the Roma are subject, but we must also allow them access to decent housing, education, medical services and social protection.
We really must do everything possible to see that they are not forced to leave their countries because of the deplorable living conditions they have to endure there, which may go as far as persecution.
Europe must recognise the Roma minority as such so that it can give them the means to fight against all forms of discrimination.
That is why we are asking the Commission for an action plan that will make clear recommendations to the Member States and the candidate countries for a better economic integration, yes, but also social and political integration of all the Roma in Europe.
We have been talking about it for a long time and it is high time for action.
The situation has gone on for long enough.
The rights of the Roma must go beyond access to decent living conditions.
Europe is the cradle of multiculturalism.
The promotion of Roma culture will play an important part in the fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia.
They must be able to remain at home if they want to, they must not be chased along the roads; that is important, it is essential for all of us. It is our duty to act and to act quickly.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are about to witness a historic moment: for the first time in Europe, the European Parliament is in a position to pass such a resolution, and we shall cast our votes tomorrow.
The European Union, the European Parliament and every other body that controls, passes and amends regulations often criticises human rights outside the EUâs borders.
On the other hand, it is a historic moment, because this is the first document that criticises human rights within the EU, with regard to Romas.
This type of political mood, developing in Parliament for the first time in its history, is significant because discrimination against the Roma within the EU no longer needs to be a taboo subject.
Today, the disability index is 60% on average in the twenty-five Member States.
This means that on average, 60% of children who are declared mentally disabled are Roma.
We have not only forfeited the childâs chance of further education, but also put him or her in a situation that he or she will never be able to get out of, and thus we practically seal the childâs fate at age seven.
Housing problems, dislodgement, compulsory sterilisation, segregated labour rooms, and numerous other means of discriminatory cases that even the resolution lists in various paragraphs, are not at all surprising within the EU and I deliberately do not mention specific countries here.
Promoting political participation is another important role of the Union, the deficiency of which is dealt with significantly in some paragraphs.
Today, Roma population in the EU is approximately 7-8 million with only two representatives here in Parliament based on our ethnic origin.
I am very proud of my country, as both of us come from Hungary.
However, there are no other Roma political representatives from any other country in the Commission, or in any other EU institution.
This participation gap must be closed, not only in the EU, which is mainly our task, but also on the level of national governments, so that in addition to EU directives and guidelines that define the strategic policies of individual countries in this matter, the national governments should also feel that this responsibility is shared by every part of society in all of Europe.
It is not up to the Roma to solve this issue, since it is not they who consider that their children are disabled; it is not Roma women who want to have their ovaries cut out.
According to public opinion polls, it is in Europe where Romas feel most European.
This statement is not at all surprising, as Roma people are no longer able to believe their own government in any country, especially in Central Eastern Europe.
Term after term, different political parties keep replacing each other, but none of the governing political parties have been able to provide a solution to this problem and eliminate discrimination, for instance.
The only hope of the Romas lies in the European Union and European Parliament, where we all sit, trying to pass a resolution with tomorrowâs vote.
I trust that our decision regarding the situation of the Roma will set a real standard for human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, with the enlargement of the European Union, the number of Roma citizens has increased from 7Â million to 9Â million.
Since enlargement is an ongoing process, in future the EU will host up to 12 or 15 million Roma.
For thousands of years the Roma have been living in diaspora, but being united in the EU they become our fellow citizens.
The European Union means an end to years of war and the beginning of cooperation.
But how can we cooperate when people are excluded?
Mostly, the Roma issue is connected with unemployment and a lack of education, healthcare and housing.
However, the core issue is racism against Roma, more specifically anti-Gypsyism or Roma-phobia.
Can we accept a situation where millions of our fellow citizens lack basic human rights and suffer from police harassment, where thousands of school children remain illiterate and the unemployment rate exceeds 70%, where attempts are made at ethnic cleansing by poisoning people and trafficking in women and children, including in western EU countries, which, contrary to the 1951 Geneva Convention on refugees, also expel Roma refugees?
The Roma also face a lack of political participation, as a result of which there are not enough Roma representatives to draw attention to their issues.
Todayâs practice is not only a human tragedy: the Roma have been turned into a political tool.
What happened to the millions of dollars and euros donated by the US and the EU to Eastern European countries for Roma projects?
Structures set up for the purpose of helping the cause of the Roma often use this cause as a pretext.
In reality most of the money is spent on salaries, trips and on buying citizens, administrators and politicians.
This process is defined as corruption, but actually it is manipulation.
There are people in this world who do not want a dynamic Europe; they practice a policy of divide and rule by maintaining poverty and establishing control over Eastern European countries.
The Roma, Europeâs largest and most vulnerable minority, are, against their will, victims and participants in this global game.
It is therefore also necessary from a purely political point of view to reinforce the Roma population.
Their political participation in elections is important.
We have to target Roma as voters and as candidates at all political levels.
The Roma-to-Roma approach, as developed by the OSCE, is another effective way of consolidating the Romaâs position.
All European organisations should start hiring Roma for Roma and non-Roma related jobs â I have a Roma assistant.
Anti-Gypsyism is a shame and a threat to the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst we are discussing an extremely important resolution, which will be put to the vote tomorrow, news arrived a few hours ago that, yesterday, in the province of Naples, a cabin in a Roma camp caught fire, resulting in the death of a young boy and the discovery of his father and another young boy in a serious condition.
A delegation of Roma from several Italian cities â who have been here for two days to meet Members and increase awareness among them â told me the news as soon as they heard it: they were saddened but stated that, unfortunately, such events continue to occur.
Where do they occur?
In Italy, in the heart of Old Europe, where these people â the majority of whom have not been Travellers for some time â are concentrated in camps without water, electricity or services.
One of them said today, âThe first time I ever slept in a container was when I arrived in Italy; I had a house where I came from.â
The rights of the European Union end at the edges of the Travellersâ camps, and the Italian Government continues to rid itself â that is the term to use â of the Roma population through collective expulsions.
In such a situation it is impossible to educate the children and to make them attend school.
There are young people 20 years old who were born in Italy and who do not have an Italian identity card.
Recently, other children born in Italy have been considered to have a Yugoslav nationality, without knowing which one, as it no longer even exists.
Many Roma citizens residing in my country have an identity card â when they do have one â that bears the address of the Travellersâ camp and, in parentheses, âRoma Campâ.
It is obvious that they will not succeed in finding work and that they will be increasingly discriminated against, when they are in that situation.
I will conclude by saying that tomorrowâs vote is extremely important, but that it will be all the more so if it is put into practice, particularly by the European Commission.
Let us not forget that the commissioner who should be attending to this issue is an Italian, MrÂ Frattini, although in my view he is very much like the monkey that used to say âSee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.â
Â Â  Mr President, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party(PSI) in support of the legitimate demands of so many Roma whom I have had the good fortune to meet in my years of social and political engagement.
The hope of the socialist members of the new PSI is that 8 April, the date scheduled as International Roma Day, will be not only a time of celebration, but above all an opportunity to increase public awareness of the problems currently faced by the largest ethnic minority in Europe.
I should like to point out just one aspect that, in our opinion, is particularly important: in spite of the commitments undertaken by the Commission, including those of recent times, we must nevertheless note that in some Member States and candidate countries young Roma are often segregated in schools for the mentally disabled or sent to classes for children with learning difficulties.
This obviously increases their sense of unease and social marginalisation.
On the contrary, provision must be made for full access to the ordinary education system, since schools are a prime means of promoting full social integration.
The current situation is an unjustified hiatus totally at odds with those principles of equality, tolerance and respect that lie at the heart of the fellow feeling fostered by the EU.
Everyone, within their own area of expertise, must endeavour to turn words into deeds.
Â Â  The Roma issue belongs among the most complicated social and political issues within the space of the European Union.
The implementation of various concepts has failed to bring a successful solution to the so-called Roma problem.
All the attempts to address it as a social problem ran aground due to cultural differences.
The efforts to integrate the Roma community often ended up in the attempts at its assimilation, which also failed.
Because of its complexity, the Roma issue is clearly at the intersection of social, ethnic and/or minority problems.
No doubt, the problem is not equally severe in all the countries.
Thus, there are no Roma in the Baltic countries, but in the southern part of the European Union and in the new Member States, the problem quite often exceeds the capacity of a single country to tackle it.
It is apparent that in many countries the transformation to market economy has not created a win-win situation for the Roma.
A substantial proportion of this minority have joined the ranks of those who did not manage and found it impossible to adjust to the new circumstances.
Their unfavourable situation, extreme poverty and high unemployment cannot be accounted for by racial discrimination alone.
The problem is very often much broader.
It begins with the lack of education.
Clearly the worst is the situation of those who live in remote localities, segregated settlements, often without access to school, electricity or running water, and in the regions with very high unemployment.
Slovakia was mentioned a few months ago in connection with the Roma â alleged forced sterilisations of Roma women.
I want to repeat what our Deputy Prime Minister said before the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities â that a thorough police investigation proved that these forced and unlawful acts did not occur.
At the same time, however, it also revealed that the legislation in this field is outdated and lacks clarity.
Concluding, I would like to express my support for the resolution since there are a number of myths about the Roma and their situation, and perhaps even more prejudices, but a lack of real understanding.
I am convinced that the Roma problem transcends the boundaries of individual states and that it must be addressed as a European problem, just as Commissioner Å pidla put it.
It is truly necessary to make use of the best experience of individual countries and to channel structural funds to addressing the problem with the participation of Roma themselves â this is really the key point in this regard.
I believe that this resolution is an appropriate and necessary step in that direction.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I take great pride in the fact that there are many Members in my group who are very committed to promoting the cause of the Roma and to following the latest developments in this field.
I am also very glad that we have plenty of like-minded friends in the other groups, which makes it possible for us, tomorrow, to join together in writing a new chapter in the history of their integration.
What prompted me to press for us to discuss this issue now was a visit I made, as part of a delegation from this House, to Novi Sad, where, in the course of our investigations into the situation of the Hungarian minority, we saw, on the edge of the city, a district that was home to Roma who had been driven out of Kosovo, and where conditions defied description.
It is an unfortunate fact that, in all our past conflicts, the Roma were often the first victims.
Even in the absence of such conflicts, though, they are in a far from satisfactory position, and that not just in the new Member States â where they are present in greater numbers â but also in many of the old ones.
If we want to point the finger at other countries and give them advice on how to treat their minorities, then it is vitally important that we in Europe treat our own minorities accordingly â particularly the Roma, who are the largest of them â by giving them the opportunity to integrate and break the terrible vicious circle that sees many of them less well-educated, sometimes forced into segregated schools, with this lack of education meaning that they have less chance of getting a job and that their earning capacity is reduced.
In turn, lower incomes mean more health problems, and so the vicious circle goes on.
Together, we have to break it.
Some time ago, I proposed the appointment of a Commissioner with specific responsibility for minority issues and for the Romaâs problems in particular.
Although nothing has been done about this, I am confident that the Roma issue is safe in Commissioner Å pidlaâs hands.
I would follow Mrs Roure in asking him to include, in the Commission communication for which we are calling, not only a description of how things are, but also of how they could be, of what improvements might be made even without much in the way of power at European level.
You very rightly said, Commissioner, that this is a European problem and that we have to find a European answer to it, not only at European level, but also, of course, in the nation states.
If our cooperation in this House helps us, tomorrow and by way of this resolution, to give some impetus to the process of finding one, we will have taken an important step.
It is your help, Commissioner, and that of the Commission, that will enable us to achieve a real and perceptible improvement over the next 10Â years in the integration of the Roma and Sinti in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Å pidla, ladies and gentlemen, to date, unfortunately, we have paid too little attention to the tragedy of Europeâs Roma, Sinti and other tribes.
It was at one time possible for people to move freely around Europe, with a lifestyle and culture of their own free choosing.
The 20thÂ century, alas, was marked by the attempted wholesale extermination of certain peoples.
During the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia there were two concentration camps for Roma, one at Lety in Southern Bohemia, and the other at Hodonin, near Kunstat in Moravia.
Considered in terms of human rights, politics, morality and simple humanity, a pig farm strikes us as an absolutely unworthy occupant, for the past 40Â years, of the site of the former concentration camp at Lety.
A place where many thousands of people, many of them children, suffered, and where hundreds of them died, must no longer be allowed to be the scene of such degradation.
Of the approximately 6Â 000 Roma and Sinti who lived in the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in 1942, only some 600 returned home in 1945 from the concentration and extermination camps. That amounts to one tenth of them.
It is because this is now no longer merely a problem for the Czech authorities, but rather a problem for Europe, that we are calling for this piggery to be relocated and for a memorial worthy of the victims of Nazism to be erected on the site of the former concentration camp.
This was the theme of an exhibition we mounted last week in this House.
I have documentation on the subject with me now.
I would ask you to back this call, and thank all the groups in this House for their cooperation.
Â Â  Mr President, I ask for your patience because I am about to say something at odds with what has been said.
Like every ethnocultural minority in the Union â whether native minorities, such as the Sardinians, Corsicans, Basques or Gaels, or legal immigrants â the Roma ethnic group also deserves every consideration.
Precisely like the communities mentioned, however, the Roma community must also be subject to the rules of social coexistence and of mutual respect for the social order.
I do not know, at least from personal experience, whether or not and in what way Gypsies are integrated in Romania and Bulgaria.
They are in my country, however, where the police cannot enter Travellersâ camps, where the health authorities cannot give treatment or carry out inspections, and where it is impossible to tackle non-attendance at school, conduct a census of the residents, check childrenâs living conditions and the legitimacy of parental authority, or supervise respect forgender differences and human rights, and I could go on for hours.
The Commission wants measures to provide jobs for the Roma community.
These and other intolerable privileges are supported by five motions for resolutions tabled by all the groups, from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to the extreme left.
With the certainty of representing millions of European Union citizens at least in this matter, we reject both the Commissionâs declaration and the motions for resolutions, which are idiotic, stuffed full of rhetoric and racist towards the people of Europe.
You Members who tabled these proposals should explain to the people why you demand that they fulfil duties and only secondarily let them enjoy rights.
You should explain to them why you do not give them priority for homes or jobs or grant them impunity.
Owing to the taxes levied on the pockets of properly registered citizens, we are called upon here to represent first the interests and feelings of these European citizens and then, and only then, to pontificate on imaginary acts of discrimination.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the pressing issues on the EP agenda this week has been the question of basic human rights, more specifically the situation of the Roma minority in Europe.
I think the question of the Roma minority reaches well beyond constitutional state borders and their situation must be resolved at a European level.
Yesterday afternoon a forum was convened, the European Parliament Roma Forum, attended by Roma people who are regularly at a disadvantage and face discrimination, who live locked behind barbed wire, or have no water, gas or electricity in their homes and who are not able to have their children educated.
Many members of the European Parliament and some representatives of other authorities, who believe that this situation of continual discrimination must be resolved with joint effort, participated in this extraordinary European Roma Forum.
We decided to establish a European monitoring and follow-up system on discrimination and also to introduce a database which contains instances of prejudice against the Roma.
We would like to ask for the Commissionerâs help in setting up such a discrimination monitoring system so that this forum can influence public opinion accordingly.
We think that the EU, civil organisations, private persons and representatives have made a great deal of effort, but very often a lot of these efforts have not been coordinated.
It is very important that the Commissioner and Parliament coordinate these different types of effort, which are not necessarily in parallel, in order to act more efficiently and effectively, and in order to provide some form of human rights protection for Europeâs largest minority in a more efficient way.
Â Â  Mr President, I am proud today to be sitting in the same Chamber as Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka and Mrs MohÃ¡csi, although not so proud that so few Members of this House or staff of the institutions belong to an ethnic minority.
This is brought into sharp relief in this debate on the Roma.
We have a situation where this group will certainly be the biggest minority after the next enlargement.
There is consensus â apart from with the last speaker but one perhaps â that something must be done.
So what must be done?
Mrs Bauer talked about the deep complexity of this problem.
The fact is that we in this House are already able to point to those things that we can do, but that Member States will not do.
For example, there is the race equality directive.
I have seen cases of Roma people bringing employment discrimination cases in their own countries, but there are so few as to make this meaningless.
We have in this House legislation already on the table that is not being implemented by Member States. It is certainly not being implemented in the new Member States.
With Mr Agnoletto this morning, I met members of the Roma community from Italy.
As is the case of my own country, the United Kingdom, the diaspora of the Roma in so-called Old Europe are suffering as much if not more than in the new countries, because they are suffering the extra degradation of being immigrants and Roma.
We must address both issues.
This is a unified struggle and â apart from one speaker with whom I and many of us absolutely disagree â I want to place on record that the problem is so complex that there should be an all-party move on this resolution, signed and supported by all parties, that we cannot live in a European Union where children from one ethnic minority are segregated in school, sent to school with people who supposedly have mental disabilities.
That is not the European Union I want to live in and we have the instruments in this House to ensure that Member States start to act.
I look forward to hearing whether the Commissioner will take urgent action.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, debates and speeches on the Roma, commonly known as gypsies in Polish, are something I have grown accustomed to since my election to the European Parliament.
Who are the Roma, and what do we mean by this term?
Are they an ethnic group, as stated in the motion for a resolution, or a stateless nation?
If we agree that they are an ethnic group, consisting of citizens of all the EU Member States, then the solution to these problems is relatively straightforward.
After all, each Member State has to ensure that its citizens enjoy the same rights and are treated equally, without being subjected to discrimination or xenophobia.
We should bear in mind, however, that as well as rights, citizens also have certain duties, towards both the country they live in and the other people who live there.
If we understand the Roma to be a stateless nation, then things start to look a great deal worse, if not hopeless.
We must ask ourselves who is to defend this nation, as the answer to this question would be a starting point from which we could find a solution to the problems.
The debate on this issue has recently become more heated because two new countries, Romania and Bulgaria, are in the process of joining the European Union.
Romania is generally considered to be the Romaâs main homeland, although they originally come from the distant land of India.
For over 600Â years, the Roma have either not wanted to or not been able to assimilate into society in the countries in which they live.
Feelings of mutual animosity have become more pronounced during this time, rather than less so.
Even though many different measures have been taken to narrow the gap in development, education and standard of living that exists between the Roma and the rest of the population, this gap is in fact widening.
Â Â  . In my opinion, the debate we have just held was an exceptionally wide-ranging one.
It covered such issues as the status of the Roma as an ethnic group, discrimination against this group and the social and political position of the Roma from a number of angles.
I believe that we heard a very broad spectrum of opinions, or rather points of view, and that this will provide us with a sound basis for further considerations on the resolution tabled by this House.
The issues raised during the debate highlight the importance and urgency of measures to promote the social inclusion of the Roma at European, national and regional level.
The backing of Parliament â and I regard your initiative as extremely important â will help us to mobilise all stakeholders and to drum up the necessary political will.
The fact that members of the Roma community are present in this Chamber as MEPs is of particular benefit, as this provides us with a starting point of sorts for a European debate on the real lives and circumstances of Roma communities.
The Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that all the relevant policies and programmes are conducted in a coherent and effective manner in order to promote inclusion of the Roma and of other disadvantaged groups.
We must carry out a more in-depth analysis of both the real needs of the various groups and the areas where action at European level can provide added value.
In my opinion, it would be helpful for the Commission to be given advice on such matters by a group of leading figures and experts, and I will give some thought to the best way in which such a group could be set up.
I will also suggest to PresidentÂ Barroso that a debate on the situation of the Roma should be held at one of the forthcoming meetings of the Group of Commissioners on fundamental rights, non-discrimination and equal opportunities.
2007 will be declared the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
A number of measures will be implemented by the Commission, and the Roma issue will obviously also be given its due weight.
Todayâs debate has given rise to a number of historical reflections and asides.
In my opinion, it would be fitting to remind ourselves that the history of the Roma in Europe has been one of persecution, and that this persecution has frequently been inconceivably cruel.
According to a decree issued by the Austrian Emperor LeopoldÂ I in the late 17th century â and I paraphrase â any Roma who crossed the boundaries of a village should be killed, and this also meant children.
Punishment awaited anyone who failed to take such drastic action.
Europeâs history is a very cruel one in this respect.
One of the speakers said that the European Union is the Romaâs only hope.
I do not believe that I would have used the word âonlyâ myself, as there are unquestionably a great many other organisations and political endeavours.
Nevertheless, we can be proud of the fact that the European UnionÂ has set an example in the field of equal opportunities and human rights, in spite of all our imperfections and inconsistency, and in spite of all the work we still have ahead of us.
Â Â  Â I have received five motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11Â a.m.
Â Â  Â The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, MrÂ Roszkowski and I requested that Parliament should commemorate and pay tribute to the officers that were brutally and deliberately murdered in Katyn in AprilÂ 1940 in an act of terrorism by the Soviet NKVD, the Peopleâs Commissariat for Internal Affairs.
We received an answer from the President of Parliament saying that we must never forget dates and tragedies of this kind that are part of our history, and I am much obliged to him for this.
At the same time, however, he informed us that the Bureau had decided not to hold a minuteâs silence for the victims of this crime, and I find this most regrettable.
Before I make a proposal to the House, I should therefore like to use ten seconds of my speaking time to pay tribute to the officers who died in Katyn and to their families.
Other Members may wish to join me in observing this silence.
Mr President, I propose that Parliament proclaim 5 March the day of the fight against all kinds of totalitarianism.
Stalinâs gang took this barbaric genocide decision on 5 March 1940.
Â Â  Mr President, most people know that 1 May is International Workersâ Day, but I wonder how many people know that tomorrow, 28 April, is International Workersâ Memorial Day?
That is the day we remember those who have been killed in the workplace or by illnesses related to their work.
Health and safety at work has of course improved over the last few years in the European Union, partly due to the legislation we have adopted ourselves.
However, the ILO estimates that there is still one death globally every 15 seconds at work, that is 6Â 000 people dying every day, and it is said that work kills more people than war.

By remembering those who have died, we can do more to prevent accidents at work.
A local campaign in my constituency, organised by Herbert Styles, tried to persuade governments to do more by formally recognising International Workersâ Memorial Day.
That is why I am asking colleagues and our President, whose own country, Spain, recognises International Workersâ Memorial Day, to try to have that day formally recognised, so that we think about accidents at work.
Â Â  Mr President, two days ago a four-year-old girl was killed in my constituency after being hit by a car in front of her mother.
The enormity of the grief that such a catastrophic event can bring to a family is difficult to comprehend and impossible to describe.
Unfortunately, such tragic occurrences are happening daily and in great numbers in one part or another of our Union.
Road traffic accidents are in fact the commonest cause of death of children in Europe today.
This is a shameful and totally unacceptable statistic for a civilised society such as ours.
The slaughtering of our children on the roads must be stopped.
Mr President, can I call upon you to personally contact all the European Heads of State and use your persuasive powers to impose upon them the urgent need to involve themselves in a serious, continuous and effective crusade to improve road safety, especially for children?
I also suggest that efforts be made to establish a widely publicised blacklist of shame, in which the 25 Member States are ranked according to the number of children killed on the roads per head of population each year.
Â Â  Mr President, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of the South Caucasus, I very much hope that the European Parliament commemorates the 90th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.
They represent ninety years that have seen the Armenian people living haunted by the past and awaiting recognition of this genocide: recognition by the world as witness, as our European Parliament did in 1987, and recognition by the perpetrators as culprits.
This recognition is a long time coming, as we are dealing with the realm of pure emotions and extreme sensitivity.
I remain convinced, however, that this moment will come, and it is the responsibility of the Union to encourage it.
In the framework of accession negotiations with Turkey, the Union must help the Turkish people and authorities to begin their memorial work, as Germany did in seeking forgiveness from the Jewish people.
We must prevail upon Turkish society to recognise the Armenian genocide of 1919.
I am hopeful, particularly today thanks to the agreement by the Armenian authorities to participate in an intergovernmental committee with Turkey on the genocide.
I am truly convinced that Armenians and Turks will be able to find the road to reconciliation so that they may live together as good neighbours.
Â Â  Mr President, I should simply like to draw the attention of the House to a very serious matter: 40 Kurdish citizens have reached their 30th day on hunger strike because they are appealing to be allowed to stay in Belgium, on the grounds of a request for political asylum.
Some of these people are in an extremely serious condition.
I have sent an open letter to the Ministry of the Interior asking it to provide subsidiary protection which, partly through the third European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights of 15 December 1980, could allow these people to remain in Belgium for the time being, even without political asylum.
A delegation from Parliament will be going to the tomorrow at 9.30 to show their solidarity with these 40 Kurds who are risking their lives.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, even when my home country, Poland, was under Communist rule, encouraging children to drink was frowned upon.
Those parents who gave alcohol to their underage children, either for the sake of a bit of peace and quiet or because they were oblivious of the consequences, came in for much criticism.
Most of the families involved were socially disadvantaged, and unaware of the harm caused by alcohol and other addictive substances.
The end result of addiction will always be a cycle of destruction and self-destruction that causes enormous physical and mental suffering.
This is true at any age, but particularly in the case of young people.
I therefore find it reprehensible and utterly disgusting that companies are producing various alcoholic drinks targeted at children, such as âalcopopsâ that look like orangeade, or powdered alcohol in sachets.
During one of the meetings of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we heard that the Commission tolerates such products in its role as guardian of the free market.
Yet the fact that our markets have been liberalised cannot be taken to mean that companies are free to encourage children or young people to get drunk.
We are therefore calling on the EU institutions, , to comply with EU legislation, and for strict penalties to be imposed on anyone who breaks the rules on underage drinking, or who breaches the ban on producing ingenious alcoholic drinks that are targeted at children and young people and intended to get them addicted to alcohol.
Â Â  Mr President, 21 April saw an important vote held in the Committee on Budgets. It had to do with the EURÂ 90 million calculated at the time to be available to Parliament from the EU Budget.
An oral amendment was moved to the effect that, from this amount, EURÂ 60 million should be tucked away in the reserves.
Being a member of the Committee, and entitled to vote in it, I spoke to oppose this oral amendment.
In line with Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure, it ought then not to have been voted on, but that was something that MrÂ Lewandowski, who was in the chair, chose to disregard.
I now call on you to use your powers as President to get this vote reversed and to stop the report on the subject reaching the plenary.
A similar written request has already been sent to the Bureau.
Â Â  Mr President, for the next few weeks, throughout Europe the attention of the media and also of various conferences will focus on what experience has been gained from the first year of the EUâs historic enlargement.
For the 100 million citizens of the ten new Member States, May 1 is not only associated with Labour Day, but also marks our return to and reuniting with Europe, and this is what we will celebrate in my home country, Hungary, on that day.
We came with enormous expectations, and I admit, the day we gained full membership rights to the EU was anticipated with a bit of scepticism.
This one-minute speech does not allow for any deliberation on what experience was gained during the first year following the enlargement.
On behalf of the 106 new representatives, however, I would like to take this festive moment to thank the long-standing members for their friendship, helpfulness, tolerance and solidarity.
Your help has greatly encouraged us to take an active and responsible part in our united work today in the interest of our countries, parties and in the interest of every citizen of the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my concern at the kidnap in the Republic of Colombia of a European Union citizen, of Spanish nationality, Carlos Ayala Saavedra, an official of the Commissionâs delegation in BogotÃ¡.
We are not aware of the circumstances of his disappearance but it would appear that he has been kidnapped, and since we are talking about an official from one of our institutions, I believe it would be appropriate for Parliament to demonstrate its solidarity in some way, both with the citizen in question and his family and with our sister institution, the European Commission.
Â Â  Mr President, I must protest most strongly at the alarming censorship carried out by the European Parliament in preventing the screening of the film in the Press Room on 20 April.
I consider this to be an unacceptable act.
The very same film has, for months and months, been the subject of censorship enforced by means of terror by Islamic fundamentalists, to whom we owe the assassination of the film director, Theo van Gogh.
I call on the President of the European Parliament to lift this ban, which does no credit to our Parliament and which conflicts with the principle of freedom of expression.
In particular, it conflicts with the principle of freedom of artistic expression, upon which, I believe, our coexistence and the legal order of the European Union are founded.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as representatives of the new EU Member States, we have been somewhat disturbed by the latest news on the Luxembourg Presidencyâs proposals concerning the European Unionâs budget for 2007-2013.
These proposals will place the new Member States, in particular the Czech Republic and Hungary, but also my country, Poland, at a disadvantage.
This is mainly a result of proposals to reduce the share of GDP paid into the EU budget by the Member States and to lower the aid ceiling to below 4% of GDP, which would be particularly unfair.
I should like to make it very clear that this would amount to nothing less than unilateral amendments to the treaties on accession concluded with Poland and the other new Member States.
Is this all that remains of the much-vaunted European solidarity we heard about before the accession referendums in our countries?
Is this the best example we can set of European cohesion?
These are the questions you should be asking yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, and the questions to which all of us in this House should provide an answer that is both honest and sincere.
Â Â  Dear colleagues, I still would like to come back to the history of the Romany Gypsies.
The present and its problems always have a connection to the past that we need to know.
In particular, when it is about human tragedies, which followed the greatest Jewish tragedy, that are, however, forgotten, since they are the tragedies of smaller nations, such as the genocide of the Romany or Chechen-Ingush people carried out during the Second World War, and the Chechen genocide last year was acknowledged by the European Parliament.
A week ago I visited a small exhibition in our Parliament that moved me.
It seems this has already been discussed here.
That was the former Romany concentration camp, Lety, in the present Czech Republic, at those times under Nazi occupation.
Few exhibits, but they cannot leave one untouched.
For example, that picture which is here â tens of small, lovely and merry children, obviously, black-haired and black-eyed, who are most probably condemned to death.
And in the former camp buildings there is neither a museum nor a memorial place to respect the sufferings, but a piggery.
Nobody would dare to treat the barracks of Auschwitz in this way; therefore, here we have unequal opportunities as well, even if we talk differently.
I ask my colleagues from the Czech Republic to do their best to change the present situation at Lety.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, something is not quite right.
How can it be possible?
I hear from Mr Agnoletto that a minority of Kurds are here in serious difficulties and are claiming asylum in Belgium.
Is it not true, however, that the Kurds, like the surviving Armenians â if there are still any of them left â are a Turkish minority?
If they are being persecuted, how can the Union have begun Turkeyâs accession process, in violation of the foundations of the Treaties?
I call upon the Commission and the President to be vigilant and to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey.
Â Â  Mr President, I am aware that, when elections take place in various parts of the world, the European Union and our Parliament send observers to see that they are fair.
I should like to invite the President of Parliament to ask the European Commission and the Council whether they do not see fit to send observers to the forthcoming elections of the Italian Parliament, which will be held in May 2006, because we are the first who should observe the rules of democracy.
You are aware that the last elections held three weeks ago in Italy were, according to many Italian courts, marred by irregularities and fraud in the preparation of electoral lists.
I should not like to see that repeated and I should very much welcome a response, bearing in mind that the fraud was perpetrated to the detriment of the current Italian Government.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to raise an urgent matter concerning the operations of a Turkish-owned bank in the Netherlands known as Finansbank.
It has facilitated the laundering of up to EURÂ 30Â million from a Turkish construction company located in the Republic of Ireland.
This money belonged to the 800 or so Turkish workers working for this company in Ireland.
The money was transferred without the knowledge of the workers concerned.
It was subsequently transferred by Finansbank to another company called Ryder Investments.
As far as I am concerned this is money laundering: the illegal transfer of money not belonging to Gama to another bank in the Netherlands and subsequently to another bank.
We have to investigate the operations of Finansbank, we have to investigate the operations of Gama, and we have to tell the Turkish authorities that companies incorporated in Turkey must comply with European law when they operate in the European Union.
I am in favour of the Turkish Republic joining the European Union, but this kind of activity will undermine its efforts to do so.
It is also important to recognise that Gama is currently in the process of seeking to dismiss the workers who blew the whistle on this scam.
Gama is, in my view, in breach of the anti-discrimination directives.
It is also in breach of the directives that oblige the company to inform the workers of its intentions.
I would appreciate it if the President would convey my comments to the Commission President.
I am happy that Commissioner Å pidla is in the Chamber at the moment and I hope he has taken note of my remarks because they are serious: they are not made lightly.
These investigations have to be carried out.
Â Â  Â That concludes the one-minute speeches.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0085/2005) by MrÂ Cabrnoch on modernising social protection and developing good quality health care [2004/2189(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to present Parliamentâs motion for a resolution on the Commission report on modernising social protection and developing high-quality health care and long-term care.
The Commission presented this report to the European Council, Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee last spring.
Its main aim was to identify the principle challenges to be overcome by all the health care systems in all the Member States, and to propose joint objectives that could be used as guidelines by the Member States when developing or, potentially, reforming these systems.
The open method of coordination is used in identifying common challenges, committing to joint objectives, exchanging views and experience and carrying out joint evaluations of the success of developments in care systems in the individual Member States.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which both discussed the Commission report, took a keen interest in it, as can be seen from the fact that over 100Â amendments to my motion for a resolution were tabled.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs discussed the motion for a resolution in late March and voted on all the amendments that had been tabled, and the motion we have before us today is the end result of that process.
In any event, only five amendments have so far been tabled, all of which propose changes that were tabled and rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I am firmly convinced that the House will vote in favour of my motion for a resolution.
If I may, I should now like to make some brief comments on the issues that we discussed.
Problems relating to health and long-term care are of central interest to all the EU Member States, and a lively debate on the health care system and its future is taking place in every one of them.
Furthermore, I can state without hesitation that health care reforms are either underway or on the drawing board in each of the Member States.
Health care affects every member of the public, and that obviously also includes politicians.
The provision of high-quality health care that is accessible to everyone who needs it, irrespective of age, status or wealth, is in the public interest, and is therefore a task for politicians.
Something else that is in the public interest, and hence also a task for politicians, is maintaining a stable health care system, and by âstableâ I mean not only financially stable, but also stable in other respects, for example in terms of staffing, which is a key issue.
The Commission identifies three main challenges in its report, namely the ageing of the population, new technologies for preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic care and the growing expectations of a public that is increasingly aware of health care choices.
To these can be added the rising age of health care workers, the fact that these workers are leaving certain countries to work abroad, the increased movement of EU citizens between Member States and the growing levels of immigration from third countries into the EU.
The main objectives proposed by the Commission are high-quality care, accessibility to all and long-term financial sustainability, which would obviate the need for state funding from other budget headings.
When the Commission report was discussed in committee, consensus was reached on these challenges and on the joint objectives.
Another issue that was highlighted was the question of subsidiarity, the implication of which in the field of health and long-term care is that national governments are fully responsible for developing and reforming health care in the Member States.
We would also stress that prevention is the most effective way of improving public health.
The role of patients as clients of health care services is of great significance to Parliament, as patients have the right to decide freely on their health and the care they receive.
Following on from this, they also have the right to receive detailed and easy to understand information on health and illness, as well as on health care and its outcomes, possibilities, alternatives and risks.
New communications technologies represent both a major challenge and a significant opportunity, as information comes at a premium in the field of health care, and we will be able to achieve higher quality care and a better use of public funds if this information can be shared between individual patients and their doctors.
Something else we would highlight is the key role played by patients, as well as their right to decide and the responsibility they bear for such decisions.
Information is an essential requirement for decision-taking, as is cooperation with doctors, even though the latter will always have an advantage in terms of information.
This does not, however, give them the right to take decisions for patients.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that my report and the motion for a resolution I have tabled will be endorsed by the vast majority of Members.
Â Â  . Honourable Members, I should firstly like to thank MrÂ Cabrnoch and his colleagues for this report.
It contains a great many proposals and recommendations, and the Commission will pay due attention to all of them.
I was particularly glad to see that the report argues in favour of stepping up cooperation in order to improve health and long-term care for senior citizens in the Member States, and that it takes the open method of coordination as its basis.
At the end of this year, the Commission will adopt a communication setting out proposals aimed at rationalising and simplifying the open method of coordination in the field of social protection.
As noted in paragraphÂ 32 of the report, these proposals will cover health and long-term care, as well as social integration and pensions.
We regard health care as one of the key aspects of the strategies to be developed by the Member States over the next few years with a view to solving the problem of demographic ageing whilst maintaining a high level of social protection.
Your report has therefore come at a very opportune time, and will be of great help to us in drafting these proposals.
The same is true for the national reports on health and long-term care that we are in the process of receiving from the Member States.
A crucial part of our work schedule will be to identify opportunities for interaction with the current and future European public health strategies and with the relevant Community action programme.
Both CommissionerÂ Kyprianou and myself and our departments will continue to cooperate closely to this end.
At the same time, of course, we will not lose sight of the fact that the Member States bear the primary responsibility for health and long-term care, and that the European Unionâs job is to support political bodies with decision-making powers at national level.
Your report discusses a wide range of issues relating to social protection and public health, as well as those relating to the free movement of persons and services on the internal market.
All these fundamental issues must be addressed using the appropriate instruments, which include the legislative powers we hold with regard to the internal market and freedom of movement, as well as the action programme for public health and the open method of coordination.
The Commission will seek to ensure maximum coherence between these individual instruments, whilst at the same time continuing to promote an integrated understanding of health care in terms of efforts to provide appropriate and fair health care to all citizens, whether in their own countries or in other EU Member States.
Honourable Members, this is an extremely wide-ranging and thorough report, and I should merely like to comment on one of its paragraphs.
According to paragraphÂ 7, Parliament regrets that the Commission views the modernisation of social protection with regard to health care essentially in terms of the requirements of the Stability Pact.
In my opinion, this is not entirely accurate.
MrÂ Cabrnoch has already said that the threefold aim of accessibility, quality and long-term financial sustainability lies at the heart of all debates on modernisation.
This means that although long-term financial sustainability is of considerable importance, it is not the only guiding principle for all of our decisions.
As I said at the start of my speech, this report has come at a very opportune time, and the points covered in it are such that we will undoubtedly give consideration to them in our future work.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Cabrnoch on his report, which is a very good one.
Benchmarking, and the dissemination of the best practice resulting from it, is very much to be welcomed as an approach, particularly in the healthcare sector.
It is an approach codified and institutionalised by the open method of coordination incorporated into the Lisbon Strategy, a method which requires the participation of the Member States in line with the Commissionâs timetables.
The best-case scenario is that this makes the whole process more dynamic.
In the worst-case scenario, the result is an avalanche of data, with which the authorities concerned cannot cope.
It is unfortunate that we do not yet have the experiential data, collected over many years, that would enable us to carry out accurate assessments of this very complex area.
Their absence seems to be a fact of life, particularly in the healthcare sector.
If the people on whose work the system depends are to be won over to the idea of inner-European exchange in the health sector, I think the open method of coordination needs, in the first instance, to be introduced carefully and progressively.
Under no circumstances must data be collected in such massive quantities that the authorities would then be unable to process it.
The dynamics of the process as a whole would seem to make a mandatory timetable by far the most sensible option, although computerised data collection cannot be started everywhere at the same time.
In the health sector, I regard the cautious and progressive introduction of statistical returns, hand in hand with in-depth feedback from the personnel involved, as the right way ahead.
It must be possible, for the sake of efficiency and the long-term acceptance of the open method of coordination, to create an ideally efficient portfolio of data by doing away with the less important returns.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, at a time when the European social model is under discussion â and when some are indeed calling it into question â this House is looking at modernising social protection and developing good quality health care.
I wish to start by saying that I support, in full, the priorities set out by the Council, which will lead to access for all to good quality health care, provided in a context of long-term financial sustainability.
Although health and social protection policy continues to fall under the Member Statesâ competence, the EU has rightly taken a step forward by applying the open method of coordination in this area, thereby strengthening cooperation between national policies.
In this regard, the open method of coordination is undoubtedly the most effective instrument in the current circumstances, although we are aware that measures of this kind are mainly geared towards the citizens as health care consumers.
Unless there is a climate of confidence between the citizens and the health care services, none of this will be anything more than good intentions.
As in all relations between consumers and suppliers, a climate of confidence is essential, and this is especially true of the health care sector.
In some Member States, the citizensâ confidence in the services falls well short of what one would wish to see.
For the system to be able to work, it is crucial that the citizens have confidence in the services at their disposal, yet for this to become a reality, no information should be kept from the users of health care services.
It should be made absolutely clear that patientsâ rights are paramount and first and foremost among them is the right to information on their state of health, on the possibilities available to them in terms of health care and long-term care and on the level of quality of the care offered on the market by individual providers.
The prime objective, which is at the moment still a utopian dream, is to provide every European citizen unlimited access to good quality services, regardless of age, sex, nationality and financial status.
For this to happen, however, Member States must accept that reforms must be carried out to ensure the systemâs financial stability.
Accordingly, they will need to introduce the principle that the patient pays for certain health care expenses.
The Member States must face the fact that every service comes at a price, although with regard to payment by patients, the personâs economic situation must be taken into account, with the onus naturally falling on the State to help the poorest sections of society.
Member State governments have sovereignty in this area, but this initiative must be seen as an important step towards the construction of a social Europe.
I therefore welcome it wholeheartedly.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by congratulating the rapporteur on the balance of his report.
The development of high-quality health care inevitably entails rising costs, and if policy takes no account of this fact, we cannot help ending up with first and second-class medicine.
History shows us who gets less care under those circumstances.
We can expect to live longer, and, when I say it is fortunate that there are more and more older people, I mean that in the sense that major issues always bring with them new ideas and innovation, so it may well be that the EU of 25 or 27 will thereby be turned into a humane society founded upon solidarity.
It is for that reason that this report makes the specific point that particular care needs to be taken to maintain equity if the poorer members of society are to bear an ever-greater share of the cost of healthcare.
Within the EU â by which I now mean the EU of 27 â health provision varies from one extreme to another.
In terms of costs, this means that countriesâ expenditure on healthcare varies from 4% to 9% of their gross domestic product.
Of the new Member States, the poorest spend the least and also have the worst health provision.
That is a fact.
It does not, however, simply mean that spending more adds up to better performance.
That requires more efficient management and particular attention to the type of care and the demand for it if health provision and long-term care are to be funded in the long run.
This calls for a European benchmark and open coordination.
The last point I want to make about cost is that the United States spend nearly 14% of their gross domestic product on health, and make a poor job of sharing it out.
We cannot aim to do that, and nor should we.
We do, on the other hand, have to take account of the fact that, at present, medical knowledge doubles every five years.
Although that means more costs, everyone has the same entitlement to care, and that is something to which we have to give priority.
Hence the need not only for benchmarking, but also for solidarity.
There is no shortage of problems to deal with.
The new Member States are still combating corruption in many areas of their health systems.
It is where the lack of provision is most glaring that corruption is at its height and older people are poorest, and their poverty is increasing more than elsewhere.
Those, in essence, are the social challenges we face.
Believe me, older people are most afraid when they believe they will be inadequately cared for when ill or that it will no longer be possible to care for them.
It is in the new Member States, as a result of budgetary pressure, that public funding is least secure.
Although I have listed just a few problems, there are others that are becoming apparent; health workers are relocating from the new Member States to the old Fifteen, to the benefit of the healthcare systems there.
So let me repeat that this is a sensitive political issue, and improved coordination and cooperation are absolutely vital.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise the need to consider this report in a wider context, in association with the following events and facts.
Firstly, it has to be considered in the context of the pressure that the Lisbon process puts on health care and on the social insurance systems in order to turn them into services capable of being marketed throughout Europe.
Secondly, when considering it, we have to bear in mind the fact that the services directive will make health care subject to European competition rules and to the country of origin principle.
Thirdly, as is emphasised at various points in the report, one consequence of population change is that, in many Member States, healthcare systems are regarded as an intolerable burden on the national budget, and this has had a markedly detrimental effect on the working conditions of healthcare personnel.
The Commissionâs latest proposals give backing to this trend.
The report plays a crucial part in preparing for a fundamental choice between what has been proposed by the Commission and the Council on the one hand and by Parliament on the other.
The question at issue is whether health care and social protection systems should remain wholly within the sphere of services of general interest or whether they should be made subject to the competition rules of the internal market.
Parliamentâs response, in no uncertain terms, to this is that health care must continue to be considered as a service of general interest, and universal access for all â regardless of their purchasing power â must be guaranteed.
In this report, moreover, this House makes it quite clear that systems of financial solidarity must be neither abandoned nor reduced to empty shells.
I hope that the Commission will, in its future proposals, take on board the detailed amendments in this report, which constitute a clear and alternative response to the challenge we face.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, MrÂ Cabrnoch, on his report.
Although I believe that the key principles adopted by the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left are reflected in his motion for a resolution, I have tabled a number of amendments that emphasise our groupâs priorities.
Firstly, I am delighted that the rapporteurâs proposals stress that health care should be provided to EU citizens in accordance with the principle of solidarity.
The right to health is after all considered to be a fundamental right in all the EU Member States, and one that is conferred on the basis of solidarity.
My amendment was intended to ensure that this is in fact what happens.
Secondly, it is surely the case that as well as safeguarding the freedom of movement of workers, we should also safeguard their right to receive appropriate, high-quality and accessible health care in all EU Member States.
It is for this reason that I have tabled further amendments aimed at improving training for health care workers, in order to achieve a comparable level of training in all Member States.
I firmly believe that this training must be funded from the EU training budget, and that the Member States must not be left to deal with this matter on their own.
Thirdly, I welcome the rapporteurâs comments to the effect that the health care services should focus on prevention, and I believe that the Commission should encourage the Member States to step up all preventive measures, not only with regard to health care provision, but also with regard to working time and health at work.
Our aim should be not only to increase the flexibility and competitiveness of the workforce, but also to protect the health of workers.
Fourthly, I agree with the rapporteur when he says that although medical science offers new diagnostic and therapeutic options, health care systems must also be financially stable.
In my opinion, health care cannot be viewed only in accounting terms, and I would therefore find it regrettable if such an approach dominated our understanding of health care reform.
I would be unable to lend my support to such an approach.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the provision of guaranteed health care is one of the stateâs most important duties, and it derives from the basic rights of individuals.
Every country should be required to maintain and fund essential health care services.
The liberal approach, which consists of privatising services and imposing market conditions upon them by means of various pieces of legislation will not safeguard the provision of care in areas such as preventive medicine, mother and baby care, diseases of civilisation and geriatric and palliative care.
Even though these areas are all loss-making, they are essential and crucial for public health.
It is a well-known fact that investing in health means investing in people, as is the case with education.
As I only have a few minutesâ speaking time, I should like to focus on what we see as the most important points.
There needs to be a public health service, and this health service must continue to develop and remain accessible to all, both to those who can afford treatment and to those who cannot.
No ideal system has yet been found for either organising or funding health care services.
There are advantages and disadvantages inherent in every system, including both systems based on insurance contributions and what could be termed state-funded systems.
The best solution is therefore probably a mixed system.
At the same time, however, the social rights of health care workers and patients must be properly safeguarded.
State funding must be available for public hospitals, preventive medicine and all other loss-making areas.
A great many lofty sentiments have been expressed, particularly in EU legislation, on the subject of modernising social protection in order to develop and improve health care, yet they are often contradictory.
The sole result of this is to aggravate the situation with regard to social and health care, even though it is already difficult enough in many countries as a result of increasing costs, bloodthirsty capitalism and a failure to observe moral principles.
A good example of this is the contradictions that arise from the fact that the Member States have seemingly been placed in charge of organisation and funding, yet medical services have been included in the services directive.
If we wish to guarantee the provision of high-quality care, we cannot regard health as a productive sector of the economy, or health services as normal commercial services.
By way of example, one company expects to make as much as CHFÂ 13Â billion from sales of an anti-cancer drug after gaining permission to sell the drug in Europe.
I have sometimes heard it said in this House that a poor Europe cannot afford to provide long-term care, and that instead we should practice euthanasia, or in other words get rid of the problem by putting people to death.
This should not be what is meant by modernising social protection in order to develop and improve health care.
The only answer to an ageing population is to change our attitude to conceived life.
We should protect this life and do all we can, by which I also mean observing moral principles, in order to improve not only the quality, but also the functioning of health care services.
Furthermore, we will not improve health care services in any way whatsoever through extensive administrative machinery, corruption, bureaucracy and by publishing ever more regulations, reports, opinions, declarations and identical or similar lists.
This merely increases costs and wastes the time of both the authorities and the doctors and nurses, whose job is to help the sick.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, MrÂ Cabrnoch, the report reminds us that health care accounts for only 10% of an individualâs state of health. The remaining 90% is determined by many other factors, such as social situation, the lack of jobs and feelings of insecurity amongst those with no means of making a living.
Even though the Member States are responsible for public health care, I therefore believe that the European Union should draw up a set of minimum social standards.
This would guarantee a minimum of social protection in all Member States, whilst still allowing the richer countries to provide better welfare and health care systems.
In my opinion, the European Union should have the right to be informed of the minimum levels of social benefits in the individual Member States.
In Poland this figure currently stands at EURÂ 100, although our dream is to achieve EURÂ 250.
The EU should also be informed of the situation with regard to health care.
Polish doctors earn EURÂ 400 a month at present, and rely on bribes to supplement their income.
Â Â  Mr President, the right to health is a fundamental one, and it is the Member Statesâ responsibility to make it real for their citizens, who are absolutely entitled to choose their own healthcare provision and long-term care â anywhere in the EU, and irrespective of their own income.
It has to be said, though, that the accessibility and quality of health provision and care diverge to a considerable degree.
An EU action programme to help promote public health has been in place since 2003, and it provides a sound basis on which our Member States can step up their cooperation.
We need to arrive at common objectives, and specifically national strategies can then be devised to deal with the challenges of more mobile patients, rising costs for new treatments and â thank heaven â increased life expectancy.
Far too little, though â as the rapporteur has pointed out â is being invested in the preventive care that stops people becoming ill in the first place.
The healthcare sector has considerable potential for employment.
It is rightly seen as being likely to become more important in the future, not only in terms of the money that will be spent on it, but also of its potential for innovation.
I am thinking of such things as home care services, for which there is an ever-increasing demand, and which make it possible for old people and the sick to be cared for in familiar domestic surroundings, something that is psychologically important and plays an important part in helping people to live longer and more healthily.
Rising life expectancy gives people a chance to make a personal contribution to society, in the shape of their own experience, which is so vital to it.
There are many obstacles standing in the way of job creation in the health sector, and they will be difficult to overcome â one thinks, for example, of the high cost of social insurance in Germany, my home country.
The European Unionâs healthcare systems must be organised in such a way that the public can afford them and businesses can be freed from excessive costs and thereby encouraged to create jobs.
The rapporteur emphasises the need for preventive care, improved long-term treatment, and on the need to help patients by improving the much-needed exchange of information between Member States, and I agree with him in this.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.
In the year 2000, when the report on modernisation of the social protection systems was being debated, I myself was the rapporteur.
The first time that we debated the open coordination method, together with healthcare, pensions and other issues was when we were drawing up the relevant strategy.
The organisation and funding of health care are a national issue that, in certain countries, is dealt with at regional level, as it should be allowed to be in the future too.
The issue is that of whether there is added value for Europe in cooperation, and the answer is yes, because these are common challenges that we face.
You pointed out some of them, two of which I want to address.
Technical development, enabling us to do more, is of course a positive development meaning that more people can be cured.
It also places greater demands on future priorities, however.
We are also living longer.
That is a good thing, but it also puts a bigger strain on health services.
An exchange of best practice in this area is possible.
As many have pointed out, it is important to invest in preventive health.
In this connection, I myself pushed the issue of our needing a developed occupational health service because many illnesses and other problems arise in working life.
Being familiar with the working environment and able to intervene early is important for health care.
I see those who have to make use of health services as being, in the first place, patients rather than customers. This is connected with the view that health care is not a commercial service but a service driven by need.
I do not think it belongs in the Services Directive, a view also expressed by a number of other people in this House.
The Services Directive is, in the first place, about commercial services, while this is a service of general interest and should be debated in that context.
Â Â  â Mr President, let me start by making a brief comment on what Mr Mann said.
If he wants to highlight the need for costs to be cut in healthcare provision, he ought not to ignore the part played by the pharmaceutical industry.
I regard the failure to address this as a defect in the report we are discussing.
I want, though, to draw your attention to something else â the link between the lack of doctors in EU Member States, to which the report refers, and the Working Time Directive, which is currently under discussion.
Doctors in many German hospitals complain of poor working conditions and intolerable working hours, and the criticism levelled by the women among them is that deliberate mobbing makes it more difficult for them to balance work and family.
This often adds up to overworked and stressed-out doctors, who may move to other countries or even leave the profession altogether.
Those who bear responsibility for the misguided health and personnel policies of recent years are now trying to make the workers pay for their failures. They do this by drawing a distinction between active and non-active on-call time, the latter of which they refuse to pay for, claiming that thousands of new healthcare posts would be needed if they were to do so.
The employersâ association of the German ,and individual ministers in the ,have given us examples of what they mean by non-active on-call time: time spent on general visits, changing dressings, time outside ordinary working time spent doing infusions, injections, and routine chores such as dealing with correspondence.
I see this as a whole new kind of exploitation, and I ask Members not only to support our amendments, but also, when considering the Working Time Directive, to see to it that what the Commission has drafted does not go unchanged.
Â Â  Mr President, this is an excellent report from an excellent rapporteur.
It is a perfect example of one of the benefits of enlargement â of our welcoming ten new Member States â that we have representatives with such strength and wisdom to improve the quality of our discussions.
I am sure both the President and the Commissioner would agree with that remark.
I particularly welcome the comment that whilst healthcare is a matter for Member States, nonetheless we can all learn a great deal from each other.
That is absolutely true, and the more we can learn the better for each of us.
I also commend the comments about the importance of having proper healthcare for elderly people such as myself.
I have one comment for the Commissioner, on which I will ask for his advice and particularly his nod of approval in a moment.
I have written to him concerning a possible scam that is appearing in various EU countries.
Tourists who unfortunately fall ill are suddenly taken from their hotel and deflected to private hospitals where they are then landed with a hefty bill.
Even if they happen to be conscious when they are taken away and protest that they are entitled to equivalent free healthcare, they are nonetheless whisked off to a private hospital.
I accept that this a matter for Member States, but I ask the Commissioner whether there is there anything he or we can do about it.
Is he aware of the extent of the problem and does he accept, as this report states, that citizens have the right to equivalent healthcare in every Member State and that this needs reinforcing?
What can he do to reinforce it?
I would ask him to be so good as to reply in English saying what can be done, so that I can send this reply to my constituent in the West Midlands.
Â Â  Health is a fundamental social right and one of the cornerstones of the European social model.
Confidence that health care can be provided is a precondition of the individual being able to operate properly in society.
It provides security.
Work therefore needs to be done on harmonising and improving the quality of the health care Europeans receive.
The ageing of the population will create problems in relation to the national health systemsâ capacity to secure access and quality in the future.
In spite of their different healthcare arrangements, all the Member States face this problem.
Modernisation is required.
Resources within the health sector therefore need to be used better, but it is important for this not just to mean rationalisation and greater efficiency.
We have to remember that prevention is the most effective form of health care.
In the Europe of the future, health must not be seen as a cost but, rather, as facilitating a competitive economy.
The mid-term evaluation of the Lisbon Strategy also emphasises the need for the social pillar.
The social dimension is quite simply a necessity if Europe is to achieve growth and employment.
If we are to go on securing a well-educated and skilful labour force, we must be able to offer effective and universal health care.
The Member States must therefore become better at making use of the open coordination method and the opportunity it provides for exchanging good practice.
More should also be done to improve our working environment so that we prevent accidents at work and work-related illnesses.
An improved environment will generally also have a beneficial effect on general health and will thus make for healthier people, which will again release resources for health care.
Health, growth and employment are inextricably linked.
Â Â  â Mr President, in order to guarantee social inclusion, we must ensure the existence of a public social security system founded on the principles of democracy, solidarity and universal access and a health care system that is similarly public and universal.
These systems must operate on the basis of non-discrimination, benefiting people on low incomes, guaranteeing equal access for all to good quality public services and safeguarding human rights.
We are therefore opposed to the proposals paving the way for the privatisation of public services in these essential areas.
We object for example to the Bolkestein proposal for a directive intended to set up an internal market for services and to the proposal for a directive on certain aspects of the organisation of working time, which, by undermining health professionalsâ working conditions, also jeopardises the health of people using the services in question.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having myself once drafted a report on this subject, I am of course particularly pleased by the considerable continuity that is still evident between MrÂ Cabrnochâs report and our previous resolutions.
For that, I would like to say how grateful I am to him.
The Councilâs eventual agreement, in October of last year, to the use of open coordination in health provision and the care of the elderly is another success chalked up by this House.
I am confident that the PROGRESS programme, on which I am the rapporteur, will soon provide us with an instrument for organising the exchange of best practice, which is so urgently needed, and for pushing through a reciprocal and mutual process of learning from one another.
At the end of the day, the Member States need to be helped to undertake reforms aimed at modernising and strengthening health systems, in which process particular importance must be attached to social cohesion and the principle of solidarity.
If the Member States want to ensure, in future, continued universal access to their systems for health care and the care of the elderly, to guarantee their quality and secure their funding, what is needed above all is more prevention and greater transparency.
Transparency is itself indispensable if quality is to be maintained and if the resources available to the healthcare systems are to be used in the best possible way.
Assessing the quality of medical services must be made much easier; paying out large sums of money for poor-quality service must come to an end.
Patientsâ organisations have a very important part to play in this, and they must be more involved in future decisions on health policy.
All the Member States wanted to go further by adopting a Patientsâ Law or Patientsâ Charter.
They all also face major challenges where the care of the elderly and long-term care are concerned.
We should join together in seeking strategies for improving the interaction between healthcare provision and treatment, in order to be able to improve care for patients in their homes and to provide sufficient care facilities.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report misleadingly entitled 'Modernising social protection and developing good quality healthcare', because it contains reactionary assessments and objectives for further promoting the commercialisation of healthcare, swelling the private business groups which control the healthcare sectors and drug production and increasing their profits.
This has painful consequences for public health and leeches the income of the grass-roots.
The patient is a customer.
Basically, there is no health policy.
Health and safety at work regulations are primitive.
On an annual basis, 40% of healthcare services provided are covered by workers' wages.
Health is increasingly being integrated into the more general anti-grass roots policy of the European Union.
Responsibility for the protection of health is being individualised and the healthcare services market is being fully liberalised, following the sweeping changes in industrial relations and in social insurance, such as the organisation of working times, the increase in the retirement age, the reduction in pensions and so on.
Healthcare should not be a commodity.
It should be a free, quality service provided on an equal footing to everyone by the state alone.
The pharmaceutical and biomedical technology sectors, production and marketing should belong to the state and should be controlled by society.
Â Â  Mr President, whilst I judge the general philosophy of this report positively, and whilst this text may be an acceptable foundation for upwards harmonisation of the rights of European citizens with regard to social protection linked to healthcare, it also presents some serious shortcomings.
It remains too general, does not set any timetables, and is not sufficiently focused.
Well, on this issue, incantations are not enough.
Let us be ambitious for this social Europe every one of us wants to see, and let us take healthcare and social protection expenditure from the Stability and Growth Pact, as this expenditure does not represent costs; it is an investment that creates wealth and efficiency for society as a whole.
Two significant matters absent from the report are the issue of financing a pioneering social protection system and mass unemployment in Europe.
Both issues are of major importance.
Without shared financing and without financial income contributions to the solidarity effort, it will be impossible to achieve the desired goal.
With regard to unemployment, it is a long-lasting strain on the sum of revenues required to finance social protection and healthcare.
By way of conclusion, let me add these two precise responses to the precise needs of the European people.
In striving too hard to reach a limp consensus, which in the end leads to nothing, we are only intensifying Eurosceptism.
Â Â  . Honourable Members, this debate has demonstrated something that I believe will also become apparent from subsequent debates on health care, namely that this is a remarkably complex subject.
In a certain sense it pushes us to our limits; after all, noÂ one can fail to be moved by anguish, suffering and death, and these are all part and parcel of health care.
It emerged clearly from the debate that the open method of coordination is regarded as a suitable way of coordinating health care systems in the European Union, and this is something I very much welcome.
Speakers also warned that consideration must be given to questions of administrative and technical management whenever this method is used.
This is undoubtedly true, and I have taken note of these warnings.
I am no fan of collecting useless information and creating systems that are incapable of delivering results.
MrÂ Bushill-Matthews, who is no longer present in the Chamber, asked a question that I imagine relates to a specific incident.
If I understood what was said correctly, the gist of what had happened was that someone had suffered health problems and was presumably treated in a clinic against his will, whereupon the clinic demanded payment for services that were not covered by his insurance.
It is by no means the Commissionâs intention that eventualities and instances of this kind should prove to be commonplace or likely, and I will look into this incident in order to obtain more detailed information on it.
Once again, honourable Members, our debate has shown that this report is an extremely valuable document, and I should like to quote one last paragraph from it.
According to paragraph 9, Parliament takes the view that the ageing of the population constitutes a challenge and should also be taken as an opportunity to involve people with long and valuable experience more closely in society and enterprises as a part of active ageing.
I believe that this paragraph demonstrates that the report is both well thought-out and well-balanced.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0092/2005) by Mr Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 establishing a European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (COM(2004)0050 â C6 0014/2004 â 2004/0014(CNS)).
Â Â  . Honourable Members, I should like to start by reminding the House that the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work was established by the European Union in 1994, in order to respond to the growing need for information on how to prevent work-related accidents.
The Agencyâs mission is to improve peopleâs working lives and to foster the exchange of technical, scientific and economic information between all parties affected by issues relating to safety and health at work, whether these be Community bodies, Member States, employees, employers or safety engineers.
In 2004, the Commission set out its proposals for amendments to the regulation establishing the Bilbao Agency, with the aim of responding to the needs of an enlarged European Union and streamlining the way in which the 78-member tripartite Administrative Board works.
The new regulation formalises the role of the Bureau, as well as maintaining and strengthening the tripartite structure of the Administrative Board, which is made up of Commission representatives and representatives from the governments, from the Member States and from employer and employee organisations.
The new proposal also reinforces the role of the social partners and strengthens the links between the Agencyâs mission and the objectives of the Community strategy on health and safety at work, as well as underlining the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Parliament has proposed a number of amendments aimed at making the original proposal clearer and more precise, and has also put forward certain amendments proposed by the Council.
The fact that amendments have been proposed to the way in which appointments are made to the Bilbao Agency did however come as something of a surprise to the Commission, as the implication is that the Commission should have closer control over the Agency.
Ever since the latter was established, its Director has been appointed by the Administrative Board, on the basis of a recommendation from the Commission.
Given that this is the procedure currently followed by the majority of agencies, it would be a pity if it were to be changed.
I should like to thank the House for having given the draft regulation such a positive reception, and for the new provisions it has proposed with the aim of making it clearer and more precise.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is significant to me that tomorrow, the day we will vote on this report, is International Workersâ Memorial Day.
That is the day that commemorates the 60Â 000 workers per year who die globally from job-related injuries or illnesses and the many millions more who are injured.
For the European Union 15, the figures have been steadily improving over the last decade, but there is still nothing to be proud of.
Some 4Â 500 workers die each year as a result of accidents at work and many more from work-related illnesses.
Over four million still suffer significant injuries at work each year.
This is the important backdrop to our debate today on the Bilbao Agency.
As I have said, the figures for the EU 15 have improved over the last decade and I am convinced that the key health and safety directives that we have put in place, and the work of the Bilbao Agency itself, have made an important contribution to that improvement.
As the Commissioner has said, we are discussing the review and updating of the regulation governing the operations of the Bilbao Agency.
That review was called for in the original regulation.
It is a little later than it might have been, but that is because there has been a full external evaluation and a full consultation of all stakeholders, which has informed the Commissionâs proposal and indeed the recommendations from the Council.
As the Commissioner has also said, the other imperative for change has been the enlargement of the European Union, which has meant an increase in the Board of the Agency from 48 to 78 and has therefore necessitated a streamlining of administrative and management processes.
The amendments that we have proposed fall into four main categories.
The first are intended to clarify the objectives and tasks of the Agency, improving the link with the priorities of the Community strategy, strengthening the Agencyâs capacity for data analysis, focusing more on the needs of SMEs and providing accessible and comprehensible information to final users.
Secondly, there are amendments intended to take account of the enlargement of the Union, clarify and improve the functioning of the Governing Board and strengthen its strategic role and the executive role of the Bureau.
Thirdly, there are those intended to reinforce the role of the social partners in the Agencyâs network in the Member States â a very important point â and those intended to reinforce cooperation with other Community bodies in the social policy area.
We have also, of course, tabled amendments to try to ensure a proper gender balance in the management structures of the Agency.
I shall pick out one or two of the more important ones.
First, I would like to say that I am grateful to Giovanni Berlinguer and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for an excellent opinion.
I have taken up a number of their suggested amendments, for example Amendment 2, which underlines the need for the Agency not only to collect and disseminate information, but also to analyse that information, identify risks and good practices, and promote preventive action.
It also underlines the role of the Agency as a risk observatory.
Amendment 4 concerns gender balance and the governing and management structures of the Agency.
Amendments 5, 6, 7 and 8 concern in different ways the added value the Agency should bring to the data it collects and collates through analysis, evaluation, identification of best practice and dissemination of that information and best practice to where it is most needed, particularly with small and medium-sized enterprises.
Amendment 7 also underlines the need for the promotion of the harmonisation of statistics on work-related accidents and illnesses, a crucial point.
A series of amendments then look at a number of technical and administrative matters concerning the composition of the board and Bureau and their respective roles and responsibilities, and the interrelationships between the two bodies.
We think these amendments will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the Agency.
The final point is the one the Commissioner mentioned.
That is Amendment 23, dealing with the appointment of the director.
I know the Commission is not happy with it, but it reflects the procedure followed by the other agencies in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairsâ remit.
The Commissioner has also intervened recently in the appointment of directors at certain agencies.
Therefore maybe the amendment better reflects current reality.
In short, the report seeks to strengthen the role and function of the Agency, which has already done excellent work.
I commend the report to the House.
Â Â  . I agree with the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur and very much welcome the efforts of the Bilbao Agency.
The rapporteur has cited some figures, but the reality is that a large number of work-related accidents and illnesses are preventable and that they particularly affect the most vulnerable people: immigrants, temporary workers, illegal workers and the unskilled.
Furthermore, they affect people that receive less protection from trade unions, which do not reach large numbers of workers.
I would add that there is some danger of the situation worsening, as a result of the political options presented to the European Union.
If competition between countries, rather than encouraging safety and innovation, meant a relaxation of safety measures and an increase in working hours, that would increase the number of accidents and illnesses.
If the Bolkestein Directive on services brought in social dumping by means of the country of origin rule, the number of accidents and illnesses would be compounded.
There are important amendments in Mr Hughesâs proposal, above all the involvement of the social partners, that is to say the workers themselves, who are, on the one hand, the victims, and on the other, the proponents of safety and health in the workplace.
Â Â  . I should like to start by expressing my admiration for the rapporteurâs work, and in particular for the fact that the correct procedures were followed when the report and the motion for a resolution were discussed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
As a new MEP and a representative of a new Member State, I find the very existence of the Bilbao Agency a matter for concern.
I have yet to be fully convinced that there is any genuine and legitimate need for a separate EU body dedicated to the matter of health and safety at work, given that this is such a narrow, albeit important, field.
I will continue to review the arguments that speak in favour of the existence of this institution, as well as any that suggest that it would be preferable for problems relating to health and safety at work to be tackled in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, or in other words at national level alone.
As things stand, however, both the motion for a resolution that has been tabled and the rapporteurâs report serve to make the Agencyâs work more transparent, and I can therefore endorse the motion for a resolution drafted by the rapporteur.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Madam President, I welcome the report on the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work and I congratulate the rapporteur on work well done.
The key elements of this Agency are its research and distribution of best practice to Member States in relation to standards concerning health and safety at work.
Legislation governing the health and safety of workers throughout the EU is a prime example of how the EU has made and can make a positive contribution to raising the quality of life for millions of the Unionâs citizens.
But legislation is just one part of the equation; enforcing that legislation is another.
Health and safety in the workplace can only be maintained where adequate monitoring is conducted at workplace level.
While I am not familiar with the situation in other European countries, I know that in Ireland we do not have an adequate number of inspectors and monitors to ensure the health and safety of our own workers.
A notable case in Ireland recently has been the exposure of the Turkish multinational company Gama, which has deprived workers of earnings through paying substantially below the minimum wage and endangered their health and safety by requiring a substantial number of its workers to work up to 80 hours per week.
This is extremely damaging to the health and safety of those workers.
In the potentially dangerous construction industry, accidents are much more likely to occur when people are required to work such long hours.
Of course, it is not just the company that has a responsibility.
We have the legislation in Ireland, we have the minimum wage, but we are not properly enforcing that legislation.
This is a high-profile case in Ireland at the moment, but there have been a number of cases in recent times where workersâ rights, particularly immigrant workersâ rights, have been trampled on.
Turkey is currently applying for membership of the EU and I support that move, but part of that process will have to be a requirement that major companies like Gama respect and protect workersâ rights within the EU.
I believe the onus is on the Turkish Government to ensure this happens.
So, while we welcome this excellent report today, and indeed commend the work of the Agency, we all need to be vigilant in our own countries to ensure that workersâ rights are upheld.
In particular, we need to be vigilant where workers are exposed to dangers and to risks and where they are less well represented by trade unions.
What we are talking about here are immigrant workers, under-age workers, temporary workers, and so on.
Finally, I wish to make a comment on Amendment 7, which underlines the need for reliable information and comparative data and the need for a systematic collection of data across the Member States in the field of health and safety at work, with the support of Eurostat.
We need accurate information across all 25 Member States, collected in a uniform way, so that we have good-quality, reliable and relevant information to underpin all policy decisions.
Â Â  . Madam President, this agency is an important EU institution; in the just over ten years that it has been operating in Bilbao, it has already had a tangible and beneficial influence on working conditions in Europe.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is right behind this report, and I wish to express my appreciation to Mr Hughes for drafting it.
We see it as very important that the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao should, as far as possible, enjoy the same legal status as the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training in Thessaloniki, and that it should be equipped with a constantly improving range of instruments.
Today, Europe needs these agenciesâ input more than ever, for it is often apparent that two of Europeâs three pillars â the social and the environmental â are threatening to give way.
Other speakers have already mentioned such things as the Bolkestein directive and REACH, and I realise how unstable a pillar social Europe rests upon when I hear employers heaping derision on the prospect of a directive on protection against optical radiation, which would lay down minimum standards for workers.
Safety at work, the prevention of accidents and preventive health care must be treated as matters of high importance if workers are to be more than factors in capitalistsâ production calculations.
Fine-sounding declarations of principle are not enough; what is needed is research and instruments, developed by this agency in order that standards may be arrived at and legal measures drawn up, and in order that it may be possible to monitor whether the rules we lay down are actually adhered to.
We in the Group of the Greens therefore expect the agency in Bilbao to be allocated the resources that it needs in order to do its job efficiently.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Hughes for his report, and I would like to congratulate the Agency for the 13Â per cent reduction in accidents in the workplace.
However, I would like to mention the fact that the administrative board finds itself overburdened with the administration to the point that it cannot concentrate on strategic planning.
This is a pity, because I would like it to strategically plan so as to be able to look at the workers that are not included in the Agencyâs vigilance for health and safety.
I refer to these as âhome carersâ, and will continue to do so for the rest of my time here.
They make up the largest workforce in Europe; they often lift beyond their weight and work around the clock, year in and year out.
There is nobody monitoring their health and safety.
It can sometimes be quite ludicrous: as a home carer myself, for a short period of time I had someone sent in by the state to give me a few hoursâ help a week.
This helper could not lift, could not put his hand above his head, could not in fact do anything that a carer had to do.
I had to let him go because there was no help he could give, all on the basis of health and safety.
I, however, could do anything, no matter how dangerous, because I was a home carer.
Â Â  Madam President, I do not underestimate the importance of health and safety at all, but I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that European Union regulations are undermining personal responsibility and, in many cases, the application of common sense.
We are now told, for example, that teachers must be protected from noisy children.
Gliders are grounded because perfectly safe winches no longer meet new specifications.
What business is it of this House to tell a builder that he must use scaffolding to refix a roof tile?
It really is about time that the people of Brussels discovered how irritating this interfering trivia could be.
Surely the health and safety of lorry drivers requires a new regulation: to dig up all the cobble stoned streets of Brussels and replace them with concrete.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to apologise for missing my slot earlier.
I am afraid I ran out of my office with the wrong file under my arm and had to go back for the correct one.
It happens to us all.
I would like briefly to refer to Mr Moteâs comments: he might be a bit more sanguine about the health and safety regulations if he had once had to gather up the remains of an unfortunate worker who had slipped off a roof and ended up dead on the street below because there was no scaffolding available during his work, and had then to go to the family of that unfortunate man and explain why he was dead.
There is nothing in the health and safety regulations that is an undue burden on business.
After all, the human cost of the deaths on building sites â which are quite appalling â and the injuries â which are also quite appalling â cannot be measured by the inconvenience of having to put up a bit of scaffolding.
I would like to address two points here.
First and foremost I should like to thank Stephen Hughes for his report and indeed for seeking to raise the whole issue of gender balance in the boards of the Health and Safety Authority.
I would also briefly like to mention Mrs Harkinâs European Foundation report, which unfortunately is not being debated in the House, but is being voted on tomorrow as well.
That dealt with perhaps a much more complex problem because of the staffing situation there â it being a much older foundation.
The Commission and the Council sought to change the status of the workers in that Foundation and we had to negotiate considerably to try and find a solution to that.
While this Parliament is only consulted on this issue, I believe we have found good common ground between the staff of the Foundation, the management and indeed the Parliament here.
I know that the Irish presidency initiated discussions on this during its time in office and it helped to encourage the Luxembourg presidency to take on board the recommendations that this Parliament is making.
I hope that the report is adopted without difficulty here tomorrow.
Â Â  . Honourable Members, the European Coal and Steel Community, which was the origin and starting point of the European Union, not only pursued the aim of economic integration, but also established a legal basis for measures relating to safety and health at work.
The bulk of the European Unionâs legislative activity in this field builds on this legal basis.
Although we have undoubtedly made progress in this area, there can be no question of us ever ceasing in our efforts.
The incidence of work-related accidents has fallen by 13%, yet the figure is still too high, and certain jobs are still unduly dangerous.
I am delighted that the Bilbao Agency has received an overwhelmingly positive assessment, as this is a view I share.
I expect tomorrowâs debate on the amendments that have been tabled to be brief and to have a positive outcome, as the individual amendments provide a logical and well-balanced response to the changes that have taken place.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0087/2005) by Mrs van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the current state of integration of EU financial markets (2005/2026(INI)).
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to start by apologising to my Dutch fellow MEPs for speaking, not in Dutch but in English, which is, after all, the language of the financial markets.
There is also the added benefit that I can address the Commissioner in a language he understands.
Madam President, when the Commissionerâs predecessor Mr Bolkestein started his term, he met with a well-prepared, ambitious set of proposals for the internal market for capital.
He presented them in 1999 as the Financial Services Action Plan â FSAP.
Commissioner, I have the impression that you are less fortunate with the heritage concerning the internal market for services that Mr Bolkestein left for you when you came here to Brussels, and which carries his name, or perhaps an ominous nickname.
But that is not our subject for today; we will have plenty of time to discuss this further.
I would like to praise Mr Bolkestein for having diligently steered the FSAP through during his term in office.
Commissioner, I am very much looking forward to the follow-up plan in the Green Paper that you are to present next week.
In the report before you and in the debates that we had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we take a positive view of the way the FSAP has been dealt with, but of course we are aware that many of the intentions laid down in the rules still have to be proven in practice.
Major attention should be focused on the implementation and enforcement of the almost 40 sets of rules that have been adopted.
Unfortunately, there were some misunderstandings about my report in the form in which it has been presented to the plenary today.
Although a broad consensus was reached in committee and we had good compromises, some imperfections slipped in during the committee vote.
Since they concern the main thrust of the report, I would like to discuss them first.
The most annoying mistake is paragraph 2 of the text before the House today.
It suggests that we should go along with the plea of some lobbyists and journalists that Brussels legislators should commit themselves to a regulatory pause.
But that is really not my cup of tea.
This paragraph 2 absolutely does not fit into a report that points to so many developments in a dynamic financial market that may pose serious systemic risks and endanger a safe and efficient internal market for financial services.
Therefore, I am clearly against tying our hands with a moratorium on legislation.
We should stay alert and the Commission should be very proactive.
Of course, this new legislation should be thoroughly assessed as to its necessity, its costs and benefits and its wider impact, but less regulation is not always better regulation.
Let me turn to some other elements of the report, such as the Lamfalussy Process.
With the well-known disclaimers that you are used to from the European Parliament, the report is quite positive about the Lamfalussy Process.
I tend to see the Level Three Committees of regulators in particular as allies for the public interest and the protection of consumers and expert users.
I note that they are more and more aware of their important role in harmonising the technical rules and the supervisory practices between regulators in different Member States.
The Himalaya report presented by CESR asks for an improved toolbox.
We say in the report before the House today that this is a good starting point for further debate.
Some important issues have to be resolved in the coming period.
Then there is European-level supervision.
In the report we speak positively about a move towards consolidating supervisors.
The industry wants to reduce the need to comply with many different supervisors, but on the other hand I can understand the hesitation of regulatory authorities in host situations to give up their competences and to rely completely on foreign supervisors.
That is why I insist on taking a further step.
Seeing the growth in cross border activity and the concentration of large players in the financial markets, it is time for integrated supervision at European level, possibly via a two-tier system with European-level supervision for large cross-border players without prejudice to the level playing field between cross-border and local players.
Not everyone agrees with me on this, but at least in the report we agree that this should be an option that the Commission should also consider further.
Then there is the issue of consumer protection and involvement.
Here we stress that the protection of consumers and the guaranteed availability of basic financial services to all consumers should remain a basic condition.
I do not think that we should aim at complete harmonisation in relation to retail financial products and service provision, because consumer protection is too different in the various Member States.
In the report I propose looking at the option of a 26th regime for pan-European financial products, such as mortgages or insurance products.
They may meet the needs of internationally mobile people to work with the providers they are used to in another Member State.
Mrs BerÃšs, the chairwoman of our committee, will speak on the issue of better cooperation in a global setting.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is already clear the coming five years will be extremely challenging in this particular area.
The smooth functioning of financial markets is essential and has a huge influence on the prosperity of each and every one of us.
Financial investments underpin jobs and growth; the value of our savings; our pensions; the cost of our mortgages.
Deep, liquid, dynamic European financial markets will ensure the most efficient allocation and provision of capital and services throughout the European economy, and beyond, in the global capital market.
In the last six years we have seen major progress.
Most of the necessary rules outlined in the Financial Services Action Plan have been agreed on time and are now being put in place.
European decision-making and regulatory structures have become more rational and efficient.
Continued systematic cooperation has developed between the European institutions and market participants.
All institutions and a very large majority of the market participants agree we need to continue our efforts, because our job to integrate the European financial markets is far from finished.
Our key priority for the next 12 months is to complete unfinished business in the area of financial services.
We still need to deal with the remaining elements in the negotiation phase before this House and the Council, as well as the key measures now under preparation by the Commission.
For example, we still need to allow more risk-sensitivity in the capital requirements for banks and investment firms (Basel II); strengthen statutory audit (the eighth Company Law Directive); fight money laundering and terrorist finance; cut down the costs for clearing and settlement; establish a European framework for reinsurance; modernise rules on insurance solvency; and create a European legal framework for payments.
