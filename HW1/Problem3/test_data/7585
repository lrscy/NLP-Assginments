I had the opportunity to visit the Sudan earlier this year, as did Mr Corrie, though not at the same time, and he led an official delegation.
I am grateful to the Commissioner for his balanced response.
It seems to me that what is needed here in Europe is an appreciation of the facts of the situation - what is actually happening.
Many allegations have been made.
The Sudanese Government denies them.
We want to get at the truth.
I would like to hear whether the Commission is going to make any effort, or is making any effort, to try to establish whether or not there is a scorched earth policy.
The Commission representative in Khartoum said to me that our aid to the Sudan is severely limited because of political constraints.
If only we could start to get more aid into that country we might do more to end the civil war there and actually get greater respect for human rights across the whole of that country.
That should be the ambition of us all.
This is one of the very difficult cases where we, on the one hand, are strongly involved in humanitarian support but where the issue of access and of staying clear of the warring parties to deliver to the people in need has been a major problem.
On top of that the whole performance and the political problems in relation to the government and its policies and human rights aspects have created quite a sour situation over some years.
Now the effort to be instrumental in a peace process by engaging in a deliberate dialogue seems to be working.
That is as much as we can say now.
I am perfectly well aware of the views and advice of our head of the delegation in Khartoum and that certainly indicates that the dialogue that we are in the middle of is making some progress.
So we are looking at ways of balancing the stick and the carrot.
I cannot be more precise at the moment.
In both the Swedish and international media, Christian Aid is reported to have demanded that, for example, the Swedish oil company, Lundin Oil, whose board also includes the UN Secretary-General' s adviser for the Balkans, Carl Bildt, should leave Sudan.
Have Commissioner Nielson and the Commission had any contact at all with Christian Aid and Lundin Oil and, for that matter, also perhaps with UN adviser Carl Bildt on the subject of these allegations of human rights violations in connection with the road building being done so that oil can be extracted in southern Sudan?
This oil company has, I understand, now been purchased by an American oil company but that does not change the picture.
It neither adds to nor subtracts from the problem.
Nor in my view does the presence of the former Swedish Prime Minister on its board of directors affect the problem.
We have no specific relations with the organisation mentioned or this specific oil company.
The oil activity in the Sudan should be looked upon as a resource for the country to be utilised to the fullest extent possible for the good of the Sudanese people.
We see many cases of a perverse use of oil resources.
If we look at it from a point of view of distribution policy, very few of the developing countries with oil resources are enjoying socially positive effects from that.
One of the elements that we raised in the discussion on priorities in East Timor, at the very launching of our presence there, was to advise them that they should be sure to get first-class consultants to assist in handling the whole issue of the oil resources which are now part of the economic future of that country.
Internal distribution is important and this should be discussed with probably most developing countries.
Thank you, Mr Nielson, for your long and outstanding cooperation.
Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, Question 47, tabled by Mr Howitt, shall be answered in writing.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
Question No 48 by (H-0600/01):
Subject: Prices for unmetered access to the Internet A main instrument in the eEurope process is benchmarking.
The Commission' s website (at http://europa.eu.int/information_society/eeurope/benchmarking/index_en.htm) provides a list of the benchmarks to be published by the Commission.
In Section 3 of that list is the vitally important matter of unmetered access to the Internet, which has become established in the UK market and hopefully soon across the Union too.
Unfortunately, the Commission has not yet provided the benchmarking data for this key indicator.
Will the Commission now provide this information for the European citizen via its website, giving comparative data on current average retail unmetered prices in the fifteen Member States, as well as the unmetered wholesale products available from incumbent operators?
Mr President, cost of access is the key determinant of Internet use and policies to reduce the cost by introducing more competition are central to the year of action plan.
In view of this the Internal Market Council in November last year endorsed a set of indicators to benchmark the year of action plan, which included the cost of access.
When defining the access price indicator, the Council specified the source to be OECD, supplemented if necessary by a Commission study.
The advantage of the OECD data was that it enabled comparisons to be made with third countries and especially the United States.
OECD data was used in the Commission's report to the Stockholm European Council.
The data includes unmetered access, however their methodology considers only prices charged by the dominant telecom operating in each country.
In practice, this meant that there were too few figures available to merit their inclusion in the website.
To overcome this methodology, the Commission called for tender for studies to measure Internet access prices in the EU.
The response was good and price data will be measured on 1 November 2001 and made available to the Commission not later than 15 January 2002.
It should then be repeated half a year later.
All the research will be published by a benchmarking section of the e-Europe website.
Although OECD analysis is limited, it gives an indication of the impact of unmetered access on the price of the Internet.
The cost in September 2000 of unmetered access in the OECD report was - and here we use dollars because they use dollars, next year we will use euros - USD 25 in the UK, USD 35 in Spain and USD 50 in Germany.
New figures from August 2001 show no notable variation in unmetered access prices.
The USA remains at the lower end with USD 20.
It is also clear from the benchmarking exercise, that unmetered access is growing rapidly in the EU.
For example, provisional data from the Internet use survey shows that in June the proportion of households with unmetered ADSL access has increased by over 200% from last October's survey.
The overall penetration of ADSL remains low, that is a fact, but there have been several spectacular advances in Member States, for example, Belgium went from 1% to 11% in the eight months separating the two surveys.
That was such a comprehensive reply that I cannot think of a supplementary question, so I will not ask one.
Question No 51 by (H-0617/01):
Subject: High-speed tyres in Sweden In April this year, when many car owners in Sweden were about to buy new summer tyres, an absurd situation arose.
The tyre industry claimed that an EU directive stipulated that every new car must be equipped with tyres capable of coping with the vehicle's theoretical top speed.
The fact that the maximum speed limit in Sweden is 110 kph was not relevant and many cars had to be fitted with tyres capable of coping with speeds of 270 kph and in some cases as much as 300 kph.
Despite the risk of fines and the new registration test, it is common for car owners to ignore the high-speed tyre requirement.
Many tyre dealers have pre-printed forms for customers to sign releasing the dealer from liability for fitting tyres which can only withstand speeds up to 190 kph.
Is this interpretation of the directive correct, and does the individual car owner have the right to ask for tyres to be fitted to the vehicle which are not capable of coping with the its theoretical top speed?
At European level the specifications for tyres to be fitted to passenger cars are dealt with by Directive 92/23/EEC of 31 March 1992.
European legislation on type approval of motor vehicles stipulates that every new car must be equipped with a certain category of tyres specified by the manufacturer of the vehicle and capable of coping with the vehicle top speed.
However, this directive governs solely the initial entry into service of the car before its registration in the fleet of one Member State.
No indication is given concerning the use of the vehicle, including for the aspects relating to the top speed of replacement tyres.
Another piece of legislation - Directive 1999/37/EEC on the minimum set of information to be put on registration papers for motor vehicles - does not include any specification for this characteristic of replacement tyres.
Therefore the interpretation by the tyre industry and distributors in Sweden of the relevant EC legislation is correct.
However, the fact that at European level no specific prescription is given does not automatically allow car owners to replace the tyres with the model they wish.
At national level and according to the principle of subsidiarity, the police and judicial authorities of the Member States have responsibility for enforcement of the relevant road safety provisions and the imposition of corresponding sanctions when needed.
In principle, fitting a car with tyres not capable of coping with its top speed could invalidate the conformity of the vehicle with the EU type approval.
This potentially dangerous situation could be penalised by the police, if it is in contradiction to national legislation.
Many thanks to the Commissioner for his answer.
In Sweden, the maximum speed is 110 km/h, but now many Swedes have to have tyres that can cope with speeds of up to 250 km/h. That costs a lot of money, of course, and causes a lot of inconvenience for car owners.
There are really no aspects of road safety necessitating this type of tyre.
I therefore think that it remains very difficult to justify making such demands, entailing large additional costs for car owners.
I understood from the Commissioner' s answer that an owner changing the tyres on his car for the second time is entitled to have another type of tyre, if permitted by the national authorities.
Is that a correct interpretation of your answer?
Mr President, I must say that this is a rather complex part of EU legislation.
Before I give a precise reply to the last question I want to consult my experts, but perhaps I can give one reply to the problem under discussion.
Even though in Sweden the speed limit is 110 to 120, tyres are expected to cope with higher speed limits because, if a Swedish car goes over the bridge to Denmark and from Denmark to Germany where there are no speed limits on motorways, they will be travelling at higher speeds.
The same security should be guaranteed throughout Europe.
I will come back to the honourable Member of Parliament on the first question as soon as possible.
Question No 52 by (H-0620/01):
Subject: Pedestrian-friendly car In many EU countries a debate is going on about improving road safety, and one project put forward in this connection has been that of the "pedestrian-friendly car" .
Is the Commission planning a new directive on this topic, or is progress in this area being made by means of possible voluntary commitments by industry?
Mr President, the Commission is aware of the matters for concern which have been raised by the honourable Member.
In order to discuss these questions the Commission issued a communication, on 11 July 2001 on the protection of pedestrians.
It is important to remember the significance of this topic. Each year, 9 000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed, and 200 000 are injured, in accidents involving a motor vehicle.
The European motor industry has now, after discussions held with the Commission, made a commitment to incorporate a raft of safety features from 2002 onwards.
These aim at improving pedestrian safety in accident situations.
As to how regulation is to be implemented, there is a choice between, on the one hand, a voluntary agreement of the industry based on agreed objectives and, on the other hand, the conventional legislative route.
In July, the Commission found that the content of the industry's commitment matched the objectives set by the Commission.
The final decision on whether the safety standards will be implemented by a commitment - which will be closely monitored - or by legislation, will be made by the end of the year.
According to the agreement, the car manufacturers promise to ensure that all new passenger cars will go through a series of tests with the purpose of ensuring that the cars are designed in such a way that pedestrians and cyclists who are involved in an accident will suffer as little injury as possible.
The discussions which have taken place with the Association of European Car Manufacturers on the commitment of the industry have been based on the following objectives: first of all, attaining the objectives proposed by the EEVC committee which deals with the improvement of European vehicle safety; secondly, implementing measures to improve the safety of pedestrians in the short and medium term; thirdly, adopting new and improved technology which will effectively improve the safety of pedestrians; and fourthly, finding an innovative solution in which passive and active safety features will be combined.
The objective of the commitment is a reduction in the number of fatalities and also a reduction in the number and seriousness of injuries.
It is estimated that the annual number of deaths would be cut by two thousand if all motor vehicles on the roads of the European Union met the requirements of the EEVC tests.
This reduction would represent 20 percent of the present level.
Thanks to new technology, deaths could be reduced even further.
If the Commission decides to propose legislation, this would be based on the content of the commitment.
The industry is making a commitment that as from 1 July 2005 all new types of vehicles will meet requirements which relate to the first series of passive measures recommended by the joint (that is, the Commission's joint) research centre.
The improvements will be added to the existing models in stages, with the result that these will be included in the features of all new vehicles by 2012.
In the next stage, the manufacturers will commit to installing other safety equipment.
This means that from 2010 onwards the objectives set by EEVC will finally be attained, either in accordance with EEVC's technical proposals or by other measures which will have an impact on safety at least equal to this.
As one example we can mention that from the beginning of next year all new cars will be fitted with day running lights, and inflexible "bull bars" will be banned.
From 2003 onwards, all new vehicles would be fitted with anti-blocking brakes.
The Japanese car manufacturers, who are represented by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association JAMA, expressed their official approval of the matter by making an identical commitment in July.
The ASCEA and JAMA commitments cover over 95 percent of the market for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in the EU.
Negotiations concerning similar commitments are underway with the South Korean car manufacturers, which would lead to almost one hundred percent coverage.
As the honourable Member is aware, the Commission has sent the commitment which was approved in July to the European Parliament and Council for comment.
Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his thorough response.
I see that the Commission is devoting thought to traffic safety, even though in my opinion a phrase such as "pedestrian-friendly car" is wrong, since there can be no such thing as a one thousand or two thousand kilogram steel object which would be friendly to a person when it hits that person at a speed of several tens or even hundreds of kilometres an hour.
But the question, above all, was whether the Commission will issue a Directive proposal on the matter, or whether it is prepared to make an agreement with the car manufacturers.
Is the reply of the Commissioner to be interpreted as meaning that, at some stage, the idea will come to predominate within the Commission that the quickest results can be obtained by making an agreement with the car manufacturers, in other words that the preferred line of action will be to follow this procedure rather than enacting a Directive on the matter?
Mr President, the Commission left final decision making until after the opinion of the Council and Parliament had been heard.
Both alternatives have their good points.
It is clear that the agreement route will be quicker, but this also represents a new way of action.
However, a resolution of this type has already been made previously, in connection with the Auto-Oil decision.
The legislative route is more traditional and familiar, but will be more time-consuming; however the Commission wishes to make this decision now that the reporting round is complete.
Question No 53 by (H-0629/01):
Subject: Origin of information technology as used in SENSUS and AVENTINUS On Wednesday, 13 June, the Commission decided to undertake an inquiry into the Europol scandal.
This inquiry must not be confined to 'the management of SENSUS' .
OLAF must examine all tendering procedures and all contracts under AVENTINUS and SENSUS.
Such an independent inquiry is the only certain way of obtaining a clear picture of the murky doings of Europol.
One of the most important questions which remains unanswered is the origin of the basic technology used under SENSUS and AVENTINUS and Europol' s Europolis and Eurint systems.
Will the Commission ask OLAF to examine all tendering procedures and contracts relating to AVENTINUS and SENSUS?
Can the Commission confirm that the patented Polygon technology belonging to Polygenesys of Munich is being used under SENSUS and AVENTINUS and Europol' s Europolis and Eurint systems?
If so, how was this technology and/or the right to use it acquired?
The honourable Member refers to an inquiry launched by the Commission on 13 June following press articles on Europol.
In order to avoid a possible misunderstanding the Commission will have to point out that it has not launched an inquiry into the Europol-related matter to which the honourable Member refers.
As far as the Commission is aware the matter concerns accusations of fraud unrelated to the Sensus contract.
The Commission understands that internal investigations by Europol have led to the Dutch judicial authorities now investigating the matter.
As far as the action the Commission has undertaken concerning the Sensus project is concerned, the Commission has initiated an internal review of the management of this project as indicated in the Commission's reply to the oral questions by the honourable Member.
Following this review and also on the basis of ongoing, more general recommendations, both from the Court of Auditors and the external monitoring panel of the Information Society Technologies programme, the Commission is implementing changes in procedures which will ensure significant improvements in project management.
The Commission attends the meetings of the management board of Europol and meetings of the heads of national units in an observer capacity.
It has no mandate to investigate Europol other than in the context of direct contractor relations such as through the Sensus project.
In the context of Sensus and as explained in the replies to written questions, the Commission is not currently planning a financial audit of Europol's participation in Sensus.
But the need for such an audit will be assessed again when all the cost claims related to Sensus have been submitted by project participants. That should happen in the next few months.
Sensus and Aventinus were involved in pre-competitive research using many basic technologies for the production of a demonstrator.
The objective was to overcome linguistic barriers between European law enforcement agencies in their fight against organised crime such as drugs smuggling and illegal immigration.
Sensus is an assembly of software models including linguistic content, utilisation and report generation, workflow and database management systems.
There is therefore no specific basic technology.
According to information received by the Commission, although Polygon was originally intended to be used in Sensus, in the autumn of 1999 a different technology was selected instead.
The Commission service has been assured by the contractors that Polygon is not a component of the Sensus demonstrator.
The coordinator of the Aventinus projects has confirmed that Polygon was not used in either Aventinus I or Aventinus II.
As far as technologies used in Europolis and Eurint systems are concerned, the Commission is not in a position to address the question of the honourable Member.
Of course, I thank the Commissioner for his very full answer, from which we can nevertheless extract some new elements in this thriller, if I may call it that.
Still, I am very troubled, Commissioner.
I have the feeling that in the light of what is happening at the moment at Europol, there is insufficient monitoring, and that in some way or other we shall have to design a system at European level for monitoring Europol more effectively.
I know that the present OLAF Regulation is not sufficient for this.
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to investigate possible proposals.
A second supplementary question concerns the coordinator of the Sensus programme.
We all know that he is an agent of the German secret service.
The man was sentenced at the end of last year for forging documents.
I should like to know from the Commissioner, since we do not yet know from previous answers, whether or not the man is still co-ordinating the SENSUS programme.
If that is not the case, I should like him to inform us who is coordinating the Sensus programme.
I thank the Commissioner for his answer.
Mr President, as far as Europol is concerned, it is not really with the present legal basis under Commission control in the same manner as the Commission budget normally is.
So the only way for us to audit issues concerning Europol in the context of a particular contract.
If we have a contract for Europol, when a final financial statement has been completed, we can control the issue.
As far as the name of the coordinator and his position, I hope I can provide that detail directly to the honourable Member.
I will check the situation today.
Question No 54 by (H-0645/01):
Subject: Defence industries In response to my oral question H-0447/01, tabled at Question Time on 13 June 2001, the Commission indicated that it was considering what action to take pursuant to its 1997 Action Plan for implementing the EU strategy on defence-related industries.
It also indicated that it would be able to report on the action it intends to take this autumn.
Can it now outline what proposals it intends to table?
Despite the difficulties in moving forward on this issue as rapidly as we had hoped, I want to stress that the analysis of the 1997 action plan advocating a need for restructuring the European defence industry and for creating a single market for defence products is still valid.
Indeed I believe it to be even more pertinent for at least two reasons: development of the ESDP - European Security and Defence Policy - and the constitution of transnational defence companies.
Up to now the Council discussions have been characterised by differences of opinion between the Member States, preventing the adoption of a common position on the framing of a European armament policy.
But as the competitiveness of the European defence industry is vital to the credibility of the nascent European Security and Defence Policy, the Commission expects that governments will recognise increasingly the urgency for a change in attitudes in order to end policies and practices that prevent European defence companies from working together more efficiently.
Such a change in the position of Member States will allow the Commission to contribute more effectively to the creation of a European defence equipment market through exercising its competence under Community policies such as the creation of the single market in defence, external trade, etc.
As the commissioner for enterprise I am pursuing the objective of promoting greater competitiveness of Europe's defence industry in close cooperation with national authorities and industry representatives.
One important initiative in that context is our efforts aimed at promoting awareness of the importance of standardisation issues for the efficiency and competitiveness of the European defence industries and to investigate options and possible start-up actions for defence standards reform.
These issues were fully explored at an important conference last autumn, attended by the principal interested partners.
On that occasion the European Standardisation Organisation, CEN, was identified as the ideal forum to implement this effort in the form of a handbook of defence standards and defence procedures which, when in place, will offer more transparency, improving interoperability, harmonisation of requirements and cost efficiency in procurement.
This process is now well under way.
As regards the industry itself, there has been a huge transformation of the defence industrial landscape, particularly in the Eurospace and electronic sectors.
Good progress has also been made in the land armament and naval sectors.
It is to be expected that once this transformation has been completed and fully implemented the industry will formulate new expectations as regards access to defence markets in Europe and abroad.
To allow the necessary time to formulate these positions it has been agreed that the planned meeting of defence industry COs with commissioners concerned should take place by the end of the year, preferably now in the early autumn.
Would I be correct, Commissioner, in summing up your thorough answer in one word, "no", i.e. the Commission is not going to do anything?
When I spoke to you some months ago in this very Chamber you said that by autumn we will have made progress.
But it seems to me that what you are saying is that the Commission is not going to do anything to follow up its communication or its action plan.
What you have said is a summary of what has happened up to now but not an indication that there really is going to be dynamic action in the foreseeable future, as it is autumn now.
I would like to say that the standardisation part, where we are actively now moving, is a very important one.
The fact that we are working now on a normal daily basis is progress.
As far as legislative proposals are concerned, I am not in a position to give a definite answer today.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 55 to 96 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was adjourned at 8.20 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Outcome of the Bonn conference on climate change
The next item is the Commission statement on the outcome of the Bonn conference on climate change.
Thank you for inviting me to report to this House on the climate change conference in July.
The conference was a success, particularly for the European Union.
On 23 July it reached a consensus political agreement on modalities to implement the Kyoto Protocol.
It thereby resolved all the main outstanding political issues which were left open after the first part of the conference in The Hague last November.
This paves the way for the ratification of the protocol.
Allow me to give you a brief assessment of the Bonn Conference before I turn to the main decisions on substance.
The outcome of Bonn represents a major achievement for the European Union.
Following the United States' withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union has taken the lead in defending the protocol. This included a declaration by the European Councils in Stockholm and Gothenburg and resolutions from the European Parliament.
High-level missions by the Swedish and Belgian presidencies and the Commission visited the United States, Canada, Russia, Iran, China, Australia and Japan to seek support for our position.
The EU's commitment to bring the Kyoto Protocol into force before the World Summit on Sustainable Development - Rio+10 - in September this year was shared by many other parties.
This made the success in Bonn so important.
The agreement struck in Bonn indeed prevented an unravelling of the international efforts to combat climate change following the failure of the conference in the Hague and the announcement by President Bush that the United States will not support the Kyoto Protocol.
What also might have happened was an alternative proposal to the Kyoto Protocol by the United States.
This would have thrown the international efforts to establish an effective international framework for combating climate change into disarray.
The talks in Bonn therefore represented a race against the clock.
It has to be said that the United States honoured President Bush's promise not to prevent other parties from going ahead on the Kyoto Protocol.
During the final plenary of the ministerial segment of the conference no party objected to the adoption of the political agreement reached.
At the same time the EU and other parties have expressed the hope that the US will rejoin the Kyoto process.
Nothing in the agreement prevents it from doing so.
The European Union showed a strong and unified position during the talks and the Belgian presidency did a good job in coordinating our position.
I should also acknowledge the political support from the NGOs and MEPs present at the meeting, participating in a very constructive way.
The outcome of Bonn represents a victory for multilateral international relations.
Against the background of the current debate on globalisation it sends another political signal that the international community is able to address global problems to the benefit of all countries.
The agreement was a breakthrough, but of course there remain a number of steps to be taken before the Kyoto Protocol can enter into force.
First, the political elements agreed upon will have to be translated into legal texts.
This will be finalised and formally adopted by the conference of the parties at its next session, COP 7 in Marrakesh in November.
What are the prospects now for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol?
Entry into force requires ratification by 55 parties representing at least 55% of the CO2 emissions in 1990 of the industrialised countries.
Given that the United States has no intention of ratifying the protocol for the time being, this means that ratification by at least Japan and Russia, in addition to the EU and the candidate countries, is necessary to bring the protocol into effect.
As the candidate countries supported the EU's positions our attention focuses particularly on Japan, but also on Russia.
Japan feels strongly linked to the Kyoto Protocol and has repeatedly stated its aim of bringing it into force by 2002.
At the same time Japan has so far refrained from clearly committing itself to ratifying the protocol, even without the United States.
Russia's position was unclear throughout the negotiations and at the last minute it became clear in Bonn that it would not raise any objections.
This is despite the fact that Russia will benefit economically from the Kyoto Protocol and the establishment of an international emissions trading system as it will be in a position to sell emission credits due to its generous emissions targets.
Both countries now have a major responsibility in determining whether or not the international community takes an important step in combating climate change.
Hence Bonn represented an important step but is not yet the end of the process.
I should also highlight the constructive role played in Bonn by the developing countries, G4-77/China, under the chairmanship of Iran, sharing EU positions on many points.
Our good relations with this group proved to be an essential element in achieving a successful outcome.
In the difficult situation in which we found ourselves, the EU was forced to make concessions to other parties to obtain an agreement in Bonn and rescue the Kyoto Protocol.
These concessions relate mainly to a generous counting of carbon zincs towards industrialised countries' emissions targets and, on the last night of the negotiations, to the legally binding character of the compliance regime.
The agreement on zincs means that around 70% of the overall 5.2% emission reduction target for industrialised countries under the protocol can be covered by zincs instead of actual emission reductions.
Nonetheless, given that emissions have increased in most industrialised countries since 1990 a significant emission reduction effort in those countries is still required.
Giving up on the legally binding character of the consequences for non-compliance was another concession necessary to get Japan on board.
However, in exchange, the system itself is quite ambitious and, even though for the moment only politically binding, creates a strong incentive for parties to comply.
Once implemented the Kyoto Protocol will have a more elaborate and stringent compliance system than any other multilateral environmental agreement so far.
The agreement includes a declaration by the EU and a number of other countries of a funding package of EUR 450 million per year by 2005 for capacity building, technology transfer and adaptation to climate change for developing countries.
The main progress of the Kyoto Protocol is, in any case, to establish the architecture and general rules of an international framework on climate change: for example, binding emission targets, the flexible mechanisms for achieving those targets, a compliance regime, support to developing countries on which further decisions can build.
Besides its importance in addressing one of the biggest global challenges - climate change - the Kyoto Protocol will establish a new major international market for emissions rights among industrialised countries.
It will also channel new resources to developing countries and the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe.
It is certainly also important for the political acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol that investments in nuclear facilities are excluded from joint implementation and the clean development mechanism.
As I said earlier, the agreement in Bonn paves the way for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
The European Union is committed to ratification by our Heads of State and Government.
I therefore intend to present to the Council and the European Parliament soon, and certainly well before the end of the year, first of all a ratification proposal for the Kyoto Protocol.
This will include a Council decision on the burden sharing among the Member States of the Communities, overall a 8% emission reduction target on the basis of the political agreement of the Environment Council of 16 June 1998; secondly, a communication on a cost-effective implementation strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU based on the final report of the Commission's European climate change programme, the ECCP; thirdly, a proposal for a framework directive on an EU-wide emission trading scheme as a core element in a cost-effective Kyoto implementation strategy.
I would like to express my appreciation for the ongoing support of the European Parliament for the EU's position in the international climate negotiations and your continuing interest in this issue.
It was reflected in your strong Parliamentary delegation in Bonn.
I hope to continue our good cooperation in the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Bonn Conference sent out three political messages of enormous importance.
An environmental message, an economic message and one concerning governance.
With regard to the environment, this Conference will go down in history as the one that brought to an end the talks and negotiations on climate change that had been dragging on for ten years and the one that enabled us finally to take action.
It is true that the agreement is less ambitious that we had hoped and was drawn up mainly at the expense of concessions made in negotiations by the European Union.
The alternative to this tiny step forwards, however, would have been incomparably worse. Without the political agreement that was achieved in Bonn, the Kyoto Protocol would be dead and we would have had to waste another ten years working on a global policy to mitigate the damage caused by climate change.
I should, therefore, like to congratulate Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m on her excellent role in the political handling of this dossier since her appointment, and I also congratulate her for the announcement she made today about presenting to this House the process of ratifying the Kyoto protocol, the practical measures on the emissions trading system and the European programme for climate change.
I should also like to highlight the excellent cooperation maintained between the European Parliament delegation, the Commissioner for the Environment and the Council, through the Belgian Presidency, throughout the Conference.
The second message from Bonn is a change in the economic model: from a fire-based, fuel-using economy, to one which is coal-based.
In this economy, a ton of coal has a set price and carbon dioxide emissions represent a cost that must be factored into the overall costs of all products and into the annual financial statements of all companies.
We will therefore be seeing, in all economic sectors, a conversion to cleaner technologies.
Obviously, the competitive advantages will go to those who convert the quickest.
This is precisely where the mistake in President Bush' s calculation lies that is already beginning to concern North American businessmen, as we saw in Bonn: In the short term, Kyoto will cost less than was thought and will bring competitive advantages in the medium term.
The third message from Bonn concerns globalisation.
Climate change has become more than an environmental dossier, it has become an issue that symbolises the environmental regulation of globalisation.
The Bonn conference thereby demonstrated, for the first time, that those who have moved quickly and effectively to promote the advantages of globalisation are also able to act to minimise the harmful effects of that same globalisation.
This is the great hope that was generated in Bonn: it is possible to find common solutions to global problems.
Commissioner, I too want to begin by offering my congratulations on what happened in Bonn.
Many of us went there with misgivings about the likely result of the conference.
These were, of course, felt particularly keenly in July when it was feared that what had been discussed previously would simply go by the board.
I want to emphasise that my political group and I are deeply impressed both with the Commissioner's work and with the Swedish and Belgian presidencies.
I am talking here not only about what happened at the Bonn conference itself but also about the sound preparatory work which, for example, the Commissioner carried out by travelling around a number of countries to try to convince them of the importance of the Kyoto Protocol.
We can only regret the fact that there is no political will for change on the other side of the Atlantic.
It is only to be hoped that, in time, there will be political developments aimed at persuading the United States too to take part in this necessary work.
American companies will probably also appreciate in the long term that they are missing something by not being involved in this development.
There is no going back now.
If we are to be able to make some impact upon climate change, everyone must participate, especially the United States which is one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases.
It is now a question of putting words into action.
As I have pointed out throughout these discussions, the Kyoto Protocol is only the beginning.
It sounds hopeful when the Commissioner now promises that we shall have a ratification proposal before the end of the year and that the intention is to return with communications and proposals on trading in emissions rights.
On this issue, I want to emphasise what Parliament has said previously, namely that trading in emissions rights must never become the biggest part of the commitment.
A real change has to take place.
We must change our transport systems and we must reduce emissions if there is to be less of an effect upon the climate.
That also applies to sinks.
There are, of course, a number of shortcomings in the Protocol and the decision.
It had been hoped that the sinks would not have been so important.
Norway has set a good example by saying that it does not intend to make use of its sinks in the same way.
It would be all to the good if more countries were to follow that example.
We must wait to see what happens at the conference in Marrakesh.
Sooner or later, it will also be time to begin discussing how we are to make further progress.
Practical proposals are required if progress is really to take place and if we are not simply to get bogged down in the Kyoto Protocol.
Allow me, finally, to thank the Commissioner and the Presidency for the sound work they have done.
Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that, at a time of violent clashes in Genoa and concern over globalisation, the outcome of the Bonn Summit should have renewed peoples' faith in the political process.
I hope so - it certainly did mine.
Together with Mr Pronk and the Belgian Presidency, you have achieved a great deal.
You provided an immense service to the environment and strengthened European influence.
I would like to congratulate and thank you.
I was pleased with aspects of the deal, the compromise over nuclear power for example was as good as we could get.
But overall the agreement is weak.
What matters, however, is the process that has now been established.
I know that Mr de Roo has instructed me in the past about how the process and the importance of it cannot be overestimated, pointing for example at the way in which the Montreal Protocol has been developed into a really effective instrument from a rather poor beginning over the past decade.
But the Kyoto process is going to be very much harder.
The priorities are to have it ratified, to get our own Member States to implement effective action plans, and not only to launch emissions trading but to prove that it can work, which is the hardest task of all.
And if we can make it work, then I hope that American business will be attracted and the whole political climate across the globe will change.
You have still a lot to do.
The vast majority in this House will strongly support you in your continuing efforts.
I thank you again.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the miracle of Bonn: the Kyoto baby learns to walk.
The Kyoto protocol is not dead, as President Bush has stated, but alive and kicking.
Kyoto is a baby that has learned to walk at the age of four.
Most babies learn to walk around their first birthday.
Better later than never, as we say in the Netherlands in this case.
One thing that is certain is that the Kyoto baby needs to grow considerably in order to keep climate change under control.
But that other environmental baby, the Treaty of Montreal of 1987, also needed fourteen years to combat the gap in the ozone layer effectively.
The same will apply to our Kyoto baby.
President Bush is already experiencing that there is much truth in the Dutch saying: he who breaks, pays.
He who walks out of negotiations, loses.
The Japanese Minister, Mr Kawaguchi, arrived in Washington today for a six-day visit to try to persuade President Bush to change his mind and participate.
There are very good reasons for doing so.
CO2 emissions are twice as high in the United States as in Europe.
It is no surprise then that there should be studies, like that of Florentin Krause, which show that the United States, by pursuing a shrewd energy policy, could both meet the levels of Kyoto and achieve 1% extra economic growth.
In order to step up the pressure on President Bush even further, my group and, fortunately, Parliament too, proposes organising CoP-9 in the United States in 2003.
By then, the Kyoto baby will be a child of school age and will have to learn to talk, especially about the international trade in CO2 rights.
In Bonn, American business seemed very interested in participating in that international trade after 2008.
The companies felt that they had been left out in the cold by their own President.
The European Union persuaded them by teaching the Kyoto baby to walk, but now it needs to learn to run.
I would like to ask the Commission to submit the Kyoto protocol for ratification before CoP-7 in Marrakech, and to put the proposal for internal CO2 trade before CoP-7.
Finally, regarding the transport sector, which is so difficult to curb, I would advise the Commission to publish proposals restricting the CO2 emissions from vans and trucks.
In conclusion, I should like to express a word of thanks to the troika for the unanimous leadership of the European delegation and to the Belgian Presidency for its special balancing skills; to the Commission for the flexible and effective cooperation in Bonn, to the G-77 for the constructive attitude and to the environmental movement for its strikingly constructive contribution to teaching the Kyoto baby to walk.
Commissioner, if we measure the achievements of Bonn against what we hoped for five years ago with regard to climate change, the results are meagre.
On the other hand, if we measure what was achieved by that battle that you waged, Commissioner - in conjunction with Parliament' s delegation and that of the rest of the Commission - to conclude the agreement that was finally reached, we must thank you, Commissioner, and this delegation for having concluded an agreement that is fundamentally consistent, in that all the countries adopted this approach. The result of this was to isolate the United States who, unfortunately, is sticking to a position that is not in the interests of the world as a whole.
I also feel that the exclusion of nuclear energy as an alternative to reducing greenhouse gases is a positive development.
We cannot conceal our reticence over emissions trading and its monitoring or the use of sinks.
The European Parliament has already stated, on several occasions, that sinks should only be used in a limited and carefully monitored way.
These issues are of concern to us.
We are also concerned about follow-up and monitoring mechanisms for compliance and the issue of possible sanctions in the event of non-compliance.
Of greatest concern to us is the fact that the report by the European Environment Agency states that unless decisions are taken immediately, by 2010 emissions will increase by 6%.
In our future work - and here I agree with my fellow speakers - it is, therefore, we industrialised countries that will have to lead the way in this reduction of emissions.
It is crucial that we ratify the protocol and make greater reductions than those laid down in the agreement.
We must introduce legally binding measures, take action on transport, which emits huge quantities of CO2 and clarify the amount of aid to be given to developing countries to ensure that they take similar action.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in congratulating the Commission on its negotiating tactics and success.
I think it is as the Commissioner said: the protocol has been saved.
Obviously, this in itself will not solve the problems.
The problems inherent in climate change and what needs to be done to stop climate change go far beyond what was agreed in Bonn.
But it is an important first step.
We must counter those who criticise the Kyoto protocol in principle - a number of members from Germany, for example, have said that the whole protocol is useless - and those who, as environmental politicians, have said it is useless because it does not go far enough, by saying that, if your house is on fire and you think it will take ten fire engines to put it out, you are hardly going to turn the first fire engine away and say, please do not start fighting the fire until all ten fire engines are here; you do what you can as quickly as possible, bearing in mind that other measures are needed.

These other measures are being negotiated both at international level and, of course, in the European Union.
Now we have to tackle the question of implementation.
You made a number of important announcements on that today, Commissioner, and you have our support.
We must keep talking to the Americans at international level.
A lot of people, including here in Parliament, are hugely critical of the Americans because of their policy in just about every political arena.
I think we should concentrate on fundamentals.
We should make it clear to our American friends that we do not agree with them on numerous counts but that we can live with our differences.
However, in this area, we Europeans cannot live with the fact that the Americans keep holding back.
And we need to tell them as much again and again.
Mr President, I too say bravo, Commissioner.
Well done.
For the rest, it never fails to astound me just how united Europeans are on the question of climate change and the measures needed to counter it.
I think that climate policy is a policy people can identify with in Europe and we should turn this to our advantage.
I also think that it is our duty to work on the American public, so that they follow our lead.
Perhaps, in this case, we are one step ahead of the Americans, just as public opinion on other questions is often one step ahead of Europe.
I should like to comment on one point of view: the impact of this climate policy on energy policy.
The whole point of climate policy is that it requires us to put a price on CO2 in the future.
Let us suppose that your estimates are right and that CO2 costs about EUR 30 a tonne.
That means that electricity from brown coal will rise by about 3.5 eurocents and electricity from hard coal will rise by about 3 eurocents.
The price of renewable sources of energy will not rise, i.e. they will become more competitive.
But nor will the price of nuclear energy rise.
As is it not excluded from emission trading and is only banned where there is joint implementation, this works to the advantage of nuclear energy.
This completely changes the weightings within the energy spectrum.
That is not the subject of this evening' s debate, but it will be subject of debates over coming months and years.
I just wanted to point that out.
For the rest, I share the view of many of my fellow members who said that this is a process.
We have only just begun it and we must stick with it.
The very fact of having been there is, I think a very good thing.
Mr President, Commissioner, may I add my congratulations?
Kyoto has ultimately not remained an empty promise.
At the last moment, Bonn produced the political signal that was necessary. It is a signal on the basis of which Kyoto can become a reality.
We must make a start on this project as soon as possible, not only in Europe, but also in other parts of the world.
Political agreements must now be translated into concrete action with visible results, because that is the way to strengthen political support for climate policy.
The signal must now be seen and heard everywhere.
The struggle against the emission of greenhouse gases is a worldwide challenge in third-world countries where the results of the rise in sea level and the change in weather patterns are making themselves painfully felt.
It is a global task, for which Europe must take its share of the responsibility.
We must invest and not forget that at present there are two billion people without electricity.
Sustainable energy can give a boost to development.
Much more discussion is needed with the United States, where the main fear is loss of jobs.
We must now demonstrate that, in fact, the economic effects are favourable.
Sustainable development must lead to sustainable growth.
Within the Union, we must now quickly begin the ratification process and launch the system of emission rights.
Industry is keen to have clarity and to start rightaway.
We must make the transition to a low-CO2 economy and give this a concrete form. This requires research and innovation.
It is of great importance for us to join forces in a common research programme.
The framework programme for research and Article 169 offer a good basis for this.
Climate policy is also a component of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
It must be adopted across the product and packaging policy, transport policy and energy policy.
In each Member State, action programmes must be introduced and clear political choices must be made on the way in which Kyoto is realised.
In this way, Kyoto and Bonn will culminate in an unparalleled burst of innovation.
It is now time for action.
Mr President, the Members of Parliament have been too kind to me personally because the Commission has the best climate change team in the world.
It is thanks to their excellent preparation of our negotiations and the preparatory work within the European Union that we have been able to succeed.
But we were also able to speak with one voice in Bonn, which led to better results, and we stayed united.
We worked well with NGOs and I believe that this also contributed to this good result.
As you said, the real result in Bonn was that we put the international framework in place.
Of course we had to make some very unsatisfactory concessions, and the end result and the real reductions were limited in a way that we are not at all happy with, but we will have to live with this framework for a very long time.
It will be subject to many adaptations and political changes and exposed to market forces, which will lead to change over time.
However, we took the initiative from the very beginning and we were able to carry it through to an international agreement.
Now we can work within that.
We can change and develop it.
The total emission reduction required, for example, for Japan is 14% and for Canada around 15% so there is still a real effort to be made for these countries.
But of course we are not happy with some of the substantial concessions we had to make.
The second point I want to make which underlines what you have stated is that we now have to move from words to deeds.
Again it is only by showing the way, leading by example, that we can stay credible.
So I will shortly be presenting these three proposals to continue this work.
We should stay in the lead in the world debate about climate change.
We should be the first to present different initiatives at conferences or whatever, to exchange good practice, and so on.
I would like your cooperation. My intention is to keep the initiative and ensure that we lead the world in combating climate change.
We now have to concentrate on Marrakesh and putting all the legal texts in place so that these can be implemented.
Everything will stand or fall with their implementation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
At the end of the debate, I have received six draft motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Safety and air transport
Mr President, the advent of competition in the air transport sector has certainly resulted in the lowering of prices of air travel for the 370 million consumers of the European Union.
However, there is a growing dissatisfaction among air travellers with regard to the quality of service which they are receiving from many airlines within the EU.
It is very important that air passengers are fully aware of their legal rights when problems arise with flights.
These are matters which I am addressing in my report.
We cannot deny that the issue of developing deep-vein thrombosis is not a serious concern for air passengers.
I am calling on the European Commission as a matter of urgency to allocate more monies from the EU research budget to carry out an independent evaluation of the possible public health risks for air passengers travelling on long-haul flights.
This includes the need to carry out a comprehensive study into the whole issue of deep-vein thrombosis.
I am calling on the European Commission to carry out this independent research in consultation with EU airline companies and EU consumer groups.
I believe that European Union airlines should not be afraid of addressing the issue of deep-vein thrombosis.
The solution to this problem may not be as hard as some EU airlines may envisage.
It is very important that passengers are fully informed as to what they should do to guarantee that deep-vein thrombosis will not develop.
European Union airlines, consumer groups and air crew workers must all work together to guarantee that all public health issues concerning air travel are fully addressed.
Safer travel for air passengers in Europe must at all times be the ultimate objective for EU governments and EU airlines.
I have nothing in principle against the implementation of voluntary codes of practice for European Union airlines.
However it is very important that any codes of practice which are drawn up by EU airlines are fully evaluated and monitored to ensure that they are rigorously enforced.
While voluntary agreements play an important role with regard to the whole issue of air travel, EU institutions and EU governments must not be afraid to intervene and legislate on issues to promote and protect air passenger rights.
In this report I am calling on the European Commission to bring forward specific proposals outlining how the charter of passenger rights in Europe can be marketed to a greater extent.
This will help to guarantee that all air passengers in Europe are kept fully informed as to their legal rights with regard to air travel.
This charter of passenger rights currently exists in European Union airports but many passengers are not fully aware of its existence or do not fully understand its provisions.
This report includes a proposal calling on European Union airlines to inform passengers of the percentage degree seat pitch available to passengers travelling in economy class.
It is clearly the case that there is more room available for economy class passengers travelling with some airlines than with others.
I am also calling on the European Union and the airlines to improve access for disabled passengers, children and the elderly and to prohibit European Union airlines from charging an extra fee for assisting persons who are immobile onto any aeroplane within the European Union.
Finally I believe that this report had the broad support of the political groups within Parliament's Committee on Transport.
I am hopeful and confident that the European Commission will now bring forward the necessary legislative proposals to ensure that passenger rights for the citizens of the European Union are greatly improved as a matter of urgency.
, representing the Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first, our thanks to the rapporteur.
The Commission proposal for a European Aviation Safety Agency comes in response to a long-standing demand by Parliament.
The Aviation Safety Agency is our second agency in the transport sector; a third for the railways and rail safety will ensue.
I think this strategy of creating European agencies is an ideal way of helping the European transport markets to integrate.
The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has already proposed a number of important amendments for the Aviation Safety Agency, such as strengthening the agency, giving it more independence and extending its remit.
I also think it is important - and I speak here on behalf of Mr Kuckelkorn - that we accept an amendment proposed by the Committee on Budgets on funding.
Come what may, we must ensure that we have efficiency, transparency and controlled costs.
These two agencies give us the opportunity to take a clear line right from the outset.
My group has also tabled a number of proposed amendments.
The first concerns the composition of the administrative board.
We are calling for employers and employees to be given a seat on the board.
Another proposed amendment concerns the creation of local offices of the agency, which have been suggested in order to allay the fears of a number of Member States about loss of sovereignty.
We expect the Member State in which the agency is located to make a financial contribution.
One purpose of this rule is to prevent a Member State from pressurising its agency, i.e. the agency established on its sovereign territory, into setting up local offices.
Here too I am positive that this is a reasonable and legitimate concern on the part of Parliament and I therefore call on you to support it.
Mr President, in the extremely interesting debate that we have heard this morning following Mr Prodi' s presentation of the White Paper on governance, he said that the control exercised by this Parliament, including control over budgetary matters, should not be concerned with questions of detail but should check whether the instruments are achieving their objectives and should adopt more of a political approach and less of an accounting one.
Perhaps this is why the Committee on Budgetary Control has made a few suggestions for the creation of an Aviation Safety Agency, such as, for example, that we again adopt the model of control used by the two agencies set up in 1975, which are Cedefop, in Thessaloniki and the Dublin Foundation.
According to this model, granting discharge to the agencies was the responsibility of the European Parliament.
Between 1990 and 1997, nine agencies were created, but it could be said that creating an external agency gives the Council carte blanche to do what it likes.
This idea is not borne out by reality, however, because the agency set up to deal with the issue of Kosovo in Thessaloniki in 1999 is a return to the model according to which it is Parliament, at the behest of the Council, that gives discharge to the Director and the board of management.
This is, I believe, in harmony with the form of governance that we are seeking to adopt on the Commission' s proposal and that would be beneficial to the Agency itself, because in this way, the external agency does not have to mean lesser control of Community funds, a control which is the responsibility of the European Parliament.
We also emphasise, in the fourth amendment, the need to incorporate in its rules of procedure the requirement for periodical external assessments of the Agency.
I must repeat that the external Agency will have freedom of action, but we would like to have an independent expert cast an eye over it from time to time to see whether the Agency is fulfilling the objective that has been proposed for it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has examined the proposal for a regulation very carefully.
It obviously supports the aim of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency.
However, we realise that we somehow need to harmonise the legal framework within which such agencies are created.
A great many agencies have now been set up: the Aviation Safety Agency, the Food Agency, the Agency for Medical Products.
It is high time we had a clear legal framework for starting up these agencies.
The two previous speakers have already commented on certain aspects.
I am grateful that the Commission announced in its White Paper on European governance that it intends to take a somewhat clearer line here.
Sparks obviously fly when these agencies are created because decision-making powers are transferred to external institutions even if, Mr Schmitt, the final decision does not, of course, always rest with these agencies.
It is especially important to us that the supervisory committees be made up of equal numbers of representatives from the various European institutions and for the European Parliament not to lose its rights of influence by outsourcing decisions.
It is also important to us for the legal recourse created within these agencies' procedures to be in keeping with the European Treaties and the principles of the rule of law.
Another particular cause for concern is that the powers of intervention created for these agencies need to be in keeping with the fundamental civil rights on which we agreed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We have tabled proposed amendments on these points and we are grateful that they are at least being accepted in part.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me firstly thank our rapporteur and all the Members for the speed with which the European Parliament has worked on the proposal concerning the implementation of a European Aviation Safety Agency.
I think that it is not totally out of place to say this, and that it practically amounts to the launch of an appeal to the Council and the Commission, to make sure that the proposal comes to fruition as quickly as possible, for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has, naturally, first ascertained the industrial interest in such an agency.
As you already know, we have an urgent need for the equivalent of the American Federal Aviation Administration if we want the Airbus standard to be commercially viable at international level, in particular the new A 380 programme.
The Committee on Industry has been very sensitive to these issues. It has not dramatically increased the number of amendments and has made sure that we can proceed as fast as possible towards the effective creation of this tool that the European aeronautical industry has been waiting for with bated breath in the great international competition which places it, fairly regularly and not without controversy, face to face with its great American rival.
This is why we are satisfied with the proposal, in the hope that the Council will prove to be generous enough in the assessment of the amendments that are presented to it.
My second important point concerns the problem of political control.
We think that the concept of safety is formulated by specialists and technicians, but politics cannot be pushed to the sidelines.
With each of the large-scale events and accidents that have recently taken place, for example with Concorde or the Mont-Blanc tunnel, we have requested answers from the public authorities.
It is therefore necessary that this new agency be a technical tool for standardisation and certification primarily fed from the work of experts and manufacturers, but it should also be politically controlled.
This is the reason for which we have put forward amendments requesting that the executive director of such an agency, or even the agency itself, can make itself available to Parliament or, at the very least, be heard by Parliament.
There are those who even hope that it should have parliamentary representatives on the administrative board, for the administrative board is a body that is not technical but political in nature.
Finally, we are hoping that, in the committees of experts, the greatest cooperation will be open to all parties concerned, notably in relation to the creation of the "single sky" or problems relating to air control.
We think that this should be carried out in consultation with both sides of industry and workers' representatives, otherwise we will be creating insurmountable obstacles to the objectives we are pursuing.
So, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main conclusions of the Committee on Industry.
Mr President, I apologise to Mr Schmitt and to Mr Collins for the fact that I was delayed elsewhere and did not hear their introductory remarks.
The opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, of which I was the draftsman, was unanimously carried and we are delighted to see that many of our recommendations have been endorsed by the two rapporteurs.
We have to move on from the old excuses, the legal challenges mounted by IATA and the opposition to even modest voluntary agreements which we still hear on some sides.
This is essentially a matter of the safety, as well as of the convenience, of the consumer.
For that reason we particularly welcome the adoption of amendments on consumer health and safety in the Schmitt report's emphasis on the provision of information on health and safety requirements for airline passengers and the Collins report's adoption of the proposal that there should be an evaluation of health risk and research into matters like deep-vein thrombosis.
The fact is that passengers today suffer not merely from being dumped from airlines, from the problem of lost baggage, but from other things which are often not the fault of the airlines themselves.
They principally suffer from a lack of information.
If the new agency does one thing, like the food standards agency which we are about to set up, it must be open, it must be transparent. We need to see how its investigations work.
We need to see how its personnel are selected.
It must be done on the basis of merit and without any links to the industry.
All of those are possible if we adopt these two reports.
I hope the House will give an emphatic welcome in the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Collins on his work, his serious, objective and rigorous work in drawing up this report on protecting the rights of air passengers in the European Union.
I fully agree with the rapporteur when he states that it is necessary - and I would say quite urgent - that we improve the current level of protection in cases of denied boarding, flight cancellations, unjustified delays which, in many cases, lead to connections with other flights or with other means of transport being missed and a long list of similar problems, which is growing every day, not to mention the fact that we Members of this Parliament are long-suffering victims of these inconveniences.
We must put a stop to this deterioration of quality before it becomes irreversible.
I must thank the Commissioner for the efforts that her department is making to achieve this, but in order to achieve this, we must undertake a thorough and appropriate review of current legislation in this field and improve all aspects of it that will lead to greater and better protection of passengers' rights.
We also need to closely monitor the voluntary agreements signed by airlines, which are also designed to improve air transport conditions.
Mainly, however, what is essential is a form of vigilance that ensures total compliance with current legislation, which often appears to be nothing more than a useless piece of paper and as such, cannot serve the purposes for which it was intended.
This is the aspect on which immediate and effective action can and must be undertaken.
To start with, we should firmly insist that a 'Charter on Passenger Rights' be properly marketed - as the rapporteur has already suggested.
Precise, clear, intelligible and full information is necessary to ensure that passengers are aware of their rights and of how to exercise them and, of course, we cannot accept these posters being hidden away in obscure corners into which few people go in many airports.
This information must be sufficiently publicised and made available to all users and not only in airports but also at points of ticket sales, in travel agencies and also, as far as possible, in the media.
Unless we ensure that passengers have access to information on their rights, which in many cases means that they cannot exercise these rights, there is no point at all in embarking on a legislative process whose outcome might also end up being nothing more than a useless piece of paper.
Mr President, I want to talk mainly about the European Aviation Safety Agency, the EASA, but I am bound to make an observation about passengers' rights, also directed to the Commissioner.
Whatever the airlines promise and whatever agreements they reach among themselves to display splendid lists detailing the rights of passengers, in practice very little comes of it.
Also from my own experience, it is clear that many things often go wrong.
I should therefore wish to call for as many binding agreements as possible that are also laid down in legislation as well as for sanctions for failure to fulfil all kinds of promises to passengers.
As I said, I wish to speak mainly about EASA.
The setting up of EASA and the provisional definition of its responsibilities are an important step on the way to complete harmonisation of safety rules in civil aviation.
This is necessary and desirable, given the growing importance of the sector at European level, of unambiguous competition rules and of uniform standards, and in view of the need to strengthen the EU' s influence at a global level.
We have opted for a cautious start which, in the first instance, will only involve European certification of new types of aircraft, such as the A 380.
That is quite reasonable because the Authority still has to find its niche alongside the national aviation bodies, which will, of course, continue to have a role.
Duplication must be avoided by efficient pooling of available expertise and capacity.
Based on a certain timeframe, the mandate of EASA can then be expanded to include other aspects of flight safety, such as the human aspect, the quality of pilot training, etc.
Legislation and the amendments too rightly cover the health and wellbeing of the passengers on board and of the environment, particularly the question of emissions.
Our citizens are increasingly worried about these things. The work of EASA will have to help reduce these concerns.
The amendments by the European Parliament make it clear that the independence of the Agency has priority.
It must be able to operate free of political interference and certification processes.
At the end of the present Regulation, the inevitable comitology crops up.
We continue to have our doubts, however, whether this will contribute to the efficient and independent functioning of EASA.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal group, I should like to compliment Mr Schmitt on his report.
Safety, decisive action and accountability are the three benchmarks for my group.
Is the Authority contributing to safety in aviation?
In our eyes it is, certainly now that aircraft that are registered in third countries, but whose flights are carried out by a Member State, fall under this directive.
I have submitted an amendment to define the Authority' s overall responsibilities more precisely.
The Commission should come up with a proposal by the end of next year at the latest on what new tasks EASA can assume.
The most important of these is the granting of permits for aircraft crew in the European Union.
What matters is the increased safety of people in aircraft, both passengers and crew. It is not only a matter of the quality of the steel.
EASA must also be able to take decisive action and that depends on the structure, but also on the quality of the managers.
That is why the board of management and the director must have relevant experience.
As a ten-year term is quite enough, only one reappointment should be sufficient.
Finally, accountability.
We consider it important that all these independent agencies should be accountable to Parliament.
The best way of achieving this to ensure that the Commission has a place in the structure of these agencies.
If we weaken the role of the Commission too far it will create serious problems of political accountability.
We took the same line on these and other points with the European Maritime Safety Agency.
I also followed Mr Collins' report with great interest because I myself was rapporteur for a comparable subject, namely liability in aviation.
We can identify well with the final version.
Many of our amendments have been adopted, for which we are grateful.
I should like to mention two more things.
Firstly, I consider it essential that passengers should be informed in good time.
Finally, Mr Lynn submitted a number of amendments to stress the fact that airlines should to their utmost to alert passengers to the danger of aviation-related thrombosis, even on short flights.
Mr President, on behalf of the Green Group I would like to welcome both of these reports.
In the limited speaking time I have, I want to focus on just one aspect and that is the health aspects of flying.
It is true to say that in the past the airlines have been woefully neglecting passengers' health.
That is beginning to change but there is still a long way to go.
I particularly welcome the fact that Mr Collins has devoted a clear section in his report to health and I strongly support his calls for the airlines to be far more proactive in giving information about health risks.
We need far greater clarity.
Information should be available when you book your ticket.
It needs to be there in doctors' surgeries.
There needs to be a health briefing in the same form as the current safety briefing on board, including advice on the preventative measures that can be taken.
Of course life is not risk-free but there has to be a balance in that risk and if people know what the choices are, they are more likely to be able to make an informed judgement.
On deep-vein thrombosis for example, although for over ten years there have been reports of people getting blood clots after travelling by plane no comprehensive independent research has been carried out.
According to a recent report in The Lancet by a London-based consultant, as many as one in ten people get blood clots of some kind on long-haul flights.
Clearly serious health risks are very slight for the vast majority but for a few they are very real.
We need to respond to that in terms of both research and the action resulting from that research.
More space in aircraft, for example, and less emphasis in getting as many people on board, in as small a place as possible with as much profit as possible.
There was another example in the press this morning.
A Canadian researcher was saying that as a result of air recycling in the cabin some passengers are at risk of catching diseases as serious as tuberculosis.
His claims have been refuted by the airlines.
The issue here is not the rights or wrongs of this latest allegation but the fact that this type of uncertainty will continue unless we have a new proactive strategy based on more and better research, appropriate action by the airlines and better information to the public.
Mr President, I am in favour of anything that leads to the standardisation of safety regulations in air transportation.
The creation of a European Aviation Safety Agency, in place of the current informal collaboration between the fifteen Member States, would be the least that could be done to establish common rules in the field of aviation.
It would however have taken, according to the report, twenty years of bargaining for this measure of simple good sense to be taken.
In spite of the euphemisms used, the report recognises that the length of negotiations is due to the difficulty of reconciling EU Member States' national interests, and behind these the various, even opposing, industrial interests.
Thus, the report brings to mind the principle of subsidiarity relating to the functioning of airports, and insists on the necessary confidentiality of enquiries made by the agency with regard to legislation on industrial property.
The fact that the differences in interests between the industrial groups concerned have not disappeared augers badly for the authority which will be granted to this agency to impose all the measures useful for the safety of passengers.
Mr President, like motherhood and apple pie, no-one could possibly be against safety, especially when it involves aeroplanes.
But make no mistake: the real agenda of this proposal is further political integration.
For, as the Commission so eloquently puts it in its own document, it intends to create the European Aviation Safety Agency through the gradual integration of national systems.
That seems to me to be a driving force for the whole of the European Union - the gradual integration of national systems.
I wish that phrase could be plastered in massive letters on billboards around the United Kingdom so that my fellow subjects could really understand what is really going on.
As Mr Duisenberg put it recently when he described the euro as a symbol of political integration, we have here yet another symbol - the European Aviation Safety Agency.
But what is particularly striking here, apart from the fact that we already have an independent intergovernmental agency in the Joint Aviation Authority, is the stark admission that continued intergovernmental cooperation is to be abandoned as it is developed and I quote from the rapporteur's report: "would have involved lengthy ratification procedures in the national parliaments of the states concerned . . ., which would not necessarily have been successful".
How awkward and inconvenient democracy is.
Rather like the Irish population when they run a referendum, you can never rely on it to behave.
Much easier, therefore, to create another European institution and get rid of the whole messy business.
Administratively convenient it may be, democracy it is not.
But it is symbolic of the European Union's experience.
Given the aviation content here, and with due deference to the rapporteur, I can only conclude with a phrase that really will not translate from the English: "What a Messerschmidt".
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, first I should like to join Ojeda Sanz in thanking Mr Collins for his excellent report and Mr Schmitt for his excellent report.
Both have presented us with a magnum opus.
As far as the question of aviation safety is concerned, Commissioner, you have now presented us with a proposal on establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation and creating a European Aviation Safety Agency long after the single market was completed and other Commissioners had let the subject drop.
This will at last allow us to replace the safety regulations adopted by bureaucrats in the Member States with uniform, European provisions accepted by Parliament.
At last we can create a truly uniform European area of safety in the European skies.
We hope that safety will be enhanced by strict and uniform controls.
In this respect we support your proposal.
The purpose of the amendments proposed by the committee, as Mr Schmitt rightly said, is to strengthen the technical independence of the European Aviation Safety Agency still further, without wanting to diminish your personal parliamentary responsibility.
We trust that this agency will be able to start work in time to grant the symbol of the independent European aviation industry, namely the new Airbus A380, a joint project involving numerous employees, numerous engineers and numerous workers in European countries, the first uniform certification for European airspace.
If it does, then I think we will have done both the aviation industry and safety a huge service.
Mr President, Commissioner, I shall deal specifically with the Collins report.
I wish to congratulate Mr Collins on his work and also the Commission on having presented us with this report on protecting the rights of air transport passengers.
This is an issue which concerns an increasing number of people, more Europeans, because the numbers of air passengers are increasing.
Dissatisfaction is also growing, however, with regard to the transport available to us and with the conditions in which they are provided.
The European Parliament and the Commission have the responsibility of protecting the interests of Europeans travelling via air transport.
It is true that the problems faced by passengers are not entirely the fault of the airlines; they are also caused by the airports, and we must confront both of these situations.
These days, airports feel like underground stations, in which the density of people is such that there is no degree of comfort and it is difficult to feel safe.
With regard to transport, passengers demand safety but they also want to know in advance the conditions in which they will be travelling.
I am grateful to Mr Collins for having accepted many of the amendments that we tabled to his report, because I feel it has been genuinely useful to include them.
Passengers must know in advance and be able to compare the conditions that the transport offers them.
Not only the prices, but also the conditions of safety, of comfort - the distances between seats, for example - and also conditions such as the air quality. One possibility that has been mentioned, admittedly, is for flights to become no smoking, but the conditions of safety against pollution have been reduced in order to reduce air transport costs.
We must confront this problem vigorously and I also wish to ask Commissioner Loyola de PalÃ¡cio whether she still intends to table legislation in this field by the end of the year, and, if so, what will it be?
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Collins on his report, which I believe brings a sensible compromise to the Commission's proposal.
As aviation is the most regulated form of transport, I welcome the commitment by the industry, as agreed in Lisbon in May, to implement the voluntary passenger service commitment.
This is undoubtedly the best way forward as over-regulation would be extremely damaging to the aviation industry Europe-wide, and in particular in the United Kingdom, and would result in our being uncompetitive.
The report is explicit in saying that the desire to protect air passengers should not hinder competition, whilst at the same time the voluntary agreement is comprehensive and detailed in those areas which need to be improved.
I hope the Commission will resist in bringing forward legislative proposals as it is only right and proper that the industry should be given sufficient time to implement fully this agreement.
On one tiny point here from Mr Collins: the UK is the only country which has in place a minimum seat pitch requirement for safety reasons and I therefore believe that the European Union could follow that example.
Turning to the Schmitt Report, we should congratulate Mr Schmitt on clarifying and improving the Commission's proposals, although I still have deep reservations in a number of areas.
Nevertheless I believe that there is general agreement that a pan-European body is required in particular in the area of aircraft manufacture, although there is still ambiguity in relation to ICAO rules, which clearly state that both individual certification of aircraft and design changes and modifications are the responsibility of states of registering.
Finally despite asking the Commission on a number of occasions, we are still unclear as to the future role of national civil aviation authorities, the JAA, as the proposed regulation does not define its parameters.
In addition, I believe at this stage efforts should be concentrated on achieving uniform applicability of ICAO, JAA, and Eurocontrol standards that are already in existence.
The EC should not seek to parallel and create unwilling distortions of the current ICAO-based safety framework.
I look forward to the Commission's response.
Mr President, I welcome the proposals to provide legal rights for passengers as well as the increase in denied boarding compensation and the right to reimbursement for delayed flights.
The idea of new contract standards between carriers and consumers is not only welcome but long overdue.
To be delayed is a nuisance.
To be denied information as to the cause of the delay, with little by way of an apology or compensation, is unacceptable.
Hopefully, with the support of the airlines and the work done by Mr Collins in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, things will now change for the better.
We can never take aviation safety for granted.
Today my colleague Mrs Cerdeira told me of the tragic crash last week of an old CN-235, converted from military use, on a Melilla to Malaga flight, with loss of life.
I extend the sympathies of Mrs Cerdeira and myself to the relatives of the victims.
Regarding the contributions of Mr Titford, I assumed he was speaking in a personal capacity.
Only people with a bizarre outlook on life and a peculiar political perspective can downgrade the importance of aviation safety in the pursuit of their own nationalistic objectives.
Safety should never be used as a political football.
I condemn Mr Titford for so doing.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to congratulate the Commission and particularly the Commissioner on the various important initiatives being put forward for this sector.
I should also like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Collins and Mr Schmitt, on their magnificent work and mention one idea that I feel is particularly important in this matter.
The passenger protection dossier is, together with the single sky, safety and protection of the environment, an important dossier for air transport, for passengers and also for the image of European integration in the eyes of the public.
We are all aware of the importance of this means of transport and also of the contradiction that exists between the Europe of the air and terrestrial Europe: whilst traditional borders are disappearing, we are seeing these borders persist in the air transport sector.
Initiatives such as those that we are now discussing are, therefore, of great importance to the European public.
I come from the Balearic Islands, where dependence on the aeroplane is, as you all know, extremely high.
I know what it is to suffer airport chaos or interminable delays.
I therefore welcome the Commission' s intention to seek a balance between legislation and the voluntary commitments affecting airlines, airports and airport authorities, not to mention the tourist industry.
This is an ambitious communication, which seeks to achieve this balance between the needs to establish guarantees for passengers and to ensure that air transport is efficient and competitive.
We must get the message across to users and make them fully aware of their rights, which are recognised by law when problems with flights occur.
I regret the impasse in which many initiatives in this sector are trapped within the Council and I hope that the appropriate agreements will be concluded so that we can move ahead without any further delay.
In the wake and in commemoration of the terrible accident that befell an aircraft en route from the Spanish city of Melilla, I should like to conclude by congratulating the Commission and Mr Schmitt on their work on the proposal to establish the European Aviation Safety Agency.
Reports such as the one by Mr Schmitt will be able, if not to prevent, which is impossible, to considerably reduce the number of these terrible accidents.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to the Schmitt report, we must congratulate both the Commission, on its proposal in response to the call from Parliament and, of course, the rapporteur on his sterling work.
The basic features of an agency such as this must be independence of action and efficiency, both of which apply in the present case.
However, having myself acted as rapporteur for a similar agency, the Maritime Safety Agency, which we recently debated here in the House, and having therefore addressed a similar issue, I should like to take this opportunity, without repeating the views already expressed, of endorsing the general view that similar rules should govern similar administrative mechanisms.
This obviously logical precept does not always apply to European Union texts or to European Parliament texts because, as we all know full well, each final text depends on the circumstances at the time in the various debating fora, especially when it comes to the vote.
For example, the proposal by our parliamentary committee which prevailed in plenary on the administrative board of the Maritime Safety Agency is completely different from the corresponding proposal in the case being debated today and amendments to improve it have, of course, been proposed.
Similarly, the Commission proposals also differ.
Is there any justification for these differences?
The same question could be applied to numerous points in many of our legislative texts. This is not something the relevant Union services, including Parliament, can be proud of.
Having said which, I think the Commission could run a comparative check on these texts and then table proposals for similar provisions to be adopted for similar cases and existing unwarranted contradictions to be abolished.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Collins on his excellent report and indeed for accepting my amendments on the health aspects of air travel.
Brenda Wilson is a Greater Manchester constituent of mine who is an active campaigner for the Aviation Health Institute, an organisation working internationally to improve air passenger health.
Tragically her son Neil died of a deep-vein thrombosis after a short flight to Benidorm.
He is one of an alleged 2000 air travellers who, according to some in the medical profession, die each year from deep-vein thrombosis, not just long haul, not just economy class, and therefore there is growing concern about the potential link between air travel and blood clots.
The research is ambiguous.
The World Health Organisation is putting GBP 7 million into research and I am asking you tonight to give your commitment to a European Union study to look at potential links between DVT and air travel and preventative action.
I am also asking the Commission to take up the idea in my amendment on improved health briefings and health warnings on tickets in advance of flying.
This will allow passengers, as consumers, to exercise the choice perhaps not to drink alcohol, perhaps to take aspirin three or four days before flying or to wear these new compression socks which help regulate blood flow in the legs.
There is no need to be an alarmist.
We know that air travel is safe but there is nonetheless a small risk for some passengers that they may develop blood clots.
We owe it to our European passengers to increase our knowledge and science in this area.
I would like your assurance that you will now respond to our call for research and meet as a matter of priority with the aviation industry to look at improved health warnings on tickets.
We are in favour of voluntary action but if it is true that the airlines have known for 30 years about the risks of DVT then maybe we need legislation.
Mr President, I should like to say, first of all, that we are discussing two quite different initiatives here.
One is of a legislative nature and concerns the creation of a European Aviation Safety Agency.
The other initiative concerns Parliament' s report on the Commission communication on protecting the rights of air transport passengers.
I wish to warmly congratulate both rapporteurs.
I shall begin with the initiative on the creation of the European Aviation Safety Agency.
I should also like to congratulate Mr Schmitt, of course, on his work.
In proposing common regulations for the civil aviation sector and the creation of a European Aviation Safety Agency, the Commission has borne in mind the objective of achieving a high and uniform level of safety, which is an essential factor for air transport.
It is also, perhaps the most fundamental passenger right.
We want to achieve this high and uniform level of safety throughout the European Union and also greater environmental protection.
This system of common regulations will also have the effect of promoting the internal market and of improving the competitiveness of the European aeronautical industry.
It is, of course, also an important factor for the Airbus project.
From now on, a single certificate will be sufficient for a company to be able to supply its products to the whole European market, whilst access to external markets will be simplified, as a result of the conclusion of agreements that will facilitate the harmonisation and the mutual recognition of the certificates.
The proposal under consideration today, therefore, represents a considerable step forwards, particularly if you take account of the objectives it is seeking to achieve. It also, however, represents a genuine innovation in the field of Community integration, if we bear in mind that, until now, the civil aviation sector has been greatly influenced by the sovereignty of Member States and by intergovernmental cooperation - an issue that the speakers have already raised.
With regard to the implementation of Community objectives, the Commission is authorised to adopt the appropriate technical standards and administrative procedures.
The purpose of creating this specialised Agency is to assist the Commission in implementing policy but the Agency will also have its own powers, since, in some cases, it will replace national administrations in issuing products with certificates of conformity with Community legislation - I repeat, this is crucial for the Airbus project, as Mr Jarzembowski said a moment ago - and, in other cases, will supervise the issuing of certificates by national administrations.
The parliamentary committees that have worked on this text have understood the importance of what is at stake and I thank them for their support for the Commission proposal.
With regard to the amendments that have been tabled, I can tell you that the Commission can accept most of them, because they improve and clarify our original proposal.
In fact, many of them are very similar to the comments made by the Council itself and will, therefore, be adopted in the consolidated modified proposal, either in part or, in some cases, with minor stylistic changes.
The Commission also unreservedly accepts strengthening the powers of the Executive Director, something to which the rapporteur referred in his speech, and the provisions on the Agency' s budgetary control.
On the other hand, we cannot accept some of the proposed amendments.
I shall list them with their numbers and explain why.
First of all, we do not feel that it is appropriate to include the revenue of the Agency and, therefore, its entire budget in the budget of the European Union.
This decision would run counter to the flexibility of management that we would like this body to have.
The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 4 and 56.
Some amendments could cause a degree of confusion, could be difficult to implement or fall outside the scope of the proposal and must, therefore, be rejected.
I am referring to Amendments Nos 3, 15, 17, 19, 28, 29, 54 and 65.
Nor can we accept Amendments Nos 5 and 62, which deal with the scope of the Regulation, as they stand, although, in this case and as a compromise, we can accept proposals being tabled in the year following the adoption of the Regulation, with regard to air operations and staff privileges.
With regard to the other areas, we cannot accept airports being definitively excluded.
We can only accept proposals being tabled later on these matters.
With regard to the publication of the results of inspections by national administrations, set down in Amendments Nos 24 and 30, the Commission does not consider this to be appropriate because confidential information, which could be the basis of criminal proceedings, is involved.
Such action nevertheless, does comply with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to the documents of the Community institutions.
I must also take a stand on the amendments dealing with the Agency' s independence, specifically, Nos 21, 32, 42, 43, 45, 53, 64, 70 and 71.
We all want this to be an independent body when it acts on technical issues, but this does not mean that it can be free from any kind of political control.
We would like to see the Agency independent of individuals, or of the various lobby groups that, as you would expect, exist in this sector and which are very active. We do not want to see the Agency independent of the Community institutions because, I repeat, there must inevitably be some form of political control.
Therefore, the Commission cannot accept the suggestions that seek to reduce its powers of control over the Agency.
Nevertheless, Amendment No 36, which reflects Parliament' s will not to participate in the Agency' s Administrative Board seems quite appropriate, if that is what Parliament wishes.
The work currently being undertaken in this House, as in the Council, proves that we are moving towards consensus on all aspects of this measure, with the exception of that of the influence of the Member States and the Community on control of the Agency.
It is, therefore, important that the Commission has the support of Parliament on this matter.
I should like to congratulate your rapporteur once again and thank you for the excellent work you have carried out.
With regard to the Commission communication on protecting passenger rights, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Collins, on having produced a detailed and stimulating report, which I read with great interest.
Having read the report, I have drawn the conclusion that Parliament and the Commission are, to a large extent, in agreement.
Both institutions attach high priority to the protection of passengers and we agree that this protection must be guaranteed by two approaches, which are not contradictory, but complementary.
The first approach is the voluntary agreements signed by the airlines and the second is laws that must be complied with.
Lastly, I shall give a brief summary of the actions planned for the near future and which, as you shall see, fully address your concerns and your suggestions.
Firstly, the monitoring of the voluntary commitments.
We fully concur that these agreements must provide for a mechanism for ensuring compliance with them if we really want them to be effective and to work properly and, therefore, to have credibility in the eyes of travellers.
Over the forthcoming months, we will be working conscientiously on these monitoring measures and on the out-of-court settlement of disputes.
I have already held a meeting with the airlines, to whom I made it very clear that this is a key issue, and I think that we can reach solutions that are acceptable to everyone.
Furthermore, passengers need to be well informed at every step, from the time they plan their trip until the flight itself, as Mr Ojeda said just now.
The airlines have given a serious commitment to provide better information, in line with their voluntary commitments.
With regard to the consumer reports comparing the profits of the various airlines, we will soon be instituting an experiment to try out various methods then to review legislation in light of the experience we have gained.
This is crucial.
Some passenger interests are so important that we must give them protection under the law.
In practical terms, we intend to propose legislation to Parliament and the Council in two specific areas: denied boarding and flight cancellations.
In relation to the first matter, we have drawn up a draft, which we are now fine-tuning, with the help of the comments of the various interested parties.
The second matter concerns the contracts airlines have with their customers.
At the end of this year we shall present a consultation document and, once we have received the reactions of those concerned, we will draft a proposal.
In the document, we shall be paying close attention to the rights of the disabled, an issue that some of the honourable Members have also raised today. We also hope that Parliament and the Council will rapidly approve the regulation, so that the standards of the Montreal Convention on the responsibility of Community airlines can apply and so that these new standards may enter into force by the end of next year.
Lastly, I shall refer to something that various speakers have highlighted, most recently by Mrs McCarthy and which concerns us all: the problems of passenger health.
We feel it is crucial to undertake a thorough and exhaustive assessment of the risks of travelling by aeroplane.
We are, therefore, financing research into cabin conditions under the Fifth Framework Programme and we are looking into how we can better support the studies into deep-vein thrombosis started by the World Health Organisation.
I must tell you that I have written personally to the chairmen of every airline to highlight this issue and to ask them, with the information now available, to immediately adopt measures to improve the situation.
In any event, although both initiatives will take a while, they will provide a solid basis for policy making and we shall keep this House fully informed.
To conclude, Mr President, I must say that I am delighted to see the degree of agreement between Parliament and the Commission. I must also tell you that on a flight with a certain airline, which was delayed by more than twenty minutes, we were informed that we had the right to a free flight with the same company for a period of one month, on the same route, just because there had been a delay of more than twenty minutes, in line with the conditions stated in their contract.
I am telling you this because the concerns and the actions of both Parliament and the Commission are yielding tangible results for the public, for users and for consumers.
Mr President, just a quick question to the Commissioner: we have stated on a number of occasions in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that we are still unclear as to the future role of the national civil aviation authorities and the JAA as the proposed regulation does not define its parameters.
I would be very grateful for the Commission's response.
It may not be possible this evening, but I would like more clarification on that area.
. (ES) Mr President, at a certain point, the two institutions, EASA and JAA, will converge and work together.
Some competences will remain with the JAA, such as staffing, for example but, with time, these will be incorporated into EASA.
In other words, at a certain point, the two institutions will converge, but only briefly.
In any event, I can send you the particular details of the matter, Mr Foster.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
System of ecopoints for heavy goods vehicles transiting through Austria
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly no easy task to have to draft a report on ones own country because one is all too subjective.
However, I shall endeavour to paint as objective a picture as I can.
I should start by clarifying that, when Austria negotiated its accession to the European Union, it asked for the content and substance of the Transit Agreement to be taken over in a protocol and hence be made part of its accession and its standing under the Treaty once it acceded to the European Union.
The Transit Agreement is without doubt doubly important because transit traffic in Austria - and this is a unique situation in the whole of the European Union - accounts for a very high proportion of overall traffic - up to 80% on many routes - and, because of Austria's geographical position and the fact that it is a relatively small country, it contributes to a relatively heavy environmental impact, especially in sensitive zones.
In addition, it is an area with practically no added value of its own.
Obviously, transit traffic cannot be separated from other types of traffic in the long term.
That is why the Transit Agreement has an expiry date of 2003, which is fast approaching.
Now the Commission does not like this agreement.
I can understand that it might not please everyone because, from a traffic policy point of view, it is far from perfect.
The Commission has tried various ways of sinking this agreement.
First it opined that the sanction mechanism was too heavy.
I admit that the Commission is materially right, I too understand that.
That is why I have taken account of Uli Stockmann's suggestion and my point 2 c) states that we in Parliament take the view that a better, sliding scale needs to be found.
Then the Commission said that the calculation did not work correctly in Austria.
I am not in a position to judge, it is a question of establishing the facts.
We decided in committee to call on the Commission to ensure that the calculations are correct because I for one do not want to sanction erroneous calculations.
But then the Commission decided that the sanction mechanism was all wrong, the calculations were all wrong and, if that does not work, then we are also opposed to the upper ceiling.
But clearly the upper ceiling for transit lorries was part of the agreement from the outset.
A provisional finding of the European Court of Justice states that this was a basic element in the transit agreement.
Nor is it true, as the Commission maintains, that this is, to a certain extent, a negative incentive to use environmentally-friendly vehicles.
Every haulier is better off using environmentally-friendly vehicles because he needs to use fewer ecopoints.
That is why, if nothing else, this regulation motivates hauliers to use more favourable, i.e. more environmentally-friendly vehicles.
Which is why I completely fail to understand why such a sustained attack is being mounted on an existing agreement which, anyway, is due to expire shortly.
Nor do I understand, Commissioner, why it is being mounted at a time when the Commission knows that Austria will have to reckon with a serious increase in transit traffic during the course of forthcoming enlargement.
I can gladly let you have a copy of the study by an independent economic institute concluding that, by the year 2015 - and I know that is a long way off - transit traffic will have increased four- to fivefold.
What I mean is that, in this situation, knowing that people are very sensitive to traffic issues, to change an existing agreement in this situation in order to create a different situation for perhaps one to one and a half years, is totally incomprehensible to me.
I should like to reiterate that this is not, in our view, about passing a new regulation. It is not about introducing additional restrictions.
It is simply about leaving an existing agreement in place and let's face it, the principle of trust always applies when agreements are signed.
I must repeat, this is predominantly about not adding fuel to the fire at a sensitive time when the question of enlargement is writ large, because we know where that can lead.
Naturally my recommendation is that we accept the report tomorrow as it was adopted in committee - albeit, I admit, by a very narrow majority, if one can talk of majorities at all here.
Commissioner, I know you will be unable to agree but I should like to ask one favour of you, nonetheless: if, and this might easily be the case, Parliament decides otherwise and rejects my proposal, could you perhaps think twice about forcing it through?
Could you use the precarious, sensitive situation in this country, which is also important for negotiations with candidate countries, as an opportunity for finding a long-term solution, rather than forcing through a short-term solution?
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. (DE) Mr President, the vote on deleting the 108% clause is about more than just Austria's environmental concerns.
Transit traffic in a sensitive Alpine region is the secondary issue.
Primarily, it is about the fact that Austria has a valid agreement with the European Union.
The Commission is now trying, in its proposal for a regulation, to cancel this valid agreement unilaterally and expects the European Parliament to validate this illegal move.
If we vote in favour of this proposal, we shall be helping to break an agreement to the detriment of a Member State of the Union.
What this can and will do is to destroy any trust in agreements concluded and hence any trust in the legal security of the European Union.
A large majority of people living in the Alpine regions in question came out in favour of accession to the EU in 1994, believing in the sanctity of contracts.
If we vote in favour of this unwarranted abolition of the protection clauses, we shall foster reticence towards the Union and force people back on to street blockades.
In this sense I urgently call on you to support Mr Swoboda's report or, given the present weather, not to leave him out in the rain.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be voting in favour of the Commission proposal.
First, because the objective of the ecopoint system has more or less been achieved.
The objective was to reduce overall NOx emissions from heavy goods vehicles in transit through Austria by 60% by the end of 2003.
In 2000, we had already achieved a 56% reduction; in other words, we are well on the way to achieving the target set in the agreement by 2003.
Secondly, the Commission proposal does not touch the ecopoint system per se.
The target of a 60% reduction has been retained.
The Commission expressly calls for the ecopoint system to continue.
Only the so-called 108% rule is to be abolished.
This rule runs counter to the very objective of the ecopoint system, i.e. to protect the environment by reducing NOx emissions.
It acts as an incentive to buy and use environmentally-friendly lorries.
The 108% clause sets an upper ceiling on the number of transit journeys and imposes sanctions where it is exceeded.
However, this clause only applies if the lorries have produced 8% fewer emissions a year.
That is a contradiction in itself.
Which is why the whole thing makes no sense.
Thirdly, reducing ecopoints does not reduce transit traffic through the Alps as a whole because it will either be switched to routes through Switzerland or trickily converted to bilateral traffic to and from Austria or traffic using east European lorries which are subject to a different licensing system and do not come under the ecopoint system.
On balance, all this means is that there will be no further reductions in NOx emissions in Austria.
Fourthly, the sanctions attached to the 108% rule are disproportionately high.
For example, exceeding 100,000 journeys in 1999 was punished by cutting 150,000 journeys in 2000.
The last point I wish to raise is this: doubts as to whether primary law, in this case an act of accession, can be changed by secondary law, i.e. by a Commission proposal for a regulation, as is the subject of today's debate, are to my mind unwarranted. Protocol no.
9 makes explicit provision for the ecopoint system to be reviewed in 2001.
On this basis, the Commission proposal is therefore legal.
That is why I am in favour of abolishing the 108% rule and adopting the Commission proposal as it stands.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ecopoint system was agreed during Austria's accession to the EU.
So what we are talking about is an existing, legally valid agreement which expires in 2003.
The objective, as has already been mentioned, is to use more environmentally-friendly lorries in transit through the Austrian Alps and to reduce NOx emissions by 60% in comparison with 1992, which has almost been achieved.
The agreement also sets an upper ceiling on the number of transit journeys, the so-called 108% clause.
Now the Commission wants to abolish the 108% clause by the end of 2003.
The rapporteur, Hannes Swoboda, rejects the Commission proposal and I concur with this view, although there is a conflict between Austrian and German interests, for example, here.
But our concern here must be to act within the context of a European transport policy and that means having a taxation mechanism for ecologically sensitive regions.
In all events, I should like to highlight three problems, as I have done in my proposed amendments.
First, the number of journeys needs to be calculated correctly.
A number of speakers have expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the statistics, because they also include some bilateral journeys.
Care must therefore be taken to calculate the number of journeys correctly, so that sanctions are not wrongly applied.
That brings me to my second point, sanctions.
In 1999, as has already been mentioned, the number of transit journeys was exceeded by 100,000, resulting in a cutback of 150,000 journeys by way of "punishment".
I think the current sanction mechanism is excessive and wrong because it hits individual road hauliers, even though it means state action.
Something needs to be done here.
And my third and final point. Our ultimate transport policy objective is to have a sustainable transport system which allows sustainable mobility in the long term.
However, the Commission has so far omitted to present a conclusive overall concept for the Alps for 2003 onwards and we need one now as a matter of urgency.
Mr President, Commissioner, even though we have taken into account all the concerns that Mr Swoboda and others have expressed as regards the upholding of the commitments that the Union undertakes in signing the Treaties, I believe that in this specific case we have to vote for the Commission proposal.
This is the line my Group has agreed upon and intends to follow tomorrow.
This is because the experiment conducted over these years will instead be used from now on to define a coherent strategy for transit journeys across the Alpine region, which will, in future, be based on as broad a shift from road to rail as possible.
The current system has proved essentially effective, since the basic objective has been or is in the process of being achieved, while on the other hand it is proving ineffective, or rather in some cases I would say it acts against the incentive to make vehicles crossing Austria more eco-friendly, as well as being difficult if not unfair to implement, and therefore the clause has indeed proved to be effectively of little use, even though worthwhile in its intention.
I believe that no serious difficulties should arise and that there should be substantial respect for the agreement in that the desired objective has been achieved, and that the clause should not be implemented because it does not help us at the moment.
It will instead be used or applied, like others, to harmonise different schemes that we should use to work out a better way to cross the whole Alpine region in future.
I hope and we hope that this too will be taken into account in the forthcoming White Paper, both in favouring the choice of those rail links that we have been waiting for for too long, and in identifying tariff measures that will, through better attribution of infrastructure costs, help to encourage more coherent conditions with regard to the Alpine region as a whole.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Swoboda, our rapporteur, and Mr Kronberger are both Austrian.
That is, of course, no coincidence and they have both explained the situation in Austria in detail.
However, I do not see this as a purely Austrian problem.
This report and tomorrow's vote are about a decision with far-reaching implications.
I am not trying - nor do I have any intention of trying - to play the internal market, competition and environmental and transport policy off against each other.
I see two points at issue here.
First, to repeat the concern expressed by my fellow members, we should not emulate President Bush by ending an agreement unilaterally.
Secondly, how serious are we about our European environmental and transport policy?
How serious are we about implementing it and how efficiently do we want to promote it?
So we are not just talking about reducing nitrogen oxide in the Brenner pass.
We need a coherent transport concept for the whole of the Alps and we need to internationalise the external costs.
Until we apply real costs, roads will be cheaper and neither combined transport nor the railways will be able to compete.
The whole of the ecologically sensitive Alpine region needs our support within the terms of the Alpine Convention.
Our citizens, and I do not just mean in these sensitive regions, are counting on the European Parliament and the sense of responsibility of all its members.
Mr President, this topic involves much more than just a traffic problem.
It is a matter of how the European Union treats its promises to newcomers, the rights of its smaller Member States and interests other than simply those of the economy.
For years, Switzerland and Austria have protected their Alpine valleys against noise and air pollution from goods traffic.
That kind of protection gains in importance as this environmentally-unfriendly means of transport increases.
When Austria joined the European Union, a compromise was agreed that enabled this Member State partially to maintain this protection by reducing NOx emissions by 60% between 1992 and 2004.
Others also benefit from that measure, since it encourages the restriction of transport or its transfer to rail connections that are better for people and the environment.
The underlying principle was not to wait for cleaner technologies, but to empower a government to limit transport by establishing ceilings.
Seven years after this compromise, the Commission is trying unilaterally to deprive Austria of that right and at this late stage to give free rein to north-south road traffic, even if the limit of 108% is exceeded.
If the European Union behaves in this way with its smaller Member States, that will increasingly provoke antagonism and opposition.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports the rapporteur in his rejection of this attack by the Commission, the large Member States and the big transport conglomerates.
Mr President, not only the number and distribution of ecopoints in Austria, but also the ecopoint system itself, lead to a highly-charged discussion with repeated heated clashes between supporters and opponents.
This time is no exception.
When Austria joined the European Union, limited access for in-transit transport of goods was agreed until the end of 2003.
The Commission wants to revoke one of the components of this agreement.
The rapporteur regards the unilateral (partial) termination of protocol No 9 without acceptable alternatives as a breach of agreements entered into.
The present system in Austria - does not seem to be flawless.
The fact that no account is taken of large groups of road users when measuring emissions does not contribute to a clear picture of emissions caused by in-transit traffic.
At the same time, Austria has not yet fulfilled its obligation to offer sufficient alternatives to the Alpine route.
I am convinced that Europe cannot do without transport, but neither can it do without a healthy natural environment in which we ultimately all live.
Therefore I support initiatives to limit emissions in general and in vulnerable areas of natural beauty, in particular.
The rejection of this proposal by the Commission therefore does not stand in isolation, but falls within this framework.
The question does arise, though, what the future of in-transit traffic through Austria will be after 2003, when the ecopoint system has disappeared.
In order to tackle environmental damage to the Alps constructively, a policy for vulnerable areas is essential.
For as long as this is lacking, ad hoc measures will appear which are seldom constructive in nature.
Hence my question to the Commission if it is going to tackle this topic in the long-awaited White Paper.
In short, I do not consider it sensible, while there is no wider policy for vulnerable areas, to take unilateral measures that cannot be expected to promote sustainable mobility.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak as an Austrian, but I also speak as a European for three reasons.
First, the Transit Agreement was part of a Union promise to Austria.
The promise being that the sensitive Alpine region would not be buried under an endless avalanche of transit traffic.
Austrians trusted in Europe's word.
66% of Austrians were in favour of accession to the Union.
If this Commission proposal is adopted, this promise will be broken.
I speak to you as a European; this is the sort of thing which will come back to haunt us if another referendum somewhere in Europe turns out badly.
Secondly, transit traffic and hence the 108% clause, which it is proposed to abolish, forms part of the Act of Accession to the European Union.
In other words, the Transit Agreement is primary law.
I ask you in all conscience: what is an agreement worth if the European Parliament can undermine primary law in a vote?
This is also a question of principle, not just Austrian, but European principle.
Thirdly, a question to all of you: what are words on paper worth?
To quote the new Article 6 in the Treaty of Amsterday: "Environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Community policies and activities referred to in Article 3", such as the free movement of goods.
Tomorrow's vote will be a measure of just how seriously this House takes the objective of this article in the Treaty of Amsterday.
Or, ladies and gentlemen, do we just pay lip service here to environmental protection and sustainable development?
The contest tomorrow is free movement of goods versus environmental protection - it is a fundamentally European question, which is why I call on you to vote in favour of the report.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to get one thing straight here. This hypothesis, that the Community is breaking Treaty law is simply nonsense.
Treaty law makes provision for adjustment and this proposal adjusts just one point of the law.
So it is not a question of breaking Treaty law.
The non-attached member is moaning that we are not treating the environment properly and is calling for environmental protection. Well my question to my fellow Austrian member is this: when will you stump up the money for the Brenner base tunnel?
Then you would be doing something for environmental protection.
We are, in fact, taking far too long about implementing the Brenner base tunnel.
That is the only real solution to the problem of transit traffic in the Alps.
Instead of bandying fine words, Madam, you would do well to push ahead with plans for the base tunnel and stump up the money.
That would be your job in a government in which you are represented.
We do not need vox pops!
Mr Stockmann made a great number of valid points, namely that the main objective, to reduce NOx emissions, has in fact almost been achieved and that the 108% clause is disproportionate and inaccurate.
Mr Stockmann, vote with us tomorrow in favour of the Commission proposal and you will achieve exactly what you want to achieve.
I can understand that you do not want to stab your Austrian rapporteur in the back, but consider carefully how you intend to vote tomorrow.
Vote in favour of the Commission proposal.
Just two more brief comments.
If we maintain this clause, there will be no change in real freight volumes; instead the transit journeys which are no longer possible will be replaced by a journey using one haulier into Austria, transhipment and a journey using another haulier out of Austria.
In other words, transit would be split, we would have more exhaust emissions and more costs to consumers. That is not the solution.
The solution is to build the Brenner base tunnel so that we can shift freight from the roads to the railways in the long term.
That is what we should be fighting for.
Mr President, may I first express my appreciation of Mr Swoboda' s arguments and also of the thoroughness of the work he has done. At the same time, we are fully convinced that the set objective of the protocol in question is a good one: the environmental protection of Austria within the Alpine region.
The Commission intends to maintain this objective, and we are also convinced, as the proposed regulation to the Commission suggests, that the 108% clause should be eliminated.
I shall confine myself quickly to two puzzling facts.
The first is a matter of logic: the clause operates on the number of transit journeys, regardless of the ecological performance of the vehicle, and therefore more ecologically friendly vehicles mean more ecopoints saved, more journeys accumulated and a greater risk of going over the 108% quota.
The result is a paradox: operators are discouraged from choosing less polluting vehicles.
The second puzzle is a practical one: the sampling system is unreliable, the critical threshold would seem to be exceeded by 0.6%, or 10 000 journeys, but according to a Commission study there are 92 000 vehicles that entered Austria and did not leave.
We are dealing with a system that has demonstrated that it is absolutely unreliable: the 108% limit has not been proved effective; the penalties are quite excessive, with 150 rights of transit less as a result of exceeding the 108% threshold.
Mr President, these are the technical and objective reasons why the Italian delegation will vote in favour of the Commission proposal.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the long term, our views are not so very different.
As far as we can tell from the Commissioner's future plans as they stand now, she wants the same thing we all want and need, i.e. specially sensitive transport rules for specially sensitive areas.
That was precisely the intention of the original Transit Agreement between the Community as it was then and Austria, standing as it did on the brink of accession in every sense of the word.
And the solutions worked out just under ten years ago and the compromises brokered for Alpine transit at the time have, on the whole, worked.
The ecopoint system has brought about a net improvement in the environmentally problematic nitrogen oxide situation, despite all its weaknesses, and the quantitative upper ceiling and 108% rule, which is what this is all about, has at least gone some way towards acting as a safety net, as hoped, despite a whole series of problems.
So why now and why, given the current situation, terminate a fundamental element of the arrangement prematurely for such as short period of time?
This is the question people in Austria are asking and they are not getting an answer.
Unless the idea is to end transit traffic restrictions, including - more to the point - in sensitive Alpine regions.
I think we shall all be doing future European transport policy a disservice if we jeopardise the common, long-term objective or completely lose sight of it for the sake of a few relatively minor inconsistencies and squabbles.
That is why I think the position adopted two months ago by an admittedly narrow majority in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is the right one.
This committee position could be used as a springboard for renewed efforts to find jointly acceptable solutions, rather than creating huge emotional and political problems for Austria and its citizens.
Austria versus the rest of the world? That cannot and should not be.
We should all being pulling together to find good, forward-looking solutions to European transport problems.
That should be our objective and I trust that we shall return a vote tomorrow which guarantees that.
Mr President, Commissioner, I do not think it is right to separate the supporters of the Commission' s measure and those against it into those who have the environment at heart and those who do not.
This is an error into which we must not fall, and I must say this with all due respect to the Members from Austria: your representation of the situation is not useful to your fellow citizens.
We are all concerned with safeguarding and protecting the environment, and the question of the Alpine passes, amongst others, affects not only Austria but also a large part of a sensitive area like the Alpine region on the Italian side.
Why do I say this?
Because in the Commission' s proposal, which we share and support, we see the same environmental concern.
It has been said that the ecopoints system will not be touched because it has produced results, and this has been confirmed.
On the other hand it has been observed - and this cannot be denied - that the ceiling system actually punishes those hauliers that try to adopt ecologically friendly procedures, as has been said, while instead encouraging bad practice, as you well know, and even fraudulent practices: for instance, many lorries go in with a bill of lading, unload in Austria and then leave, and so are not subject to the points clause.
All that does no more good to the environment than it does to the transport system.
Of course, there is also a problem of guaranteeing mobility, there is a problem of guaranteeing competition among haulage companies, but there is most of all an environmental problem.
I ask you to take in the aspect of concern for the environment that is expressed in the Commission proposal; I agree with you all that we certainly need to find stable, definitive solutions for the future, which will really protect us from these risks.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Swoboda for the work he has carried out, although having said that, I must tell him that I cannot agree to his suggestion or to what he says in his report, because the Protocol is categorical on this matter.
Article 11 of Protocol No 9 discusses NOx pollution..
Nowhere does it mention noise or any other type of pollution.
The objective of Article 11 is to limit gas emissions and NOx emissions and nowhere does it mention any other types of pollution that could have been suggested but which, at the time, were not suggested and were not included.
Furthermore, when Article 11 discusses a revision - and I am here attempting to answer what was said earlier - the Commission is not trying to steamroller nor to exceed the legal obligations that bind us all, but to adhere strictly to the provisions of Article 11 of Protocol No 9 to the Act of Accession, in other words, to undertake a revision, to see precisely how it has developed. And yet people are suggesting that we are proposing equivalent measures in order to reduce NOx emissions.
Please read it.
I requested the text in order to read it out to you.
Unfortunately I do not have it here with me, but I can quote you part of the text, which states that, pursuant to Article 71, which covers codecision, it authorises the Council and now Parliament - following recent changes to the Treaty codecision applies - to adopt Community measures that - and I quote verbatim - "guarantee equivalent protection of the environment, in particular, a 60% reduction in pollution" .
Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that we are not trying to steamroller or to exceed the provisions of Protocol No 9 to Austria' s Act of Accession.
I fully realise that there may be difficulties and I also know that Austria is suffering as a result of the vehicles transiting through it, as are other countries, which may, incidentally, suffer from other types of problem too.
I also understand that regions such as the Alpine regions and other particularly sensitive areas of the European Union can and should be given special protection where transport is concerned, road transport above all.
Not the whole of Austria, however, which is what this Protocol refers to.
The Alpine regions are a part of Austria, but not only of Austria.
To this end, the principle of ecopoints - let me make this quite clear - has been positive and has reduced NOx emissions by more than 50%.
We have not reached the ceiling of 60%, but a reduction of over 50% has been achieved.
I stated, although I did not give a firm commitment, that I intend to propose, as stated in the White Paper on transport policy - which I hope you will soon be able to read, that for particularly sensitive areas such as the Alps, measures must be taken to limit the potentially harmful effects for the environment.
The system of ecopoints itself could be one solution.
Perhaps.
I am not saying that it is the solution, but it could be one.
There must be an ecopoint system - which leads me to the final point - that really works because this, Mr Swoboda, is the problem and this is another point on which I disagree with you.
You say that with a ceiling of 108%, hauliers still see a benefit, for the moment, in improving the environmental quality of their lorries.
You are wrong, Mr Swoboda.
It is not in their interest at all, because if their ceiling is 108% why should they make improvements when, with this number of trips they reach a ceiling that they cannot raise by reducing emissions, since they cannot travel more often without penalties being imposed on them?
At the moment, the two clauses contradict each other, which is why we are proposing that they be removed.
If we want to continue improving emissions, the 108% clause must be withdrawn, because otherwise, some of the better lorries might stop transiting through Austria because they have too many ecopoints and lack transit rights as a result of this 108%.
This could lead to the use of lorries that pollute more.
This is of no importance: it is no longer in anyone' s interest to improve the quality of their emissions because the ceiling is set at 108%.
This is why we are proposing that it be removed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, starting from the premise that there can always be divergent legal interpretations, as I freely admit, I feel that the provisions of Protocol No 9, Article 11 state that a review should be carried out, that equivalent measures should be proposed and that the objective is NOx emissions.
They also state that, if we want to continue improving NOx emissions, our only option is to remove the 108% ceiling because, if we maintain this ceiling, there is no incentive to improve environmental quality with regard to emissions by European hauliers transiting through Austria.
I therefore urge Parliament to support the Commission proposal and to reject - I am sorry, Mr Swoboda, but for the first time we cannot agree - Mr Swoboda' s proposal.
Mr President, if you lose, you lose.
I will, of course, have to accept the decision if that is how it turns out.
But, Commissioner, you stressed several times today that you have to propose an equivalent solution.
You have not proposed an equivalent solution, that much is clear.
In that respect you are legally off base.
Mr President, I should like to stress that the Commissioner was quite right in what she said.
The Treaty can only be revised, and rightly so, if equivalent measures are introduced.
Exactly what are they then?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Cultural cooperation in the EU
The next item is the report (A5-0281/2001) by Mr Ruffolo, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on cultural cooperation in the European Union [2000/2323(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this motion for a resolution has arisen from some simple but not obvious observations.
The first observation concerns a lack of coordination among the cultural programmes of the Union, especially between those included in Culture 2000 and those in the programmes financed by the Structural Funds.
The second observation is especially that there is a gap between the programmes managed at Union level and national cultural policies, based purely and simply on the reciprocal provision of information.
A positive response to these two observations depends on the recognition of two points: first, the principle of subsidiarity not only does not exclude cooperation but demands it.
It must not be understood in terms of sectarian cultural protectionism, but in a positive and active sense as a fertile encounter of diverse cultures.
The second point to recognise is that the richness and specific character of European civilisation lies in the diversity of its national and regional cultures.
Therefore, the expression 'unity in diversity' has been chosen as the motto of the report.
European culture is clearly not a homogeneous unit: it is a collection of diverse cultures, each with its own historical roots and its area of radiation; I might almost say it is a symphony in the technical musical sense of the word, in that it develops through consonance and dissonance: a symphony not created by a single composer, however, but resulting from the course of history, through dramatic conflicts and occasional religious, nationalist and ideological massacres.
Nonetheless, today, at last, there is a convergence on common humanistic values of liberty, equality and, if not fraternity - which would be too much to ask - then at least mutual tolerance. These are values which are recognised in a common area; they are distinguished both from distinctly consumer cultures and from fundamentalist ones, and are based upon the great traditions of Christianity, liberalism and socialism.
