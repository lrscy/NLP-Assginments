President Prodi sent a message to President Bouteflika to express the solidarity of the European Union with the Algerian flood victims.
Therefore the Commission, through its humanitarian aid office, has moved quickly in response to the floods.
A decision to allocate EUR 758 800 of humanitarian aid has been taken under the primary emergency procedure to help meet the urgent needs of the victims.
The funds are already being used for a range of support measures including temporary shelter, beds, clothing and blankets, water, sanitation and medical assistance.
Humanitarian operations funded under this decision will be implemented by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and by two NGOs - MÃ©dicins du Monde and MÃ©dicins sans FrontiÃšres.
With those decisions on Hurricane Michelle and the Algerian floods, the Commission underlines its determination to address the needs of victims of humanitarian disasters whenever they occur.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Trade in small arms
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0723/2001, tabled by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on small arms;
B5-0729/2001, tabled by Mrs Morgantini and Mr Brie, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on controlling international arms transfers and arms brokering;
B5-0730/2001, tabled by Mrs Maes, Mrs McKenna and Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on controlling international arms transfers and arms brokering.
Commissioner, Mr President, just as certain small-scale conflicts receive poor media coverage, so certain categories of what are known as light weapons could be said to receive poor legislative and financial coverage. I mean that the legislation regulating them is insufficient and that they are cheap to buy.
Why are we surprised, then, when it is this type of arms which keep these forgotten conflicts alive?
Yet the number of victims alone should concern us, if it were not concealed by the effects of poverty.
However, evidence that the world does have a conscience has emerged in the shape of the United Nations Programme of Action aimed at containing and controlling the transfers, or rather the trafficking of these light weapons which are responsible for extensive loss of human life.
In the light of the current international situation, with the armed alliance in Afghanistan and the international fight against terrorism, there is even greater need for the Union to join and support this resolute, pioneering UN measure.
The European Union' s military policy must be more than just defence measures controlled by senior military staff.
It must, in essence, be based on the prevention and control of the arms trade by an arsenal of binding laws covering all areas of this industry.
Our legislation must target arms brokering and export and detention licences, as well as extradition and police cooperation procedures, and national legislation governing these issues must be harmonised.
Instead of attempting to intervene in blazing conflicts, would it not be better to defuse them before they ignite?
The Union' s legislative structure would allow us to do this at the stage when we are still preparing for military action.
Europe must seize the opportunity afforded here.
Mr President, we are quite properly concerned about the spread of small arms and light weapons, particularly the illegal traffick in, and uncontrolled circulation of, these weapons.
I am not sure why Parliament has decided to bring forward an urgent resolution at this time, unless it wants to contribute something useful in the context of the current international crisis, the continuing threat posed by weapons held by terrorists or the consequences of the large accumulation of weapons in Taliban hands in Afghanistan.
There is some passing reference to these matters in the motion for a resolution which contains many useful elements.
For many years I have worked to overcome the problem of anti-personnel landmines but I have always sought to focus attention on the real culprits who use such weapons indiscriminately and irresponsibly.
Usually these were armed rebel groups in developing countries with no concern for human life and they had been supplied by non-western countries.
It is important, therefore, that when considering the matter of small arms we should take care not to become over-obsessed with our own authorities or industry: these are the easy targets.
Instead, we should focus on terrorist groups and other criminal elements that are sitting on stockpiles of weapons or continuing to obtain them from various sources.
It is scandalous, for example, that there has been toleration for so long of large stockpiles of weapons held by terrorist organisations such as the IRA in one EU Member State, in order that it may threaten or carry out attacks in another.
In relation to Afghanistan it is to be hoped that a legitimate government with democratic aspirations will be established there very soon, anxious to engage positively in the real world and begin the development of a sustainable economy and a better life for all its people.
There must also be efforts to remove weapons in Taliban hands and integrate ex-combatants back into some sort of mainstream society.
I am not referring to terrorists there.
Much has been achieved.
Our focus for the future in relation to small arms should be on identifying and destroying stocks of weapons held by insurgents, terrorists and criminals and cutting off their sources of supply.
This is the area on which we should be concentrating our efforts over the coming months and years.
Mr President, nearly ten years ago, in the early 1990s, I travelled through the Khyber Pass, a trip I can strongly recommend to all colleagues - though perhaps not at this moment.
At the top there is a small village where you can buy food, water and "souvenirs".
The "souvenirs" are drugs, home-made Kalashnikovs and home-made surface-to-air rocket launchers.
With the money I had on me I calculated that I could buy ten Kalashnikovs or three rocket launchers.
The only problem was how to get them home through customs, so I did not buy them!
Coming forward to 10 October this year, at the United Nations in New York there was a speech by the American Assistant Secretary for Arms Control.
He used wonderful sounding sentences, such as "we must redouble our non-proliferation and arms control efforts", "the entire globe faces a security challenge!"
But he had no proposals at all for controlling small arms.
Why?
Because the extremely powerful and wealthy organisation called The National Rifle Association - the NRA - helped to elect the present administration, which will therefore not stand up to the Association.
With the events of 11 September and the high murder rate inside the United States of America, I wonder just what it will take for America to cooperate with the rest of the world on this problem.
My Group supports the motion because it is a small step in the right direction.
- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this problem - the trade and trafficking in small arms - is one of the most serious problems facing the world today.
The first observation I wish to make is that this expression 'small arms' is misleading, because small arms include heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade throwers and mortars of less than 100 millimetres.
We are talking about devastating weaponry.
To quote the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, speaking at the Conference held in July, we must be fully aware of the terrible effects of the current trade in these arms.
It is estimated that there are some 500 million arms in circulation in the world today and that, every day, these arms kill on average more than one thousand people.
This is, therefore, an issue to which States must pay serious attention.
It is an area in which the fine line between seriousness and hypocrisy can be most clearly traced.
For many years I have called for the issues of the arms industry and trade to be the business of States alone.
Applying the market economy to this area can only have disastrous consequences, and instead of complaining about the trafficking and dealing in arms, we should be adopting stricter measures on the state control of the production and trade in these arms.
Unfortunately, however, governments themselves are not always entirely blameless.
Currently, in Portugal, a campaign is running, launched by Catholic missionary organisations and supported by the Portuguese section of Amnesty International, to draw attention to this scourge.
And why missionaries, you might ask?
Because missionaries are, particularly in Africa, those who have most frequent contact with the appalling consequences of this situation.
Unfortunately, my country - it is not only France, the United Kingdom and other often-mentioned European Union countries - is not entirely free of blame in this matter.
According to figures that have been released, in 1998, the year in which the European Union code of conduct was signed, Portugal sold around EUR 9 million' s worth of arms to countries that it should feel unable to do so, such as Angola, Algeria, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Sri Lanka and Turkey.
Portugal also sold around EUR 5 million' s worth of arms to a further eleven countries that should, at the very least, be under strict observation.
We support the resolution that has been tabled.
This is a matter on which some progress has been made, but more energetic steps must be taken. Above all, the European Union must set an example in this area.
We cannot shed crocodile tears on Thursdays over conflicts that are continually supplied by the legal or illegal trade in these arms.
Mr President, the accumulations of small arms dotted all over the planet are a cause of destabilisation and crisis and the European Union has promised to do what it can to combat this phenomenon.
The European Union has proposed, as part of its joint action on small arms and light weapons, to introduce a series of confidence-building measures, including measures to improve transparency.
The Union has promised funding and technical assistance to countries, international organisations and non-governmental organisations asking for support for this purpose.
The European Union welcomes the results of the United Nations conference on the illegal trade in small arms although, as the members have said, it does of course recognise that the results might have been clearer and more concrete.
However, we believe that the very fact that this first conference was held at all is an important step.
We particularly welcome the decision to organise another conference before 2006 so that the progress made can be examined and evaluated by then.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
As indicated on the display board, the next item is Mrs Lynne' s report.
The debate is scheduled for 5.30 p.m.
I am therefore going to suspend the sitting for a short while.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)
Announcement by the President
I wish to speak about a very special matter: today, for the first time, If am not mistaken and if I am not misleading the House, we will have the opportunity to have twelve booths, because out of respect for this report and as a result of the rapporteur' s invitation, we will today have sign language interpretation to my right, as you can see, which is a tribute to the communication between this Parliament and all of Europe' s citizens, whoever they may be.

2003, European Year of People with Disabilities
The next item is the report (A5-0377/2001) by Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the European Year of People with disabilities 2003 [COM(2001) 271 - C5-0306/2001 - 2001/0116(CNS)].
Mr President, I welcome the sign language interpreter.
I only wish that we could have sign language interpretation for all our debates to make sure that all people could access all the reports.
The timing of this debate is very sad, when so few Members are present in the Chamber and, even more importantly, to vote later.
It is very important to demonstrate our commitment to disabled people.
Putting the report right at the end of a Strasbourg agenda does not demonstrate any commitment.
Having said that, I thank the Commission for their cooperation on my report and all the other Members of the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I have managed to incorporate a number of their amendments.
I believe that is one of the main reasons why we do not have any new amendments today.
The European Year of Disabled People, 2003 must not just pay lip service to the problems that disabled people face.
We need to have concrete outcomes.
For a start, we must truly move away from the medical model of disability to the social and rights-based model of disability.
We must make sure that we mainstream disabled people; that all legislation takes account of the specific needs of disabled people, whether they are wheelchair users, someone with a visual impairment, someone with a hearing impairment, someone with a learning difficulty, or someone with a mental health problem.
All EU citizens should have equal rights.
I hope that in 2003 - if not before - we make sure that all of Parliament's buildings are accessible to disabled people - they are not at the moment - and that all EU Member States are aware of the problems that disabled people face.
I shall tell you a story about what happened to Jenny, one of my constituents, the coordinator of Access Charter.
I invited her over to the Article 13 Anti-Discrimination hearings.
She uses a wheelchair.
For a start, she could not get into the Parliament's buildings in Brussels without going through revolving doors because they refused to open the double doors.
I remonstrated with them.
They unlocked them, took off the rope that was binding them and then 20 minutes later they were locked and bound again.
We booked her a hotel room with disabled people's access.
Somebody had put a bed across the bathroom door and so she could not get in.
She had to change hotels.
She then went out to try to get something to eat at night, with her colleagues - remember she was using a wheelchair.
No taxi in Brussels would stop for her.
She managed to get to a restaurant.
The manager then came out and said "You can't come in here.
Your appearance will put off other diners."
When she got to the airport she was subjected to a full body search.
She remonstrated with the security people.
One of them said: "Have a nice trip.
I hope your plane crashes."!
That demonstrates the problems that disabled people face and the real need for a disability directive.
I hope we will hear the announcement of that in 2003.
We have to have funding for major research into the status of disabled people.
We have to have a study into the situation disabled people face in institutions in particular.
It is essential that regional and local government are involved in this year but, more importantly, that organisations of disabled people and representing disabled people are involved in this year.
I have called specifically for a funding increase from EUR 12 million to EUR 15 million over the two years.
Particularly for sign language interpretation, for personal assistance, for accessible meeting rooms, for hotels etc., there are added costs; in addition, funding for impairment-specific NGOs is only for 2002, not for the year itself.
Furthermore, in line with the Article 13 Action Programme on Anti-Discrimination, I have called for subsidies for the expenses for special events at European level to go up from "not exceeding 80%" to "not exceeding 90%".
We must also have a proper evaluation of the year in clear and simple language, and in accessible formats.
I made my report available in all accessible formats at my own expense.
But I would like the Commission, in future, to make available on request any report at whatever stage in accessible format.
Finally, the year must be the step in the right direction to combat discrimination.
But more importantly, it has to be a celebration of disabled people's contribution to society.
Mr President, I would just like to say that I am standing in for my colleague, Mr Andrews, and I am very honoured to do so because of the important issues in this excellent report by Mrs Lynne.
The purpose of the year is to provide for a coordinated effort to change attitudes and to promote the removal of social and environmental barriers to equality and to assist in legal and policy developments.
This means putting a value on diversity and celebrating diversity.
It also includes making us aware of issues relating to multiple discrimination.
I want to stress our full support for the designation of 2003 as European Year of People with Disabilities.
I know that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs also supports the objectives of the year, as members unanimously backed my colleague's opinion.
There are approximately 38 million people in the European Union who have a disability.
They face a wide range of barriers, including different forms of discrimination.
People with physical and sensory disabilities are just as much a part of our society as able-bodied people.
Very often, however, they are hindered from taking part in our society.
What makes it worse, as Mr Andrews states in his opinion, is that they are not hindered by their disabilities, but by their environment and the attitudes towards them.
They suffer multi-discrimination.
This must change.
Some of the problems include public transport and access to buildings, stairways and doors which are not wide enough to allow wheelchair access.
Surveys show that the intellectual capacity of people with physical disabilities is very often under-estimated.
They can be discriminated against when applying for jobs.
The exclusion of people with disabilities from society not only denies their fundamental rights, but also deprives society of diversity and inclusivity.
People with disabilities can make a positive contribution to society. Their experiences can encourage more tolerance, understanding and awareness of the needs of others besides their own capacities and abilities.
Our own goal must be to end discrimination and safeguard their rights.
It is important that discrimination against people with disabilities is tackled as a mainstream issue.
The four amendments presented by my colleague, Mr Andrews, were fully supported by the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, and endorsed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
They are now Amendments Nos 20, 45, 47 and 48.
I have nothing else to add, only to congratulate Mrs Lynne on her excellent report and on the very touching speech she gave to us in the presentation of the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sign language interpreter, I would like to express a few thoughts on the World Year of People with Disabilities. I am also speaking on behalf of Mr Mantovani, who is particularly interested in this subject and cannot be here with us today.
This a truly vast subject, as can be seen from the statistics: today there are approximately 30 million people suffering from disabilities in the European Union.
This means that one European in ten encounters barriers not just in the field of work but also in access to public transport, buildings, private services, education and training - in other words, in all areas of daily life.
However, there are other barriers as well, maybe less obvious but just as insurmountable, which restrict the freedom of European citizens with disabilities, such as the barriers to movement within the Union and to going to live in another Member State.
All these barriers too often prevent people with disabilities from playing the active role they would like in society, work, school and daily activities.
We need a multifaceted strategy to ensure that these people are guaranteed equal opportunities in full respect for the European citizens' Charter of Fundamental Rights.
However, there is one right which stands out above the others: the right to full citizenship.
That is why our group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote with conviction for the proposal for a Council decision on the Year of People with Disabilities - or, as we used to say in Italy in the olden days - people with different abilities - 2003.
I therefore thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her good work and for accepting the 17 amendments tabled in committee. Three of those were tabled by us, and we feel they are particularly important because they uphold three concepts: firstly, recognition of the importance of the role played by the family at all stages in the lives of people with disabilities; secondly, promotion of a culture of solidarity within society, meaning an understanding that a person' s value is not expressed solely in terms of what he does or is able to do, but primarily in what he represents, namely a human being in all respects; thirdly and lastly, reflection on the concept of the quality of life of a person with disabilities, understood not just to be access to employment or training but also all the other aspects of daily life, in the family and in and as part of society, a quality of life which is genuinely high and equal for people with disabilities too.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, ladies and gentlemen, it is a happy coincidence that this week, just a few metres away from the Chamber, we can see an exhibition organised by Bernd Posselt entitled, 'chain of understanding'.
It shows hands, helping hands, joining hands, hands expending energy, and this exhibition is devoted to disabled people and includes work done by disabled people.
At this point I should therefore like to thank all of those who give time, patience, energy and love and make sacrifices for those who need their help.
This includes the families of disabled people, but many more besides.
We should not leave them out in the Year of Disabled People.
My second point is that I am glad that 2003 is to be the Year of Disabled People, particularly now, because for me it also shows that the Stability and Growth Pact and an aggressive disability policy are not only not contradictory, but also not mutually exclusive, if we are serious about the European social model, defending the dignity of all human beings and ensuring respect for human rights, which are principles to which we feel committed.
We still have much to do, however.
We need more equality in everyday life.
This involves firstly actually implementing all of the constitutional provisions.
We need to move from principle to practice.
Secondly, we need more comprehensive integration.
Integration must not end at the school gates, but must also encompass working life and social life.
Thirdly, we need disabled people to have the right to receive support to live the life of their own choosing.
Disabled people must be able to decide for themselves how they wish to live their lives.
Fourthly, we have to change the images we have, such as the image of a disabled person doing handicrafts.
Here, PCs, the Internet and integration using the new media could be very helpful.
With this in mind, we are looking forward to the Year of Disabled People, because we hope that it will sharpen the focus of our work and that we will be able to take further initiatives to eliminate the injustices and barriers which exist in our society.
Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Lynne not just on this particular report, but for her constant faith in and fight for policies for the disabled.
I should also like to make a point of thanking Parliament for the support and enthusiasm with which it accepted the proposal for 2003. We need to make 2003 the year in which we send out a clear message that policies for the disabled are not just solidarity policies.
They are not just humane or charitable policies.
They are policies based on fundamental human and civil rights.
The second important point is that 2003 should not just galvanise governments into action.
It should also galvanise social and business circles and the scientific community into action.
Governments themselves should start up action plans for a package of policies. Transport, urban planning, special policies for the job market, education.
Society should do everything it can, especially through the civil society and non-governmental organisations, to foster collaboration and take innovative initiatives which can be used as a basis for new proposals for the European Union.
Business circles can also play an important part.
Support for research and new product technology can bring about exceptional new products for people with disabilities and new technological products can be adapted to the specific requirements of different types of disability.
As Mrs Lynne referred to the Commission reports, may I inform you that only yesterday I started up my new web page, which can be read by Braille.
2003 should be seen as a year in which we push ahead with European priorities, such as those set out in the Commission communication on a "Europe without frontiers", while the individual Member States promote their national objectives, which differ from one country to another, given that policies for people with disabilities are at various stages of development.
I must say that I accept most of your amendments, in both spirit and letter.
I should like to highlight the following points: first, I totally agree that we need to concentrate more on awareness-raising about various types of disabilities and the fact that some people with very serious disabilities are victims of multiple discrimination and, of course, the plight of those kept in institutions.
The second important factor are the special policies on education and employment.
Access to the job market depends on education and we need to focus on this.
The third important point is the need for all the agencies involved to work together.
We cannot propose and implement policies for the disabled. We need to work with their organisations so that we can present policies in which they themselves are involved.
We believe that 2003 will be the start of a new form of collaboration, a new type of innovative policy at European level for people with disabilities.
The budget, which is EUR 12 million, is small but we should point out that it is not for implementing policies but to back specific events of local or national importance, the main function of which will be to kick start societies and organisations.
I should also say that we believe that it makes sense to leave the funding ratio at 50% of activities at national level because this will allow for more events while, at the same time, allowing governments to take additional action in a range of policies.
May I again congratulate Mrs Lynne on her personal stand. I should also like to inform you that the Council will take its final decision on 3 December 2001, the same date as the European Day of Disabled People.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 5.55 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)
Mr President, I have just one question: on Tuesday morning we approved requests for urgent procedure for the items on financial aid for a series of Balkan countries, and I regret that these are obviously not going to be taken until the mini-session, because we would have had sufficient time to deal with this issue in this afternoon's sitting, which has been suspended twice.
In the past, of course, anything which we added to the agenda on Tuesday morning was always taken on the Friday.
I hope that it will soon be possible to revert to this practice when Friday sittings are reinstated, but I wanted to take this opportunity to ask when these items will be taken in the Brussels sitting because you did not announce this just now.
Mr Posselt, according to my information, these will be adopted on Thursday 28; in other words, they will appear on the agenda for Thursday 28.
As for the rest of your comments, Mr Posselt, you are entirely within your rights to make them, but I hope that the Conference of Presidents considers the basis of your comments, for which there is some justification, I must admit.
Vote
Mr President, I voted for the report on the European Year of People with Disabilities, but Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are also some States whose laws include rules which discriminate against people with disabilities.
I am sad to say that there is even an Italian law which discriminates against them on age grounds, thus violating Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Indeed, it stipulates that people with disabilities who are over 65 years old are not entitled to the EUR 350 allowance granted to people with disabilities who fall ill before they reach the age of 65.
I therefore call upon the Commission to present a proposal implementing Article 13 outside the workplace as well, and, at last, to force the States which are not yet applying it to do so. I refer, in particular, to Italy, and I hope that the Berlusconi government will listen to what I am saying and abolish the laws currently in place in Italy - as in other parts of Europe - which discriminate against people with disabilities.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity of an explanation of vote to thank Mrs Lynne for her outstanding report, but also to thank Mr Karas for mentioning my exhibition and Mrs Petter who was responsible for putting it together.
This is a splendid initiative for disabled and traumatised children who are cared for by a children's centre in Munich.
This initiative will now be continued in Italy and France by a series of colleagues.
Mrs Lynne has spontaneously offered to take it to England too.
I am very grateful.
This is a good start to our preparatory work for the Year of Disabled People.
That is why I should like to thank all of those colleagues who are supporting this magnificent initiative from Bavaria.
The good intentions of our rapporteur notwithstanding, we are worried that the European Year of People with Disabilities (2003) will be a year in which a great deal of money is spent and numerous events are staged, but which does nothing to change the situation of disabled people, especially those from the poor sections of society.
We are worried by the hypocrisy of all this interest being expressed in people with disabilities by the various institutions of the European Union because it is the very policy of the European Union, with its capitalist restructuring, privatisation of health, welfare and education and undermining of workers' rights and social insurance, which is to blame.
The first dramatic victims of this policy are the handicapped and people with disabilities.
They hypocritically maintain that their aim is to "promote equal opportunities" and "combat discrimination".
But does a young person or a child from a poor, working class family living at risk of disease and accident have the same opportunities, first and foremost in preventing disability, as a young person or child of the bourgeoisie?
Does a child whose father is an executive of a multinational company have the same opportunities in finding work as a child whose father is unemployed?
It is impossible to combat the various types of discrimination which arise in a capitalist society as long as the main type of discrimination between the exploiters and the exploited continues to reign supreme.
What sort of a fight against discrimination is their policy, which spreads poverty, unemployment and illiteracy?
Of the 38 million disabled in the ÃU, 7.5 million are of school age.
How many of these children have special schools or special classes and the special equipment needed for them to acquire an education?
In Greece, only 7% of disabled children attend special schools, while 185 000 disabled children are not even in the education system.
And yet not one ÃU text, including the one under debate, so much as mentions free national health, welfare and special education, even for these people.
Nowhere does it suggest that the technical assistance needed for education, vocational rehabilitation or daily life should be provided free of charge.
This situation will change when the people, the workers and the disabled fight to obstruct the policy of "free competition and market laws" until it has been overturned.
This fight has the vote of the Communist Party of Greece.
That is the end of voting time.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The session was adjourned at 6.50 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 November 2001.
Announcement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, Spain has once again been cruelly struck by terrorism.
On 23 November, Ana Isabel Arostegui and Javier Mijangos, both officers of the Ertzaintza, the Basque regional police, were killed in a cowardly attack whilst carrying out their duties in BeasaÃ­n, in the Basque region of Spain.
Two days prior to that incident, terrorists set off a bomb in Bilbao, injuring two other officers of the same police force.
On my own behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, I immediately sent a message expressing my most sincere condolences to the families of the victims of these despicable attacks, as well as our wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured.
Once again, terrorist groups in Spain have acted with fatal disregard, showing that they deny the right to life and totally reject the concept of democracy.
Having made an assault on justice, by killing Judge JosÃ© MarÃ­a Lidon Corbi, they have, this time, attacked the Basque regional police force.
In doing so, they are showing their determination to attack the main pillars of democracy.
With our heartfelt thoughts for the victims, their families and all those who fight for democracy, I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Ladies and gentlemen, since our last session, five journalists have unfortunately been killed in Afghanistan.
Maria Grazia Cutulli, Julio Fuentes, Harry Burton and Azizullah Haidari were killed in an ambush between Jalalabad and Kabul.
Ulf Stroemberg was found dead following a burglary in Taloqan.
As you know, we are also extremely concerned about Ken Hechtman, who is missing.
The eight journalists who have died in Afghanistan since the beginning of the conflict were carrying out their duties in a courageous, passionate and tenacious manner.
They believed that it was their overriding duty to inform others.
I would like to pay a warm and sincere tribute to them for the work they did, because they enabled us to keep constantly abreast of developments in Afghanistan.
Freedom of information is one of the most fragile freedoms. The death of these journalists illustrates this.
I admire the way in which they fulfilled their duties.
At this time, our thoughts go out to their families and their colleagues, who are devastated by their loss.
I would like to ask you to observe a minute' s silence in order to display our deepest sympathy.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Order of business
With regard to the agenda, I have two changes to propose.
First of all, the Committee on Budgets adopted Mr Ferber' s report on the supplementary estimates of revenue and expenditure of the European Parliament, and has asked for this report to be put on Thursday' s agenda, pursuant to Rule 114 of the Rules of Procedure.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The second proposal is from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, regarding the vote on Mr Bouwman' s report on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer, requesting that the vote be brought forward to tomorrow' s voting time.
This is because the Council intends to take its decision on this on 3 December.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The order of business is thus established.
Speeches on points of order
Madam President, I would just like to draw the attention of the House to what happened yesterday in Rome.
A disaster occurred in which many firemen died and others were wounded; some of them are in an extremely serious condition.
They rushed to save human lives with the same courage displayed by the firemen in New York.
I feel that it is right for us, as European citizens and the European Parliament, to pay tribute to these brave men who have laid down their lives in an attempt to save the lives of others.
A block of flats collapsed, and if these men had not sacrificed themselves, others might have died.
I feel that Parliament should also pay tribute to these brave, remarkable firemen.
Mr Tajani, I have already sent a message of condolences to the Italian government.
Madam President, I, too, would like to express my grief at the deaths which occurred in the incident in Rome yesterday, and to express my heartfelt thanks and full support for the work of the police force and the municipal police, in particular, who are always ready and willing to act in the front line, not just to combat crime but also to come to the aid of European citizens at difficult times such as these, and who are always prepared to lose their lives doing deeds of great bravery, as, sadly, happened in Rome as well as New York.

Madam President, in this week dedicated to employment, I wish to draw your attention to the several thousand Portuguese workers who live in the worrying situation of great instability, with companies going bankrupt with impunity and no one being held responsible, even when it is known that they were viable and had healthy order books, which is what has happened at Molin, Confelis and Norporte.
Despite Portuguese workers having the lowest wages in the European Union, there have recently been countless cases of companies not paying salaries on time, already involving more than PTE 20 billion and many thousands of workers.
I would, in particular, highlight the situation at the Mandata e Mortensen glassworks in Marinha Grande, at the Sotima timber plant in ProenÃ§a-a-Nova, at Cuftexteis, in AnsiÃ£o, and the threats being levelled at hundreds of workers at the Eres textiles company in FundÃ£o, because of their local and regional importance and because of the consequences for the development of the areas that are affected.
Apart from showing some solidarity with these workers, Madam President, I should like you to inform the Commission and the Council of this serious situation that is affecting thousands of Portuguese workers.
Madam President, speaking as a Basque and, therefore, as a Spaniard, I would like to thank you for the sensitivity you always show with regard to the problem of terrorism in the Basque country.
On the other hand, and I am sorry to have to say this, I must point out that from time to time on these occasions when, in theory, we are supposed to be observing a minutes silence, there are people in this House who continue to talk, even on the telephone, which seems to me to show, amongst other things, a total lack of consideration.
Under Rule 19(4), may I ask you to personally intervene with the Greek authorities on behalf of my constituents Paul and Lesley Coppin of Mildenhall, and Anna Skinner of Epping, in relation to her brother Anthony Adamiak, and on behalf of the other Europeans who are currently in jail in Greece for plane spotting.
We respect the independence of the judiciary in Greece and the cooperation we have thus far been given from the Greek authorities, but when these people have already been in prison for three weeks without charge and now have a further two weeks before charges are brought, I hope you will agree that there is an urgent humanitarian need for an appeal on their behalf and also a need to remind the Greek authorities of their absolute duty under the Convention on Human Rights to bring charges before defendants.
Twelve people went on holiday and have ended up in jail.
I ask for your intervention on behalf of the European Parliament.
Mr Howitt, you are aware that Mr Van Orden already brought up this issue at our previous part-session in Strasbourg.
Of course, I acted upon Mr Van Orden' s comments and my Cabinet contacted the Greek permanent representation.
We were given some further details.
There was, in fact, due to be a court hearing this Monday.
We are unable to confirm whether or not this hearing took place.
I am perfectly willing to intervene myself, depending, of course, on how events unfold, and on the situation, which, I can assure you, we are monitoring extremely closely.
Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members, whose acute interest in human rights and compliance with the rule of law in the Member States of the European Union is most gratifying.
At the same time, I am glad for this opportunity to point out that all substantive and adjectival rules, human rights and the rule of law are complied with to the highest degree in Greece, as I believe they are in the United Kingdom.
Having said which, I believe that the judiciary in my country will be scrupulous in complying with the requirements of both Greek domestic legislation and international conventions.
However, I should like to take this opportunity, merely for information purposes, to apprise the House of certain facts, so that we know where we stand.
We live in an age in which terrorism operates on an international scale.
The people arrested in Greece had been arrested on a previous day at another airport and cautioned against taking photographs of military installations, especially during operations or exercises and, according to the newspapers, transcripts of communications between air force aeroplanes and between aeroplanes and the base were found among their effects.
They were then found at another airport and it was at this other airport that they were arrested, having been warned what would happen beforehand.
So, as you can see, in these times of heightened awareness of the threat of terrorism, in these times when everyone knows that this sort of ban applies to every military base in Europe, and given that they had been warned, there was no more room for flexibility or turning a blind eye.
Nonetheless, I am sure that the proper procedure will be followed to the letter because Greece is at the vanguard of the 15 in providing the necessary guarantees for all citizens brought before its courts, irrespective of where they are from.
I trust that these few words have given the House the information it needed.
Thank you, Mr Souladakis.
Ladies and gentlemen, given that I have a further ten or so points of order, most of which relate to this issue, and that this matter is almost turning into a debate in itself, I propose that we leave the points of order and proceed to the debate on the preparation for the Laeken European Council, as these comments could be made after the debate.
Future of the European Union
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the Laeken European Council on 14 and 15 December 2001;
the report (A5-0368/2001) by Mr Leinen and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Laeken European Council and the future of the Union (2001/2180(INI));
the report (A5-0399/2001) by Mrs Kaufmann, on the Commission White Paper on European Governance (COM(2001) 428 - C5-0454/2001 - 2001/2181(COS));
the oral questions (B5-0529/2001) to the Council and (B5-0530/2001) to the Commission, by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the European strategy to promote quality in employment and in social policy.
At the end of the joint debate, I have six motions for resolution concerning the European Council, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
I would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Louis Michel.
We are pleased to have you here and I shall now give you the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the areas to be discussed at the European Council in Brussels-Laeken on 14 and 15 December will include the future of the European Union, European security and defence policy, enlargement, the fight against terrorism, the area of freedom, security and justice, the general situation of the EU and its prospects, employment and social cohesion, headquarters and various bodies and agencies, and lastly, external relations.
With regard to the future of the European Union, the European Council will adopt the text of a declaration that will launch the debate on the future of Europe.
The first chapter of the text will analyse the strengths and weaknesses of European integration, the second will bring together the issues that the Convention might tackle, and the third will set out how the debate will be organised.
The General Affairs Council of 19 November has already confirmed that the Member States agree on the procedures.
The principle of calling a preparatory Convention is an important step towards building a Union that is stronger, more readily understood by the people, and more focused on meeting its essential objectives.
Representatives from governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and the European Parliament will take part in the Convention.
With regard to the candidate countries, the Presidency' s proposal is based on the following principles: they will be fully involved in the work of the Convention with the right to express their views; they will be represented in the same way as Member States, in other words, by one representative for each government and two parliamentary representatives. The representatives from candidate countries who have not yet signed their accession treaty will not take part in the consensus when the Convention draws up its final report.
The Chair of the Convention will be appointed by the Laeken European Council.
The Chair will be assisted by a Presidium made up of representatives of the various component groups of the Convention.
The Presidency-in-Office of the Council will take part, but the precise involvement of representatives of the following two presidencies is yet to be decided upon.
Lastly, the Secretariat of the Convention will be fulfilled by the Council' s General Secretariat, which will be able to enlist the help of the Commission, as well as the secretariats of the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
We have reached unanimous agreement on consulting civil society through representative organisations at European and national level.
We dispensed with the idea of a Forum made up of a separate assembly.
These organisations could be interviewed or consulted in line with methods that are yet to be defined.
The contributions from these organisations will be included in the official documentation sent to members of the Convention.
The Convention will begin its work as soon as possible under the Spanish Presidency and will complete its proceedings by the European Council in June 2003.
We are still considering the length of time that will pass between the end of the Convention' s work and the beginning of the Intergovernmental Conference.
With regard to the themes, the Presidency' s approach was to work on the basis of the content of the Declaration of Nice to draw up a sufficiently broad and coherent mandate, which the Presidency could use for its work.
The Presidency supports the recommendations made by the rapporteurs, Mr Leinen and Mr MÃ©ndez De Vigo, on this point.
These themes are placed in five groups of open and impartial questions: the goals and the content of the Union' s policies, the division of competences between the Union and its Member States, the democratic legitimacy of the system, the ability of the Union to decide on and to pursue policies.
When the Prime Minister visits each capital city, he will present an outline of the Laeken Declaration.
The subjects that the Convention may tackle will be presented in this outline in the form of questions and choices, so as to enable the delegations to issue an opinion with full background knowledge.
To sum up what I have said on this important matter, I would like to make the following comments.
Whatever the content of the Laeken Declaration, the Convention will remain in charge of its own agenda.
I think that there would be no point into trying to shackle it with a predefined mandate.
The Presidency has attempted to set out and clarify the themes dealt with at Nice, where the declaration was willingly drafted in a relatively open manner.
Nothing that the Presidency proposes should be interpreted as a mandate for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.
The mandate of this conference will be decided in accordance with the procedures laid down under the Treaties.
Lastly, the goal of the Laeken Declaration is to ensure that the Convention method is fruitful and that its results are taken up by the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference.
The debate on the future of Europe must also aim to make the European Union more transparent, more effective, and bring it closer to its citizens.
In this regard, the Council took great interest in Mrs Kaufmann' s report on the White Paper on European Governance.
The report contains some valuable guidance.
I particularly support the concern to ensure that the greater involvement of civil society in the way the Union works does not adversely affect the key role played by the representatives that have political responsibility.
I shall now turn to the European security and defence policy.
The Presidency will submit a report to the European Council that sets out the progress that has been made.
Work is well underway on improving military capabilities and strengthening civil capabilities, as shown at the capabilities conferences held on 19 and 20 November 2001.
With regard to declaring the European security and defence policy operational, the Union is faced with the following dilemma: either it cannot issue the declaration because of a veto imposed by one of the NATO members, who is not a member of the EU, or the Union declares it operational without the declaration having any real capabilities, as it is unable to use NATO assets.
In both cases, I want to draw your attention to the fact that it is, of course, the Union' s credibility that is at stake.
The third approach recommended by the Presidency is to declare that the Union will decide how to respond to each situation, depending on the military and civil resources and capabilities at its disposal.
These are my comments on the European security and defence policy.
(NL) I should now like to turn to another topic, namely enlargement.
The Commission' s report was debated extensively at the General Affairs Council of 19 November.
Remarkable progress was made in the accession negotiations.
Consequently, we should be able to finalise the accession negotiations involving the countries that are ready from 2002 onwards, thus enabling these countries to take part in the 2004 elections.
The Belgian Presidency is proceeding with the same robust and regular rhythm as its Swedish forerunner.
At the same time, attention was focused on the implementation of the acquis communautaire by the candidate countries.
At the European Council of Laeken, the Heads of State and Government will be given the opportunity of sending out a few messages to the candidate countries.
The timeframe that was established in Nice and clarified in Gothenburg will be fully complied with.
Enlargement is irreversible, and ten new Members could be included by 2004.
In 2002, the Commission will make proposals to the Council concerning agriculture, cohesion policy and the budget of the Union.
The Commission will sketch a roadmap for the countries that are not involved in the first enlargement round.
Additionally, it will carry out a plan to strengthen the institutions of the candidate countries and will set aside EUR 250 million for that purpose.
I should now like to say a few words about terrorism.
The Presidency will be presenting a summary report at the European Council of Laeken, outlining the Union' s measures to combat terrorism.
That report will also look to the future.
These days, in my view, it is safe to state that the Union has responded promptly and effectively to terrorism.
Its response was comprehensive, and that is the added value which European action brings: the Union has asserted itself as an effective and credible, in fact, vital partner, on which the United States and third countries can rely in the fight against terrorism.
The Union has established its diplomatic and humanitarian role.
The Union and the euro zone have contributed to the stabilisation of the economy in a turbulent period.
Finally, despite major efforts which the fight against terrorism has required, the Belgian Presidency has not lost sight of the EU' s other priorities, including enlargement, the follow-up of Tampere and Lisbon, etc.
(FR) I shall now turn to establishing the area of freedom, security and justice.
The Laeken European Council must reiterate the importance of establishing the common area of freedom, security and justice.
The Union' s response to the challenge posed by the tragic events of 11 September has shown the political will of Member States to make progress in this area.
The introduction of a common asylum and immigration policy was one of the priorities of the Belgian Presidency' s work programme.
The progress we expected has not been made.
The Laeken Summit should be the opportunity to reinvigorate the asylum and immigration policy by implementing Tampere, to supplement and strengthen the coordination of instruments for police and judicial cooperation, by finally establishing Eurojust, to reiterate the principle of mutual recognition, thus demonstrating the trust that each Member State places in its partners' legal system.
On a practical level, the Presidency hopes to reach an agreement in Laeken on the following issues: a framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States; a framework decision on the fight against terrorism; a framework decision on the execution of orders freezing assets or evidence in the European Union and an agreement on the common list of terrorist organisations.
To move on to the next point, which is the economic situation and prospects for the European Union.
This issue will be discussed on the first day of the European Council.
The Finance Ministers will present their 'eurokits' and will announce the outcome of their negotiations on cross-border payments.
The message from Laeken must be to increase the Union' s credibility by emphasising the progress we have made, particularly in the area of international trade after the Doha meeting, in stressing the benefits of the single market and in respecting the economic Stability Pact.
The summit will stress the need to reiterate our determination to pursue the process launched at Lisbon and at Gothenburg.
With regard to the preparation of the Barcelona European Council, specific action needs to be taken before the end of the year - we must establish the Food Safety Agency, make progress on Community patents, reach agreement on cross-border payments in euro and on public contracts, as well as implement the Galileo project.
As far as employment is concerned, the European Council will discuss the 'employment package' .
It will support the aspects of this package as well the guidelines for 2002.
In these guidelines, the European Council will include a new horizontal objective on the quality of employment and will also adopt a first list of agreed indicators for the quality of employment.
Regarding the headquarters and the various bodies and agencies, the Heads of State and Government will try to reach an agreement on where to locate the headquarters of various bodies and agencies of the EU and the European Community.
As for external relations, the European Council will examine international issues in the light of current events.
If necessary, it will issue an opinion on the situation in Afghanistan, the Balkans and the Middle East.
As you will have noted, the Belgian Presidency has worked hard to show that the European Union has an important role to play on the international stage.
To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, I have outlined for you the work programme of the Laeken European Council.
This Council will be where the European Union takes decisions on some fundamental issues that will map out its long term future, such as the physical introduction of the euro, the confirmation that enlargement is irreversible and the operational aspects of the European security and defence policy.
The Laeken Council will also be the starting point for considering the future of European integration.
The citizens of Europe will be broadly consulted on this issue.
This is the meaning of the so-called Laeken Declaration.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the summit at Laeken can be an historic one.
Our group has every faith in the Belgian Presidency, because Belgium has always been faithful to the ideal of European unification and, above all, because Belgium has always stood for the European Community approach.
We, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats do not want Europe to be governed by a few great nations, but, rather, we want Europeans to work together, we want the European Community approach, and so we wish you, Mr President-in-Office, great success.
Both you and the President of the Commission have spoken about the enlargement, and the memory is still fresh in my mind of a conference with the leaders of our related parties from the acceding countries, that is to say, from the countries desirous of joining the European Union.
Following on the French foreign minister's highly misleading statements, we declare loud and clear that we must not give the impression that those who will be ready to sign the Treaties in the coming year will have to wait for the stragglers also to comply with the criteria.
Each country must be judged on its own merits; it is on this basis that we must proceed with the enlargement of the European Union.
At Laeken, you will no doubt be considering Afghanistan, which is indeed necessary, and we repeat that it is necessary to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist networks.
Now, though, we must also create the basis on which the international community, comprising the European Union, the USA, and the Arab and Muslim world, will now help Afghanistan to rebuild itself, making it possible for a humane society to come into being there, with a government in Kabul that respects human rights, including the rights of women.
It is that task that is before us in the days and weeks ahead.
I would like to comment on the Middle East.
We urge all the parties involved to return to the negotiating table.
I am being very restrained in my use of language when I say that we greatly regret the way that the Prime Minister of Israel behaved towards the visitors from the European Union. These were Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, Mr Michel, the Foreign Minister and Council President and also Mr Solana, the High Representative.
We have no patience with the way that the Israeli Prime Minister treated our delegation to Israel - and I can remember some of Israel's great Prime Ministers, such as Ben Gurion, Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin.
(Applause)
We encourage the Commission and the Council to keep to the course they have set.
We will always defend Israel's security, as we have always done in the past, but the people in Palestine are as much entitled to human dignity and a life lived in security, as are the Israelis, who rightly lay claim to that for themselves.
(Applause)
Let me make another comment on the Convention.
We have high hopes for what you will be deciding at Laeken.
The composition of the Convention is, numerically at least, well-known.
I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to use all your influence to ensure that the fifteen government representatives are the sort of people who will work together in the Convention and will feel themselves bound by whatever proposal for a decision results from it, so that the governments, too, will be made to discharge their duties with regard to what the Convention brings into existence.
For the Convention is not some kind of seminar, so - if, at the end of it, we are to be able to say more than just Yes or No, and I know perfectly well that the governments want that to be the case - the Convention must come up with something so convincing that it will be binding on the governments.
Our group will, in any case, be sending its best and most experienced people to the Convention, so that we can achieve a real result.
We also echo President Prodi's demand and beg you to make your influence felt in order to make it possible for the Convention to start as early as possible in 2002 - in February or early March under the Spanish Presidency - and then be concluded under the Italian Presidency at the end of 2003, giving us, by then, a new Treaty ready for signature, on which we can then have very comprehensive and repeated discussions here in Parliament.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what I am saying reflects my profound conviction that Laeken is such an important summit precisely because it will be about the future direction of our European Union, about whether we carry on the way we did at the mini-summit in London, with seven countries taking part, eight countries not taking part, and the European Commission not even present, that is not how we envisage Europe.
On the contrary, Europe is for us the European Community.
It is our wish that you, the Council Presidency and the Commission make Laeken an expression of this Community, and if you do that, you will have our entire support.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the threshold of a summit, under the Belgian Presidency, that will be very important in the history of the European Community.
Geographically speaking, Belgium is at the centre of the European Union. I hope it can also manage to be at the Union' s political centre.
With regard to the agenda that Mr Michel has presented, Madam President, I would firstly like to state my group' s support for the Leinen, MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Kaufmann reports, that deal with the fundamental issue of the future of the European Union.
Firstly, we have always supported the idea that there should be a Convention, because this has proved to be the method that allows for public debate, and for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be drawn up democratically.
With this in mind, we think that this is the best method to implement: a Convention that is politically solid, that has democratic support and which is methodologically consistent with its objectives.
For this reason, I would like to make some practical suggestions to Mr Michel with regard to the statements he has made.
Mr Michel, in this instance, Parliament would be grateful if you could act in the same way you did with the Convention for the Charter of Fundamental Rights with regard to appointing a President.
Propose a President at Laeken and let the Convention elect the President.
I think that this is a question of good manners, which, in a democracy, are very important.
Secondly, I also think that it is significant that you speak about the dual democratic legitimacy of the Union, because it currently seems as if civil society has nothing to do with MEPs or with members of the Member State parliaments.
It is important that we should open up to and consult with the organisations that enrich civil society, however, we must not forget that democratic legitimacy is essentially achieved through elected representatives.
In this regard, Mr Michel stated that the membership of the Bureau or Presidium of the Convention remains open.
If the President and the troika have a presence in the Bureau, the European Parliament' s proposal will make sense - two MEPs and two representatives from Member States - for this will provide a balance between the two branches of democratic legitimacy.
We also insist that there should be a wide-ranging and coherent proposal; we do not want to have to choose between a selection of sample proposals.
And in relation to the potential time gap mentioned by Mr Michel, we would like to see a proposal, under the Greek Presidency, that brings the work to a conclusion; we do not want the outcome of the Convention to be postponed indefinitely. It must have a follow-up and must lead to a decision from the European Council.
With regard to the Commission, Mr Prodi, I would urge you, with regard to the responsibility you have as guardian of the Treaties, one of the Commission' s functions, to make proposals as quickly as is possible.
There are two points in Declaration No 23, for which the Commission has full jurisdiction, the simplification of the Treaties and the division of competences.
Some time before, you should table a proposal that we can debate.
This is one of the Commission' s functions that cannot be taken away.
With regard to governance, a related issue, we would ask you not to damn us with faint praise, as the British say, and which we Spanish might express as 'killing us with affection' because there are some really interesting proposals, but now the Handelkern report is being published.
Why can we not sit down together and reach an interinstitutional agreement on governance?
We also have a democratic responsibility and we cannot consent to legislative power being taken away from us though the back door.
This is a serious warning.
(Applause from the Left) Lastly, Madam President, with regard to the CFSP and the fight against terrorism, you will all be aware that we are all working very hard, using the emergency procedure, on producing a European Search and Arrest Warrant, a framework decision on terrorism, a fight against money laundering, which is also important and related to terrorism, and we think that a joint effort by all should be made on this matter.
But our actions must also show that we have learned from our mistakes and shortcomings, and there is a very serious shortcoming for which the European Union should accept responsibility, and I think that at Laeken an important step could be taken by making defence one of the issues we should address in the Convention and which are to be incorporated into the Treaties.
Finally, Madam President, we have very important political responsibilities where Afghanistan is concerned.
The first hostages of terrorism have been the Afghans and above all the Afghan women.
And in the Middle East we have to continue in our attempt to find a solution that will ensure the security of the State of Israel' s borders, but which will also allow the Palestinian State to function and to be respected.
Our debate today is on the future of Europe and I might take that as a point of departure.
President Prodi has talked about the indispensable necessity of the institutional triangle: the Commission, Parliament and Council.
It is indispensable and each part of it has a core, indispensable role and responsibility and benefits by the very fact of the three parts working well together.
Personally, I am getting increasingly fed up with so-called analyses in newspapers and commentaries on issues of personality which miss the points of substance.
The point of substance about the role of the Commission is that it is at the heart and core of the European project - and it is indispensably so - and that is the structure of truth which we must promote, defend and constantly revisit.
With regard to a sense of Europe as Hans-Gert Poettering mentioned earlier, I believe it has been diminished at the highest level through Members of the European Council.
Every State has a right to bilaterals and multilaterals but there is a time and a place for every one of those initiatives.
It is not the time and place to conduct such an initiative immediately preceding and in the same place as a Council meeting that is meant to discuss the same issues, as at Ghent.
When we reduce the European Security and Defence Policy to the somewhat farcical theatre of presence or absence at the dining policy at Downing Street, we diminish the idea of Europe itself and we need, from the top down, at the level of the European Council, a commitment to an internally consistent and coherent sense of Europe.
The Commission President and Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo have both referred to this question of the interinstitutional dialogue and balance and President Prodi has talked about the very sensitive issue of call-back procedure.
The one plea I would make, and we have already asked Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee to deal with this question with some urgency, is that before us now is the responsibility, among other things, to begin to implement one major part of the structural economic reform programme of Lisbon, namely to create a single European market for financial services.
If we cannot work out the levels of commitment and lay down rules with proper conditions between Parliament, Commission and Council, we run the risk of failing to meet the target and the necessity for reform.
There is therefore a general urgency and, in some parts, even a specific one.
I hope all candidate countries will participate in the Convention, under the principles of Helsinki, namely equal treatment.
That is all and there are 13 candidate countries.
Secondly, I hope there will be a minimum period between the Convention and the IGC.
I agree with all those who said that this business of reform must be finished before the next European election because then there will be a new Parliament, a new Europe after enlargement and a new Commission.
Madam President, in the short time available to me, I do not wish to repeat what has been said by our excellent rapporteurs, nor do I wish to concern myself with the strategy of the Council and the Member States, who have, for months, been setting this Convention up to be as feeble and unsuccessful as possible.
In this historic context, with one of the most important summits, preparing for an historic Intergovernmental Conference, in the offing, I wish to address the Commission.
Mr President of the Commission, I would very much like to remind you that all the great projects of European integration began with the Commission's visions and outlines and that the Commission was the spiritus rector and visionary behind almost every great step forward.
Let me remind you of the Single European Act, of the first Delors package, of Maastricht with its second Delors package and the Report on Economic and Monetary Union, of the White Paper on the completion of the internal market, of the White Paper on growth, competition and employment with its visions of the social dialogue and of a social chapter in the Treaty, of the White Papers on environmental policy and on the role of Parliament and of all the great concepts produced by the Commission, which went ahead of the Intergovernmental Conferences to prepare their way.
You speak today of the institutional triangle, which will indeed become a struggle for power between Council and Parliament, but where the Commission should be, I see nothing but a black hole.
Mr President of the Commission, where is the Commission's White Paper on European democracy?
Where is your draft European constitution?
Where is your White Paper on a system of checks and balances in this supranational space, on the Convention's methodology and on fundamental citizens' and human rights in Europe?
None of these have you produced, and today's marginal comments by you are insufficient.
Just to single out one point: if you do not even give this Convention the right to elect its own president from among its own members, you are disowning it before the eyes of the European public as a whole.
That is only one of the many errors you have been propagating instead of a vision.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I would like to say something about the Laeken Declaration and, in particular, about the Convention.
Especially since the failure of the Nice Summit, this Parliament has agitated for a new method for Intergovernmental Conferences.
Across party boundaries, it has worked jointly with our colleagues in the national parliaments and together with various representatives of civic society, to consign to the past, once and for all, the politics of secret diplomacy behind closed doors, of opaque decision-making and of horse-trading in marathon sittings through the long nights.
I believe this new approach, with the calling of a Convention, to be crucial to the European Union's future viability, for the primary issue here is the reinforcement of democracy in Europe.
It is, above all, about our citizens, about a comprehensive and broad debate on what shape should be taken by our common European home, which we hope we will, from 2004, share with ten more European countries.
Mr President-in-Office, today you have put before us the salient points of the Laeken Declaration, which is to be ambitious in its scope.
Let me return to a number of issues.
My group sees the composition of the Convention as being of extraordinary importance, and we take the view that two things, in particular, need to be taken into consideration here.
One is the principle of political pluralism.
There is an absolute need to guarantee that the various political forces are represented in the Convention and that the delegations of this Parliament or of the national parliaments should include not only representatives of the major political parties but also, because we need them, representatives of smaller political parties in the various European Union Member States.
Above all, we need a productive bilateral political debate, without which discussions will be lacking in interest.
Both sexes also need to be appropriately represented.
I see that amendments to the report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen have been tabled on this subject. I hope that many Members will support these amendments so that, above all, the national parliaments and the Council will also then consider how they may comply with this criterion.
I believe there is an urgent need for purposeful and structured dialogue with civic society, something which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have mentioned.
We could, I think, also consider whether the Economic and Social Affairs Committee, which is an important mouthpiece for civic society, might play an intermediary role in this area.
I am very pleased with the announcement that the Convention is to draw up its own agenda, as not only questions about the institutions will have to be dealt with, but also a broad spectrum of the most diverse political issues, as well as the issue of how a wide variety of European policies are to be formulated in the future.
A report by the Commission tells us that 60 million people in the European Union are affected by poverty, at present, and I find myself thinking that this appalling figure alone tells us what a great need there is for political action, and that this Convention must be about a change of direction and a new kind of politics in Europe.
Mr President, the scope of European Union foreign policy needs to be extended in the light of the recent international developments, but the Member States' governments have to realise that we cannot have a common foreign policy without joint intelligence.
The geopolitical situation, poverty - an increasingly serious problem - and the growth of terrorism - there are now cells in all the countries of the globe - must prompt us to start work at Laeken on a project to introduce genuine joint intelligence, new intelligence which is not created or developed along the same lines as Europol but which is capable of being used transparently with political, economic and cultural analysts who will be able to focus our foreign policy on that cooperation and timely intervention without which the European Union, with or without institutional reforms, will not be able to get off the ground.
With a view to achieving peace in Afghanistan and the subsequent reconstruction of the country, the Union' s role both as mediator and a proactive force must be defined now so that Afghanistan' s future is characterised not just by economic recovery and the establishment of a democratic political system, but also by the reestablishment of a role for women in politics and social life.
The Union cannot ignore the fact that, to bring about genuine peace in the Middle East, we must work actively to oppose those who encourage, or, at any rate, do not offer resistance to local terrorism which, it is now quite clear, is supported at international level, and the Union has the economic and political tools to intervene along these lines.
In conclusion, the success or failure of the Convention depends on the will, the genuine European convictions motivating us, our will as individual parties and governments not just to produce documents on reforms but to focus on practical action that, as well as improving the situation of our own countries, can improve the situations of countries that look to us for help too.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, the EU' s Heads of State and Government have decided to hold a Convention on 14 and 15 December with a view to designing a constitution for a federation of national states.
Now, let us clear up any confusion.
A federation of national states is a federal state.
A federal state is a state and not a federation, in the same way as a fruit knife is a knife and not a fruit.
States have constitutions, while federations of states are based on agreements in international law between independent nations.
I call upon the Heads of State and Government to give the Convention a clear mandate.
Is a draft constitution for a federal state to be devised, yes or no?
Or is a draft agreement between independent nations, not designed to establish a state, to be devised?
Why not let the Convention devise two different, clear and unambiguous proposals, one for a federal state - model 1, as envisaged by the federalists - and the other for a federation of states - model 2, as envisaged by the Euro-realists and focusing upon the cross-border problems we cannot solve ourselves in our own parliaments?
Submit the proposals for public debate, followed by a referendum in which all EU citizens are asked if they want a constitution for an EU state or an agreement between nations acting together.
When we have their answer, an Intergovernmental Conference can be held with a view to proposing changes to the existing treaties.
The great majority of people in all EU countries want a referendum.
Why, then, not ask for their views before we do anything in their name?
Let us have a peaceful and competitive debate concerning Europe' s future, and let the people give their answer.
I believe that people will prefer our version of a Europe of democracies, as set out in the minority opinion of the members of SOS Democracy.
I would happily defer to the majority in a referendum, but never to officials and ministers operating behind closed doors.
Mr President, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the report drafted by my colleague Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and myself enjoys the support of a very large majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with only Mr Bonde, Mr Berthu and Mr SacrÃ©deus being opposed to it.
So a substantial majority shares the position we have taken and I am pleased to learn today that the Belgian Presidency agrees with many parts of it and that even the Commission can go along with many of the points Parliament has made.
A powerful current of opinion sees Laeken as an important opportunity that we must seize in order to make our European Union more democratic and more capable of taking action.
If that is so, Laeken is perhaps the last chance to do this before enlargement, when the EU is enlarged from fifteen States to between twenty-five and thirty.
I am very grateful to all those who have helped to prepare the way for the new method.
I find myself thinking back to the beginning of the year, and back in January or February all this seemed a long way in the distance.
I thank all those who have contributed to a new method really becoming possible - a convention in which the representatives of the parliaments will enjoy equal rights with the representatives of the governments in giving shape to this project for the future of this European Union of ours.
The Convention, though, must not be a merely cosmetic exercise, and I believe it would be very unsatisfactory if we were to simply list the options that are already present in Europe.
That these options are there, we know from the speeches of our Heads of State.
They are well known, and they are nothing new.
This Convention must be a political forum for grappling with solutions, one in which real effort is made to reach a consensus as to how we, in Europe, are to go forward.
That is the real task.
That we are to produce various proposals, be they federalist or, on the other hand, intergovernmental in nature, sounds very appealing, but, President Prodi, if we produce a hotchpotch of proposals, can we then expect strong responses from the Intergovernmental Conference?
I very much doubt it.
The governments have the same problem. They can come up with whatever they will, but the Intergovernmental Conference's unanimity principle results in the same sort of blockade that we had in Amsterdam and Nice.
No, I believe that the Convention represents the great opportunity to use the consensus method to arrive at the overwhelming majority.
What emerges is not unanimity, but the overwhelming tendency, the overwhelming majority.
If we go to the IGC with such a coherent proposal, we maximise the likelihood of it being accepted, because governments naturally find it hard to deny themselves consensus.
Issues still remain to be negotiated, and all this will have to be put into the form of a legal text.
All this work will have to be done by the IGC, but I would warn against restricting the Convention's role to that of drawing up options using different terminology.
That is not the task for a political forum such as a Convention.
We note that, at Laeken, the Council proposed someone to preside over the Convention; that is all well and good, but I do think that the Convention should be able to confirm him in office, and should be able to elect him.
A Convention elects its own President, and that is the procedure that should take place.
President Prodi, you spoke in terms of a small Bureau.
Such a Bureau would have a great deal to do, being the organ that would have to direct this great Convention, and it would be advantageous if the opposition parties, both from the national parliaments and from the European Parliament, could have as much a sense of being represented in it as did the majority.
Turning to the timetable, I am glad that the governments themselves state that more or less one year is needed, which would mean that the Convention would complete its work in June 2003.
There would then be a break, but just for the summer recess.
I am in favour of us all resting from our labours in July and August, so that the IGC can begin in September under the Italian Presidency and we can complete the constitutional treaty by the end of 2003, in good time for the European elections and also for enlargement.
With such a document we could stand before the peoples of Europe; it is my belief that, if the Treaty is successful to the extent that children can read it at school and understand it, then we will also be reducing the citizens' alienation from Europe, which is the task before us.
Mr President, I think that the European Council that is about to take place, this time in Laeken, is of fundamental importance.
We are at one of those pivotal moments, as Karl Jaspers would say.
We will find that the introduction into circulation of euro notes and coins will increase the sense of belonging to Europe.
Negotiations on enlargement will mean that a longstanding dream of many Europeans becomes reality.
I think that the terrorist attacks against Washington and New York on 11 September have awoken the consciousness of European citizens, who are now asking for more Europe and better Europe.
Therefore, your responsibility, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is great indeed.
But let me tell you that I think you are doing a very good job, and I would like to say that this Belgian Presidency has maintained an excellent attitude towards the European Parliament, one that has been based upon collaboration, participation, listening and, in short, the desire to work together.
Support for the Convention is something that this Parliament chose to adopt a long time ago, even before Nice.
In the Resolution of 17 November 1997, which I had the honour to present together with Dimitri Tsatsos, with regard to the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were already saying that the intergovernmental method for the revision of the Treaties had run its course and that we would have to look for another method.
This method is the Convention.
Do not think that the European Parliament gave its support to the Convention because of some kind of obsession.
This is not true.
We did this because the Convention brings Europe closer to its citizens, because it is more open, more public, more transparent, more participatory; it allows, as the Convention that drafted the Charter proves, that our citizens want to be involved in the construction of Europe.
For this reason we have put our faith in the Convention, and I am happy to say that the Convention will be brought to life in the Laeken declaration.
Make no mistake about the Convention, however.
It is an instrument.
With regard to another famous Convention in history, the Philadelphia Convention, George Washington said that you could talk about everything, propose everything yet decide upon nothing. This is also true.
What we want is to help the decision making process, bringing Europe closer to its citizens, its people and bringing together the various legitimacies of the European Union.
Therefore, Members of the Council, there is no need to be afraid of the Convention.
There is no need to take a successful instrument and empty it of content.
There is no need to constrict the Convention.
You must give the Convention all it needs to be a success.
The previous speakers - above all Mr Leinen, with whom I have had the great pleasure of collaborating in the drafting of this report - have spoken about many different subjects.
Let me highlight some of these.
Firstly, the European Parliament is asking that, if we take our model to be the Convention that drafted the Charter on Fundamental Rights, the four parts of which it is comprised be balanced.
In that particular Convention, there were 16 MEPs and 62 members of the Convention.
In the proposal that you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have sent to the capitals there are still 16 MEPs, but there are 120 members of the Convention.
And I do not accept that some of these extra people are observers, because observers have exactly the same rights as everybody else, and so they should, except during participation in the final consensus.
I would also like to say, despite the words of a previous speaker, that the Commission has participated fully, and I would like to praise Commissioner Barnier' s observations, which have been very important.
However, there is still an ambiguity with regard to the word 'consensus' : consensus does not mean unanimity. This was not the case in the Convention that drafted the Charter.
There were members of the Convention that voted against - and there is one very notable opponent amongst us today - but there was a sufficient majority, a sufficient consensus. Therefore, let it not be said, yet again, that consensus means unanimity.
This is not true. It means final support for the resulting text.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there is one issue that you, yourself, said is still not resolved, which is to the issue known as 'cooling' .
And as for myself, when I have to explain that after this work carried out by the one hundred and twelve people on reaching a final result, governments want to 'cool down' , things become extremely complicated.
What is this 'cooling' process?
If the result is a good one, let us adopt it immediately, then we can move on to other things.
We have enlargement to prepare for.
To conclude, Mr President, I think that we have to get rid of this fear of the Convention.
We have to remember that Europe is asking us to give a positive indication.
But what indication?
This can only be the Intergovernmental Conference.
I also hope that, at the end of this process, the indication will be a Constitution for the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of the European Union is, as a subject for debate, no doubt closely related to, and in part inseparable from, the reform of governance, which forms the subject of my report.
You will see, on reading it, that it is not exactly sparing with its criticisms.
It takes up a very definite stance on numerous subjects addressed by the Commission in its White Paper, and, to use a phrase currently popular in Germany, a good thing too!
It is precisely for this reason, President Prodi, that it is important to me that I thank you and your colleagues for your initiative in producing this White Paper, above all for the Commission's willingness, expressed in the White Paper, to unreservedly and even self-critically examine and change all the rules, procedures and ways the EU has of exercising its authority, in short, everything summed up in the word 'governance'.
This merits every respect, being, in fact, about nothing more or less than the reduction of the prevailing gulf between the EU and its citizens.
In this, the Commission finds in Parliament a close comrade-in-arms.
We are, as is well known, only at the beginning of the debate on the reform of governance.
Many of the Commission's proposals need to be considered in depth.
The White Paper announces several initiatives, and when they are definitely on the table, we will express our opinion of them.
I assume that certain proposals can become reality quite soon and not only at the end of next year at the earliest.
I would put under this heading the committees and working parties listed in Commissioner Kinnock's White Paper on reform of the Commission, and which are participating in the consultation procedure.
I will take this opportunity to point out that I think that every future legislative proposal could have an appendix listing all the experts, associations and organisations that played a part in drafting it.
Parliament does indeed support the improved participation and consultation that the White Paper calls for, but we take the view that this requires an interinstitutional agreement on democratic consultation, and I am pleased, President Prodi, that you have mentioned this today and given it your clear support.
President Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my report takes at length a very definite position on the issue of better lawmaking, and this is not by chance, for the fundamental issue is the role of Parliament as joint legislator.
Parliament has repeatedly emphasised that it puts its trust in the Community method, and that it sees the maintenance of the balance between the institutions as the best way to make progress towards integration.
It is not, then, some concept that we are defending, but rather its content and political essence, so I want to make it very clear today that, to put it mildly, there has been great disquiet in Parliament about the Council' s and the Commission's long-standing efforts to draft an action plan for better lawmaking, about the working parties that have already and secretly been drafting papers with the objective of putting this programme of action on the Laeken agenda - all of which has been done without involving or even informing Parliament, the joint legislator.
As item 30 of this report quite clearly states, we see this as a grave breach of the Community method.
The report therefore also demands that the action programme for better lawmaking should not be on the agenda for the Laeken Summit.
This is certainly not about this House being unwilling to take part in any consideration of how lawmaking could be simplified or even improved.
President Prodi announced today that the Commission will be producing a consultative document aimed at starting a dialogue with this House on this issue, and I can tell you that this Parliament is ready for it.
Let me say, though, and say quite emphatically, something to which we attach the highest importance: that if Parliament's legislative authority, given to it alone directly by the citizens who elected it, is restricted, Parliament will not take it lying down.
It is, especially, co-regulation that is at issue here.
The use of so-called framework directives is something we view with a highly critical eye.
There must be appropriate mechanisms of democratic control, and on this point, Mr Prodi, there are evidently differences of opinion.
We want a time-limited 'call-back mechanism'.
So I was very surprised that the Council representative made no comments on this of all issues.
Better lawmaking is indeed a matter for all three institutions, and I would be interested to know what the Council Presidency has to say on this issue or on that of the proposed interinstitutional working party.
Mr President, despite all the fine words, I cannot shake off the impression that the Laeken Summit is actually intended to clean up the very soiled image of the Belgian Presidency, an attempt to brush successive howlers by the Verhofstadt-Michel government team under the carpet.
These days, one only has to read the foreign quality press, such as The Spectator and The Wall Street Journal, to realise how much damage this Belgian government is currently causing by its incompetent behaviour and, for example, by the insults which Minister Michel, present at the moment, has addressed to Austria and Italy.
That is unfortunate, for the Belgian Presidency could have easily played a significant role in this time of debate about Europe' s core tasks, about Europe' s borders and about the democratic deficit.
After all, we know from experience that the Single Belgian Federal State does not work along democratic lines and that consequently, a Single European Federal State cannot work democratically either.
We know from experience that, for example, matters of social security, are best decided at the level of the individual nations and that the principle of subsidiarity has to be followed to the letter.
We know from experience that a high level of respect is needed for linguistic and cultural differences if we are to co-exist in a proper, democratic way.
We know from experience that problems arise when people, citizens, and voters cannot identify with the political structure which decides on their fates.
In my country, Flanders, 70% of those questioned cannot name even one European institution and nearly 40% do not realise that they elect the MEPs.
Anyway, this should all be steamrollered by the Laeken propaganda machine, and in that way, the Belgian Presidency will finish as it started: insignificant and at the service of the inflated egos of a few ministers.
Mr President, the Lisbon European Council and the socio-political agenda adopted by the European Council at Nice bring us into a new phase of policy on social affairs and employment in the European Union.
As we have heard from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the President of the Commission, interest is now focussed on the quality of work and of social affairs policy.
We in this Parliament want to be fully involved in this development.
We - by which I mean the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, whose Chairman, Michel Rocard, I represent - are therefore putting an oral question to the Council and Commission, coupled with a motion for a resolution.
It is our conviction that secure jobs, favourable working conditions and appropriate workers' rights do not diminish productivity and economic growth and hence the creation of jobs, but, on the contrary, promote them.
Work for all is the objective.
We want a strategy for more and better jobs.
Quality of work involves job satisfaction, which improves employees' motivation, and health and safety at work improve as well.
We are looking to the Commission to produce a proposal on the status of temporary workers.
Moreover, quality of work involves equal treatment of both sexes, the reconciliation of work and family life, and measures to keep older people in the job market.
For this we need the most modern forms of vocational education.
There is a need for further education, in-service training and lifelong learning.
The adaptability of enterprises and their capacity to deal with structural change will be particularly important in creating new and better jobs, and minimum standards across Europe are needed to ensure that employees are involved in this, informed and consulted in due time, and thereby enabled to adjust to change.
In comparison with our economic counterparts, for example, the United States, Europe suffers from a low employment rate.
The Lisbon European Council recognised that this was a problem and proposed an ambitious objective for progressively increasing this rate.
It is absolutely vital that we achieve this objective.
The Commission has presented a communication in preparation for the Laeken Summit, in which it sets down the outlines of a strategy for promoting quality of work and social affairs policy.
The drawing-up of appropriate indicators and criteria, as Mr Prodi informed us, is not the least important of these, but is primary.
As I said at the outset, Parliament expects to be fully involved in discussions.
It is our ever more frequent experience that European social affairs policy is carried on by dialogue between sub-committees of the Council - for example the Employment Committee or the Social Protection Committee - and the Commission.
Parliament is often left out in the cold.
We protest against this.
Parliament must be able to play its rightful part in formulating proposals on subjects such as employment and social protection which, after all, are of immediate concern to all citizens.
If we are to do this, the relevant specialised fora and the Commission have to keep us up to date with the work they are doing, and Parliament has to be consulted in good time before every European Council.
We expect a clear pledge on this from the Laeken summit.
We are, at the end of the day, the representatives of the people and therefore, in essence, the primary organ of the European Union.
President Prodi just used a very fine expression in describing Parliament as the most important expression of democratic Europe.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, it is for these reasons that we look forward to your answers to our oral questions.
Mr President, after Mr BarÃ³n Crespo' s speech, there remains very little for me to say on this matter.
I am going to refer to the Commission White Paper, and also to the mysterious Council document, the Mandelkern report, to which reference has been made, but of which we have no knowledge.
The two documents deal with the legislative powers of Parliament.
Mr Prodi has made a commitment not to put forward any proposal to the Laeken European Council, and it seems right, in fact, that these issues will not be discussed at Laeken, because, in short, these are issues that affect the very essence of the process of drafting a new European Constitution and which should, therefore, be in the Convention itself, and, possibly, at the Intergovernmental Conference.
What we have to do here is to establish the legislative competences of the European Institutions, and make it clear that, of all the European Institutions, it is the organ of popular representation, the European Parliament, that holds the mandate for this popular representation.
The wording of the White Paper, relating to the powers of enforcement, to self-regulation and coregulation procedures, and to the Lisbon strategy, are all aimed at cutting back Parliament' s limited legislative powers.
Mr President, I have one minute indeed, and it is outrageous, in my view, for draftsmen of the opinion to be apportioned a meagre one minute of speaking time on such a weighty matter.
Overall, Nice has failed to come up with the goods, but as for the areas of competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, of whose opinion I have the honour of being the draftsman, the situation is not actually that bad.
I would particularly refer to the improvements made at our initiative to the workings of the European legal system.
The major concern which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wishes to express, therefore, is that whatever the fate of the Treaty of Nice may be, the positive changes which I alluded to a moment ago should enter into effect independently of the overall ratification of Nice.
With regard to the Laeken Declaration itself, to put it succinctly, the European Union must show itself prepared to meet the challenges that lie ahead.
It must focus on its core tasks and carry out its tasks properly.
In this connection, the European citizen expects Laeken to send out a clear signal that a great deal of work is being put into a European security policy, both internal and external.
I have been as generous as I can, Mr De Clercq, but one has to recognise the time that is allocated to your Committee.
Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Prodi is here to listen to this.
The Environment Committee is very unhappy with the idea of voluntary agreements, as a way of proceeding.
We want to see a legal framework for them because we believe that this is far too much like secret law-making.
We are not at all happy about the co-regulatory approach - whatever that may be - because we see that as a way of moving away from binding legal instruments, which can sideline democratic control.
Mr Prodi will know that we are very happy with the idea of publishing expert advice.
We are grateful for what crumbs we receive and would like to see sometimes the authorship of the legislation which we then tear apart.
On the question of implementation, we are very worried about the application of the law and I quote "in a way that takes account of regional and local conditions".
We feel it would be better to draw up the law in a more flexible way in the first place.
If you are going to take account of regional and local conditions, it probably means that you are going to upset the conditions of fair and equal competition.
We see a great need for the Commission to devote more energy to the issue of implementation and we see no real need to establish criteria to focus its work in investigating possible breaches of the law.
What they need is more staff.
Finally, I recommend to Mr Prodi to read the occasional paper produced by the European Policy Centre on regulatory impact analysis.
It provides the idea of having a regulatory impact analysis on all new legislation to assess the need for it, to examine alternatives and to examine its overall impact.
It would include, and this may not recommend itself to Mr Prodi or his staff, the idea of a specific regulatory assessment office in the office of the Commission Secretary-General.
I think that would be a very good idea.
Mr President, five principles form the basis of the Commission' s reform of the EU' s forms of governance: openness, participation, efficiency, consistency and a clear division of responsibilities.
The work on these areas cannot be regarded as being complete if one half of humanity is ignored.
No one can say they are working for participation if they do not guarantee that it is both women and men who are participating.
Our Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities called for a council on equality to be set up to, for example, gather information and analyse trends; for women' s rights groups and non-governmental organisations to be part of the database on civil society that the Commission intends to set up; and for considerations of equality to be integrated into information gathering at both national and local level, because women' s and men' s priorities, circumstances and needs often differ.
It is unfortunate that none of our demands has been incorporated into the report.
Mr President, the debate on the future of Europe must be conducted in a very responsible manner if it is not to end in failure, as happened with the intergovernmental method at Nice.
We must recognise the legitimacy of the European citizenship of the citizens of the Member States, for this, too, will help to bring the European institutions closer to the citizens once again.
Today, we have to take into account the way the interinstitutional organisations' systems have developed, and the more sophisticated this development becomes the more it widens the gap between the citizens and the institutions.
When the institutions work properly, problems do not arise, but when they do not work properly - and the number of petitions we receive is evidence of the considerable gap between the institutions and the citizens - the citizens are wronged by the institutions.
Our positive response must be to strengthen the institutions which safeguard the rights of the Union' s citizens.
The Committee on Petitions has been forced to issue an extremely critical opinion on the Commission' s proposals on good governance, for it has found no reference in them either to the European Ombudsman or to the Committee on Petitions' role as the institutional body which safeguards the rights of the citizens, who indeed petition it to uphold their rights.
The proposals for good governance do not appear to contain any significant element that might succeed in bringing the citizens closer to Europe.
This endeavour could be said to be effective in theory but, in actual fact, to have no genuine impact.
Lastly, we hope that it will be possible to make the obscure role of the Council clearer, at least by advertising the institution' s sittings when it is legislating, to avoid the impression of it being a huge black hole.
I recommend the points made in these reports to the other European institutions, for I am sure that Parliament is the only body with democratic legitimacy.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, there are only two observations I wish to make, and they overlap with each other.
I believe that the European Union's practical policy after 11 September has made it clear, through the behaviour of a number of Member States which indulged in bilateralism or appeared enraptured by their own managerial airs and graces, that the European Union is strong wherever it works in accordance with the Community method, and weak wherever it does not.
That is the lesson to be learned from the past two or three months; it shows us how necessary general reform of the European Union is if this approach, which weakens us, is not to recur in future.
The conclusion to be drawn from this is that it is important that we find the right mechanism at Laeken, where the European Council will not yet, essentially, be deciding on content, but where success will depend on the methods by which the content is worked out.
One thing, I believe, must be clear. If there is to be a Convention which owes its existence to the help given by the Presidency, a number of Member States and the Commission, and in which Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments take part, then it must not be a Convention whose procedures are conceived in such a way that it does not have the room to manoeuvre needed if the right decisions are to be reached.
Nor must it lack a procedure that can serve as the basis for the final negotiations by the Heads of State and of Government.
It is, above all else, unacceptable that so much time is allowed to elapse between the Convention and the summit that the old method of the diplomatic governmental conference destroys all the political momentum built up by parliamentarians.
I believe that this will be the decisive test by which Laeken will stand or fall.
I wish you a great deal of success, knowing as I do that you, in the Council and in the Commission, share this view that these positions must be made to prevail so that we can work together with a view to a result acceptable to all.
The Convention marks the start of a new European Constitution, a bold vision of Europe' s future, a euro which is not suffering from monetary isolation but which is being embedded in socio-economic policy, a European Commission which is transformed into a European government, European elections with European lists of candidates and with people heading the lists of candidates who, via the European Parliament, can produce a president for the European Commission.
We would like more qualified majority votes in the Council and more codecision in the European Parliament.
The Council meetings must become public, allowing national parliaments to adequately monitor the Council Ministers.
We look forward to close cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
This is a vision and the possible shape of things to come.
The Convention should look to reach consensus rather than draft a catalogue with no strings attached.
The Convention must enter into an open dialogue with civil society, for part of Europe' s future lies in more European cooperation in those fields where citizens expect to see cross-border results, including food safety, immigration, environmental pollution, international crime and terrorism.
However, an equal share of the areas of policy could be apportioned to the regions and civil society.
I am thus in favour of more positive subsidiarity.
We must avoid a situation of Europe-autism and therefore focus on innovative institutional restructuring which goes hand in hand with cooperation in the various fields of policy.
Bringing about new types of European administration means adopting a more open working method and result-focused approach.
We will achieve this by introducing new instruments, such as co- and self-regulation and open coordination, but, in the event of failure, we must have the assurance that we can fall back on call-back mechanisms.
I am pleased with the resolutions before us.
As the European Parliament, let us today choose in favour of a new, transparent form of European administration and let us vote in favour of the Convention, thus ensuring a democratic future for Europe.
Mr President, in February 1787, a previous convention met in Philadelphia.
Several of the American States were opposed to calling the thing in the first place and several others were determined to restrict its mandate and to dilute its effect.
The convention's formal brief was extremely restrictive and it was not itself to decide but only propose.
Yet from that experiment flowered the American Constitution and the post-colonial parliamentary democracy that we still recognise today.
Such a similar result will only come out of this European Convention, if we as a Parliament are bold, well-organised and persuasive.
Beneath the Presidency of our European George Washington, we must draft a clear set of proposals and, while accepting the questions set for us by Laeken, we must retain the capacity to ask ourselves some questions.
Let us be truly creative for Europe.
Mr President, the Union already has implicitly in the Treaties the bones of a Constitution.
We all look to the Convention to make it explicit and clear and to create the proper legal framework for a thoroughly democratic Europe.
That, of course, will involve, as has been said in parts of this debate, fully recognising the prerogatives and powers of this great all-European Parliamentary Assembly.
But democracy at this level will not be effective unless it is also fully effective at the level of the little battalions: at the level of the local authorities, at the level of the constitutional regions, the self-governing internal nations of the Member States.
Now that means that the Convention must look to that question as well, and improving governance in Europe must, as the Commission has said, look closely at the proper involvement of regional and local authorities.
I thought that the Commission was somewhat timid in what they said about that, but alas, Parliament argues yet further timidity and talks down all the references in the White Paper to regional involvement with the Commission.
Recital M and Paragraph 26 are to be deeply regretted as currently phrased in Mrs Kaufmann's otherwise admirable report. We want to see these amended.
We want to see a strengthening of the reference to the necessary involvement of the Commission and Parliament with the regional and local authorities, as well as with national parliaments.
We do not want to subvert the constitutional framework of Europe. We want to improve it.
Mr President, the Laeken Summit is to form the basis of a new EU treaty.
The European Parliament' s resolution demands that this change to the treaties results in a constitution for the EU, that is to say, a decisive step of sorts on the way to a federal state.
I believe that something essential has been forgotten, namely that the Irish people have made use of their right to reject the Treaty of Nice.
This right, and this rejection of the treaty by the Irish people, should be respected at the Laeken Summit and a statement made to the effect that the Treaty should be rewritten.
The message from Ireland is clear: less centralism and supranationalism and more respect for national democracy.
What we need are treaty changes along the following lines: openness in the Council of Ministers, with the opportunity to monitor decisions by the national parliaments, at the same time as the national parliaments are given the opportunity to propose laws instead of this right' s being located in the Commission bureaucracy.
This is an important debate and I would like to compliment the Commission on its publication of the White Paper on European Governance.
In light of recent developments, it is obvious that it is a time for stocktaking but there can be no doubt about the relevance of the European Union to Member States and its citizens.
In most respects the European Union has lived up to the ideals and aspirations of Europe's founding fathers.
The achievement of peace alone justifies our existence but we have achieved much more, not least the fact that the ideals enshrined in the Treaty of Rome - of assisting economic and social development of small and under-developed countries - have by and large also been achieved.
Ireland bears witness to this fact and, despite the outcome of the Nice Treaty, Irish people readily acknowledge the benefits of our membership and also support proposals on enlargement.
So what has gone wrong?
We have failed, in my view, to communicate Europe.
Citizens do not feel part of the European family.
Their perceived isolation from the decision-making process has left them frustrated and cold.
That sense of abandonment has led to the apathy and indifference as demonstrated by the lower turnout in recent European elections and, in Ireland's case, rejection of the Nice Treaty.
The Commission and Parliament are right about one thing, the EU lacks democratic legitimacy.
Furthermore, no layman, nor many MEPs, really understand how the whole thing works.
The White Paper and this report are all part of a hard sell, the idea being to sell the EU concept to our citizens more aggressively so that the people will learn to love it.
Beneath all of this is the interinstitutional battle and both Mr Prodi and Parliament are desperate to preserve the Community method, fearing there is too much intergovernmentalism about.
Whoever wins this battle between the institutions will make no difference to ordinary people.
It is time to put the true intentions of the EU project to the electorate in each Member State.
Only then will we know whether they want to be a part of it and whether the project can ever work.
But perhaps after Ireland, Denmark and Switzerland, that may be taking democracy a stage too far for all of you.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen have, once again, presented us with a truly sophisticated report, but I feel that they have dwelled a little too much on methodology.
It is, of course, better to have a speedboat rather than a rowing boat, as you can go faster in the speedboat, but if you do not know where you are going, you are not at so great an advantage.
I welcomed the comments made by Mr Poettering, Mr Cox and Mr Voggenhuber, who, for the first time in a long while, focused on the issue of the Commission in their speeches.
In my view, we are now facing a very serious problem.
We have a fight on our hands.
There is a tug of war going on between the Council and Parliament.
We are increasing our powers of co-decision, but, at the same time, we are in the process of destroying the Commission.
In doing so, we are introducing further bureaucracy, and I do not think there is any point, Mrs Theorin, in discussing transparency, governance, co-decision and democratic legitimacy, when we cannot even talk about electing the Commission by direct universal suffrage.
I believe that the balance of our institutions depends on this and that we cannot run our economy along the same lines as the great American model. It is the balance of our institutions, the check and balance, the division of powers, and not how to share the cake between the various institutions that our discussions, our debates and the Intergovernmental Conference, as well as the imminent Convention, should focus on.
I think that this is the only way to fight against further bureaucracy, the only way to once again make our institutions meaningful, the only way to reinvigorate European integration.
So, as Mr Salafranca said, there are no favourable winds for those who have no clue where they are going, and I think that, first and foremost, the problem that Parliament has is to know and understand in which direction it wants to travel.
Mr President, President Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed, by our unanimous adoption of the Kaufmann report, our ability, in the very short time available to us, to act in concert and respond to important reform proposals from the Commission, on which we will be able to take up a position either today or tomorrow, just in time for the European Summit at Laeken.
Let me just pick out a few points from the Kaufmann report and highlight the following: Mr Prodi, we are delighted to learn that you are sticking with the joint working party proposed in October.
What matters now is that we get it moving quickly and start collaborating appropriately on the subject matter in hand.
We, in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats insist in any case on an early start being made on this work.
We are glad that the Commission of the European Union has given up developing what would have been, in effect, its own administrative structures right down through the regions, towns and local communities, as we read about, for example, in preliminary drafts of its White Paper.
It is also our opinion that it is fundamentally unacceptable that the Commission should adopt a method of open coordination, bypassing its co-legislator Parliament, with guidelines sanctioned only by the Council of Ministers and with the Commission using the financial reins of the programmes to set their general course.
Here, too, the co-legislator needs to be involved.
We urge you to undertake an in-depth reform of the comitological procedure.
It is not acceptable that, with the help of the national bureaucracies, Parliament's legislative prerogative should be made null and void by means of implementing provisions whose content, purpose and extent are not laid down in advance.
We also demand that European agencies be kept to a minimum.
May we remind you that the Commission and the European Parliament are born allies when it comes to the promotion of European integration and action in the interests of Europe's citizens?
The transposition of European legislation requires at every level its own culture of public administration, which must also embrace the application of European rules through the authorities in the Member States.
There is an urgent need for appropriate instruction and training of civil servants at these levels.
Thank you, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, this debate is, in fact, far too early to be able to rate the chances of success of the Laeken Summit realistically, but, Mr President-in-Office, it is already a fact that the Belgian Presidency will be memorable, even if it was only because the attack on New York has put the fight against terrorism and Europe' s role in the world, at the top of the list of priorities.
For my group, it is vital for the Laeken Summit to spell out once more that we have our own contribution to make, especially in the search for political and diplomatic solutions for international conflicts, with full backing from the UN institutions, and that we also want to reactivate the dialogue with the Arab States.
The EU' s own role means, inter alia, that Europe refuses to ignore or suspend the principles of the rule of law and human rights in the name of the fight against terrorism, and that Europe insists on justice in the framework of an international court of justice and not in the framework of exceptional courts.
Mr President-in-Office, I hope that Laeken will drive home this clear message to the United States, among others.
Nevertheless, the risk remains that this priority could push aside the sixteen other priorities.
That is why, on behalf of my group, I would like to convey a wish to the Council Presidency. We expect the Council Presidency to make an extra effort at the Laeken Summit to clarify that the Lisbon objectives also apply at a time when we face economic decline, when companies are being restructured and unemployment continues to rise.
It is important for the Laeken Summit to demonstrate to people that Europe is not just about the introduction of the euro. It is also about economic growth, employment, the future of pensions and the fight against social exclusion.
Mr President-in-Office, Laeken' s piÃšce de rÃ©sistance will undoubtedly be the declaration about the future of Europe.
This declaration is still one of the Prime Minister' s personal projects with which he, in the capacity of President-in-Office of the Council, is doing the rounds of the capital cities.
As the draft document is still a well kept secret for this Parliament too, we are having to make our contribution to the declaration without, in fact, any knowledge of the content of this document.
I find this regrettable.
That is why I should like to pass on a few suggestions which are extremely important to us in the framework of the declaration on the future of the European Union.
First of all, we must avoid a situation where the Laeken Declaration sets up scenarios whereby the competences of the European Union are cast in stone, thus not allowing Europe any room for manoeuvre where this is not explicitly provided for in the Treaty, or a scenario in which use is made of lists of competences.
Mr President-in-Office, such scenarios certainly do not meet the expectations of the citizens.
Secondly, there is the risk, if I can believe the lobbies, that Europe' s voice will be somewhat drowned out by that of the delegations of the Member States.
We trust that Laeken will launch a balanced Convention and that, furthermore, the participation of women will be guaranteed.
Thirdly, Mr President-in-Office, I was taken by surprise a moment ago when I heard you say - and I hope I did not misunderstand you - that "l'idÃ©e d'une assemblÃ©e parallÃšle au forum de la sociÃ©tÃ© civile a Ã©tÃ© Ã©cartÃ©e" .
This is very bad news, for it is obvious to me that the debate on the future of Europe is already being compromised if the civil society is not accorded a clear status, if a structured platform for a dialogue with the civil organisations is not really being created and if all that remains is a virtual computer debate with no room for real participation.
I hope that this can still be rectified in Laeken, but I would nevertheless wish the Council Presidency every success at this stage.
Mr President, you said that openness, efficiency and bringing the EU closer to the people were to be important issues at Laeken.
I could not agree with you more about that.
Following the not entirely successful compromise in Nice, the Irish referendum and, according to many opinion polls, growing scepticism towards the EU project in quite a few Member States, there are high expectations of the Laeken Summit, with changes to the EU anticipated.
The EU must become more intelligible and citizen-friendly.
A clear constitution is needed, explaining how the EU is governed and who does what.
The EU must cut back on the work it does and concentrate on the cross-border problems.
I do not believe people want the EU to do more in all areas. Instead, they want it to deliver the goods in those areas it has made its own, taking decisions openly.
It is completely unacceptable for it to legislate behind the closed doors of the Council of Ministers.
If it is to be possible to simultaneously enlarge and deepen the EU, we must involve people and win back their trust.
That is not something we can do through fine declarations and constitutional exercises of an academic nature, but through genuine reforms and political courage.
I hope the rest of the European Council is as courageous as the Belgian Presidency.
Mr President, I would just like to reiterate what the rapporteur, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, said just now.
There is no sense in setting up a Convention and then doing our level best to stop it succeeding.
What do we mean by 'succeeding' ?
Success means achieving substantial progress towards a stronger, more integrated Union, which will inevitably involve reducing the role and powers of each State, that is the problem, Mr Michel, and increasing the role and powers of the common institutions.
This is your responsibility now as European Council, and this is the decision you must make: to reduce your powers.
At Nice, you failed precisely because the intergovernmental method is an obstacle in itself, in that it favours those who are lagging behind and forces everyone to conform to their slow pace.
The President-in-Office, Mr Michel, and President Prodi have been through some really tough times in recent months, times when the lack of joint instruments was starkly and sometimes cruelly clear.
I feel that the Convention, a genuine Convention, should be an embryonic constituent assembly, and that it is the only thing that can make the future of the European Union brighter than the confusion which reigns at present.
Mr President, with regard to the European strategy to promote quality in employment and in social policy, announcing and adopting plans is not enough: quality employment with rights must be created and tangible objectives must be set to ensure that all social rights are respected.
Creating jobs is not enough: they must not be precarious, employees must be able to live with dignity and must be paid on time, unlike the current situation in Portugal, which, despite the low official rate of unemployment, still has the lowest salaries in the European Union, and where job insecurity is growing worse, the number of companies that are behind in paying their employees is increasing and it is becoming more and more difficult to develop areas that are reaching crisis point.
A policy seeking to achieve quality in social terms calls for priority to be given to employment with rights, with particular emphasis on women and young people, including their training, but also on pay and contracts, and special attention must also be given to the elderly and to pensions, especially minimum pensions, which means that the European Union cannot continue to insist on giving absolute priority to the monetary policies of the Stability Pact, as it is still doing.
Mr President, in our view, the draft declaration that the Laeken Council is due to publish to shape the debate on the future of the Union seems to have been drafted under some very odd circumstances.
According to press reports, the Belgian Presidency says that it deliberately did not release the document to its partners too early, so that they would not have the time to rewrite the text.
This is not a very co-operative way of working and this is what leads us to warn the members of the Council: do not forget that you are representing countries and national democracies, which should have a free hand in these negotiations.
The ideal scenario would be to initially establish an interparliamentary forum consisting of representatives of the national parliaments or which works on the basis of proposals from the national parliaments, as the latter are well placed to sum up the feelings of each nation.
In any case, I would say to the Heads of State and Government, do not allow a mechanism to be imposed upon you that would lead to proposals being made that are out of touch with the interests and preferences of our people.
This is a point that I will explain in greater depth in my explanation of vote on the resolution that will be tabled.
Mr President, many Christian-Democrats have played a leading role at each stage of the development of the European Union, and even now we want to make a joint effort in order to turn Europe into a lasting success story.
The Nice Summit, which was supposed to be the summit of truth, cannot really be described as a run-away success, certainly not in terms of its intention to properly prepare the Union' s institutions for enlargement.
The Heads of State and Government will now hopefully realise that they can no longer afford any half-hearted or premature conclusions at Laeken.
The report by Mr Leinen and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo indicates very clearly what decisions are crucial to secure a bright future for the Union.
We back this report and I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs warmly on their work.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your work is not complete, and neither is the term of your Presidency.
It would therefore be premature to draw up an assessment of your Presidency at this stage, but pending the Laeken Summit, I should still like to say the following. We have noted, and this is also evident from opinion polls, that European citizens have given up.
They are not really turning against Europe, but they no longer feel involved.
Therefore, more attention should be devoted to issues such as: more information, more public debate, more openness towards the NGOs, making it clear that the Union' s objectives do have a bearing on every single person and that the Union shows equal respect for every human being.
In this connection, I would call on you as Head of Government of a small country not to allow yourself to be pushed into a corner again, as was the case in Ghent and in London, in fact.
People cannot understand this and accept this even less.
I would also urge you to continue to guarantee the same respect for all languages and their users.
I would therefore urge you to discontinue your planned intentions concerning the use of language in the bureaus for the protection of industrial right of ownership.
People do not understand this, neither do they want or accept this.
They do not want a second-rate language, and neither do they want to be treated like second-class citizens.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will just mention five points in the short time available to me.
Firstly, I welcome the Convention. It is not a constituent assembly but it is all we could realistically achieve.
Secondly, we need to be careful not to undervalue or trivialise the term 'European Constitution' , and the members of the Convention need to be courageous and innovative in their role.
Thirdly, federalism must not be a matter just for the States and the European Union, with the basic regional and local levels and linguistic and national minorities being excluded.
Fourthly, with regard to the method, Commissioner Barnier is right to talk about 'maximum consensus' . We are not aiming at unanimity on the reforms.
Fifthly and lastly: the timetable. We must beware of excessively long delays between the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference supposed to adopt the European Constitution, for it is an unfortunate fact that enthusiasm for reforms wanes fast.
Mr President, Mr Leinen and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo's model of a Convention sets out an accessible and also, I hope, successful way ahead into Europe's future.
I also agree with your desire, in response to statement 23, for an enlarged agenda which, however, the Convention should set for itself.
Even such an enlarged agenda, though, offers little hope of achieving the desired result, namely a single basis for decision-making.
I am far more inclined to think that the possibility suggests itself of submitting to the Council various options which could also take account of the different positions.
I know that on one point I stand quite alone, although I am in the right.
I wish to reiterate my warning against setting an earlier date for the Intergovernmental Conference planned for Nice in 2004, because I am firmly convinced that the people would see it as an evasion of their vote.
If, as all sides in the House maintain, we really are striving for an open debate which is accessible to the public, then nothing could be better suited to that than to include the themes in the next European elections.
Mr President, the Belgian Presidency has played a major role in completing some of the groundwork for the Union' s enlargement.
One is indeed struck by the optimism which is taking possession of those involved: the naming of the date 2004 suggests that the work is nearly finished.
There is even talk of a big bang of ten countries acceding simultaneously.
Commissioner Verheugen is sensible enough to state that it is possible that up to ten new countries will join in 2004.
After all, it is not up to us to determine an accession date for the candidate countries. The year 2004 is an assumption and a hope, but holds no guarantees for any Member State whatsoever.
We, and they, should therefore continue to make every effort to achieve a sound and credible result.
A great deal needs to be done within the current Union in order to clarify the significance of enlargement.
Naturally, many are right to be truly enthusiastic about this fantastic, historic process.
But under the influence of those who believe they can secure political gain from xenophobic sentiments, a climate of uncertainty has emerged.
False representations of the costs involved in the enlargement are doing the rounds.
They are designed to instil fear and are based on worst-case scenarios: as if it has not been clear for a very long time that the cost of this whole enlargement process would be covered by the EU budget.
Far more important is greater awareness of the need for anchoring more firmly the character of the Union as a union of democratic constitutional states.
The events of 11 September have illustrated this more clearly than ever.
The fight against serious crime and terrorism is a common cause, and reticence in this connection will jeopardise the safety of citizens.
It is actually very strange that our union of constitutional states, as such, has not resulted in greater trust among the Member States and their legal systems.
A great deal will need to be done about this in the coming years.
May I offer my congratulations to the co-rapporteurs for an excellent report and also to the Belgian Presidency for having carried the idea, born in Parliament, of preparing the next Intergovernmental Conference by means of a Convention nearly to fruition, although we still have the Laeken Summit to come.
This is a dramatic improvement on the preparations of previous Intergovernmental Conferences.
Instead of the usual group of foreign ministry officials meeting together behind closed doors we will have a publicly representative body taking ideas from a wide public debate and coming up with a coherent set of proposals for reform.
This is a tremendous opportunity but does not guarantee results and it is for us to make something of it.
We will do so if we avoid divisions on the theology or vocabulary of European integration where we are sometimes divided on the word even though we are united on the substance.
Let me give a couple of examples: in some political parties and countries the word "federalism" is mistakenly equated with centralism and they talk of creating a centralised super-state in the way that Mr Farage spoke earlier.
That is not what anybody wants and if you define federalism as different levels of governance, as decentralised as possible but centralised where necessary with each level democratically structured, then we already have the beginnings of a federal-type system and I am happy, under that definition, to proclaim myself a federalist.
In some countries the word "constitution" is an almost sacred text that has emerged after revolution or after national independence.
In other countries such as the United Kingdom it is a more pragmatic concept.
In that pragmatic sense we already have a European constitution, not a very good one, but we have it and we should improve it further.
The constitution is the Treaties which lay down the field of competence of the EU, the powers of the institutions, the legislative and the budgetary procedures.
Let us recognise that de facto they form our constitution.
Let us improve our constitution by firstly codifying it to make it simple and clear in a single text so that citizens can see how this constitution operates, and secondly by clarifying it in several ways: clarifying the responsibilities, what the Union is and is not responsible for and clarifying the structures.
Let me give one example of confusion that we have now.
The functions of Mr Solana and Mr Patten should be merged into a single individual to represent the Union externally, perhaps with a special status as a specially appointed Vice-President of the Commission.
Finally, as regards clarity and democratic accountability: it is essential that all legislation passes the two tests of acceptability to the Council representing the States and acceptability to Parliament representing the citizens, a double guarantee as to the quality and acceptability of European legislation.
I said this is an opportunity, but it is not a guarantee.
We must fight to make the necessary changes come about through the Convention.
Mr President, in the opinion of the Liberal Group the Convention must suggest alternative prototypes for the development of the EU.
One of these alternatives is the trend (currently underway) towards a federal state.
The supranational Commission would be developed into a federal government, exercising executive power and directing the Union's legislation; this would operate subject to the confidence of the supranational European Parliament.
The Council of Ministers would be developed as the Parliament's second chamber.
Along with this federal model, we must consider a structure which will be built upon the principles of an association of states.
Here, the leading body would be a reformed Council of Ministers made up of representatives of the Member States.
Since the Council would hold the right of initiative, it would not be able to operate in its present manner as a legislative chamber representing the Member States.
In this case, alongside the supranational Parliament there would be a second chamber formed in order to strengthen the position of the Member States, which would be composed of members of the national parliaments.
This type of decentralised association of states is, in my opinion, better suited to an expanding European Union than a centralised federal model.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen, for their sterling work and the manner in which they have conducted themselves, for want of a better word, from start to finish in order to include as many ideas and views of the Members of the European Parliament in their reports as possible.
Obviously, there are as many excellent and interesting ideas, visions and proposals for the future of Europe as there are responses to the challenges facing the European Union.
However, not one idea, vision or proposal can be implemented or can bring in results unless the right method is used to put flesh on the bones of these visions and proposals.
And the right method is none other than a convention, a body which needs to reflect accurately all the current political forces in Europe.
The work of this convention, which we believe should be the subject of the fullest democratic dialogue, should result in a proposal which is a synthesis and product of all the views formulated at it.
Only thus will the foundations on which the Europe of the future is built be more representative, more democratic and, hence, more efficient, not to mention permanent and equitable.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, I know that you are in a hurry and must go, but I would like to thank you very much for keeping the promise you made to Members of this House, to bring nothing to Laeken on which a decision had already been made, and for being so determined that there should be an interinstitutional working party.
Such cooperation with Parliament is quite exemplary, and I wish to thank you most warmly for it.
I would, though, also like to extend my warm thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Leinen, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mrs Kaufmann for having focussed their excellent reports so well on the vital importance to us of making Europe's decision-making structures more democratic and more efficient and for pointing out that there must be no contradiction in this, much as that might have appeared to be the case here and there, with elements of democracy having to be sacrificed for efficiency's sake.
Both as regards the Convention and legislation, what matters to us is that we, as the people's directly elected Members of Parliament, are convinced, not that we can do everything, which would be quite false, but that we should have control of the decision-making process.
Mr President of the Commission, some small differences may well still be there.
We want this 'call back position' only in the event of a delegated decision-making structure being incapable or coming to the wrong decisions - wrong, that is, in the sense of being contrary to what the legislature intended.
It would be better, and is always good, for others to reach decisions along the lines that we have indicated in our fundamental decisions and political approach.
I hope, firstly, that the Council is now willing to set up this interinstitutional working party soon, and, secondly, that we will be able, taking the Mandelkern and Kaufmann reports and the Commission's Final Conclusions as our basis, to conclude the Agreement as early as June next year, or, at least, that the Council will be able, next June, to agree that the three institutions have found a way to take Europe into a future which will be more highly developed and marked both by democracy and efficiency.
Mr President, the issue of European governance is such a complex problem, and one that our fellow citizens have difficulty in understanding, which is, in itself, a paradox.
We all know that Europe is suffering from a serious democratic deficit, and that is why there is obviously a need to radically reform the way in which powers are exercised at European level.
We must do so and bear in mind three objectives, namely to clarify the decision-making process, to improve the efficiency and transparency of this process, and to encourage the involvement of citizens.
That is why I support the guidelines contained in the White Paper and the Kaufmann report.
We must, of course, ensure there is greater transparency in the Council' s work, we must encourage the European Parliament and the national parliaments to play a greater role in the legislative process. We must simplify Community legislation and make it possible to undertake genuine consultation with civil society.
Furthermore, I think it is worthwhile, as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs stressed, to draw up an inter-institutional agreement on co-legislation, to guarantee that the European Parliament plays an effective role and fulfils its political responsibility.
The reform of governance is therefore a step in the right direction.
However, it will obviously not be a substitute for the radical reform that our institutions need so badly.
We must provide ourselves, as soon as possible, with a simple and understandable constitution, clearly defining the division of competences, clarifying everyone' s role so that citizens finally understand who does what, and so that they can know who is responsible.
Lastly, as everyone in this House knows, we cannot have democratic power without democratic legitimacy.
That is why the President of the European executive must one day, and one day soon, I hope, be elected by universal suffrage.
Mr President, the Laeken Summit will be a major but difficult summit, particularly because of the importance of the subjects that will be debated.
In this brief speech, I would just like to focus on the institutional elements of the summit.
The Convention must concentrate on instigating a new phase which will produce a Constitution leading to the creation of a federation of nation States, but it must also establish the competences of the various institutions: the Commission, the Council, the Member States, the regions and the major cities.
These are decisions which will have to be made under the banner of solidarity and subsidiarity, two values which must inspire our new Constitution.
The Laeken Council will also have to discuss the timetable for this progression towards the new institutions.
Indeed, we must ensure that decisions which are fundamental for the future of the Union are not taken at the time of the electoral campaign.
That is why we feel it would be appropriate to initiate the Intergovernmental Conference earlier than planned, during the Italian Presidency in the second half of 2003.
Clearly, the people must be involved in the process of creating a Constitution through the votes of the parliaments - for example, we would have preferred Parliament to have been given the opportunity to debate and amend the Nice Charter for there are parts of it, particularly those regarding the individual, which are wholly unconvincing - especially regarding the European Parliament, for without the involvement of the citizens and their representatives we will not be able to transform the Europe of the euro into a political Europe which can enlarge its borders in the future, maybe even as far as the Yurals: in other words, a great Europe which will bring a long, lasting period of peace.
Mr President, I am going to concentrate on the legal issues, which are what is most worrying right now when it comes to the structural aspects of the EU.
The Council is in danger of infringing Articles 8 and 10 of the European Council Convention, together with Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, freedom of expression, respect for private life and the protection of personal data.
That is something people cannot do much about.
Because there is no balance of power in the legal area, the terrorist legislation, which is entirely necessary, is in danger of undermining democracy in the long term.
The intergovernmental model is out of date.
The European Parliament must become a co-legislator and the EU' s Court of Justice be given full powers.
The Council cannot be turned into a so-called state within a state.
On 11 September, the EU' s structure in terms of pillars ceased to be at all effective.
External and internal security issues became ever more closely connected.
Vigorous measures to combat terrorism and serious crime are now required.
These must nonetheless go hand in hand with increased public control and legal protection, especially when it comes to what are known as the principles of due process, such as, no punishment without law, proportionality, the presumption of innocence and the right to a defence and to be tried before an impartial court.
These rights must become unconditional at EU level.
The Laeken Summit must signal the start of openness and democracy, which are prerequisites for successful enlargement.
They require a convention on a mainly parliamentary basis, obviously with a substantial number of members from the EU institution closest to the people.
The Convention should be able to work towards producing a proposal, so that people in future know what it is they are to adopt a position on.
Anyone who wants to develop the EU and make it better and larger should support the thinking that is being done in terms of devising a constitution which is characterised by an effective division of power and which, it is to be hoped, will develop out of today' s excellent reports.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no democracy without a Parliament.
Today again we find that the European Parliament is the principal integrating element in the European Union.
Nowhere else do Council, Commission and Parliament engage in public discussion, not always achieving unanimity, but openly, and, I hope, constructively.
Our three rapporteurs have presented excellent reports.
This Parliament has, since Nice, been pressing forward with a Community process which must burst forth in Laeken.
I share President Prodi's concern that the European Union is not yet adequately equipped to cope with enlargement, and so I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to check again, and check carefully, whether what was decided in Nice really does enhance the working capacity of the Council and of Parliament.
I doubt it.
The European Community and European Union have developed splendidly over the past nearly fifty years to date, and I hope that the next fifty years will be prepared for in such a way that we can work even better in the European Union over the next fifty years.
Mr President, the forthcoming summit in Laeken will be an extremely important meeting. At this summit, the agenda will need to be drawn up for the Convention which has to submit the reform proposals for the European institutions.
And everyone knows how important agendas are for the outcome of consultations.
We are happy with the planned make-up of the Convention, except that I should like to add that it is important to strike a political balance.
This will mainly be the responsibility of the national parliaments.
Furthermore, I am also of the opinion that the chairman of the Convention should be elected by the Convention itself.
With regard to the agenda for the IGC of 2003-2004, the Council has naturally included the four points of Declaration 23 appended to the Treaty of Nice.
I should like to briefly comment on these four points.
As far as the demarcation of powers is concerned, we are in favour of a more federal structure of the European Union, with a clear distribution of tasks among the Union, the Member States and regions.
Concerning the structure of the future treaties, we endorse a basic treaty with a constitutional character which must also include the Charter.
In respect of the role of the national parliaments, we believe that they must primarily encourage and monitor their own ministers in the supervision of the implementation of European policy.
Are there any more topics for the Convention?
Yes, I should like to outline five.
The common foreign and security policy must be included in the Community Pillar.
The policy in the field of police, justice and criminal law must also fall within the remit of the Community, with a European public prosecution office, a public prosecutor and a Community Europol.
The European Parliament must be granted full legislative and budgetary powers.
The President of the European Commission must be elected by the European Parliament and the European Council of Ministers must meet in public when they discuss legal matters.
I am pleased that Mr Prodi has said this now, and I am very interested to see if Mr Michel shares this view.
These are the topics which mainly centre around transparency and the Union' s democratic content and which, as far as I am concerned, should be added to the Convention' s agenda, thus affording the Union a more stable foundation which meets the requirements of a modern constitutional state when the new Member States accede.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my opinion, the most important aspect of the Laeken Summit is the following: that the Council is able to reverse the trend seen in Nice, that is to say, that we move away from this feeling of failure at the summit that marked the end of the French Presidency a year or so ago, towards a feeling of success at the Laeken summit at political level and for Europe' s citizens.
I think that this is what the excellent Leinen and MÃ©ndez de Vigo report is calling for.
In addition to the details, the concrete proposals, which are, of course, important, the essential thing is to develop a new perspective at Laeken, a constitutional perspective, and this means, without any doubt and as I said before, reversing the current trend.
The method for the forthcoming reform is of fundamental importance.
As is the Convention.
But neither must we let the Convention develop into some kind of tedious rigmarole, and in order for this not to be the case, the Convention should be called in order to prepare reform with true content and a real agenda.
If the agenda for the forthcoming reform remains restricted to Declaration 23 annexed to the Treaty of Nice, we will not be getting off to the right start, and the report that this House will, probably, approve tomorrow, calls for more than this.
It calls for a more wide-ranging agenda.
Above all, it calls for an agenda that, once again, includes the policies of the Union and the institutions that are intended to manage these policies.
