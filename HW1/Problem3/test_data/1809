Because in the future Ireland, the Netherlands and others will be directly or indirectly burdened with the consequences of problems that their EMU partners knowingly and wilfully left unsolved.
Madam President, we believe that the recommendation, adopted on Monday by the Council of Finance Ministers, which puts Ireland in the dock because its budget is, allegedly, expansionary, is disproportionate, to such an extent that we have to wonder why it was made.
It is disproportionate because Ireland seemed rather like the good pupil in the European classroom and its level of inflation, which, at the end of the day, really is fairly low in absolute terms, does not threaten to destabilise the whole eurozone.
Under these circumstances, why demand restrictive measures which might have a harmful effect on Ireland?
In order to explain this, you have to look at the analysis of the new single monetary system, in which small adjustments achieved by varying exchange rates are replaced by a rigid single currency system, supplemented by strict procedures.
Therefore, adjustments through markets are replaced by centralised, administrative adjustments.
Is there any guarantee, however, that this new administrative process will produce better results than the market process?
We do not believe that this is the case.
The only guarantee is that an economic policy that does not suit all countries will be forced onto the various Member States.
This rigid system may have disadvantages which, in the long run, will cancel out the presumed advantages of the single currency.
There is still one question that has not yet been resolved.
Is this compulsory unified policy one that has been determined by the larger countries for their own benefit and to the detriment of smaller countries, or could it one day perhaps backfire on the larger countries themselves?
I have no pat answer to this question.
At the moment, Ireland might well believe that it is part of the first scenario i.e. that it is a smaller country being sacrificed to the interests defined by the heavyweights.
However, the question is more complex because, behind the condemnation of Ireland, there are larger targets in the firing line and France is, perhaps, the prime target.
The point is no doubt to set a precedent for, or even to reinforce the idea of, referring to the multilateral surveillance procedure under Article 99 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that it can be extended to other Member States in the future.
The process of constraint is, therefore, far from over.
Europe' s disciplinary role may first affect the smaller Member States, but it may, in future, have an effect on everyone.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our discussion today is rather strange because, from what Mr Wurtz and Commissioner Solbes Mira are saying, I have the impression that they are fighting the same battle.
Both of them are saying to us that you do not have the right to grow, but you do have the right to spend.
To take the first point: you do not have the right to grow.
Here we have a Member State, Ireland, which has an impressive budget surplus, an extremely small budget deficit, a very high growth rate and a level of inflation which, while it is too high, particularly because of reasons beyond its control, nonetheless respects the major part of what we said must be respected in the stability pact, Yet you are telling Ireland that growth is not a good thing, despite the fact that it has respected the criteria.
Mr Wurtz is telling us that we must have the right to spend.
I would point out to you, Mr Wurtz, that that is not the case in Ireland.
Ireland does not spend excessively.
It has strong growth precisely because of the fact that its spending is not excessive.
The decision on France, on the other hand, was to make a token gesture and issue a minor reprimand, but to state that the situation there is quite acceptable.
Yet, I note that France patently does not respect its commitments.
France had undertaken to reduce its public spending and to make tax cuts.
This imbalance has been upset.
We can see that the trend of reducing budget deficits is slowing down in France, whereas growth is becoming stable.
We can see that France has the highest level of public spending of all the countries in the eurozone.
We can see that France' s national budget is being used to fund spending on the wages bill, which, logically, ought to belong to the market economy.
None of this is satisfactory but you do not say anything, because France, like Germany and Italy and other countries, is too big for you to handle.
I am, therefore, concerned, Commissioner, because and I am not blaming you in order to have a real 'policy mix' , you need to be bolder, politically speaking, to be better armed, legally speaking and to be equipped, economically speaking, with rather more complex analytical equipment than we have at our disposal.
In fact, in this matter, we are suffering from a lack of Europe rather than an excess of Europe, and it is the smaller countries that are taking the rap for this deficiency!
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the Commission and the Council because we have one year before the euro is introduced for real and this economic policy coordination, which we have been hoping and praying for since we changed over to the euro, really needs to take shape.
I do not know when or how the Commission and the Council would be able to use this procedure in Article 99, and paragraph 4 in particular, if not on this occasion.
Imagine that they had to do this next year.
I do not think that would be possible.
They have both been guardians of the Treaty as well as guardians of the general interests of Europe.
As a consequence, economic policy coordination has not yet been achieved.
Commissioner Solbes Mira has just presented a document that has been adopted by the Commission and which we shall study very closely; in other words. It is a document which will enable us to forge ahead in those areas.
We would like to thank him in advance and we hope that we will be able to improve the system on this basis.
Perhaps what we should be criticising is the gap between BEPGs in the budget, rather than the recommendation that the Commission has just drawn up.
When BEPGs, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, are set out, everyone is gathered around the table - Ireland, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, and so forth. The issue that we are coming up against today is that once BEPGs have been adopted, everyone goes home again and adopts their own budget, almost completely forgetting what was established collectively, among equals.
The problem today is that the Commission is dismissing a budget that the Irish Parliament has already adopted and it is assessing the outcome of internal debates held in Ireland, France, Germany and Italy after the fact.
I would, therefore, like to congratulate the Commission once again for having adopted this resolution.
Mr von Wogau wonders if the Irish economy may really has such an impact on economic and monetary union.
Of course it does not, but you must go back to Article 99(4).
It says that the Commission must make these recommendations and the Council must adopt them when the proper functioning of economic and monetary union is in jeopardy, and also when the economic policies of the Member States are not consistent with those that have been defined collectively.
This is certainly the current scenario.
Let us move on to the question or whether a large or a small country should have been reprimanded.
Do you think that one day the Commission could have criticised a larger country which was sending out negative messages that might weaken economic and monetary union if it had not previously responded in this way to a smaller country? - I still do not know the difference between a larger and a smaller country, but never mind.
I do not believe so and I therefore welcome the decision taken by the Commission on Monday.
Madam President, the economic unification of Europe is a great adventure, but fortunately we have fifteen Ministers of Finance who keep a close watch on each other in Ecofin.
Although we cannot be absolutely sure of that, of course, since meetings are held behind closed doors and sometimes also behind a smokescreen.
Only very exceptionally, when things are really getting out of hand in one country, does Ecofin open its doors, does the smokescreen lift and does the colleague concerned get a public reprimand.
This week, Ireland became the first country to suffer this fate.
Are things going so badly with the Irish economy then?
Can we really not trust the Irish?
Not at all.
On the contrary, Ireland is doing well, as has already been mentioned by many speakers.
For five years Ireland has enjoyed an average growth of 5%, with unemployment down from over 16% to scarcely 4% and a budget surplus of over 4.5%.
Admittedly there is a threat of the economy overheating and there is a risk of inflation, and that was not within the framework of the agreements made by the ministers themselves.
But all in all it is not strange that the Irish should feel harshly treated.
However, much greater risks lie in wait.
The possible next Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, has announced that he wishes to lower taxation despite a budget deficit and despite a ratio of public debt and gross national product that is more than three times the size of Ireland' s.
What we wonder is whether the Council of Ministers will administer a public reprimand here too.
Commissioner Solbes Mira, though we have doubts about the necessity of taking Ireland to task, in the latter case you can count on our support.
Madam President, I believe that the Commission's censure of Ireland is a serious breach of Ireland's democratic freedom.
The freedom of an elected government to frame its own budget in accordance with its electoral commitments is fundamental to democracy.
I therefore urge Ireland's Minister of Finances not to renege on his promises to increase spending, on health in particular, and to lower taxes, especially for the lower-paid.
I hold no brief for tax cuts for the wealthy, nor is this a budget that would be proposed by the Green Party.
Nevertheless it is a programme that has been negotiated with the social partners.
Ireland has particular difficulties with inflation because of its traditional ties of trade with the UK, which remains outside the eurozone.
This is an aspect of Irish inflation which has been completely ignored by the European Commission.
In fact, if the European Commission had deliberately decided on a course which would alienate the UK from joining the euro, by revealing itself to be an out-of-date bureaucracy which tries to bully elected governments in ways that are completely outside its brief, it could not have done better.
This is absolute political stupidity to say the least.
This interference with the Irish budget is the result of the Maastricht Treaty; the Commission is even trying to get governments to agree their budgets with it in advance, which was not part of the Treaty.
I therefore anticipate a resounding rejection of the Nice Treaty in the Irish referendum this Summer because of this unwarranted interference and because this is a very bad treaty, as many in this House agree.
Since 1994 the cumulative increase in employment has been 39 per cent.
Today the economy is close to full employment, which is a huge sea change for Ireland.
Irish unit labour costs are still more than 10 per cent below the eurozone average.
Therefore both wage rises and tax cuts for the low paid are on the agenda for Ireland in 2001.
I believe the Commission is deliberately trying to interfere in a field beyond its competence.
We must not let this happen.
Over the last five years there has been a dangerous increase in inequality with the rich becoming very rich and the poor becoming ever more marginalised.
We will not and cannot tolerate this continuing.
I want to thank Parliament for debating this issue.
I encouraged Mr von Wogau to table this question because I believed that Parliament would treat this important precedent in a fair and balanced way - and indeed it has.
Furthermore, I recognise that everything discussed in the Commission was in secret and everything discussed in the Council was in secret.
And we had to accept the press releases from the propagandists when it was all over.
So, at least in this House we have an open and democratic airing of the whole subject, and I welcome that very much.
One thing we speakers from Ireland forgot to say was how much the European Union has contributed to the success we have.
I do not want to go into all the details, but I want to mention one factor that is underestimated, which is the way that the Irish economy - being small and open - responded to the internal market.
It is no coincidence that Ireland took off the day that borders were abolished in Europe and we got a free market.
That was important.
Another thing that is exaggerated is the transfers of money.
A Commission study, when Ireland had an economic growth rate of 10%, showed that the transfer of structural funds to Ireland only contributed 1.5%, if that.
So the people who say that Ireland has grown on handouts from Europe are exaggerating.
What disappoints me about all this is the shock expressed by the Irish finance minister.
He was told this by the Irish Economic and Social Research Institute, just as the Commission told him.
He was told it by the Irish employers' association.
He was told it by the central banks.
And if he had a problem with it - with the trade unions demanding increased wages - it was because his policies had already stoked inflation and had already undermined their real incomes.
Even if we were not in the Union and in Monetary Union, we would still be affected by the decisions taken by the European Union.
In that sense, there is no such thing as sovereignty for a small, open economy like Ireland.
The minister is reputed to be a sportsman.
A sportsman should have obeyed the referee when he blew the whistle when somebody broke the rules.
Even if there is room for argument about whether the Commission was right or wrong, for our minister in his arrogance and our Tanaiste to pretend that they could not accept or understand that was dishonest and unfair.
Commissioner, I wish to begin by reiterating your words at the very beginning of your speech, to the effect that in this matter, the role of the Commission is to coordinate the economic policies of the countries of the European Union and this function has nothing to do with the normal transfer of Community funds.
Commissioner, I would like you to answer the following questions: how do you think the Irish economy can be cooled down when the rate of inflation in Ireland is higher than the interest rate set by the European Central Bank and, therefore, money in Ireland is very cheap?
You and your colleagues, Commissioner, know that, in the United States of America, there is a difference in the rates of inflation between the various states.
This does not necessarily affect the stability of the dollar, however.
Why should this situation, in the case of Ireland, whose economy only represents 1% of the European Union' s GDP, be crucial to the stability of the euro?
Finally, Commissioner, you mentioned the Stability Pact several times, but not once did you mention the Growth Pact!
I would say that stability is important if there is to be growth, and I would give the example of Ireland, which has been a Member of the Union for twice as long as Portugal and Spain. Nevertheless, it has already shown such high levels of growth that it has reached the Community average.
This makes me wonder whether the Commissioner would not also like to consider the possibility of not seeing the Maastricht criteria, particularly inflation, as his Bible and whether there are not other, more important aspects for him to think about in order for Europe and all the countries in Europe to grow at a healthy pace?
Madam President, the Commissioner finished his speech by saying that not that many consequences can be drawn from this case.
I agree, which precisely raises the question: "Why bother?"
I accept that, as a Commission, you have the right to do what you did.
As Guardian of the Treaty, you have the duty to act, if you believe that is correct.
I accept that Ecofin endorsed the judgment of the Commission.
The Irish Government too has a right and duty to defend its policy preferences, where it feels it is right to do so.
I do not question your right, Commissioner, to do what you did, but I question your judgment.
I believe it was the wrong judgment in the context of such an important precedent-setting example.
I believe the Irish response was the wrong response because it was too petulant.
I believe both the Commission and the Irish response to the Commission's recommendation lacked proportionality.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
In the grey economic space, the budget was inflationary, but, on the supply side, the tax change will bring greater participation in a stretched labour force.
The tax change will lower wage expectations and therefore inflationary expectations.
The capital expenditure will get rid of infrastructural bottlenecks; the case is at best a grey case.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union' s criticism of Ireland' s economic policy is controversial.
As I see it, there are good reasons for supporting the Ecofin Council' s recommendation.
The economic policy guidelines, on which all EU Member States have agreed, are concerned basically with ensuring that we do not once again slip into the galloping inflation and devastating budget deficit of the Eighties, which subsequently led to a backlash in the form of crisis and unemployment.
Ireland is the first Member State which is now seriously beginning not to meet its inflation targets.
Against the background of the crisis in the Nineties, it is therefore perhaps only reasonable for the EU to react.
Now, things are beginning to go well for Europe again.
No-one begrudges Ireland its fantastic growth.
On the contrary, it is of course one of the foremost examples of EU cooperation' s really being able to help substantially improve conditions for an individual Member State.
However, that is why we must not forget our experiences of the crisis during the Nineties.
We must not compromise on our conviction that the fight for growth and full employment can, and must, be allied with a clear acceptance of responsibility when it comes to price stability and a balanced budget.
Why, then, can Ireland not be allowed to go its own way?
The problem is that we of course live in an interwoven, internationalised economy in which developments in one country influence developments in the others.
As long as only one small country infringes the guidelines it has itself accepted, the problem may seem small.
Now, however, there are worrying signs that more countries may be doing this, in which case it will be important to send out warning signals early on.
In my own country, Sweden, an attempt is now being made to feature the criticism made of Ireland in anti-euro propaganda.
Just look, they say.
If we take part in EMU, we shall lose our economic independence.
The EU will even obtain power over our taxes.
I think that propaganda of that kind is nonsense.
Ireland has been criticised not because it is to reduce taxes, but because the reduction is to take place in a situation in which this may contribute to overheating and to inflation' s taking off again.
The EU has issued a recommendation. No forcible means are to be used to take over Ireland' s tax and budget policies, despite all that is maintained by Swedish opponents of the EU.
Madam President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their opinions.
I tried to clarify a number of points in my initial speech, but I have a feeling that I did not succeed.
Firstly, we are not judging Ireland against any other country.
We are judging Ireland against its own commitments, accepted in accordance with the broad economic guidelines.
Secondly, we are not taking a decision that has just come out of nowhere and which was not anticipated.
The Council' s 1998 recommendation already referred to the need for a stricter fiscal policy for Ireland. In the 1999 recommendation, a reminder was issued that, in spite of the efforts made, these were still not enough and, in 2000, after it was pointed out that the budgetary policy adopted by Ireland needed to be more restrictive, there followed a clear expansionist budget on Ireland' s part.
When I talk about an expansionist budget, I am talking about overall figures. I have no quarrel with more health expenditure or more expenditure on reducing tax.
Those are policy matters to be decided upon at national level.
As Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, my concern is with the overall status of the Irish budget.
However, it is not only my concern but also that of Ireland' s Central Bank, which I assume is familiar enough with the situation of the Irish economy and clearly understands that the current budget gives a substantial procyclical boost to the economy.
That is the situation, and these are the facts we are judging.
On that basis, we can talk about what we are, or are not, to do.
My duty as Commissioner responsible for these matters is to apply the broad economic guidelines, which are compulsory in a way that the Stability Pact is not.
The Stability and Growth Pact - to answer Mrs Torres Marques - was decided upon following a Community regulation.
The broad economic guidelines are the model we duly agreed for inclusion in the Treaty of Maastricht. And what we have done is to apply this model strictly, as required.
In contrast to what some believe, it is obviously not a position of the Commission.
Rather, it is a position of the Commission and the Council. Nor, in making our proposal, did we proceed on the basis of any factor other than our own assessment of the point at issue.
No one should therefore imagine that there are motives or problems of any other kind, large or small.
We are talking about consistency with the model we had duly established.
Reference was made to a greater degree of understanding.
I believe that we have been showing understanding since 1998 but, in this situation, decisions obviously need to be taken at some point.
Reference was made to the lack of diplomacy on the part of the Commission.
I can assure you that none of the leaks that have appeared in the press come from my department in the Commission.
Obviously, it may be thought that the best pupil in the class is being punished.
As I have said, it is not a case of our imposing sanctions.
We are using a recommendation to highlight an example of incorrect behaviour in the light of the economic policy guidelines.
And this is not inconsistent with good behaviour in terms of growth and inflation.
We could talk in much more detail.
Mr Bradbourn intimated that not enough data had been provided.
I am prepared to appear before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, whenever you think it appropriate, to comment in more detail on all the data we are talking about.
Article 99(4) - which is one of the things you are concerned about - applies in accordance with the provisions of current legislation.
There has been discussion about whether the censure of Ireland is or is not justified.
In my opinion, it is justified.
If it were not, this proposal would not have been made.
Moreover, it is justified in spite of the limited impact Ireland has on the overall European economy.
Clearly, there are - and I repeat - two reasons why I think the censure is justified: firstly, because of the obligations accepted by everyone in terms of the model we have defined; and, secondly, because I do not believe that anyone can seriously defend the view that, in terms of the model we have implemented, a country can be treated unequally on the grounds that it is large or small.
We can talk about other subjects which have also been raised: the problems concerned with Ireland' s contribution to European growth, specific problems, the development of inflation etc. I think that all these technical subjects can be discussed.
It is true that nominal inflation has gone down in the last two months in Ireland.
Nonetheless, when we talk about the overheating of the Irish economy, we are talking about underlying inflationary pressures, the operation of underlying inflation, the increase in salaries, the increase in the cost of living and many other factors fundamental to any correct assessment of what is happening in Ireland.
Is our approach wrong?
Here, we are embarking upon a subject that is difficult to assess because it is necessary to ratify the Treaty of Nice and because it is a factor that will impact upon other models.
I would ask you whether you believe that policy assessments of this kind exempt the Commission from its duty to apply the Treaties in the forms in which they are established.
In my opinion, the Commission has acted with sufficient prudence after having repeatedly urged the Irish Government to take a different course.
The Commission presented the matter to the Group of Euro Countries and to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council.
The decision was not approved by chance.
The matter was debated by the special group of the Economic and Financial Committee after each and every one of the arguments put forward by the Irish Government had been analysed.
And, in spite of all that, the decision was taken, as I have just said, on the proposal of the Commission and, so to speak, with the assent of the Council of Ministers.
In my opinion, the Commission did what it had to do.
I would again emphasise the significance of the term, 'recommendation' .
I am not talking about a sanction but about a recommendation, and I believe that we cannot draw any conclusion which takes us farther away from the content of that Council decision suggested by the Commission, namely to apply a standard which is there in the Treaty for the purpose of resolving a series of practical problems raised in the model we have established for coordinating economic policy. Although a different model may apply in the future, that is the one that is in force today.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, as you will see there are very few people here.
The situation was the same last month.
I made the suggestion last month that we could use the additional two or three hours on Monday evening for debate so that Members could attend this vote as well.
Could you tell me if that suggestion has been looked into and what the response of the Bureau or the Conference of Presidents was?
I am told that your suggestion is still being examined and that no satisfactory solution has yet been found.
Mr President, I have another suggestion. We are currently preparing an amendment to the timetable, which means, as of next year, we could have an extra day in Brussels.
I think that we are departing from the agenda. At this point, we are due to proceed to the vote on the urgent resolutions.
VOTE
The next item is the vote on the urgent resolutions.
Before the vote on the resolution on religious freedom in China
Mr President, regarding the following resolution, my group felt bound to sign the joint resolution on religious freedoms in China in order to demonstrate that, in our view, there are no borders when it comes to defending freedom of conscience and freedom of expression.
On the other hand, most of the Members of my group are totally opposed to any reference to the Falun Gong movement in this resolution.
We have therefore requested a separate vote and a roll-call vote on the two paragraphs relating to this issue and we shall vote against these paragraphs.
This is exactly the procedure scheduled, Mr Wurtz.
Mr President, I would just briefly like to say that it has been proposed that we should start earlier on a Monday and leave earlier on a Thursday.
I must say that this is absurd since it would mean that many of us would have to travel here on a Sunday so that others could have Friday free.
It always used to be the case in Europe that Sunday and not Friday was a day of rest.
Mr President, I do not want to debate this either, but I have to clarify that what Mr Posselt said is wrong.
I did not suggest starting earlier on a Monday.
I suggested using the evening hours on Monday, which are now free, for debate, as we do on Tuesday and Wednesday.
That way we might be able to vote earlier on Thursday and people would be able to attend to vote before they go home.
That was my suggestion.
That was the last statement of this sitting as we have reached the end of the agenda.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 7 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 15 February 2001.
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February there were unfortunately two more additions to the intolerable list of victims killed in ETA terrorist attacks in Spain.
The bomb attack in San Sebastian was directly targeted at Ignacio Dubreil, a local councillor of the Basque Socialist Party in Ordizia.
The explosion killed JosÃ© Ãngel Santos and JosÃ© Leonet, employees of Electra, and four further people were injured, including Mr Dubreil.
Once again, ETA terrorists have shown that they deny the right to life and reject the very principle of the rule of law.
On behalf of the House, I have sent a message of our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and wishes for the prompt recovery of those injured in the attack.
I now ask you to please stand and observe a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Agenda
Madam President, this is not really an objection.
It is just that I find it rather unfortunate that we shall not be adopting a resolution, as expected, following the debate on the air strikes against Iraq. This strikes me as a very important issue, particularly in the context of infringement of the principles governing common foreign and security policy.
You are right, Mr Gollnisch, that is not an objection to the agenda.
So, shall we agree that the agenda has been finalised?
The agenda is thus adopted.
Madam President, I would like to raise an issue which is closely related to the debate on the future of Europe.
Furthermore, I am delighted that President Prodi is present, and I believe that the Council is also present.
I have discovered, by means of a communication to the three European schools - and the Members of this House well know that the European schools are highly active when it comes to approving the budget - that on 7 March a debate will be held with the pupils of the European School, section III, in which the President-in-Office of the Council and Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Persson, the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and the Prime Minister of the Belgian Federal Government, Mr Verhofstadt, will participate.
I think that this is a good initiative, but I notice that neither the European Parliament nor the Belgian Parliament will be present, although Mr Verhofstadt will be.
And having reread the fourth Annex of the Nice Council conclusions, it seems to me that this initiative, which only brings together members of the Council, does not respond to that debate, which the members of the Nice Council remind us of so insistently.
Madam President, I believe that this requires an explanation from you and that you should also approach the very august members of the Council to tell them that, if they want to speak with civil society - in this case the pupils of the school - they must take account of the Parliaments, as they emphasised in the fourth Annex.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
I await your explanation.
I would also ask President Prodi, who is present, and the Council to give us theirs.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, it is perfectly clear.
You are well aware that we had indeed been informed that the Council was planning an initiative for 7 March this year, which it hoped would be common to all three institutions.
You will doubtless remember that I discussed this prospect at length at the last Conference of Presidents, although at the time I did not have any details as to the form the proposed initiative would take.
The Conference of Presidents decided to grant me a mandate and to entrust me with the task of determining, on the basis of the details provided for my information, whether the European Parliament' s involvement in this initiative would be appropriate or not.
I even remember, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, your saying at the time that the European Parliament would not just be participating in order to be included in the photo.
We have been working hard since that Conference of Presidents.
My private office has endeavoured to obtain details of what would be done and what would not be done, because it is an important matter and one to which we are committed.
To date we have received a few, still only very sketchy details, including the fact that this will take place in a school with the pupils involved.
That is all very pleasant, but there would also be a letter to be signed by the Swedish President, the Belgian President, Mr Prodi, as the Commission President, and also by myself, on behalf of the European Parliament.
I considered that I could not single-handedly take the decision to sign a common letter of this kind.
You are therefore about to receive a copy of this letter so that all the Members of the House and all the group Presidents can advise me of their views on this initiative. I do not doubt the value of this document, but I do think it ought to be considered by Parliament.
I think I have answered you with as much detail as possible and, believe me, we took the matter perfectly seriously.
Madam President, the problem is that the event has been announced and Parliament does not appear on the poster, to put it in artistic and bullfighting terms.
I therefore do not really know what the point is in you replying to this, since we are not even attending the event, let alone performing.
Mr Prodi will perhaps clarify matters.
It is true that I, at any rate, have not received any invitation to attend.
Madam President, it would appear that the central role of Parliament is being highlighted once again, for it is only now, through Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, that I have learned of this event, and this gives me great pleasure.
I have asked for clarification and am told that a letter has just arrived, to which I have not yet replied.
I have just learned of the matter through Parliament and I will make sure that I reply when I get back.
I did not know anything about the debate or the invitation.
(Applause and laughter)
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, how delightful!
Mr Prodi has just learnt of the launch of this initiative through us, and it is his own chief of staff who has provided us with the famous letter I just mentioned!
We shall certainly coordinate our efforts to look into this matter and we shall endeavour to take the best course of action in the interest of our respective institutions and also, primarily, of course, in the common interest of Europe.
Madam President, as International Women's Day approaches, next week, we are appalled by the level of misogyny in Europe in the twenty-first century, despite the European Union's policy of sexual equality.
The exclusion of the world-famous soprano Monserrat Caballe from an all-male club at the Liceu Opera in Barcelona cannot be construed as an internal affair at the Opera and is certainly a violation of the principle of sexual equality and Community legislation.
And that is not all, this decision by the Opera harps back to an age when the sciences and arts were only open to men and it is an insult to all female artists and scientists.
I therefore call on you, Madam President, not to let this unhappy incident, this unhappy decision pass unnoticed by the European Parliament and urge you to take the necessary initiative.
Thank you, Mrs Karamanou.
I promise I shall look into the matter very carefully, as it is indeed quite intolerable.
Madam President, Rule 6(1) of our Rules of Procedure lays down that, in relation to petitions, the President must announce them to Parliament and refer the issue to the competent committee.
On 12 July 2000, the president of the Spanish Supreme Court sent a petition to the European Parliament requesting the waiver of the immunity of the Italian Members of the European Parliament, Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell'Utri, because of alleged offences concerning the purchase of a Spanish television channel and the non-payment of taxes to the Spanish inland revenue.
Yesterday I asked the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market whether she was aware of the issue and she told me that she had received no information about it.
Given the provisions of Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to ask Parliament' s President what has been done in relation to this petition and to add that, last Monday, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had only become aware of the issue through the newspapers.
Mr Medina Ortega, I shall give you all the details necessary.
Article 6(1) to which you referred, stipulates that the request presented to the President must be sent from the competent Member State authority.
However, the request to which you have referred raised a very serious problem.
As you know, we are fully informed on these matters of waiver of immunity because we receive a great many of them with regard to all countries.
Indeed, I have checked the facts of the matter, and all these requests, with the exception of those originating in Portugal, have always been sent by a government body, be it the Minister for Justice or Foreign Affairs.
The case of Portugal is exceptional; requests from that country may be addressed directly by the judicial authority.
In this instance, the request was received directly from the Supreme Court.
I immediately made enquiries to check the position - I was not in Brussels at the time, but I asked for verification immediately - and we noted that, several years previously, a request for the waiver of immunity had been received, also from Spain, but this had been sent to us from the Spanish Government, which conveyed the request of the Supreme Court.
Since there were no new developments in Spanish legislation between these two dates - 1990 and 1999 - I thought there was a significant problem of eligibility.
As you know, Mr Medina, we are in a good position to know that we have to be very careful because European case law does not always follow us, and we must always act in a very disciplined fashion.
I have therefore asked the head of my private office, who was present in Brussels at that time, to write to the Spanish authorities to find out whether the president of the Supreme Court was, in the eyes of Spanish law, the competent authority, in application of the regulation, to send us this request.
I have not, to date, received any response.
I now understand better why I have not received a response.
Reading the Spanish press, I have seen that the problem was a very complicated one, that there was unquestionably a difference of opinion between the judicial authorities and the governmental authorities.
The question, and it is a far-reaching one, as I am sure you can see, is whether the European Parliament can decide between the two arms of Member State authority, the judicial authority and the governmental authority, in order to determine which of the two is the competent body.
I understand that the coordinators of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market are going to look into this matter in March.
Personally, I think this is excellent, but once again we must act with the utmost discipline in accordance with the texts of both national legal systems and European law.
Madam President, since the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market cannot be here today for health reasons - she will be here next Monday when the coordinators of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market debate this issue - and therefore is not able to reply to Mr Medina, I would like to say something to him.
Madam President, we Spanish Members of Parliament - all of us - have the right to be judged in Spain only by the Supreme Court, a right that has not been recognised in this case by the Spanish judge because he believes that it concerns a non-Spanish Member of Parliament from a non-Spanish Parliament.
However, this petition for waiver of parliamentary immunity has been dealt with as if it concerned a Spanish Member of Parliament in a Spanish Parliament.
Madam President, I simply say this to illustrate the legal complexity of the affair.
I believe that the Presidency of the European Parliament is acting very prudently on this issue in order not to jeopardise the legal process.
There is only one precedent in my country, which dates from 1991.
That precedent was dealt with through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was received by the then President of the European Parliament - a colleague of yours and mine, Mr Medina - Mr Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo.
Madam President, I am sure that nobody here is suffering an attack of Alzheimer' s, but that some people are surely seeking to manipulate this Parliament for reasons of party politics in their own countries, which I believe we should all oppose, Madam President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have received ten requests for procedural motions, and I have been informed that Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock are absolutely forced to leave at 4 p.m.
We must, consequently, opt to postpone the ten requests for procedural motions until 4 p.m.
I think this is a reasonable decision.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Commission reform: human resources
The next item is the Commission communication on Commission reform: human resources.
I shall immediately give the floor to the Commission President, Mr Romano Prodi.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, exactly a year has passed - or rather, it will be exactly a year tomorrow - since the Commission adopted the Reform Strategy White Paper.
Over the course of this year, the Commission has already discharged two key aspects of the White Paper, the reform of financial management and the new planning and programming cycle for the Commission's work.
Within the allotted time frame, the Commission completed the third and most substantial and complex stage of the work announced by the White Paper this morning, with the adoption of guidelines on personnel policy and management, which is, as you are aware, one of the most sensitive points of our administrative reform.
This very afternoon sees the beginning - the first meeting with the trade unions and the staff will take place today at 4 o'clock - of a further stage of consultation and conciliation, which is just as important and just as exacting, involving all the staff and all the representatives.
Only when this process, which will take several months, is completed will the Commission define its position.
Within the space of a few months, we will have to achieve the fundamental goal we have set ourselves of being a good employer in the years to come, offering competitive conditions to attract the most highly-skilled people for the European institutions and allowing its staff to reach the highest levels of efficiency, professionalism and responsibility.
A great deal of work has been necessary for us to reach this point, and so, before I say anything else, I would like to thank Neil Kinnock and his staff for the huge amount of work they have put into the laborious preparation of these documents.
Allow me once again to pay tribute to the staff of the Commission and all the institutions for their hard work this year.
It has been a difficult year and I am aware that some sections of our staff are concerned at these rapid, far-reaching changes, which have come on top of an already heavy daily work schedule.
However, a thorough review of the Commission's organisational model could not be put off: we had committed ourselves to the task before Parliament and the work was most urgent and absolutely essential.
There had not been a complete reorganisation for decades.
Therefore, we intend to make every endeavour to secure a broad, intense debate on the guidelines and details of the reform, so that it becomes the common legacy of all and all commit themselves to furthering its progress.
I would, nevertheless, like to take this opportunity to stress a fundamental concept: the reform is not and never has been a political end in itself, to be taken out of its wide institutional and political context, that is.
It is part of a clearly-defined project which has furthered peace and democracy in Europe, creating a model of cooperation and development based on the principle of the rule of law and on respect for fundamental values.
The institutions of this unique model, the institutions of the European Union, have played a fundamental role in this process and it is amazing to see - and this is one of the things which has made the greatest impression on me since I have been here in Brussels - the extent to which the people who work in the institutions view their jobs as completely different from any other job; there is an unmistakable atmosphere of being part of the historic project of European integration.
This widespread motivation is evidence of the unique nature of the administrations of the Community institutions and a guarantee of their strength, and it is on this new basis that we are building the new European civil service, which will be different from the civil services of the national States but will complement them.
It is awareness of this uniqueness which underlies the guidelines we have adopted today: to reform outdated rules and customs in order to make it possible for the institutions to deal with the challenges of future years, keeping the European project clearly in their sights.


There are three points on which the guidelines for the reform of personnel policy and management are based: firstly, we intend to guarantee the pay and pension levels necessary for an independent, high-level European civil service; secondly, we want to improve working conditions to enable our staff to work to the best of their abilities, progressing professionally and having their rights recognised, with the aim of ensuring the right balance between job satisfaction and private commitments; thirdly and lastly, we want to introduce a more modern career structure to allow our staff to adapt to new tasks, removing the rigidities which have become established over the years and increasing responsibility and rewarding merit at all levels.
A large-scale programme of investment in training activities will be an essential complement to the achievement of these objectives.
I have to say, in this regard, that training has always been overlooked. It is true that the new staff were high-calibre but, with the changes taking place nowadays, even high-calibre staff need ongoing training.
Basically, the aim of this package of reform initiatives is to enhance the capacities and skills of our staff.
It is the political duty of us all to make this reform a success if we want the institutions - particularly the Commission - to be able play their full role as the driving force of integration in the coming years.
This is an ongoing task and it is called "The Future of Europe" .
The guidelines which we have adopted today and which we will submit for open, thorough consultation with all the staff, are a substantial step forward in this direction.
Madam President, as I have said here before, the central purpose of the reform of the European Commission is to strengthen the performance, confidence and vital independence of the institution in order to ensure that the standards of service which the great majority of staff want to provide and the public has the right to expect are available to the European Union.
From the outset we have been working to fulfil that purpose by modernising structures and systems, by focusing more directly on priorities, by making unprecedented provision for the allocation of individual responsibility at all levels and by prioritising the use of people and of financial resources.
In the twelve months since the Prodi Commission adopted the Reform Strategy White Paper we have achieved significant advance in all those areas.
Many honourable Members are familiar with the details and I thank them for their very close interest.
We will return to those details on future occasions.
Compiling and implementing the very substantial changes has, of course, required immensely hard work and dedication.
The people most directly involved have typically worked over 70-hour weeks throughout the last 15 or 16 months.
I thank them and I pay tribute to them.
I also strongly commend the much larger numbers of staff for their diligent commitment in coping with extensive reorganisation and innovation - much of it very complex and testing - and simultaneously fulfilling the primary tasks of the Commission.
Their ability and willingness to adapt to change is truly worthy of praise.
It certainly contradicts the crude caricatures of the Eurocrat.
Such people need to have a modern working environment and progressive career prospects in order to enable them to do a good job even better, with more explicit recognition of their capabilities.
That requires investing finance, time and effort. It also requires treating effective management, which is essential for a knowledge-based organisation like the Commission, as a core task of the institution.
Today the college unanimously adopted a series of proposals and guidelines for fulfilling those objectives, including guidelines on a new, more linear career system and on pay and pensions.
We will immediately carry out thorough consultations with staff and staff representatives on all these documents in the months until mid-July.
These proposals are all available to the House.
I will, therefore, briefly outline the principal purposes of the comprehensive changes.
They are based firmly on the reality that the most valuable resource of any administration is its staff.
The Commission is no exception and the fact that the general quality of staff is high is evident in the continuing essential policy performance of the Commission.
The institution has not, however, used human resources policies that are appropriate to the changing responsibilities and needs of the institution as an organisation.
Our proposals therefore make provision for changes to ensure, first, that officials' careers depend primarily on their demonstrated abilities, their proven performance and their willingness to accept responsibilities and that they should all have the benefit of objective annual appraisal.
Secondly, the changes should ensure that career development opportunities for all staff are maximised by removing glass ceilings and rigidities and by providing officials with career guidance, appropriate training and real possibilities for greater mobility both inside the institution and externally.
Thirdly, they should ensure that managers are responsible for their staff, are given the support that they need and are evaluated on their achievements.
That is a radical change in established custom and practice.
We propose to make that change in all respects in the interest of managers, the people that they manage and the institution.
Fourthly, the working conditions of Commission staff should better reflect the practices of national administrations in the Member States.
Making provision for parental leave for Commission staff for the first time, improving working conditions and facilitating flexible employment arrangements such as part-time working are crucial to achieving equality of opportunity and practice and to improving career development.
Fifth, and finally, the Commission must progressively begin to make the necessary investment to ensure that staff can reinforce and broaden skills throughout their professional careers.
We propose a five-fold increase in the budget available for training over the next five years.
It will still not bring the Commission' s proportionate training expenditure up to the average level of European Union Member States.
It will, however, be a significant advance that can be made without imposing undue pressures on the budget.
For the institutions to continue to discharge their obligations successfully they obviously need to continue to attract high-ability, multilingual staff, the majority of whom will spend most of their professional life in a public service outside their home country.
There is increased and increasing competition for qualified international staff in many areas including multilingual, multi-skilled secretaries, IT specialists, scientific researchers, international trade and market specialists, competition lawyers, financial experts of every kind and many more.
The Commission considers that the realities of expatriate work and life, of significant responsibilities and of rising demand for scarce skills must be reflected in the rewards package for the staff of the institutions.
The results of a comprehensive independent study published last April commissioned originally by the Commission showed that the European civil service pay scale is higher than that of national civil servants, similar to that of comparable personnel in other international organisations, significantly lower than that of similarly qualified expatriate employees of multinationals and lower than that of diplomats.
That reinforced our view that the pay scale is appropriate, reasonable and relevant to the role of the Commission and to the demands upon its staff and that in some respects improvement is necessary and justified.
Support for childcare for children under the age of six, for instance, is essential for equal opportunities and for the Commission to be able to attract staff, particularly women, from Member States with advanced systems.
Similarly, payment of position premiums for functions that carry particularly heavy responsibility and/or workload is gradually becoming the norm in labour markets throughout the European Union.
For the institution to retain its competitiveness as an international employer, it should be introduced in a targeted way in the Commission.
With these considerations in mind we have reviewed the structure of pay and rewards in order to identify and, where necessary, reform the outdated elements.
We are consequently proposing to cut or to end allowances which have no continuing justification and to keep and, in some respects, improve those which correspond to objective conditions such as expatriate working life, bringing up children and, typically, having to work in more than one foreign language.
Our pensions proposals, meanwhile, fulfil our undertaking to guarantee the long-term actuarial balance of the system and, naturally, existing pension rights will be honoured.
In compiling and adopting all of these proposals for consultation, we have naturally given close attention to budgetary implications.
We have made very clear to this House and to the Council that all changes arising from reform and from pay and pension proposals will keep within the limits set by the relevant part of the Financial Perspective established by the Berlin Council in 1999.
We will fulfil that commitment.
The ending of the 5.8% so-called temporary levy, in place under various names since the 1970s, will provide a substantial part of the resources for meeting obligations.
The savings on allowances that are no longer justified will make other investments possible.
We propose that the pay and pension system continues to be based on the fixed relationship with pay movements in the civil administrations of Member States.
The total employment costs of the administration of the European institutions is, as a proportion of the budget, 1.9% of that budget.
That compares favourably with the average bill for Member States calculated on a like-for-like basis of 13.1% of budget.
Throughout the period of the Financial Perspective to 2006 the costs of the administration as a proportion of GNP will be lower than they were in 1985.
The documents adopted by the Commission today are, as the President of the Commission emphasised, proposals for consultation.
In keeping with the method which we have used on all reform-related proposals each of the documents will be the subject of serious and detailed negotiations with staff representatives and wider consultations with staff over the coming four and a half months.
Constructive suggestions for improvement will be welcome and, as the record plainly shows, we heed them and we are ready to include them before decisions are finalised by the college.
When they are finalised the decisions relating to changes that do not require alteration of the Staff Regulations will be implemented.
The other decisions, such as those relating to career structure, pay and pensions, will be submitted as formal proposals for legislation to the Council and to this House.
Some, like those on appraisals and promotions, will require consideration by the Interinstitutional Staff Regulations Committee.
Clearly, this Parliament, as a legislature, as a budgetary authority and as an employer, will rightly have close interest in all of these developments.
I would draw attention to the importance of the changes that we are proposing in respect of the career structure.
This affects Parliament in respect of all the areas I have just mentioned.
One important aspect and, indeed, a prior condition to making progress on the career structure is that we must reach agreement on a multiannual framework governing movements in unit wage costs allowing the institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council to set a robust and structured framework for developing the careers of their staff.
I am sure that Parliament will give earnest and informed attention to this and, indeed, all other elements of the reform strategy.
At my hearing in Parliament in 1999 I expressed the hope that we would be partners for progress.
That hope has been fully realised.
I hope our partnership will continue.
I commend the proposals which were adopted unanimously by the Commission for consultation today.
Madam President, I would particularly like to welcome Mr Kinnock' s statement and say how pleased I am to see that Mr Prodi is here, because these reforms will only be successful if they are led from the top.
Therefore it is very important that he be here.
I drew up on behalf of Parliament a report, which was approved almost unanimously last year, in which Parliament warned the Commission that the reforms must be implemented as quickly as possible to avoid staff demoralisation and public disenchantment.
I would like Mr Kinnock to explain how he is going to move these forward as quickly as possible, because that warning is as valid now as it was when Parliament approved the report a few months ago.
My second question is to ask Mr Kinnock whether he shares my great concern about the lack of interest being shown in his reforms by the Council.
I have had a look at the agendas for ECOFIN and general affairs meetings over the last year, and there has been only one item about personnel, which was about freelance interpreters in March 2000.
Would he share with me the view that, if the Council took more interest in his reforms, it would help their speedy and thorough implementation to achieve the end that we all want, which is the most professional and effective European civil service.
Madam President, I totally agree with the sentiment that Mr Harbour expressed in his excellent report last year, together with three other honourable Members who were rapporteurs on associated reports.
The reform should proceed as quickly as possible in order to avoid the demoralisation and destabilisation of the staff of the European public service.
I agree with that even more strongly now than I did then.
In any reform process there is an unavoidable gap between original design and effective implementation.
It is in the interest of everyone who wants progressive change, and the stronger institutions which that change will bring, to try to make that gap as narrow as possible.
Nevertheless we first have to undertake full and thorough consultation and negotiation as a matter of courtesy to our staff but also to encourage the sense of ownership of reform which is essential to success.
The four and a half months that we have set aside for those negotiations and consultation allow us to work quickly but thoroughly.
Secondly those decisions which are the responsibility of the Commission can be taken quite quickly after the end of that four and a half months, taking into account the result of those consultations and negotiations.
We can then embark upon the changes probably by the end of this year.
Others, however, must be submitted as formal legal proposals to this House and to the Council.
That will, everybody anticipates, involve a year of negotiations on the detail of amendments to the Staff Regulations and the pay and pensions package, which will take nearly the whole of 2002.
These delays are regrettable but obviously we want to ensure that we go through the full and effective system of democratic scrutiny both by the Council and this House.
That is understood amongst the staff.
It also means, of course, that the two-year rollover of the present system of pay and pensions will provide stability and security for all the institutions, which would not have been the case if the Council and Parliament had not agreed to our proposal on that.
Hopefully, therefore, if the legislation rhythm is not subject to delay, we could be fully implementing several of these necessary reforms in full by the beginning of 2003.
That in some respects is an optimistic scenario but we certainly will make every honest endeavour to achieve that.
Finally, on the Council point that Mr Harbour very fairly raises, I have to say to him that my view is slightly different from his.
I understand his concern but I have the advantage of going to the General Affairs Council and having our proposals - I quote "warmly welcomed" and also having an extremely good reception in ECOFIN at lunch where the discussion was naturally quite intimate but immensely constructive.
In addition, of course, I have visited a variety of Member States to ensure that governments, and indeed national parliaments, are fully informed.
I have encountered no sour attitudes.
I have encountered some good arguments and we are always ready to engage in those.
There will be more opportunities to attend the Councils but the Council wanted to see our proposals come to a state of reasonable maturity so that they were solid and worthy of the Council' s consideration.
Madam President, Mr Vice-President, I congratulate you on the many proposals you have made, which in my view are entirely along the right lines.
I should like to address two problems.
Following on from the first question, lately many Commission staff have started to shy away from decision making because of what lies ahead of them.
Let me ask you this, what can you do to encourage the Commission staff to engage actively in decision making once more?
Surely all the Commissioners have not only agreed on these steps but have also stated quite clearly that they will take on political responsibility for the reform measures they are proposing in their areas of work?
And my second question is this: you propose to externalise, i.e. outsource, a range of areas.
Do you not see something of a contradiction between externalisation on the one hand, and your justified desire to create a unified and independent Commission staffing structure, on the other?
What will you do, Commissioner, to ensure that externalisation does not lead to the fragmentation of this unified civil service?
Madam President, may I say in response to Mr Swoboda' s first question that he may have had some unfortunate encounters but they would certainly have been with a minority of staff.
I will not go into great length but just repeat the point that I made earlier that the willingness to adapt, under extreme pressure with heavy workloads and two very innovatory proposals, demonstrated by the vast majority of Commission staff in the last year is entirely to their credit.
That does not signify a reluctance to make change.
They need clear guidance.
They deserve to have transparent decisions to work on, but nevertheless they have demonstrated in the context of extremely difficult circumstances sometimes that they are willing positively to engage.
There are people who, like in other administration in any democracy will spend time seeking opportunities to be pessimistic, sowing the seeds of doubt and harvesting bitterness.
Such people are found in all walks of life - with the single exception of course of the European Parliament, I understand that.
This means, although I know Mr Swoboda is not doing this, that the willing, highly professional, dedicated and, as President Prodi earlier said, highly-motivated civil service of the European Union can be misrepresented infamously in the press and elsewhere by a very small minority who are externally but not internally regarded as representative.
I hope honourable Members will always try, even if sometimes it is difficult, to make a distinction between those people.
Finally, the externalisation and the approach that we are advocating in company with several honourable Members from all parts of this House - and I pay them tribute - is certainly not a departure from the concept or practice of a permanent, independent and competent European public service.
On the contrary, by defining our management roles effectively and by externalising the obligations to execute already determined policies in a highly accountable way, we are securing the permanence and competence of the European civil service and giving the European taxpayers the benefit of maximum flexibility in conditions of assured security.
I hope that the House will continue to give its support to this process of externalisation.
Commissioner, thank you for clarifying those points on your reform plans.
I would agree with Mr Swoboda when he says that the staff currently feel great concern, despite your attempts to reassure us by telling us that it is only a minority.
However, if I have understood correctly, the negotiations are going to start now, which should make it possible to bring the plan in line with the principles you advocate: merit, modernity and training.
I should like, therefore, to ask three questions.
In your plan, how do you intend to take account of the multicultural reality of the situation of European Union officials who do not all have the same traditions in terms of administrative management?
How do you think it will be possible for everyone to manage?
Secondly, even if the implementation is a lengthy process - you have just mentioned the year 2002 - do you not consider it essential to put systems in place rapidly or, in other words, to phase in the implementation in order to restore confidence in the working methods and the motivation of Europe' s officials.
Thirdly, I feel that there is one area which we have failed to take into consideration and that is how do you take into account the priorities determined by the expert working group, which specified that two interfaces had to be reformed as a priority?
This was the interface between the work of the administrative staff of the Commission of the European Union and, I would say, the decision makers, Directors-General and Commissioners.
The second interface concerns the relationship between the administrative work of the Commission and those to whom we provide money or working methods, the methods of intervention of the European Union.
What plans do you have in this respect?
Madam President, I am going to respond to the first two questions because they relate to an extremely topical issue of very wide general interest.
To return to the question of demoralisation among staff: clearly, we have created a sense of insecurity this year.
I am aware of that: it has been a difficult task but we could not do things any differently, for we have had to go right back to grass roots and review every job description, the fundamental objectives and also the issue of multiculturality.
So why is it that this reform is so problematic?
Because we cannot be content to copy or imitate blindly any of the national administrations: either we succeed in the ground-breaking experiment of combining the different traditions and cultures to create a single tradition and a single culture, or we will have failed in our task.
Obviously, we could not - we cannot - accomplish such a process without going right back to grass roots and starting completely afresh.
I am quite aware that this has caused concern and I take full responsibility, but there was no other option.
Even today, our debate starts with an open proposal, a proposal that is not limited to points to adopt or reject but which is the starting point for a discussion - moreover part of our tradition - that will, in the future, become part of a tradition of public administration which is different from that of any individual country.
Well then, we are still a long way from completing this reform - it will take the whole of the forthcoming year to implement it - but, as Commissioner Kinnock said just now, we should have completed the dialogue process, this process by which, together with the trade unions and staff, we are to establish our strategy, before July.
We plan to have the definitive reference framework ready within the next few months, before the summer, the following stage then being to implement the individual chapters.
Madam President, I will be very brief by answering just the third question that related to the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts.
In order to be brief I will simply say that the Committee of Independent Experts made over 90 recommendations.
We have either met or exceeded all of the proposals made by the Committee of Independent Experts apart from literally a couple of exceptions which, put to the test of practicality, could not be pursued.
I am happy to be able to report that included the recommendations relating to the relationship between Commissioners, cabinets and services, which in September 1999 as one of the first acts of the Commission under Romano Prodi' s leadership, became the subject to agreed rules which clarify those relationships.
These are capable of being used by any of the parties to those rules, so we have a major advance in transparency which I think works to the benefits of services and Commissioners and Commissioners' cabinets.
One final point, on the relationship between the Commissioners in administration and externalisation, I will not add much to what I said to Herr Swoboda, but the steps we have already taken to abolish the so-called technical advice bureaux and to establish the major new nascent agency, if I can put it like that, as a Commission service called Europe-Aid with the huge improvement that that makes possible in management and accountability is evidence that we not only took the Committee of Independent Experts seriously, but we also have taken very seriously the various reports from this House, particularly those associated with and worked on by Mr Bourlanges.
Madam President, I thank the Commission for what it has told us.
I must confess that this debate strikes me as rather odd, since the impression is surely being created that our European officials, however competent they may be and however hard they work, constitute a rather pathetic category that needs support on a number of levels.
I am very well acquainted with the working conditions and salaries of European officials: they earn, certainly in the higher echelons, more than a minister, or even a prime minister in the national Member States, so let us not exaggerate.
My question is the following: I heard Commissioner Kinnock say that European officials enjoy a number of facilities that are no longer appropriate to the present time.
I assume that he is alluding to the opportunity to acquire items like cars and drink tax-free.
Can you say exactly what facilities are being abolished because you no longer consider them appropriate to the present time?
In addition you also said that you wish to introduce salary improvements.
Can you tell us exactly what salary improvements you have in mind?
The point is that, in my view, there is no longer much room for improvement in this area.
Mr President, I think the honourable Member will benefit immensely from seeing the highly readable documents which were considered for consultation by the Commission today.
I take great pride in the fact that our institution has, in a full and very exact account, set out everything there is to be said about the salaries, the career structure, and the allowance systems that have been available to European civil servants.
I hope and I know that there are those who have this ambition that all institutions can emulate that practice and do so with great rapidity.
As far as cars without VAT are concerned, expatriate workers working for all the European institutions have the right, granted to them by the Belgian Government, to purchase certain goods, including cars, free of value-added tax in the first twelve months after they are engaged and at no time after that.
So far as the allowances are concerned, there has at present been a provision available to European civil servants since the 1960s which allows them to make transfers of parts of their salaries to their home countries.
It originated because of the difficult and expensive business of making international financial transfers.
However, over the years obviously transfers have become extremely easy.
The real problem arises from the fact that a co-efficient was built in as a means of providing compensation because of variations between the different currencies of Member States.
That has resulted in an imbalance of compensation which is why the system now makes heavy demands, or heavier than justifiable demands, on the budget and why we will bring it to an end.
The same thing applies to travel allowances established in the 1950s on the basis of the first-class rail fare of an official at least once a year, or even twice a year, to their home country.
That was one thing when there were six Member States with contiguous boundaries and railway systems connecting them.
That has changed somewhat.
Consequently, a system that allows people to claim first-class rail fare twice a year to different parts of the European Union is no longer justifiable.
We are radically changing that and bringing it into line with modern travel realities.
I hope that custom will also be emulated.
Madam President, the single most important aim of the reform process must be to turn the Commission into a world-class administration capable of serving the European public.
The first question the Socialists must ask is whether the proposed reforms are good news for staff.
They are not.
They are not good news for staff who persistently under-perform.
They are not good news for staff who hope to be promoted simply on the basis of the number of years spent behind their desk.
They are not good news for staff who refuse to acquire new skills.
They are not good news, in other words, for a small minority of Community officials.
They are excellent news for all other staff.
Radical reform of the category system introducing a linear career structure will provide new opportunities for staff especially women and young people.
My question to the Commissioner is, in the process of consultation that is ahead now, will he ensure that the interests of a small minority with vested interests do not prevail over the future prospects of the vast majority of staff.
With strength, Madam President, I say yes, yes, yes, to all the questions asked by Mr van Hulten and I say it with joy.
That is an excellent answer with which to close this debate.
My thanks to the Commission President, Mr Romano Prodi, to Commissioner Kinnock and to all the Members of the European Parliament who have spoken.
(Protests from Mr Bigliardo)
Mr Bigliardo, I would dearly have liked to have been able to give you the floor, but, as you can clearly see, our time is extremely limited.
It would be unthinkable not to allow the three rapporteurs to speak when they asked for the floor.
I think it was the very least I could do.
Mr Cox stepped down, and I should like to thank him very much for that.
Madam President, I should like to say on behalf of my group that we welcome the fact that this announcement was made first in this House and not to the media or elsewhere.
I just want to ask Mr Kinnock, can we be sure that all these excellent reforms will also be implemented in this House?
Mr President, I informed the services in advance of my wish to raise a point of order while Madame Fontaine was in the chair.
It seemed to me that a number who simply raised their hands during the course of the first part of this sitting were given preferential status.
I regret that.
Can I ask you to inform me when the President will next be in the chair as I wish to put a point of order to her.
And can I have your assurance that I will be able to do so on that occasion?
In Strasbourg, Mr Howitt!
Mrs Fontaine will next be in the chair in Strasbourg, so you have ample time to formulate your question.
At the beginning of this sitting Madam President spoke about "la liste insupportable d' attentats" and I agree with her.
This is an unbearable situation.
Now, at the very moment when the Colombian President is meeting President Bush to discuss pursuing peace talks with revolutionary guerillas and when Zapatista supporters are marching through twelve states to Mexico City to discuss with President Fox a bill that would grant Mexico' s Indians self-government, legal status for their language and rights over natural resources, the Spanish Government, on the contrary, is making a new aggressive bid to crack down on Basque independence campaigners.
Last weekend, in Bilbao, Mr Mayor Oreja affirmed that he wanted to defeat ETA, not just ensure its disappearance.
Mr Poettering, you were there with Mr Berlusconi.
You were at this meeting as a special witness.
Do you believe, Mr Poettering, that this aggressive policy will bring peace to the Basque country?
Mr President, while the number of deaths in Iraq increases as the result of criminal sanctions and the use of radioactive weapons during the American/British bombings in 1990 and 1998, a new terrorist has moved into the White House and, in a bid to outdo his father and Clinton ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Korakas, we are going to discuss this matter tomorrow.
There is no point in making a point of order: you will be able to speak on the subject tomorrow.
Mr President, during the Strasbourg part-session, I put a question to Mrs Fontaine concerning prisoners in Turkish jails, and I received a very sympathetic answer.
Unfortunately, it was in French, but I have had it translated, so now I understand it too.
That letter describes the process, now under way, of negotiating with the Turkish Government concerning democratisation as a run-up to the whole application and enlargement process.
I should like to emphasise that it is now more necessary than ever to take action on this matter because, in addition to the problems by which it is already affected, Turkey is now faced with a severe political and economic crisis which will signify a setback for the democratic process and will mean that political prisoners in jails will be in an even worse position than they were before.
Hence, this request - it is not Mrs Fontaine who is in the chair, but it is, of course, you who represent the Presidency - to the effect that this matter should once again be addressed and the Turkish authorities once again urged to set the democratic process in motion and move it forward instead of bringing it to a standstill, for what we are witnessing now is a retrograde step.
Mrs Frahm, this is a subject which is always on Parliament's agenda, both in the committees responsible and in this House, when it is actually on the agenda.
Mr President, an initial observation: there is one Member who sits on these benches and who speaks a language which is not his own. He could surely do with some English lessons, so that at least somebody may understand him.
But what I wanted to refer to, Mr President, was the issue which Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, President of the Socialist Group, mentioned, in other words, the event of the seventh.
We have seen today that the Council has taken a unilateral decision to organise an event to launch the debate on the future of the European Union on the seventh.
And it has done so, as we have seen today, without the knowledge of the President of the Commission, and taking his name in vain.
The President said that she was going to consider the issue, and I believe that, in view of what has been heard here, it would be better if the European Parliament did not attend that event, which is nothing more than a marketing stunt, and I would also ask the Commission not to attend.
If we wish to debate the future of the European Union - that great public debate which must take place - we must do so from the outset on the basis of a consensus between the three institutions.
There is also another solution, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo: that we completely reorganise everything so that both the European Parliament and the Commission can be present, discarding all the documentation produced thus far and producing new material.
That is also a possible solution!
In any case, I endorse the hard line taken in your response.
Mr President, I would like to invoke Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure in order to make a personal statement.
Mr Galeote referred to me personally, accusing me of demonstrating party-political motives for having raised the issue of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell' Utri' s immunity.
As a Spanish Member of the European Parliament and as Socialist coordinator in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, this case falls within my competence, and to some extent I am obliged to raise the matter, because it seems to me absolutely shameful that seven months after the president of the Spanish Supreme Court sent a petition to this Parliament, nobody has even had the courtesy to reply to him.
Somebody is responsible, either Parliament or the Spanish Government.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having heard Mr Gorostiaga' s words, I simply wanted to ask this House a question.
How long are we going to put up with the indignity of one of our Members, under the protection of his position as an elected Member of Parliament for one of the Member States - Spain - taking the floor every time there is a terrorist attack and a condemnation by this House to play down the attack, to justify the crimes and to side with the murderers.
How long are we going to put up with this indignity, Mr President?
Mr President, I wish to protest at your cutting off the microphone without allowing me to finish.
I had two points.
The first concerned the bombings in Iraq.
You cut me off because the debate is to be held tomorrow, whereas what I was trying to tell you was that I have a proposal for tomorrow's debate and that is that we pass a resolution.
I did not intervene during the discussion of the agenda so as not to intervene twice.
The second point concerns Moldavia.
I read a report in the press about an unacceptable pre-election intervention by the High Representative of the CFSP, Mr Solana, in connection with Moldavia; taking account of the results of the election - in which the people of Moldavia voted freely and gave a huge majority to the Communists - I wished to raise the question of this unacceptable stand.
Allow me to read it so that I can call on Parliament to take a stand ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Korakas, first you wanted to take the floor to propose an amendment to the agenda after it had already been adopted and now you are raising an issue which is completely irrelevant to the proceedings.
This is not a point of order!
Mr President, I would once again like to invoke Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure in order to make a personal statement.
It appears that the European People' s Party wishes to discount any Socialist intervention by accusing it of harbouring electoral or party-political motives.
There is nothing I would like more than to have an influence on the Italian electoral process.
The Italian electoral process is taking place in Italy, but in Spain, at the moment, we have a president of the Supreme Court who is awaiting a response from this Parliament and so far he has not received one.
Mr President, I have requested the floor not for personal reasons but on behalf of the President of my group and in my capacity as Vice-President of that group, to say that I thought Mr Poettering' s speech was marvellous.
I congratulate you.
I believed that the democratic parties had the legitimate concern of preparing for democratic elections.
The accusation of electioneering applies to autocratic leaders, not to democratic leaders.
I must say that Mr Berlusconi is electioneering in Spain at this very time.
And I must say to Mr Poettering, in view of his assessment of this situation, that he must have read and shared the opinions of some of the characters in George Orwell' s Animal Farm, and that you must believe that all the European citizens are equal, but that some, Mr Berlusconi for example, are more equal than others.
Because here the only thing that is certain is that a petition for waiver of immunity has been hidden in an office, in who knows what institution, for at least seven months, in a situation which affects elections about to take place in Italy...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, since the subject of the Italian elections has been raised in this Chamber, I would like to reassure Mr Poettering. I would add that the current function of the plenary sitting certainly does not make it the most appropriate place to go into a question which has been dealt with at length in the Spanish press and has featured in the Italian newspapers, which did, in fact, inform us about the elections.
I would point out, moreover, that we can have recourse to bodies, such as the Parliamentary Bureau, and to people with responsibility for such matters, such as the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the President of the European Parliament and the Secretary-General, who, I am sure, will be able to investigate what happened and discover whether anything out of the ordinary took place.
The plenary sitting would not appear to be the most appropriate place to do this.
I therefore feel that the best thing would be to place our trust in these bodies and wait for them to analyse the case properly, seeing as I imagine the matter is of interest to all the Members in this Chamber.
I wonder whether the procedure used would have been the same for the least important Member of this Parliament.
Mr President, I can only warmly welcome Mrs Napoletano's words, which oppose the position adopted by the Parliamentary group she belongs to.
I, too, like Mr Poettering, am in complete agreement on the fact that matters relating to the internal affairs of Member States of the European Union should not be raised in this Chamber.
It pains me, however, to see that the Spanish Member who quoted "Animal Farm" has clearly not read the book or, at any rate, has not understood its meaning, for the work in question condemns the totalitarianism of the Communist regimes: maybe the Member should consult someone who marches in the ranks of his group.
In any case, I hope that this incident will serve as a lesson for the future, and I call strongly upon the House not to use the European Parliament to broach matters of national politics.
There have already been many interruptions of this kind in recent days, including that of the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, who spoke, totally inappropriately, on matters of Italian politics.
I would like, once again, to thank Mrs Napoletano for her statement.
That is enough points of order, or we will never get on to the items on the agenda.
Draft SAB 1/2001
The next item is the report (A5-0064/2001) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget 1/2001 of the European Union for the 2001 financial year.
Mr President, it has taken rather longer than expected, but we must discuss these important issues before turning to the less important ones.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our task is to vote on a Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget - the first this year - which was adopted by the Commission on 31 January and has already been adopted by the Council on its first reading.
There are several aspects to this Supplementary and Amending Budget.
It is intended to modify the remarks for budget line B7-541 in order to enable the European Agency for Reconstruction in the Balkans to extend its activity to Montenegro and cover its administrative costs.
It aims to update the EUR/dollar exchange rate, as obliged by the Council Regulation on budgetary discipline. While the 2001 budget is based on a parity of EUR 1 = $ 0.91, the Commission will have to present the required adjustments to EUR 1 = $ 0.87.
This will then give rise to what are really only virtual savings of EUR 245 million.
EUR 60 million will be transferred from the reserve to finance the agreed BSE tests.
And then there is the issue which is of crucial interest to us all, as is evident from the discussions and debates held over the last week: an additional EUR 971 million will be released to cushion at least some of the impact of the BSE crisis.
The figure of EUR 971 million is broken down as follows: EUR 700 million will be used to cover the 'purchase for destruction' scheme for cattle over 30 months, EUR 238 million will go towards the buying-in of beef in public stocks, and an extra EUR 33 million will be used to finance the additional BSE tests conducted on cattle over 30 months intended for human consumption.
Let me make it clear from the outset that I am in favour of adopting the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget, albeit in a modified form.
I say "modified" because we should give some encouragement to the Member States to take on more responsibility for the common agricultural policy.
So I support the draft, although I sympathise with those Members who want to reject this Supplementary and Amending Budget in its entirety.
My initial reaction was to say no to the draft as well.
Since I became a Member of the European Parliament, I have had to defend the common agricultural policy at home.
And that really is not an easy task.
We spend almost half our budget on our agricultural policy, and almost a fifth of that goes on supporting beef production.
But now that the beef market has collapsed, we are supposed to come up with almost EUR 1 billion to destroy the beef cattle which have been raised at such expense, because they have become unsaleable.
And it is very difficult - if not well-nigh impossible - to explain to the general public, the taxpayers and consumers, why this has to be done.
For one thing is clear: though this may be an enormous amount of money to cushion the initial impact of the BSE crisis now, it will not be enough for the rest of the year.
It is the proverbial drop in the ocean.
Or a tiny bit of sticking-plaster on a suppurating wound. And this suppurating wound is our common agricultural policy with its system of production incentives.
These mechanisms date back to a time when there was still a shortage of most foodstuffs.
But these times are well and truly over.
Today, there is a surplus - a glut - in all the key markets.
Coupling financial support with production creates an incentive - indeed, a necessity - to increase production and rely on more and more intensive production methods.
This intensification has a significant environmental impact and marginalises less productive locations.
And we cannot even defend the system on social grounds, for while the large factory farms have constantly expanded, small family farms have gone to the wall, unable to survive under these conditions.
In total, 80% of EAGGF funding flows to less than 20% of farms.
We have to break away from this system.
We cannot merely continue to treat its symptoms: we have to find a cure.
By its very nature, the system simply creates more and more problems.
So let us use this latest crisis as a chance to overhaul our common agricultural policy.
Let us use it as an opportunity for reform, focusing on the following objectives: maintaining a sufficient number of farms to preserve the environment and the cultural landscape, and recognising two core elements of the farmers' role, namely to produce high-quality foodstuffs while protecting the environment within the rural development framework.
And, of course, also achieving one of the European Parliament's longstanding goals: the promotion of rural regions.
However, this means supporting other forms of economic activity as well as agriculture.
Let us see the Supplementary and Amending Budget as the final step in our old agricultural policy - a step which has to be taken because no other instrument is available quickly.
But when we come to adopt the next financial measure, we must have a clear outline of a reformed agricultural policy.
For one thing is clear: although as a budget specialist, I have to focus on the financial aspects, I am well aware that the current crisis is not a financial crisis at all but a crisis of our agricultural policy.
And the sooner we set about correcting the problem, the better.
Now that two million cattle are to be slaughtered and destroyed in an effort to ease the burden on the markets, there is talk of an ethical problem.
Ladies and gentlemen, two million older cattle are slaughtered every year in Europe.
This is business as usual in other words.
But as a rule, these animals end up on the dinner table, not in an incineration plant.
However, I think it is a little far-fetched to talk about ethics.
Especially when there is talk of a 'Herod premium' in relation to a calf slaughter programme.
Good heavens, we do pride ourselves on our Western Christian roots, don't we - so I would just remind everyone that King Herod killed new-born male infants.
He killed people, not animals.
And despite all our love and understanding for animal protection, we should leave the church out of it.
There is a difference between humans and animals.
Let us not forget that.
Mr President, the central question in addressing the first budget amendment of 2001 is whether we should continue to make in-roads in to European agriculture while the BSE fire is still raging.
Is it permissible for a crisis to be used, or abused, for one' s own political ends, for the greening of agriculture policy or on the contrary for its liberalisation?
The real problem of BSE is caused not by large or small-scale businesses or the number of cattle per hectare: the real problem is that Member States have made a mockery of European rules and hence, in fact, have abused the trust of European consumers and farmers.
In that sense, I am bound to say, partly in view of the discussion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that Amendments Nos 2 to 5 are not in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the Committee on Agriculture as communicated to the Committee on Budgets.
Amendment No 1 is included in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture.
Madam President, the seven-point programme of the European Commission will come up for discussion later.
We are now concerned with the budget amendment before us.
The Committee on Agriculture agrees with this budget amendment, which is in line with the proposals made by it back in November 2000.
Although its foundation is weak, for example because of the relationship between the euro and the dollar, which is at this moment considerably less favourable than is desirable for the agriculture budget or is presented by the Commission, this is still the most practical course to follow.
The space within the existing budget will be used and the Financial Perspective remains intact.
That will no longer be the case in the near future.
Now that beef consumption has fallen by 28% and export is virtually impossible, we are heading towards a surplus of 2.5 million tons of beef, though the storage capacity of the European Union only totals 1 million tons.
The consequences for farmers' incomes are dramatic and the low prices certainly did not encourage consumers to increase consumption.
The expenditure ceiling will soon be in sight.
It was decided in the Committee on Agriculture of the European Parliament to discuss four alternatives for future funding, namely changing the Financial Perspective, saving on the current budget, adjustment of the division of costs between the Union and the Member States or additional funding through levies and discounts.
Because of the present foot-and-mouth crisis, that discussion will have to begin earlier than we should in fact prefer.
Mr President, it will be clear to you that the support of the Committee on Agriculture for the budget amendment can be seen as support for the Commission: it is exhibiting, in any case, more dynamism than the Council, which is bogged down in the individual national agendas, instead of solving the crisis.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group will vote for the Supplementary and Amending Budget out of necessity and due to the lack of viable alternatives, because in this crisis situation, urgent action is needed.
We do so in the awareness that in recent years BSE has often been accompanied by significant government failures, and the mistakes of the past are still coming back to haunt us.
So the Community has a responsibility to play its part in overcoming this crisis as well.
We will also vote for the 70/30 split, because we want to adopt the budget as quickly as possible, even though some people in this House would have wished to examine this issue more fully for future occasions.
Let me also add that at this difficult time that we should do our utmost to act in a serious and responsible manner and not add to the panic. I for one do not want to have to adopt one supplementary budget after another.
I should like to remind everyone that we are only a third of the way through implementing the much-vaunted Agenda 2000. We cannot celebrate this as a success and the basis of European business until 2006, and then slam on the brakes and deal it a death blow at the first available opportunity.
That will not enhance our credibility.
In any emergency, urgent measures are needed - but anyone wishing to change tack too abruptly at such a time could easily capsize in Europe's fickle waters.
An energetic approach is needed, but so too is sensitivity, if the issues are to be addressed seriously.
The task now - of course, against the background of enlargement towards Eastern Europe and the next world trade round as well - is to develop the common agricultural policy and the European model of consumer protection and agriculture in line with Member States' pledges in the international arena regarding Agenda 21, resource protection, sustainability, and balancing natural resource use on the one hand, and the use of technology and the economy on the other.
Mr President, I believe that the situation is now so serious that it is not enough for the European Parliament alone to deal with these issues. In my view - and this is our group's demand - the Heads of State and Government must discuss these issues at their forthcoming summit in Stockholm and provide honest answers to this crisis.
An answer must be found to the loss of consumer confidence.
The Member States must finally do their homework more promptly than in the past.
We have countless examples of occasions when the Commission was initially pressed to act and finally responded, but the Member States acted too late.
We must put an end to this situation.
We must also find answers to some of the attacks and aspersions cast on the professional integrity of farmers.
Some of what is happening goes beyond what is acceptable.
The Heads of State and Government must find an answer to this problem.
And the question is, do we really want to overcome this crisis?
For if we fail to do so, we will find that two years down the line, half the beef farms in Europe will have gone out of business.
So this means that there must be a response, and a change of course, from the Heads of State and Government too.
Mr President, in my view this debate is taking place in an unreal atmosphere.
We have in front of us a budget relating to the BSE crisis, but know that at this moment a far greater danger is haunting Europe: the danger that foot-and-mouth disease will spread on a large scale.
This budget will, in any case, not be adequate to confront all these calamities.
If we approve this budget, there will not be the slightest leeway left in the 2001 budget.
Is that sensible?
In the view of my group it is not.
We believe extra leeway should be created for the months ahead.
The only leeway that we have been able to find at the moment would be created if instead of a proportion of 70-30 for financing the disposal of livestock, a proportion of 50-50 were introduced.
This would create the extra scope of approximately 300 million euro in the budget for dealing with other calamities in the future and maybe also for financing measures for combating foot-and-mouth disease.
In the view of my group, the greatest threat looming at the moment is the renationalisation of agricultural policy.
Every country will try in its own way to find funds to confront the outbreak of all those diseases.
We must prevent every Member State pursuing its own independent policy: all policy must continue to issue from Brussels and that is why that extra leeway in the budget is necessary.
I should like to ask the Commission what steps it has taken since the Haug resolution of last July on the guidelines for the budget: that resolution clearly asked for a consideration of alternative forms of finance in relation to outbreaks of disease.
What has the Commission done on this point?
Is it possible to insure ourselves in future against these kinds of calamities?
Is a levy on meat required for an emergency fund?
We would like answers to all such questions, because it is unacceptable that diseases should break out and we should have no resources to do anything about it.
Mr President, Commissioner, Representatives of the Council, all we are debating is an Amending Budget, but look at the wealth of strategic issues it raises.
First and foremost, there is a gulf between the Commission' s own diagnosis of the anticipated cost of the BSE crisis and the funding plan before us.
I should like to repeat Mr Fischler' s point of view, as published in Le Monde one month ago to the day, which said that the costs of this crisis will be huge, even in the best case scenario where consumption would not fall more than 10% in 2001 and where our exports would be maintained.
Intervention buying alone would have a budgetary cost of EUR 3 billion.
One month later, consumption has fallen by 27% and exports have halved.
Yet we have been proposed a budget of a little less than EUR 1 billion, or a third of the estimated minimum costs.
This budget deficit gives a spectacular insight into the major political deadlocks that are provoked by a steadfast and increasingly intolerable refusal by the majority of the Fifteen and the Commission alike to consider even the slightest change to the Financial Perspective, even if this would lessen the effects of such a serious, unexpected crisis.
In the medium term, my group is certainly in favour of far-reaching reform of the common agricultural policy, a reform that would put an end to spending all the budget on illegitimate funding of agribusiness which centres on high productivity and is dangerous to human health and to the environment.
We want to see a CAP that no longer sends millions of animals to the incinerator; instead, we want a CAP that reserves its funds for real farmers, paying them a decent price for their products to enable them to practice long-term farming, sustainable development and safe, healthy livestock feeding.
Quite the opposite is what we have today where small and medium size producers are in deep trouble and are being well and truly lynched. They are victims of a pernicious agricultural policy that was pretty much foisted upon them.
We do not believe in making things worse in order to further our own ends.
We shall therefore vote in favour of this budget as an emergency measure.
We cannot, however, leave it at that.
The European Union must see its responsibilities through to the end.
On this issue, I shall voice my opposition to the idea of renationalising the CAP or, to put it more accurately, renationalising the funding of the CAP, as one amendment is underhandedly seeking to do, which would be tantamount to disintegrating the Community.
Incidentally, I would like to ask the majority of this House, which is dedicated to boosting the quality of European integration, if they can imagine what an enormous impact the talks on the future European Federation and on the unification of the great European family would have if, all at once, the oldest common policy were smashed to pieces, if the cardinal principle of solidarity crumbled at the very hands of the Fifteen and if, in the face of a major crisis, there was a return to the principle of every man for himself?
I believe that such issues are certainly worth several EUR billion.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, have the Community institutions been infected by the prion?
In other words, has the European Union gone so far down the path of madness that it would sacrifice the oldest and most complete of its common policies, by which I mean the common agricultural policy, when, paradoxically, it is also imposing and stepping up the integration process in the other sectors.
Our group has many reservations about the SAB which was adopted on Monday by the Committee on Budgets, and is even openly opposed to it, since the Committee is challenging the traditional distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, that the report is trying to force us to accept.
Of course, EUR 971 million is not enough by far given the serious nature of the situation; it is merely a starting point to mainly fund the 'purchase for destruction' scheme and possibly the screening tests, if necessary.
But then what will we do?
The crisis is so extensive that direct aid should naturally have been released immediately in order to support farmers' affected income and the beef industry as a whole. There are sufficient funds for that.
Once the SAB is adopted, there will be a margin of approximately EUR 500 million.
We know that huge savings can be made on some of the budget lines.
For example, we would make instant savings by reducing the aid given for setting aside agricultural land, which would pave the way for protein crops. Europe depends to a great extent on the United States for its supply of these as a result of the Blair House agreements.
By rejecting direct aid funded from the Community budget, as proposed by France, the Commission and the Council are preparing for the renationalisation of agriculture.
If this goes ahead, we will have to bear all the consequences of any such renationalisation.
In the first instance, we must acknowledge the failure of European integration, a failure upon which we must reflect before undertaking further common policies, particularly on a single currency.
Mr President, the honest farmers who bear no blame for the BSE crisis are now paying the price for the Commission' s and the Union's misguided agricultural policies.
The draft before us merely entrenches the structures which supported large-scale factory farming and production and are therefore partly to blame for the crisis.
Seventy per cent of the supplementary budget is to be used to pay for the incineration campaign.
It thus shores up the factory farming structures which have contributed to the crisis.
We will lose all credibility with the honest and blameless European farmers if we vote for this supplementary budget.
We will be sending out the wrong signal if, with this incineration campaign, we now sweep the problems of those who are partly responsible for the crisis under the carpet.
So I support the rapporteur when she calls for a fundamental shift in our agricultural funding regime in favour of small-scale farming.
But unlike Mrs Haug, I am not prepared to vote in favour of this supplementary budget.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that in today's debate on the Commission's supplementary budget, we should distinguish between three separate issues.
Firstly, which short-term measures must we adopt in order to restore some measure of stability to the beef market?
Secondly, what must we do in the medium term when this House debates the Agriculture Commissioner's 7-point plan?
And thirdly, what must we do in the long-term?
This House will also debate this issue, in connection with its review of market structures in 2002.
Please, let us keep to this.
For now, the immediate task is to adopt measures for the farmers throughout Europe so that the massive fall in beef prices does not put their livelihoods in even greater jeopardy than is already the case.
That is the purpose of this supplementary budget, and, please, we should deal with everything else in a calm and sensible way.
Let us not delude ourselves: until last autumn, there was a balance between supply and demand in the beef market, and it is important to be honest about that.
There are no milk lakes or butter mountains, and, Mrs RÃŒhle, let me make one thing quite clear, it was the government which you support which agreed eighteen months or two years ago to adopt what you now describe as a bad system, namely Agenda 2000.
That should be stated clearly for once, and you might like to discuss it at some point within your own party - which includes Mrs Schreyer, the Budget Commissioner, who proposed it, and Mrs KÃŒnast, the German Agriculture Minister, who supports it - and yet you act as if you had nothing to do with the whole thing!
I cannot let that pass.
If anyone is able to put forward any other short-term proposals, they should table them here as proposed amendments today or tomorrow.
I am prepared to go along with that, but I have yet to hear any reasonable alternatives, and we have to be honest about it.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that applies to you too, since you belong to this party as well.
We must be honest for once, and if a strategy is pursued which allows the small farmers to go to the wall - which is the message I heard, especially on the German side, from the Agriculture Council on Monday evening - my response is that it is simply not a strategy.
When I hear the German Federal Chancellor's recent assertion that it is a question of large versus small, and the German Consumer Affairs Minister's announcement today that large farms also need to be given appropriate support, which is why she does not support any upper limit on the animal premiums, I have to ask: what on earth is going on here?
In the short term, we must take every possible measure to restore stability.
The supplementary budget provides the right answers. We must debate the medium and long-term solutions in a calm and reasonable fashion.
Ultimately, that is the only way to identify appropriate solutions.
Those of us from the UK know only too well what a devastating effect BSE can have on the agricultural community.
I hope others can learn from our experiences and maybe our mistakes as well.
I think the most important lesson is that there is a need to take stringent measures from the outset, firstly, to prevent further outbreaks and, secondly, to ensure that consumer confidence increases.
Unless safety measures are dramatically increased we cannot succeed in restoring consumer confidence, which is critical in the long term to European beef markets.
In the UK now our markets and beef consumption have returned to 1995 levels.
However, to restore confidence, we really need to be clearly targeting our aid and we must encourage Member States to vigorously take up this aid, which to my understanding has not always been the case.
I would just like to address the issue that various people such as Mr Mulder and Mrs Haug have raised, namely whether the aid should be the traditional 70/30 split between the EU and the Member States or whether we should go for a 50/50 split.
Now, whilst I sympathise with the reasons behind what has been outlined by Mr Mulder and Mrs Haug, and I appreciate their serious concern about the level of funding being sufficient for the unidentified needs for the remainder of the year, it would be extremely difficult for this Parliament to go down this route because, firstly, the financial regulations state that 70/30 is the agreed split and anything new would actually require a change in the financial regulations and, secondly, speaking as a UK Member, I want to see parity, with other Member States being dealt with in exactly the same way as the UK.
So, if we want to ensure fair play, it is important that we have the same split.
Thirdly, if Parliament votes for this new approach the Council will have to have a second reading and this will only serve to prolong the process until a decision is reached, and this goes against our experience in the UK, which is that you must deal with things quickly and speedily to restore consumer confidence, which is vital to beef markets in Europe.
For these reasons I am against the rapporteur' s recommendation.
I do not want to apportion blame about the crisis but I have similar concerns to those outlined by other Members about the approach and length of time it has taken the Commission to attempt to tackle BSE with rigour and determination.
The Commission should have banned spinal cord from food and human consumption and animal feed once the disease was apparent in the UK.
The Commission should be undertaking a full and immediate audit of control procedures to prevent contaminated cattle from crossing borders.
In conclusion I would like to say that I support the request for the SAB and I think it is important we get Member States to take up this aid.
Mr President, the Supplementary and Amending Budget makes pitiful reading.
It literally means that EUR 700 million in EU funds is to go up in smoke, as this is the amount to be spent on beef that is at risk and that will have to be destroyed.
The worst thing about all this is, however, that the BSE crisis is seriously threatening the equilibrium of the EU budget.
Some of the expenditure in this supplementary budget is being financed on the rather optimistic supposition that considerable savings are to be had from the euro-dollar exchange rate.
This is probably mostly wishful thinking.
But the most serious aspect of the issue is that the margin for the Financial Perspective is in danger of being used up entirely.
After the proposal has gone through, the margin will only be EUR 506 million, or just over 1% of the total amount in that category.
Nevertheless, we may assume with a degree of certainty that the demand for beef exported outside the EU will rocket.
Consumption has dropped in many of the large countries, which is reflected in increased stocks.
As, at least for a few years, we can expect consumption to fall permanently, we should aim to release these stocks for export.
Within the framework of the current Financial Perspective, there is no longer any scope for doing this.
As a result, there is fear that other agricultural expenditure will be cut.
That might well mean a cut in income for individual farmers, in other words, individual farmers will have to pay for the crisis.
We have to remember that the BSE crisis was not caused by farmers.
They used the legally approved feed in good faith, although it turned out to be toxic.
For that reason, we all have to share the responsibility and not put the burden of that responsibility on one part of the population.
I am in favour of dividing the costs in half.
Mr President, Commissioner, the supplementary budget per se and the EUR 971 million are not the problem.
They are simply part of normal business and we should not be perturbed by the amount of money involved.
The real question is what it is used for and why it is necessary.
And I say that if the European Parliament had had codecision rights in respect of Agenda 2000, a different decision would have been taken in Berlin.
For example, we would have meadows instead of maize, we would have suspended intervention, all of which was proposed by the Commission and by Parliament.
We would have linkage with the working costs, we would have the 1990s threshold, which applies in conjunction with the working costs.
We would have adopted all these measures which are now back on the agenda, and, Mr BÃ¶ge, we would then have something which we genuinely could call Agenda 2000 and progress.
But now, under your influence, in which I also include COPA and the broad spectrum of the Christian Democrats, it is precisely these reforms which have been blocked.
That is the major problem: we are having to address this issue again today and spend money on a policy which has gone in quite the wrong direction.
If we take Mr Fischler's proposals, it is the destruction, not the slaughtering, which is the problem.
We in Europe will then feature in pictures all over the world which show the slaughtering campaigns and destruction.
From a cultural point of view, and in terms of Europe's cultural claim, we cannot sustain that for very long.
It would undoubtedly be sensible, Mrs Haug, to agree on the slaughtering of young cattle and calves in this context.
It is not a matter of a 'Herod premium' , but of ensuring that these new-born calves do not develop into massive bulls, but go on the market, after the appropriate tests and removal of any unsafe material, as quality meat.
That was Mrs Schreyer's proposal.
I regret that the proposal did not come from Mr Fischler and I hope that we will be able to follow that up later when we discuss his 7-point plan.
In other words, it depends on how we spend the money.
As the budget spokesman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has pointed out, we have often reimbursed money in the past.
But that is not the problem: the key issue is whether there will be enough money left over to set a new course in our agricultural policy.
I can see the following danger: if we pay for the special measures required to deal with this crisis out of the normal budget, then when we do want to set a new course, the funds will no longer be available. The emergency measures will no longer be necessary, but the money will have been spent.
So I think it is quite acceptable for the Member States and the EU to cover the costs here as well.
I would like those responsible for this crisis - who are not found in the political arena but in the private sphere - to pay into a compensation fund for those who have been affected, i.e. the farmers and those who have suffered human tragedy, as is the case in Great Britain ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the BSE crisis, or 'mad cow disease' , is being presented to us rather as if it were one of the ten plagues of Egypt.
However, this disease affecting livestock in Europe is not the result of a curse.
Cows did not go mad because they ate grass, or even smoked it.
Cows have gone mad because they have been given a dose of politics.
Cows have gone mad because they have had to swallow the common agricultural policy that the European Commission has forced down their throats for nigh on thirty years.
Basically, this intensive policy and these animal feeds are the result of the decisions taken by Member States and the Commission, particularly, let us admit it, by the French Government, by the French agricultural unions, why not admit that as well, but also by the Commission, particularly in the international agreements which favoured European cereal producers over American-grown soya bean meal.
At this point, we may need to have the courage to confront European opinion head on.
Europe is guilty.
Europe must make amends.
To my mind, the taxpayer in France or any Member State should not have to pay twice for this.
The European Union does not actually levy taxes.
When it is brave enough to levy taxes, it will perhaps be able to take on its own policies, but Europe does not levy taxes and there is no question of taxpayers paying twice over, firstly through the Community budget and then through their national budgets.
It is, nonetheless, utterly inconceivable that the European Union should be splitting up, essentially in the rift between the European project, with a monopoly on great prospects and plans for the future and the nation states or Member States which are being turned into leper colonies designed to contain European policies, as they are fulfilling the same function as the pesthouses of the Middle Ages, right down to the quarantines.
Mr President, I endorse the Haug report and congratulate the rapporteur.
I agree that the Supplementary and Amending Budget No 1/2001, which makes EUR 971 million available for additional costs arising from the BSE crisis, should be endorsed by Parliament.
I nevertheless feel that the following observations need to be made about this proposal:
Firstly, the EUR 971 million that have now been made available are necessary but they are not sufficient.
In any event, we will see.
Secondly, the BSE crisis, the real problems faced by producers, the collapse of consumer confidence and food safety requirements connected with protecting public health deserve more than vague answers and the postponement of solutions, however obvious conflicts of interest or budgetary problems may be.
The sensitivity of the situation calls for rapid, full answers.
Let us not, therefore, allow this climate of crisis to continue.
This issue needs, as it has needed in the past, to come off the agenda.
Let us find the courage to draw a veil over it, since this will help to restore the confidence of Europe' s citizens.
Let us not confuse the current emergency with the essential review of production methods to be promoted through the reform of the common agricultural policy. This reform is necessary but it must not be carried out hastily, which would be the case if it were carried out in the midst of a crisis or if it were guided exclusively by financial considerations or national interests.
These factors would, in fact, condemn the reform from the outset.
Thirdly, what has been said demonstrates the need for the European Parliament to gain real decision-making power on all agricultural expenditure, including expenditure that falls under subcategory 1-A. It also shows the need for an extension of the nucleus of expenditure that falls under subcategory 1-B.
In this way, the legitimate interest of Europe' s citizens will be respected.
Fourthly, what is at stake clearly, in my opinion, calls for this issue to be addressed fully and in depth at the Stockholm Council, and I hope that this will be done.
The fact that BSE and its impact both on farmers and consumers continues to dominate our political agenda is an indication of the seriousness of the current crisis.
However, the preventive measures that have been put in place such as the ban on meat-and-bone meal should, on scientific evidence, see the elimination of BSE and its threat to human health.
The testing of all animals over 30 months and the removal of specified risk material should go a long way in restoring consumer confidence.
For example, in Ireland, out of 48 000 cattle tested there has not been one reactor to the BSE test, and to me that is an indication that the disease is confined to other animals in the suckler cow and dairy herds.
My concern is that it will take some time through natural wastage to effect their removal and I would ask the Commissioner to examine ways of expediting this process.
The emergence of BSE in the older animal group tends to undermine consumer confidence even if they are not destined for the food chain.
I agree with the Commissioner on the need to rebalance the market.
The 'purchase for destruction' scheme may be necessary in the short term but it is immoral and certainly alien to the ethos of farming.
I would urge the Commission again to examine the possibilities and its policy in relation to food aid.
There are a lot of people who believe, Commissioner, that something more positive could be done with this quality meat product.
I caution against panic measures in relation to the long-term future of Europe' s beef industry.
We must be optimistic even in the face of crisis and plan for a viable future, albeit within a new framework, in relation to production at farm level.
In conclusion, from an Irish perspective, I believe that any attempt to reduce the size of the beef herd would be contrary to our national interest.
Mr President, along with the Members of my group, I shall support the proposed Draft SAB.
I should just like to make, as would the Members of my group, a few comments.
Commissioner, my first comment is to reiterate that not so long ago, you proposed a review of the Financial Perspective to increase external expenditure and the ceiling of heading 4, which certainly was a requirement and we agree with you here, and to do this by lowering the ceiling of agricultural spending in heading 1.
If we had not supported you on that issue, it would be extremely difficult for you to propose the SAB that you put before us today.
You should, therefore, acknowledge that we have been more cautious and careful than you have.
We think that every sinner should be allowed to reform rather than being put to death, and so we welcome your conversion.
My second comment is that we obviously need to totally divorce the problems of a complete reform of the common agricultural policy from the problem we are faced with now.
Today, our house is on fire.
We must, therefore, do everything we can to put this fire out.
When your house is going up in smoke, you do not start to question the quality of the building that you are trying to protect - you start by putting out the fire.
So, let us put aside the problems of reforming the agricultural policy and concentrate on the urgent issues in hand.
That is not all, however.
Listening to Mrs Haug, Mr Abitbol and other speakers, I am struck by the general challenge launched on the CAP.
Yet, I do not think that it can be said that it is because the CAP is what it is that there is this specific medical and veterinary problem, unless one has a slightly theological or fatalistic vision.
There is a serious veterinary problem and a specific medical problem, which is the spread of the disease from livestock to humans.
This has given rise to a whole raft of issues, but this could have happened, for example, in the case of foot-and-mouth disease, if we now discovered - God forbid - that foot-and-mouth can be spread to humans.
We should not be like the Prophet Philippulus, the Tintin and Milou cartoon character, who walks along beating a gong saying "Retribution is nigh."
That is not the problem that we face.
My last comment is to mention the problem of how the burden should be shared, either 50/50 or 70/30.
I believe that it would be truly paradoxical for us to reduce the need for Community solidarity at the very time when this disease and the problems that it creates for farmers are becoming a problem that affects the entire Community.
This would be an absolute contradiction, which is why we do not support Mr Mulder and his friends on the proposal before us.
Commissioner, Mr President, that is all I wanted to say.
You have our full support.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to go back over ground that has already been covered, and so I will refrain from describing the content of the amending budget proposed by the Commission and already adopted by the Council.
Instead, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you to reflect on what I believe are two extremely relevant points which featured in the amendments tabled in the Committee on Budgets in the context of this debate.
Firstly, the obligatory costs. As we are all aware, Parliament does not have much power when it comes to these costs, which include agriculture.
It is the Council which has the last word, for the CAP has always been synonymous with the European Community and the now the European Union.
I feel that the time has come to move on and to grant this Chamber greater powers: we have been elected by the European citizens and, as such, we have the duty to represent their interests in all fields. As part of the budgetary authority, we should have the right to exert weighty influence on all budgetary matters.
The second point is the splitting of the costs between the Member States and the Union.
The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has tabled a series of amendments on this point, seeking, as you are aware, to revise the intervention percentages to achieve a 50/50 split between the Union and the Member States.
I do not feel that this would be the right thing to do, and I will tell you why.
In the first place, given the difficulties the political world is currently experiencing as a result of the BSE crises, such a decision would appear in the citizens' eyes to indicate withdrawal from the problem by the European institutions.
In other words, the Union would soon be accused of being ready to intervene to ban State aid or set milk quotas, but just as ready to wash its hands of crises in the moment of need.
Take heed: when I say citizens I am not just protecting the farmers, who have been directly hit by the crisis, but also and above all the individual consumer who has, quite frankly, been in a state of terror for months now over a situation which is getting worse every day.
That is who we must protect, and it is certainly not by offloading the financial burden of the situation onto the Member States that we will do so.
Secondly, if we were to support this political position we would be encouraging the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy, which would be an absurd thing to do at a time when the post-Nice debate certainly does not provide for the cancellation of Community policies.
Mr President, the BSE crisis shows, among other things, how quickly confidence can evaporate. It will take time to restore confidence.
One of the reasons is that BSE is only the latest development.
What is also at issue, of course, is the long-distance transportation of livestock and a good deal else which will have to be changed as part of a transformation of the whole of the EU' s common agricultural policy.
For all these reasons, far-reaching measures will be required which will have to be effective in the very long term and on several different levels if it is going to be possible to restore confidence.
Overall, I think the Commission' s proposal is a good one.
It is dramatic, but it is nonetheless sensible and balanced.
Above all, it is necessary.
The Commission talks about getting production down and thus avoiding over-production and meat mountains.
A transitional period will be required, but this is a justified aspiration and will pave the way for an acceptance of principles oriented more towards the market economy.
The Commission also talks about an overhaul of the common agricultural policy in 2002.
I think it ought to be possible to begin this work no later than this year.
If the EU is to be competitive, there must first of all be changes to the common agricultural policy, even though that will obviously require a transitional period of a number of years.
We cannot go on producing for meat mountains. Instead, producing for consumption is what it is about.
The question is that of whether the Commission' s proposal is enough to restore confidence. It is probably not.
That means that more will need to be done.
I am less impressed by some of the points in the Commission' s proposal, for example concerning the distribution of costs between the EU and the Member States - at present 70 per cent for the EU and 30 per cent for the Member States.
That is a part of the legal basis, but nonetheless something which needs to be changed as soon as possible.
There are at least two reasons why the costs ought instead to be distributed on a 50/50 basis.
Firstly, there are budgetary reasons concerned with making it possible to tackle the whole of this operation successfully.
More than 40 per cent of the EU' s budgetary resources now already go on agriculture.
It is impossible to go beyond that level.
Secondly, another form of cost distribution is, in actual fact, only fair.
We have for a long time been familiar with the problems and the reasons for these.
Nonetheless, different countries have done a great many different things, and those which have invested to avoid this crisis have themselves borne the costs.
It is only fair that those who have done little, and perhaps in certain cases nothing at all, should now themselves bear a larger part of those costs which are necessary in order to overcome this crisis.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is going to accept this Supplementary and Amending Budget practically in the form in which it has been delivered by the other institution.
We accept that we are dealing here with a genuine budgetary emergency.
We need this extra EUR 900 million in order to implement the plan which the Commission has drawn up to combat BSE.
Above all, we must make our cattle farmers and public aware that the European Union is a common solution to their problems.
We would do irreversible harm to the process of European integration if we did not find a common response to this general crisis, which is the first truly general crisis in the Union.
And this response must be first and foremost a financial one.
Later on we can discuss when we must apply all the principles of Agenda 2000 in the field of agriculture, but now - and I say this again - is not the time to be talking about the future of the common agricultural policy.
Now we have to offer real responses, financial responses. We have to help European cattle farming with hard euros.
This is not the time to be discussing cofinancing rates, and there is therefore a majority in this House which, in principle, rejects the budgetary amendments to the Haug report, despite the opinion of certain people such as Mr Stenmarck.
There is still one outstanding financial issue: will there be sufficient money in Category 1 for additional measures when they become necessary for the month of May?
Agenda 2000 establishes a multiannual budgetary framework, which has been approved unanimously in the Council and by a sufficient majority in the European Parliament.
Would this not therefore be the time to say why the real budget for 2001 is, by a considerable percentage, less than that approved in the Berlin Financial Perspective for this year?
I would also like to say that perhaps the true financial debate does not lie in seeking an impossible revision of the Financial Perspective approved in Berlin, but in complying with the budget that was actually promised there.
I believe that that would be a truly European response.
Mr President, I feel that the supplementary budget proposal of EUR 971 million to improve the funding of measures to combat BSE is necessary and fair.
With this increase, the budgetary margin still available for agricultural expenditure within the CAP will be practically exhausted.
There is therefore a clear need to initiate the debate on financing the BSE crisis in the years to come.
This debate must, however, be conducted methodically and at the right pace and include an overall evaluation of European farming, the current state of the rural world and of how the CAP has responded to this situation.
I feel that the CAP must be reconsidered in order to provide the appropriate responses to what is today known as the 'European agricultural model' .
It will also be necessary to amend the drafting of its objectives within the Treaties. The CAP has today largely outgrown its origins, objectives and implementation tools.
I think it would be unacceptable, however, to use the excuse of the BSE crisis to force through reforms that everyone concerned wishes to see.
This is what appears to be happening as a result of the amendments now being tabled by the Commission, which seek or propose to amend the bases of cofinancing for support measures for the beef sector.
We all know that some Member States want to see the CAP renationalised, but I think this would be a terrible mistake that would cause the European Union to move backwards instead of forwards.
Such a move would penalise the poorer countries particularly harshly since farmers in those countries would receive less favourable treatment than their colleagues in other parts of the Community.
I do accept the need for debate on this issue, however, although it must be conducted in the context of an overall assessment of the CAP and other Community policies, not in this opportunistic way, taking advantage of a crisis to impose national self-interest when what is required is a Community response showing solidarity with those who are in difficulty.
Mr President, I rise to support this budget that should be spent to help with the BSE crisis.
We have to accept that we will have to incinerate a great many of the older cattle in order to restore consumer confidence.
It has the advantage of taking away some of the production when those cattle are incinerated, so I support the majority of this budget going towards the incineration of older cattle.
As we move forward to reforming the CAP - and we all accept that it has to be reformed - we must not do this with a gun to our head.
We must do this in a calm way.
It is no good just blaming the large farmer versus the small farmer.
It is not as simple as that.
It is about intensive production and this does not always take place on the large farms.
We cannot in Europe look only at the way we produce our food under the CAP.
We must also look at food imports from outside the European Union.
It is madness for us to put our house in order and then to see food coming into the European Union that does not meet the same safety standards as ours.
We have to be very concerned about this but we do not want to take too negative a view as regards consumption.
Consumption can return, and it has returned in the UK.
It has been a painful process, but now is not the time to make a judgment on exactly what in six months' time the consumption will be in Europe.
If the safety measures are put in place, if confidence can return, then the consumption can rise again quite dramatically.
That will be the time to reform the CAP and make sure we get it right.
Mr President, I support the supplementary budget and recognise the need for it.
I support the idea of the 70/30 ratio, as we have had in the past.
I want to point out that there are people in this Parliament who think that, because we reduce the European budget and force the Member States to take up the cost, we are saving the European taxpayers from something.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The question is whether the money is paid through the European Union or through the national governments.
In any case, the crisis is here and it will cost the European taxpayers.
It is not the appropriate strategy for the Members of this House to recommend that we should pass our responsibilities on to the national governments.
I would also like to underline the fact again that in this European Union we seem to think, when we introduce a supplementary budget of this size, that it is a major burden on the taxpayers of Europe.
It is actually a relatively small amount.
The budget of the European Union is a little over 1%.
Now the Member States which fight hardest and most vociferously against increasing that budget are the ones that take 47-50% and spend it themselves.
So the European Union takes 1%, of which in the past, agriculture took 80%.
Today agriculture takes about 40%, so as a percentage of GNP the budget of the European Union takes a lot less from the European tax-payers than it did 15 to 20 years ago.
The other point I should like to make is that so many people, by connecting these outbreaks of disease with the common agricultural policy, tend to somehow blame the CAP for the problem.
The truth is that the European consumer never had cheaper food and never had safer food. The evidence for that is in the longevity and the health of people.
Even in the poorest regions of this Union and in the poorest cities and towns we do not see hungry children any more because this Union has guaranteed and supplied cheap food of a high quality.
We should remember that.
So what are the solutions to the problem?
I would have preferred to hear the Commissioner plan for what consumption will be for the next three or four years and take immediate measures to reduce production.
I do not agree with my Irish colleague, Mr Hyland, that it is in anybody' s interest to produce something for destruction.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, agricultural policy has now been at the forefront of public debate for weeks.
This is a challenge and an opportunity for this policy area, for it is clear that there must now be a debate about our agricultural policy expectations.
Is it only about quantity? To what extent is quality also an issue?
How vigorously must we pursue the other goals which we demand of agriculture as regards landscape preservation, culture, animal welfare, and environmental protection?
During our debate, we have also heard from many speakers who have made it clear that previous proposals, which were supported by the Commission and the European Parliament, focused very strongly on these goals, but were unfortunately rejected by the Council.
I hope that the Council now recognises that it can no longer ignore this debate, but must tackle it head on.
But of course I must also point out that while we are focusing the debate on these objectives, we must not neglect to take the action necessary to overcome the current crisis.
