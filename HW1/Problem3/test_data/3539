The issue here is not merely technical, yet nor is it primarily procedural.
The key issue is the content of the first budget of an EU enlarged to include countries in which average incomes per head are substantially lower than the current EU average; a budget with payment spending raised to the level of inflation; the lowest budget, in real terms, since 1987; a budget that is not only incapable of contributing towards economic and social cohesion, but also institutionalises discrimination towards the new Member States; a budget that sets a bad example of Parliamentâs role as a budgetary authority, as, year after year, it accepts cuts and redeployments, which, in spite of worthy protests, tally with the objectives of the âCharter of the sixâ.
This budget does not augur well for the 2007/2013 financial framework.
It is characterised by political aims that are dominated by the obsession with competitiveness, and in which social issues are replaced by military and security issues.
It would be difficult for a budget to be any more explicit.
Â Â  .
The forest fires last summer in Portugal left a trail of death and devastation â 11% of forests and 5% of Portuguese territory caught fire.
This clearly illustrates the need to fund forest fire prevention measures that will preserve the EUâs rich and extensive forest heritage, particularly in southern Member States and the Mediterranean fringe, which are affected by such fires every year.
Appropriate measures are also required, however, at Community level.
The new forest protection programme, Forest Focus, which was approved last year and which runs until 2006, includes measures for combating forest pollution.
Measures required for preventing forest fires, however, are consigned to rural development, thereby undermining the continuity of measures funded thus far.
It should not be forgotten that, in various resolutions, Parliament has asked for increased funds for the forest protection programme and for fire prevention measures to be included.
We therefore regret that, when the reference amounts for the programme were being adapted, the opportunity was not taken to consider the needs of enlargement, in order to adjust aims and increase appropriations.
In spite of the large increase in the forest area of the EU, only EUR 4 million for the ten new Member States has been added to the already paltry EUR 61 million for this period ...
Â Â  . During the budgetary procedure for 2004, it was agreed that we would revise the reference amounts for the 29 Community programmes adopted under codecision, in order to take account of the needs of the ten new countries for 2004-2006, since these amounts had only been set for the fifteen current Member States.
At the conciliation meeting of 24Â November, the Council and Parliament reached an agreement to increase reference amounts by EUR 2.58 million, only around EUR 30 million short of Parliamentâs original proposals.
This cannot, however, be seen as a victory, since Parliamentâs original proposals were in line with the limits set out by the financial perspectives.
Many of these programmes adopted under codecision had become underfinanced for the fifteen, and we should have taken the opportunity to make some general corrections to the programmes and, in some cases, to the actual aims themselves.
We refer to complementary programmes to the actions of Member States in fields such as the sixth research and development programme, the framework programme in favour of culture, Forest Focus for the protection of forests, Life III, public health, youth, education, including Socrates, and many others.
This report, one of five, validates an agreement that falls short of what is required, with Parliamentâs direct complicity, and we condemn this.
Â Â  . Around 15% of the population of the EU â over 57 million people â live close to the poverty line.
In Portugal alone, more than two million people â over 20% of the population â live close to the poverty line.
While nothing is done to alleviate severe income inequality and major unemployment, which affects over 14 million people, the risks of poverty and social exclusion will increase, and will increase still further with enlargement to include ten countries in which the average income is lower than the Community average.
It is, therefore, regrettable that the Community programme of measures to combat and prevent exclusion receives just EUR 75 million in funding for the 2002-2006 period, in other words, an average of EUR 15 million per year for the current 15 Member States.
Worse still, the adjustment made to take account of the needs of enlargement is only EUR 10 million, or EUR 2 million per year.
Parliamentâs complicity in this state of affairs is regrettable, given that fighting social exclusion and poverty ought to be one of our key priorities, even bearing in mind the limited objectives of the current programme.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the package of Commission proposals before us (one proposal for each type of legislative act in question: decision, decision, regulation, and another on the proposal to adapt the reference amount of the sixth Euratom framework programme) aimed at amending the reference amounts of programmes adopted under codecision, to take account of enlargement.
By revising the financial perspectives for 2000-2006 to take account of enlargement, Parliament and the Council must â at the end of the budgetary process for 2004 and in line with the process of codecision â revise the reference amounts for programmes adopted under codecision, within the maximum limits of the aforementioned adaptation and revision of the financial perspectives.
I feel that the extra amount proposed â EUR 2.58 million, on top of the original budget of EUR 26.7 million â meets funding needs arising from the current enlargement process, for this vital package of programmes adopted under codecision and financed under Heading 3 of the financial perspectives (internal policies).
Results were in some cases excellent and therefore worthy of the highest praise and, accordingly, of our unequivocal support.
Â Â  . At present, under the current legislation, when an official vessel of a Member State detects and pursues on the high seas or from the high seas, a vessel suspected of illicit drug trafficking, which is flying the flag of another Member State, it cannot take any action against it without obtaining the prior authorisation of the flag Member State.
Given the need for prior authorisation and the time taken to obtain this, many anti-drug-trafficking operations end in failure on the high seas.
The basic aim of the Spanish initiative needs to be viewed against this background.
That aim is nothing other than to step up cooperation between EU customs administrations in combating trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances by making it possible, in particularly urgent circumstances, for an official vessel of a Member State to take action on the high seas against a vessel flying the flag of another Member State, where there is good reason to believe the vessel is being used for illegal drug trafficking, without having obtained prior authorisation from that Member State.
While this initiative is restricted to offences arising from illicit drug-trafficking on the high seas and in view of the amendments added by the rapporteur â albeit not all of them welcome, in our view â I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . There has been a dramatic increase in illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings in recent decades.
We therefore need to find fresh ways of combating this type of crime.
It is important to pay special attention to the situation of the victims of this type of crime.
They must be afforded protection and help, especially if they are minors or from a similarly vulnerable group.
These immigrants are exploited by gangmasters, and given their illegal status, it is very difficult for them to escape, since they are often afraid to contact the relevant authorities.
I endorse this Directive, as I feel that it will make a welcome contribution towards both helping the victims and catching the criminals.
Short-term residence permits are to be granted to victims of an action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the competent authorities.
Overall, the proposed amendments are aimed at improving the situation of the victims.
The idea has been suggested of a reflection period, to enable them to consider whether or not to cooperate, which may be difficult in view of the difficulties they may have, not only in speaking about their situation, but ...
Â Â  . I support the idea of helping victims of human trafficking.
However, this is not at all what this directive is about.
It simply forces victims to co-operate with police authorities by means of the threat of expulsion.
Instead, comprehensive victim protection must ensure a permanent residence permit, thus granting full access to medical and social support without preconditions.
A clear distinction must be made between 'trafficking in human beings' and the smuggling of migrants.
Trafficking simply means helping immigrants to illegally enter Fortress Europe â for profit or as a benevolent activity.
Trafficking is based on a decision to migrate, but it often ends in exceptionally exploitative capitalist conditions of work later.
'Illegal immigration' is nothing more than the understandable reaction to EU-efforts to fence itself off from migratory flows resulting from global poverty, war and capitalist exploitation.
'Illegal immigration' is usually the only way to reach EU-territory at all.
If you really want to help victims of trafficking and exploitation, you should not hide behind the interests of European law enforcement authorities and fob victims off with short-term residence permits.
Instead, free access to the EU must be part of a free world so that people can move freely.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs communication, on which this report is based, is intended to improve the monitoring of the application of Community law, in view of the need to pre-empt the natural increase in tasks arising from enlargement and to take account of the extension of the Community acquis.
The Commission proposes various actions designed to improve the monitoring of the application of Community law.
The communication details what is covered by the prevention carried out in close and reciprocal cooperation between the Commission and the Member States; it then describes the conditions of effective management of monitoring and of how infringements are dealt with, which will become even more significant after enlargement; finally, it looks into the possibility of gradually changing the culture of monitoring, by introducing the dimension of preventing such behaviour.
There are, of course, both positive and negative aspects to Mr MacCormickâs draft report.
Among the good points were Recital L: âFailure by the Community legislature to achieve good quality in law-making can itself be detrimental to the correct understanding and application of Community lawâ; andâits desire to see enhanced cooperation between parliamentarians in the European Parliament and Parliaments of Member Statesâ
These points were sufficient for me to vote in favour.
Â Â  . As the report states, the most effective guarantee of the proper implementation of Community law begins with the quality of its law-making.
It is only with high-quality legislation that the law can be understood and applied correctly.
Appropriate monitoring effectively depends on information that is both qualitative â concerning the practices adopted in actually applying the law â and quantitative, reporting on numbers of directives whose transposition or effective application is delayed by reference to established deadlines, or otherwise deficient.
It is important to underline, as regards this measure, the importance of close and reciprocal cooperation between the Commission and the Member States.
As the Commissionâs communication rightly points out, simply punishing infringements will not be sufficient; it is also essential that we prevent such infringements before they happen.
Such pre-emptive action must involve closer collaboration with national parliaments and meticulous compliance with the principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and appropriateness.
Â Â  . The question of biological and chemical agent attacks against EU Member States has been the subject of debate, particularly since the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
A joint programme has been adopted, which is intended to improve cooperation between Member States in the areas of evaluating chemical risks, alerts, intervention, the storage of means of intervention and in the field of research.
We must, however, be realistic and rational with regard to the measures that we decide to take were we to be faced with the threat of this type of attack.
I feel that the adoption of budgetary and legal initiatives must be based on a clear risk analysis demonstrating a genuine probability of terrorist attacks in the EU.
Consequently, I support the recommendation that a realistic analysis should be carried out of the threat posed, which will form the basis of an EU response.
This will make use of European cooperation between national police forces involving Europol and take into consideration the results of cooperation between intelligence services in the fight against terrorism.
Â Â  . This question achieved almost complete consensus in committee, with only two Members voting against.
The report aims to improve preparedness and response to biological and chemical agent attacks.
It concludes that an effective system against such attack would be based on four pillars: effective early warning system; effective reporting system; a well-developed public health care system; and emergency planning in the event of a disaster.
What is in fact required is an effective response framework in the event of a disaster, way beyond being a mere stockpile of vaccines, which may seem at first glance to be a simple solution, but which offers no guarantee of success.
I therefore voted in favour.
Since the events of 11Â September, terrorism has become a genuine threat.
Due to its unpredictable nature, combating terrorism must take the form of prevention.
I congratulate MrÂ Schmid on his report, but I should also like to suggest a somewhat different approach; measures should be taken actually to thwart biological and chemical attacks.
Citizens will be safe from terrorist attacks of any type, if such attacks could be neutralised in time.
Â Â  .
The report before us poses such a vast array of questions that it would be impossible to cover everything in this short explanation of vote.
Nonetheless, while I do not agree with the thrust of some premises and proposals contained therein, the report deserves praise for the criticisms it makes of the current repression of rights and of safeguards of privacy and the protection of personal data â as a consequence of measures adopted in certain countries under the pretext of the âfight against terrorismâ â which are undermining fundamental rights and freedoms.
I should like to highlight criticism in the report of the agreement being negotiated between the EU and the USA concerning the transfer of transatlantic passengersâ personal data, which it deems illegal.
The report also criticises the attitude of the Commission and of some Member States âto connive at this violation of the law and the principle of legalityâ.
As a result, personal data are, without informing and obtaining the consent of the data subject, transferred or accessed directly or systematically by a third party.
I should also like to point out the need for effective monitoring of Europol and Eurojust, the concern with strengthening SIS and with projects to extend the capacities and competences to SIS II and the anxiety regarding the development of the use of personal biometric data.
Â Â  . While I do not agree with the wording of certain parts of this report, I feel that the report does contain a set of proposals intended to uphold the dignity of people held in the various EU countries, to improve the conditions in which they are held and to help them to reintegrate into society.
The report begins with an alarming picture of the situation in various parts of the EU in terms of aspects such as prison overcrowding, the increase in the prison population, the increase in the number of detainees awaiting definitive sentencing, drug addiction and rising suicide rates.
The report makes various general recommendations, which I welcome.
Among these are the prisonerâs right to have access to a lawyer, the prisonerâs right to health and safety, to decent conditions of detention, to professional and social reintegration; the recommendation of protection for juveniles and special protection for pregnant women and mothers of young children; and the recommendation that prison staff should receive training and enjoy decent working conditions.
If implemented, these recommendations will help to solve the serious problems that exist.
Â Â  .â Prison conditions in Europe are alarming; the report before us today highlights the increase in the prison population, overcrowding, the increase in the numbers of foreign prisoners and the increase in the number of prisoners awaiting sentence.
A CouncilÂ ofÂ Europe report also refers to the persistence of ill treatment and unsuitable and insufficient prison buildings, as well as mentioning the inadequate activities and care provided, and of the increase in drug addiction.
I support the drafting of a EuropeanÂ PrisonsÂ Charter containing binding rules for MemberÂ States.
We call on the MemberÂ States to release funds to modernise prisons and to provide more suitable training for the police and prison staff.
We propose more widespread use of alternatives to prison sentences. We would also like to increase opportunities for Members of the EuropeanÂ Parliament to visit prisons.
All the amendments I tabled in committee were adopted. They seek to strengthen several aspects of the report.
All inmates must be able to take part in schemes designed to help them reintegrate back into society, so that fewer of them re-offend.
It is essential to strengthen measures to prevent violence between fellow prisoners and prevent suicide. Special protection must be given to juveniles and women, particularly pregnant women and mothers of young children.
Â Â  .
I am, naturally, in favour of the fundamental rights of prisoners and I am aware of problems such as overcrowding, the rates of death, suicide and ill-treatment and the inadequate nature of prison facilities, which force us to consider the need to take certain measures in this area.
This area, however, is strictly a competence of the Member States.
Consequently, due to the subsidiarity principle, I voted against.
Â Â  . The common position submitted by the Council tallies with the positions previously adopted by Parliament.
It does, however, contain two points that we should like to see amended, so that the second phase of the Daphne Programme (2004-2008), which is already some months behind schedule, may get under way.
Firstly, the Councilâs proposal places too much emphasis on the perpetrators of violence, which creates a further target group on the same level as the victims of violence.
We endorse the need to set up treatment programmes that are also aimed at perpetrators of violence, and as such we ask that these should be referred to only in the paragraph on treatment programmes that are aimed both at victims and people at risk and at those who have perpetrated violence.
The second point is the establishment of a support centre for NGOs, so that they may be able to improve their projects, set up links with other partners and enjoy the benefits of the Daphne acquis.
The provision of technical support is essential during this second phase of the programme, especially for those NGOs taking part for the first time, in other words, those from the new Member States.
Â Â  . Even though most of Parliamentâs proposals on extending the Daphne Programme until 2008 had already been accepted, and even after funding had been increased to EUR 50 billion, we voted in favour of the rapporteurâs position.
We must implore the Commission to maintain the balance of its proposal with regard to victims and attackers, and to ensure that these are not placed on the same level.
We also agree with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to ensure that new Member States can also benefit from this programme, not least through the creation of a support centre aimed at helping NGOs to plan their projects and establish links, especially those taking part for the first time.
It is essential, however, that governments in Member States pay particular attention to this problem and do not leave the violence prevention campaign solely to the NGOs.
Indeed, a recent programme on a French television channel criticised the fact that no awareness-raising campaign against violence has been launched on that channel.
There is such a campaign in Spain, yet more than sixty women have died in previous years, and this year is following a similar pattern.
Portugal is in exactly the same situation as Spain.
Â Â  . This Parliament has long supported the development of the second phase of this programme designed to fight violence against women and children and to combat trafficking of human beings with a special focus on women and girls who might fall victim to abuse.
The fact that the Council has given its support to this programme and has taken on board some of this Parliament's strengthening amendments (including the increase in budget) is to be welcomed.
I support the Women's Rights Committee's text and trust that the plenary will accept a well balanced report which should ensure that the new Member States can fully benefit and that their specific needs will be taken into consideration.
Â Â  . â On the day after the day devoted to womenâs rights, I am pleased to see that the EuropeanÂ Parliament is also taking this issue to heart.
No fewer than three reports on the subject are to be put to the vote today.
Unfortunately, however, the reports only contain general and commonplace statements. The report on combating violence against children, young people and women is no exception.
To combat this type of violence effectively, it is necessary to focus on those who perpetrate violence, not just on the victims.
Above all, it is essential to be able to understand the social, family, economic or even religious reasons why individuals lose control and resort to violence.
In truth, all this report does is to state that there has been an exponential rise in these types of violence.
It fails to deal with the real causes of such behaviour. In fact, all this violence tends to result from the same causes.
Violence against women cannot be eliminated without addressing the factors that contribute, directly or indirectly, to women being in a submissive position.
I am thinking particularly of the status of women in Islam. In Islam, women are perceived as inferior and submissive.
Under no circumstances are womenâs rights a secondary consideration.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in today's vote on the copyright directive I voted for Amendments Nos 101 or 55 and 53.
What is involved here, to all intents and purposes, is the introduction of stronger copyright laws through the back door, further strengthening the hand of large suppliers, while, as a consequence, many small suppliers will be unable to operate successfully in the marketplace.
The reason being that they cannot afford long-drawn-out procedures and patent rights.
What is at issue here, moreover, is the scope of the directive, which is intended to cover breaches of copyright.
I believe that this applies when we are talking about commercial objectives with direct and indirect economic advantages.
That is why I voted for Amendment No 53.
It is not true to say that this directive creates greater legal certainty, because there is no clear and uniform definition.
If it is to achieve the Lisbon strategy, the EU needs patent legislation that protects financially weak, generally small companies and inventors, and thus encourages innovation.
What the EU does not need is patent legislation that leads to a monopolisation of patent rights.
Â Â  â The Regulation governing the statute and the financing of political parties at European level violates the fundamental principles I referred to during the course of yesterdayâs debate. It also violates some of the procedural provisions of the Treaty.
By way of example, it violates Article 202 of the EC Treaty, which states that executive powers can be given to the Commission but not to the European Parliament.
It also violates Article 198 of the EC Treaty, according to which, âsave as otherwise provided in this Treaty, the European Parliament shall act by an absolute majority of the votes castâ.
Article 5 of the Regulation states that the European Parliament shall verify compliance with the conditions of funding âby the majority of its membersâ, while Article 191 of the Treaty does not give it any authority in this regard.
All this shows that this is illegal.
The Dimitrakopoulos report attempts to rectify this irregularity by reintroducing the requirement of the outcome of the vote to be a âmajority of the votes castâ vote at the level of the European Parliament regulation.
This, however, does nothing but increase the confusion and the contradictions.
We hope that these anomalies will provide sufficient grounds for the Court of Justice to declare that this inopportune and badly-constructed regulation does not conform to the Treaty.
Â Â  The European political parties, or rather the manna from heaven that ought to fund them, amount to a rather sorry sight.
This is how I understand MrsÂ Voynetâs declaration of her faith in Europe by the creation of a EuropeanÂ GreenÂ Party. She also expressed her concern that Europe is not sufficiently loved by its citizens.
I doubt that this self-interested love demonstrated by the Greens, and by all the other political parties developing the necessary structures to be able to emerge, will actually strengthen the democracy of the EuropeanÂ Union.
The report of the CommitteeÂ onÂ ConstitutionalÂ Affairs has been cobbled together in a makeshift manner. It is a legal monster born of RegulationÂ (EC)Â NoÂ 2004/2003, which, after numerous setbacks, was adopted on 4Â NovemberÂ 2003.
The regulation is currently the subject of an appeal before the CourtÂ of Justice, which I filed together with several of my fellow Members, thus showing that the delegation of the GroupÂ forÂ aÂ EuropeÂ ofÂ DemocraciesÂ andÂ Diversities is equally determined to oppose this new resolution.
Further, we see the new politico-financial responsibilities devolved to the Bureau of the European Parliament as a cause for concern.
The Bureau will be sitting in judgment upon itself. There is also likely to be extra work, in the very short âterm, for the CourtÂ ofÂ Auditors and for OLAF.
Â Â  .
As we can see, Parliament is assigned âa new task, which is different from the âtraditionalâ tasksâ, in which âParliament exercises âexternalâ powersâ, in other words, monitoring âEuropean political partiesâ.
This would, for example, establish the procedure of âsanctioningâ a âEuropean political partyâ that no longer observed the âprinciples upon which the EU is foundedâ.
While the report tries to have us believe that it is of a technical nature, I feel that this report is, much to the contrary, highly significant politically.
It puts in place the âStatute and financing of European political partiesâ, which sets out â and this is crucial â a certain model of the European political party, and establishes procedures for access to financing, for which discriminatory conditions must be fulfilled.
There are many aspects to cover, but it is essential to mention how strange it is that Parliament is in charge of this process, since it will be the judge and the judged, and this according to criteria and procedures that may lead to exclusions on entirely political grounds.
I should also like to point out that the original aim of this entire process was to bypass the Court of Auditorsâ criticism of the financing by certain groups in Parliament of their respective âEuropean partiesâ.
This solution has been imposed by the dominant players in the EU, without any genuine support, hence our vote against.
Â Â  â Parliament seems to be ignoring the three appeals concerning this procedure brought by different political groupings. They contested the legality of the Regulation governing the statute and the funding of political parties at European level.
Parliament should remember that the existence of these parties is far from being established, and that this regulation violates many principles, among them the principle of equality, the principle of freedom of thought and of conscience, the principle of democracy, and the principles of the separation of powers, political pluralism and subsidiarity.
Firstly, this new system will allow the funding for such parties to be withheld not on objective criteria but on criteria based on teleology and political purpose.
In requiring the parties to observe âthe principles upon which the European Union is foundedâ, parties which do not subscribe to a particular European doctrine will be barred from receiving any funding.
Furthermore, this control is initiated and operated by Parliament itself.
It cannot be a judge and a party at the same time.
This new system will also lead to many different kinds of discrimination.
In effect, by imposing very high requirements for the formation of a European political party, the aim is to exclude new groups.
In this regulation, the usual legal approach has been swept aside for an entirely arbitrary one.
Does Parliament want to make a stand for democracy?
If so, I call on it to counter all threats to political pluralism.
Â Â  â The report before us contains the first measures on the application of the Regulation governing the statute and financing of political parties at European level, adopted in JuneÂ 2003.
The report determines which Parliamentary bodies are competent to allocate public funds to European parties.
Although in the past I supported the Regulation, I cannot now endorse the content of this report.
The report entrusts the allocation and management of Community funds to the Bureau of the EuropeanÂ Parliament, on the grounds that the Bureau is already responsible for funding issues concerning the internal organisation of Parliament. This is clearly not a convincing argument.
ArticleÂ 3(c) of the Regulation treats the funding of parties as an entirely political question.
The allocation of Community subsidies depends on political loyalty. The interpretation of this does not entail all the necessary guarantees of impartiality â far from it.
It is therefore totally unacceptable to make the Bureau responsible for deciding on requests for or the suspension of public funding. The Bureau is a bureaucratic body where only certain political tendencies are represented.
As this is a political issue, the ConferenceÂ ofÂ Presidents should be entrusted with the necessary powers, as it is an openly political body.
Â Â  .
We voted against the Dimitrakopoulos report because it completes the procedures for the promotion of the central idea of the Rules of Procedure for the European parties and their financing, in other words the creation of agencies and mechanisms which will âcreate a European conscienceâ and cultivate the perception of the one-way, capitalist, anti-grass roots policy.
Any opposition voiced will be denied any room for expression.
Measures are being taken to muzzle the opponents of the system.
Rights are being abolished, such as the right of free expression and to establish political parties.
On the basis of Community orders and the choices of big business, the European Parliament is being turned into the judge of the âpolitical correctnessâ of these parties.
The majorities will decide on the legality of the existence of the minorities or at least on the terms on which their ideas are projected and on whether or not resources should be granted for such projection.
The amendments proposed by Mr Dimitrakopoulos move in a more conservative direction.
While excessive powers are granted to the more easily controlled Bureau of the European Parliament, the sole right reserved for the European Parliament itself is to decide âby a majority of the votes castâ (not even an absolute majority of its members) if a party does or does not observe the principles of the EU; in other words, if it fits into the mould of big business in the ÎU and its system.
We shall vote against this report because it turns the European Parliament from a forum for the juxtaposition of ideas into the judge of the right of ideas to exist.
Â Â  . We should like to call into question the contentious point that decisions on establishing political alliances or political parties at European level, which are not internal organs of Parliament, and on allocating grants to these organisations, are the exclusive competence of Parliament.
This is especially controversial as it is based on vague and elastic criteria, allowing decision-making to take place purely on political grounds, in which the Members will be both judge and judged.
It is precisely because the Bureau is the body with the competence to take such decisions that I voted against this report.
Not every political group represented in Parliament sits on the Bureau, yet all political groups must take part in such politically charged decisions as creating political organisations that are eligible for Community funds.
Otherwise, the transparency of these decisions is compromised.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group consequently tabled an amendment aimed at replacing the Bureau with the Conference of Presidents, the body that reconciles such representation.
Given that this proposal was rejected, I voted against.
Â Â  . The report before us is a response to the need to amend Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure, in view of the new competences in the fields of financial management and of monitoring the legitimacy of political parties at European level.
To my mind, this undermines the provisions of the Treaties.
The Bureau will be responsible for most of the tasks relating to the operation of the funding system, since it is the body responsible for financial and administrative matters concerning Members and the internal organisation of Parliament.
I must reiterate the need â in accordance with the principles of appropriateness and proportionality â for provisions, especially financial provisions, concerning political parties at European level, to be extended and actually applied to all political parties at European level, without discrimination and regardless of whether or not they are part of European political parties or European alliances of political parties.
As Mr Berthu stated in his minority opinion, I fear that the new system will bring about all manner of discrimination.
I also regret the rejection of an amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, conferring competence to the Conference of Presidents, rather than the Bureau, which would be a more solid guarantee of pluralism and participation.
I voted against.
Â Â  . I believe that the European parties' statute, which provides for the financing of European political parties, is in breach of the subsidiarity principle.
It is for the citizens of a Member State to decide whether or not they will choose to fund national political parties or independent representatives.
The criteria for EU funding only of pan-European political parties exclude and therefore discriminate against smaller national parties and independents.
It is also extremely worrying that the decision on whether or not a party will share in EU funding will be taken by an institution of the European Union.
This hardly supports the fundamental principles of democracy and subsidiarity.
Â Â  Mr President, I said earlier that this was largely a tidying-up exercise, but drew attention to the fact that Rule 180(8) would now apply to all Rules of Procedure.
This means that in the new Rules to be published in time for the new Parliament â indeed, presumably in time for the enlarged Parliament in May â the figures in our Rules will automatically be adjusted to suit the expanded size of Parliament.
Those figures have to be adjusted to be the same proportion for the enlarged Parliament as they are for this Parliament.
For instance, the figure of 32 Members needed to table a motion or an amendment will rise proportionately.
Through what we have voted, this will also apply to Rule 29 in its new version, which lays down the minimum size for constituting a political group in Parliament.
The figure in the new version is '16 Members from at least 5 countries'. That will have to be revised upwards to 19 Members â or whatever the number is â from at least 5 countries.
However, as we realised that this would affect existing groups in the House just for the May part-session, there is a provision that allows existing groups to continue as they are until the elections, irrespective of this rule change.
This means that none of the existing groups need to fear being dissolved before the election campaign.
They will subsequently have to look at their situation in the newly elected Parliament after the elections, as will every group, on the basis of the verdict of the electorate.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe MrsÂ Frassoni made a comment about voting on Amendment NoÂ 4.
A number of votes were taken en bloc.
If I am correct, I think the point she made was that temporary committees would no longer have the same status as they have had in the past: Parliament would not be able to set up temporary committees.
Mr Corbett, am I right on this point?
Â Â  I do not want to encourage a debate here, but Mr Corbett, please make a brief response.
Â Â  Mr President, I can allay the fears of colleagues: Mrs Frassoni was mixing up committees of inquiry and temporary committees.
I will take the matter up bilaterally with her.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Paulsen report not so much because of its content â with which I was not totally familiarâ than as a reaction to the procedure.
After the vote in committee, we were faced with a result that made implementation of the regulation impossible.
That was a reflection of the widely varying opinions of the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
At the rapporteurâs request, the Council has now, and somewhat unusually, brought forward a new text in advance of the vote in the House.
The rapporteur agreed this text with four of the groups in Parliament and presented it to this House in what I see as a very undignified manner, with new versions of the English text being presented day after day over the last week.
It was not until this morning that all the changes, that is to say changes in the form of the Council text, were presented to Parliament.
We are now looking at a totally new legislative text that has not been discussed in committee beforehand.
This House has had no opportunity whatsoever to adopt a position on this text in committee; instead, the text was immediately presented to the House with adoption today by a non-qualified majority vote.
If we made this system the rule, then we would certainly have a very rapid procedure, and we could deal with all legislative texts within four weeks.
The Council would just have to present a text, four Members of this House would nod it through, and the whole House would vote for it, because it would not be possible to address its actual content.
I regard this way of proceeding as extremely dangerous, because the hallmark of a parliament is the way it debates a topic and its diversity of opinion.
It cannot amount to a dictatorship by a handful of people in the groups, who explain overnight at a group meeting what is in the text, without anyone knowing exactly what is actually being voted on.
I urge you to think about this and only to permit this procedure in exceptional cases in future.
I can of course understand that MrsÂ Paulsen is anxious to put her report to bed, because she is not coming back.
However, she could also have achieved that by talking to me.
But that is not what happened.
I hope you will take this point on board and reject any such procedure in future.
Â Â  Today's vote, which was a first reading, required only a simple majority.
Whether or not we had a qualified majority was not at issue today.
That will be an issue at another stage of the procedure.
As you know â and I heard your point â the House is sovereign.
I followed the correct procedure, I put the question to the House, I followed the advice of the rapporteur, I invited the committee chair to speak, a majority expressed itself in favour of proceeding and I then did so, as is my duty.
Â Â  . We have recently seen a series of food and livestock crises, such as âmad cow diseaseâ and foot and mouth, which illustrate the need to raise food safety standards.
Appropriate legislation must be adopted that encompasses all stages of food production and processing, that ensures that consumers are provided with the information that they need and that sets up official control systems, thereby ensuring compliance with the law and penalties for those who infringe it.
Food and animal feed must be safe for human and animal health.
Safety must be the overriding consideration, ahead of any commercial aim, be this for pure profit or for trade facilitation.
A heady climate of permissiveness has been created in the wake of the abolition of internal borders and the gradual liberalisation of trade, which has, in turn, led to a lack of investment in essential technical resources (such as reference laboratories and research centres) and human resources (such as professional training).
This situation must be stopped.
This regulation forms part of the same approach as other regulations in the White Paper on food safety, which establishes a series of common aims in the field of food safety and common EU-level sanctions.
In other words, it addresses the consequences without calling into question either the underlying production model or liberalisation.
The proposals contained in the report fall short of what is required, despite a number of welcome proposals, such as the application of the same ...
Â Â  . Since the mid-1990s, the EU has adopted an increasing number of legislative acts on questions of health and safety concerning food and animal feed, with the aim of responding to consumersâ pressing concerns.
Monitoring and inspection have played a crucial role in this response.
The battle is far from being won.
As the rapporteur stresses, what is required is greater stringency and a common legislative system applicable to all official monitoring.
The objective is increased safety, both for consumers and for producers, and this report is a further step forward in the field of food safety, specifically in food and animal feed.
I am aware that this is a subject that has long been a priority area for the EU and, as such, I endorse the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.
These measures will bring significant benefits to consumers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, on my own and MrsÂ Boogerd-Quaakâs behalf, I would state that we voted against the Fourtou report in the final vote.
Certainly, it is important that measures be taken to combat piracy, but the regulations as amended go much further.
In particular, extending the regulations to include patents would be a mistake.
We can also concur with MrÂ Schnellhardtâs criticism of the procedure, a criticism that can also apply where this point is concerned.
For example, the group had extremely few opportunities to discuss this matter before we faced having to make a final decision.
There is also justification for observing that more than 50 leading experts on intellectual property law in Europe appealed to Parliament to look more carefully at the matter, something we have not, however, done.
The legal basis can also be questioned, since the procedure is now at issue.
Pursuant to ArticleÂ 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community has not usually approved such procedures.
I wish therefore to observe that we have obtained regulations that may damage small enterprises and that are not limited to combating piracy, which is what is important.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I did not vote for the amendments to the European Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure on the financing of political parties; not because I am not in agreement with all this, but because it is the logical consequence of the fact that back in June last year my colleagues and I voted against the Leinen report.
Implementing the regulation in this way amounts to discrimination against the smaller party groupings in this House, which although they are active at European level nevertheless are not represented in any group.
Financial support is given to large party groupings but not to smaller ones, thus creating a huge gap in terms of democratic deficit between these two kinds of grouping.
We all know that parties and their organisations are dependent on financial contributions.
This creates an uneven playing field between the parties at European level, and I cannot vote for that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I voted against the FourtouÂ report on intellectual property.
In my opinion, the EuropeanÂ Parliament has made a serious error of ethical judgment when voting on this report today.
The votes of the conservative, socialist and liberal Members produced a majority for a position on the issue of intellectual property that, in my view, gives too much weight to the interests of large multinationals as against the interests of citizens. Intellectual property tends not to be an easy issue to deal with.
The credibility of the EuropeanÂ Parliament is at stake here.
How are we going to explain to the citizens of Europe that Parliamentâs rapporteur, the person with the highest profile in relation to this dossier, is married to MrÂ Fourtou, who is none other than the chairman of VivendiÂ Universal?
How can Parliament explain its policy to the thousands of European citizens, especially young people who learn about European policy on this issue by email, while the question of the existence of a personal interest overshadows a text such as this?
I think Parliament has made a very serious mistake today.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Turmes.
As you know, MrÂ MacCormick has already raised this question in a different way.
For our part, I will put the question of interests, including family interest, to our Bureau.
I will then be guided by its wisdom.
This issue has certainly been the subject of much discussion within the House.
I am not referring to this particular rapporteur nor to todayâs report, but to the principle.
This is a problem that we must address.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of MrsÂ Fourtouâs report (A5-0468/2003) on measures and procedures to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the negotiated compromise package.
It has been important to us to ensure protection for citizens and their rights and, at the same time, to combat growing trademark counterfeiting, pirate copying and the infringement of intellectual property rights.
Moreover, the directive ensures further harmonisation of national legal regulations on the enforcement of intellectual property rights and helps ensure that the legislation is complied with.
The compromise means that the proposal is limited to circumstances of a major commercial character.
It excludes offences by consumers who have acted in good faith and strengthens peopleâs right to carry out private copying in accordance with the Copyright Directive.
It means that judges must take account of the intention behind infringements, and it ensures the confidentiality of important information.
Moreover, adoption is in accordance with the EUâs global obligations in relation to the World Intellectual Property Organization It also means that there is proportionality in the proposal and that obstacles to trade must not be created.
Finally, we consider it important to have the proposal adopted before enlargement.
Adoption following enlargement could mean that future legislation would only be adopted in several yearsâ time, which could lead to increased illegal activity.
Â Â  We have chosen to vote against the compromise on the harmonisation of the Member Statesâ legislation on intellectual property rights, mainly because of the amendments to ArticleÂ 9 that have been tabled.
If the proposals for amending ArticleÂ 9 are adopted, this will lead to conflict with Swedish legal tradition, especially the principle of the free sifting of evidence.
We believe that, if such large alterations are to be made to legislation and thus to Swedish legal tradition, the changes should be well thought through and well worked out, and not arrived at in a hurry as these have been.
We are not therefore opposed to altering the legislation, but we do not believe that the changes are satisfactory in their current form.
Â Â  . The issue addressed in this report is difficult due to its history and its far-reaching ramifications.
As far as we are concerned, we are vehemently opposed to pirating and counterfeiting, and we advocate rules to promote the use of discoveries and inventions that belong to all humankind in these free and fair times.
The first consideration is, therefore, the object of the protection of intellectual property.
Should authorsâ rights, trademarks and patents be treated in the same way?
While we steadfastly oppose the misappropriation and commercialisation of human knowledge and of what is part of human heritage, we acknowledge the difficulty of striking a balance between legitimate property rights and the social and collective benefits of the item concerned.
This, however, is the theory.
Whereas mechanisms to protect these rights are unable to stop trade and abuse, they must not be so lax as to allow, or even encourage, pirating and counterfeiting.
An example of this is Port wine, and other such designations of origin to be preserved or created, given that it represents heritage that is universal and, therefore, local and national.
As such, in the name of spurious liberalisation, it can have a devastating economic, social and cultural impact, as well as a detrimental effect on health.
The rapporteur has shown caution and, on this issue, it is better to be safe than sorry.
Nonetheless, the rejection of certain amendments, especially those relating to the âfederalistâ tendency, in which caution was nowhere to be seen, led us to vote against.
Â Â  .â Economic operators commit serious violations of intellectual property rights on a commercial scale. They deceive consumers or they usurp the identity, reputation or technical procedures other businesses have invested a lot in establishing.
It is therefore right to establish special legal measures to combat this scourge.
Under pressure from certain lobbies, however, certain people wanted to ensure that this directive is applied with particular flexibility.
This is extremely dangerous as it opens the door to the abuse of these anti-counterfeiting measures. They could be used against private individuals, guilty of saving music from the Internet onto a CD, for example.
Big business could also use these measures to harass weaker competitors such as small- and medium-sized enterprises, for example.
Lastly, there is the fear that this directive could be used to return in a roundabout fashion to subjects on which Parliament has already reached a decision, like generic medicines and the impossibility of patenting software.
This is why I voted against this draft directive, which Parliament has not succeeded in amending satisfactorily.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this resolution, as I naturally endorse the promotion of new technical requirements and new processes that actively contribute towards adopting measures taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants.
The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen Community requirements regarding the restriction of new heavy vehiclesâ polluting emissions (positive-ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas).
This therefore constitutes a further important means of promoting the sustainable development that the EU champions.
Given the mishaps and delays that have affected this process and the âspeedâ with which we are trying to push through amendments to the Commissionâs proposals, there is no chance of establishing a framework in which operators and professionals in the sector are forced to comply with rules and to be subject to the relevant inspections.
The rules have not been clarified and feasibility checks, especially of certain monitoring methods, have not been carried out.
We must launch an awareness-raising campaign, as soon as possible, in collaboration with these professionals.
Â Â  We voted against Amendment NoÂ 1, designed to limit the applicability of the Framework Decision so that, where the drugs trade is concerned, it applies only to serious and/or international crime.
We support the Council decision as a whole and believe that this addition would limit the scope of the Framework Decision and, therefore, clearly entail a deterioration in the Councilâs document.
We also wish to emphasise that the EU should deploy every possible means to combat the use and sale of drugs.
We interpret the Council decision as saying that drug trafficking is prohibited, and we therefore believe that âcoffee shopsâ should not exist within the EU.
Â Â  â There are three reasons for our rejecting the creation of an independent agency with its own legal personality to manage external borders.
Firstly, management of the land, maritime and air borders is the sovereign prerogative of Member States. It is for Member States to guard against the flow of migrants and to combat people trafficking.
The Council of Ministers is, furthermore, unanimous on this issue.
Secondly, each Member State should have a representative on the Management Board. Decisions must be unanimous rather than being taken by a majority.
To our great surprise, France is the only country proposing a 12-member Management Board, so removing the rights of Member States to manage their own borders.
Lastly, in our opinion, it is out of the question for the Agency to have exclusive powers on issues such as the removal of third country nationals illegally residing in a Member State and the establishment of a European Corps of Border Guards.
The United Kingdom and Ireland made the right decision in refusing to accept the Schengen on the control of external borders.
The French Government should have had the courage to do the same.
Â Â  .
We know that drug-trafficking is a threat to the health, safety and quality of life of citizens.
In 2001, the Commission adopted an EU-level approach to combating trafficking, in view of its transnational nature.
The final agreement laid down substantial amendments to the Commissionâs original proposal, such as the establishment of new sanctions that tally more closely with those set out in the UN Conventions on this issue, in contrast to the limited definition that the Commission had put forward.
We welcome the fact that consumption is not penalised, although this question is not addressed as thoroughly as we would have liked.
We are opposed to the European Arrest Warrant, hence our final vote.
Â Â  At present, drugs policy is not harmonised within the EU. Instead, each country devises its own policy.
That does not, however, prevent the drugs issue from appearing high on the political agenda.
Ever younger people are misusing drugs, and more and more young people see no danger in trying cannabis.
Even what are termed party drugs, that is to say the most dangerous synthetic drugs of all, are becoming more widespread.
In a Europe without borders, we are in danger of having ever greater drugs problems as the legalisation of drugs extends beyond the Netherlands.
Many appear already to have given up the fight for a drugs-free Europe.
It deserves to be repeated that there is a link between the number of people who try drugs and the number of people who are in danger of getting hooked on their misuse.
The possession and use of drugs must therefore remain criminal offences.
The wrong signals are still being sent out to the young people of Europe when anyone can buy five grams of cannabis at a so-called coffee shop.
We must not be satisfied with this Framework Decision, but must continue to strive for a drugs-free Europe.
We say no.
We do not wish to legalise, we do not wish to liberalise and we have not given up the dream of zero tolerance for drugs.
Â Â  . Under the Italian Presidency, we were finally able to conclude an agreement on the minimum provisions applicable in the field of combating drugs at Community level.
The main objections, both in the European Parliament and in the Council, came from the Netherlands, where the consumption and sale of small quantities of soft drugs are permitted.
It is, therefore, understandable that the Oostlander report should have confined itself to proposing that the Council framework decision should be accepted in the version presented, without any amendments, because this text received unanimous approval after a year of negotiations.
This did not stop me from voting in favour of the measures that have been proposed.
I wish to highlight two of these: the penalisation of all types of trafficking, production and sale of opium, cocaine and cannabis, and the condemnation of the production of synthetic drug precursors if they are produced with the aim of processing drugs.
Applying the principle of subsidiarity allows Member States to use the framework decision to sanction personal consumption, but does not force them to do so, thereby respecting the various national legal and criminal systems of the Member States.
Â Â  .
After years of discussion in Council, an agreement was concluded last November on the minimum provisions applicable in the Community-level fight against drugs, and this agreement has been submitted once again for the consideration of the European Parliament.
All types of trafficking, cultivation and sales of opium, cocaine and cannabis will be penalised and the production of synthetic drug precursors is to be condemned if they are produced with the aim of processing drugs.
Activities relating to drugs used exclusively for personal consumption as defined by national law are, on the other hand, excluded from the scope of this framework decision.
This means that, on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, although Member States use the framework decision to sanction personal consumption, they are under no obligation to do so.
Illegal drug-related activities will be punished by criminal penalties of at least one to three yearsâ imprisonment and incentives, aid or attempts to commit one of these infringements will also be punished.
I regret, however, (and everything suggests that this is the result of pressure by the Netherlands), that judicial cooperation and extradition are not pursued more vigorously.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  We are well disposed towards an agency for better coordination and cooperation in the area of border controls.
We wish nonetheless to emphasise the importance of national self-determination in the implementation of border controls.
There must be no restrictions upon the competence of the Member States, and their influence upon the development of border cooperation must be retained in full.
Â Â  . We are very much in favour of greater cooperation between States for the better control of external borders and of the creation of a technical agency to encourage such cooperation.
The von Boetticher report on the subject calls for a qualified judgment, however.
On the one hand, it tries to limit the agencyâs tasks to technical cooperation and says that âthe management of national borders should remain a sovereign Member State responsibilityâ, which is excellent.
On the other hand, however, it sets the new system not in an intergovernmental framework but in a Community one, guided by the Commission and under the political control of the European Parliament, thus opening the way to extensions of supranational competences in the future.
It must in fact be read in parallel with the draft European Constitution, which shows the mentality that prevails in Brussels: Article 3(166) charges the Union with âthe gradual introduction of an integrated management system for external bordersâ, that is a supranational system with a European border police.
Although the von Boetticher report limits the agencyâs tasks for the time being, it cannot therefore give us any reassurance.
It appears to be looking to extend Community powers, which is inappropriate here.
Â Â  . This report should be seen in the context of âgradually developing a genuinely integrated system of external border control managementâ, as proposed, in fact, in the draft âEuropean Constitutionâ.
Whilst containing some contradictions, as a result of its supranational perspective â the report endorses the Commissionâs role in this agency â at the same time, it rightly states that monitoring national borders should remain a sovereign Member State responsibility.
One of the reportâs more positive aspects is to criticise the idea of giving this agency the task of expelling immigrants.
What is being proposed is basically to create an agency that will have responsibilities to date held by the Member States, which will prop up what is known as âFortress Europeâ and which will assist in stamping out immigration and in expelling immigrants.
I accept that there must be cooperation between national bodies, in order to combat networks that exploit immigrants and traffic in human beings and to combat organised crime and money-laundering.
Mechanisms for this purpose already exist, however, and so there is no need to create new instruments that remove tasks which fall strictly within the competence of the national authorities and which are sovereign Member State responsibilities.
The crux of the issue is not, therefore, to create new agencies but to change current policies.
Hence our vote against the report.
Â Â  . Due to the increase in the external land, sea and air borders that will need to be monitored after enlargement takes place in May 2004, the European Union needs an effective system for managing its external borders, in particular to combat international terrorism and organised crime, illegal immigration, trafficking in arms, drugs and human beings and to combat crime at sea.
For this reason, I support the establishment of a European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders.
It was, incidentally, in this context, that I suggested â and plenary adopted this suggestion last November â a proposal to the effect that, when the next financial perspective is negotiated, Community programmes should be put in place to support defence re-fitting, in particular, a programme exclusively dedicated to developing equipment to protect the EUâs external borders.
Nevertheless, given the intergovernmental nature of border control and in light of the experience that each of the Member States has acquired in performing this task, I believe that each Member State should be represented on the Agencyâs Management Board to ensure that it can benefit from the skills and knowledge acquired âon the groundâ by each country at its own borders.
Since the report did not see fit to take up this concern, however, I felt obliged to vote against it.
Â Â  . Establishing the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders, which is expected to take up its responsibilities on 1Â January 2005, arose out of the overwhelming need to improve the management of controls at the external borders which, it should be noted, now total 6Â 000Â km in length.
Account must also be taken of the European Unionâs enlargement.
I disagree with the rapporteurâs view that the Agency should have a âmore Communitarianâ character, but I did agree with the position expressed by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the effect that the intergovernmental nature of border control should be maintained.
This is in fact the line adopted in the Commission communication â without prejudice to a system of majority voting in the Agency (for operational reasons).
On the one hand, this is a result of the Community legal system itself â and of the current division of powers â but, on the other, today offers better safeguards for the experience acquired by each Member State in performing these tasks (whether at air, sea or land borders or at all three).
It therefore appears to make sense that the Management Board should be composed of one Member from each Member State, assisted by two representatives of the Commission.
Consequently, I voted against the report.
Â Â  It must be possible for both women and men to combine family life and working life.
We therefore welcome a Framework Directive in this area which establishes objectives in terms of, for example, working time, access to child care and minimum periods of parental leave.
We do not, however, think that issues concerning the ways in which welfare is to be organised should be decided at EU level.
We have therefore voted against wordings that require special forms of tax relief or the use of what are termed vouchers or that in other ways regulate welfare policy in detail.
We also wish to emphasise that families can take different forms in terms of how their members live together, and we therefore support the wording that states this.
Families that do not consist of mother, father and child must also be recognised and be given the same legal status as the traditional family.
Â Â  We believe that family policy must be characterised by freedom of choice.
It must be possible for both parents to combine working life with responsibility for their family.
The Moderate family policy envisages highly flexible child care.
We are, in principle, able to support quite a few of the proposals presented in the report.
We note that, in its explanatory statement, the report emphasises that family policy does not come within the competence of the EU.
We agree with that and have therefore chosen to vote against the report as a whole.
Â Â  . As we all know, at the Barcelona European Council, the Member States gave a commitment to eliminate obstacles to the participation of women in the labour market and to set up, by 2010, childcare facilities for at least 90% of children between three years old and the mandatory school age and for at least 33% of children under three years old.
The need was stressed for a financial contribution for the creation and/or operation of high-quality childcare services at affordable prices.
How, then, can this be reconciled with social spending cuts or with a large part of the childcare network being dismantled in the enlargement countries?
Giving families more subsidies, vouchers or tax benefits is pointless unless the necessary infrastructures are in place.
Unfortunately, the proposal we tabled to extend childcare to cover, by 2010, all children until they enter compulsory education was also rejected.
We must also highlight the need for structures to support the elderly and dependent persons, to improve the timetables of urban services, (opening hours for shops, businesses, transport, etc.) and integrated and humane housing and town planning.
The report also calls for shorter working hours, a change of mindset, for a more equitable division of family responsibilities, and ...
Â Â  .
Since the 1990s, the Council has launched several actions to reconcile work and family life, making this a highly topical issue, and 2004 has consequently been declared International Year of the Family
Mrs Bastosâs report argues that everyone should be able to choose whether to work or to stay at home and, if they decide to work, they must be able to reconcile working life with the needs of the family, whether in terms of children or the elderly, who are increasingly part of the family setup.
I could not agree more with this principle and I therefore welcome not only Mrs Bastosâs request that the European Commission evaluate the state of policies for reconciling family life, working life and private life, both in the current Member States and in the candidate countries, but also the emphasis she gives to measures to be implemented to support the family.
These include financial assistance for childcare and education, vouchers for the recruitment of home helps for families with disabled children and vouchers to help low-income families with three children or more.
Â Â  . In line with the proposal I tabled in the relevant committee, I welcome, in particular, the inclusion of the framework concept of âfamily-friendly policiesâ, and the guideline to pursue policies governing taxation and other levies and tariffs in public services that take account of the family and the greater size of family units, without discriminating against them.
Also important is the reportâs recognition of the social and economic value of family and domestic work, which is often overlooked and scorned, either through deeply-held prejudice or a simple lack of interest, which results in prejudice against individuals and in real inequalities.
I also welcome the adoption of the amendment I tabled against revising the concept of the family.
Revising this concept would be both misguided and also outside the sphere of Parliamentâs competence.
The family, which is a secular sociological and anthropological reality and is unequivocally deep-rooted, must not be confused with individual options that result in different situations and which do not fall within the scope of the family.
I would also highlight the aptness of the reference to the need to provide specific allowances for situations including large families, for children with disabilities or for multiple births, and also the idea that the Member States must develop forms of cooperation and networks for exchanging good practice.
Once again, I congratulate Mrs Bastos on her excellent work and on the enormous step forward that this report represents.
It will serve as a benchmark for family policies in the European Parliament.
Â Â  I have actively supported the fact that, in paragraph 3, the European Parliament comes out in favour of the Christian Democratic idea âthat family policy should create preconditions to enable parents to spend more time with their childrenâ.
The same paragraph also emphasises the value of the fact that this would also âhave a positive impact on family formation and family stabilityâ.
On the basis of this, what paragraphÂ 2 calls âtackling the demographic problem faced by the majority of the Member Statesâ is an urgent matter.
In accordance with our view of society, Recital K of the report specifies that âthe rights of children must be at the heart of family policiesâ.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats succeeded in voting down Recital G (by 321 votes with 169 in favour and 21 abstentions) and, thus, the attempt to create a new and diffuse definition of what constitutes a family, something that is definitely not a task for the EU.
The PPE-DE Group believes that the concept of the family is based upon childrenâs right to their mothers and fathers and upon parentsâ responsibility for their children.
Children must always be at the heart of how we construct our society, at the same time as the family is societyâs most important and most fundamental building block.
I therefore voted in favour of the report as a whole (there having been 424 votes in favour, 51 votes against and 37 abstentions).
Â Â  . The harsh fact is that women make up only 46% of the working population.
There are 12 million working women and on average they earn 20% less than men.
They are in fact victims of inequality, first of all in access to work: their unemployment rate is two points higher than for men and 80% of French adults earning less than the index-linked guaranteed minimum wage (SMIC) are women.
There are a variety of solutions.
Obviously, women must be given the means to make a genuine choice between working or not, that is they must be given the means to stay at home and look after their children if they so wish, by increasing family allowances, for example.
Reconciling work and family life must at last be made possible, however.
Today, single-parent families account on average for 14% of all families with children and 90% of single parents are women.
These trends must be taken into account and working hours, childcare systems and childcare allowances, family benefits and parental (maternity or paternity) leave arranged accordingly.
Equality between men and women certainly requires that.
But we must be very careful to avoid quota systems such as we already have in the political field.
Â Â  . This is a positive report, in which the rapporteur divides women from minority groups into: women with disabilities, migrant women and Roma women.
For women who are disabled, it argues for the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation to be transposed and for access to be provided to education, training, employment and occupational training in an ordinary environment.
The report also calls for these women to be helped to become more independent and for their participation in political life and in decision-making to be promoted.
As regards migrant women, the report draws attention to incorporating the equality dimension into policies, programmes and actions designed to combat racism, discrimination and social exclusion.
It calls on the Member States to ensure the effective application of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and specifically states that migrant women should be able to participate in political life and in the decision-making process.
Where Roma women are concerned, the report draws the attention of the Commission and of the governments involved to the need to ensure the effective application of policies implemented at Community and national level that are likely to improve Roma womenâs economic, social and political situation.
This last aspect is the most important one, due to enlargement.
The remainder of the report basically consists of rehashing earlier proposals and decisions.
There is still a need for ...
Â Â  . The rapporteur has produced a report on minority womenâs groups, specifically women with disabilities, migrant women and Roma women.
These are interesting perspectives, which warrant everyoneâs attention.
These are problems of which I am aware and to which I would truly like solutions to be found.
To this end, I must express my particular concern at all types of violence (not only domestic violence) faced by women with disabilities and at the lack of respect for the individual rights of migrant women.
Since I broadly agree with the content of MrsÂ Martinez-Orozcoâs report, I voted in favour of it.
Nevertheless, I must point out that the problems I have referred to are not confined to women alone.
These are situations that occur across the board and affect men too.
Â Â  Prior to the Swedish referendum on EU entry in 1994, all the parties working for EU membership stated that cohabitation issues, marriage legislation and abortion issues did not come within the competence of the EU.
They promised to direct their efforts to ensuring that these issues remained areas in which strictly national legislation applied, without the involvement of the EU.
We stand firm by that pledge to the Swedish electorate.
We believe that national legislation is very much better in this area than common EU legislation.
We observe how other Swedish parties have abandoned that pledge and are ready to transfer these issues to EU level.
Were that to happen, it would be to the detriment of Swedes and be in danger of conflicting with Swedish custom and tradition.
There is no obvious need for coordination, and the best adjusted legislation will be achieved if the various national parliaments within the EU are allowed to design the legislation in this area.
EU aid policy too must respect individual countriesâ legislation.
We share the Swedish view of the right to abortion but, out of respect for third countries, we have voted against those parts of the Junker report that demand free abortion.
The report also focuses helpfully upon the serious health problems present in the developing countries, where EU aid policy has an important role.
Â Â  . The official themes of Mrs Junkerâs report should have been the major chapters of the United Nations action programme drawn up at the Cairo conference ten years ago.
We are therefore entirely justified in expecting to find in the report some relevant considerations of economic growth, migration, urbanisation policy or even the environment, all of which were issues raised and highlighted by the Cairo conference.
It is therefore very surprising to read a text where all these questions are completely passed over in favour of the recurrent obsession with questions of sexual and reproductive health, which occupy no less than 20 of the reportâs 27 paragraphs.
Even a question as central as education is mentioned only for the part it may play in the matter.
In short, the rapporteur sees the population question in the developing countries as coming down to a womanâs control of her body: it seems to us that a wider reading of the problem and one closer to reality in all its aspects would have been more useful, and also more respectful of the different approaches taken, within the Union, to a sensitive subject like abortion.
Â Â  . Karin Junker's own-initiative report seeks to tackle one of the world's most difficult challenges, of achieving more of the stated outcomes of the UN International Conference on Population and Development, held in 1994.
The report starkly highlights some of the statistics which clearly demonstrate that more action is required.
Globally, one woman dies each minute from pregnancy-related causes, about 200Â 000 maternal deaths per year result from the lack or the failure of contraceptive services, at least 75Â million of the 175 million pregnancies each year are unwanted, and rape and other forms of sexual violence are increasing, including in Europe.
These, and a whole host of other facts contained in the report, clearly point to a need for increased action and assistance to be given by developed countries to combating poverty and encouraging economic growth, with a corresponding increase in educational opportunities, particularly lacking in some countries, for women and girls.
On the basis of the latest figures, the indicators for the Cairo conference objectives are still showing shocking inequalities between the world's wealthy and poor countries and regions.
The EU governments can and should take a lead in improving the situation.
Â Â  . The Junker report must be viewed in terms both of what it states explicitly, but also in terms of what it implies.
In other words, in addition to the attention that must be paid to the health of mothers and babies during and after pregnancy, or to basic precautions to prevent the spread of the Aids virus, the text â especially with the amendments tabled in committee â expresses quite a clear vision of womenâs freedom and rights, specifically of those who need to receive all the means for âself-determination in family planningâ.
The report recommends that a policy should be adopted with the aim of increasing access to contraceptive methods and of making abortions easier to obtain by improving the conditions in which this takes place.
Two aspects of the text warrant some criticism; firstly, in order to reduce the number of births or to improve the sanitary conditions of these births, it fails to present and does even less to promote any alternative solution to the use of mass contraception, which is seen as a basic right.
Secondly, the report even includes abortion in a number of measures to be funded, to which the EU is asked to contribute, without bothering to find out what the policies in at least some Member States in this field are.
These are the reasons that have led me to vote against the report.
Â Â  .
Almost ten years after the Cairo Conference, this own-initiative report providing an assessment proves to be timely, and the rapporteur emphasises this by calling for the debate to be held on 8 March, coinciding with International Womenâs Day, particularly because the report is concerned mainly with womenâs reproductive health.
The report is even more timely, we believe, for two reasons.
The first is that, having just returned from the 7th Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly, we felt it was particularly significant that the report approved in that forum on poverty-related diseases should have included a recital on terminations of unwanted pregnancies and the need for these to take place in safe conditions.
Secondly, because as a Portuguese citizen, these reports on this issue, chime with a very lively debate currently taking place in Portugal, in which a right-wing majority is obstructing debate and serious and humane decisions, using arguments and means that are truly disgraceful, not to say criminal.
Although this is clearly not the only theme of the report, we must use this explanation of vote to highlight the rapporteurâs statement that âabortion must not be regarded as a family planning methodâ, but also her call for âlegal and medically safe interventions to be possibleâ.
Anyone arguing the other side of the case finds themselves increasingly isolated, and sharing a stand with President Bush and his âMexico City policyâ.
Â Â  . As has become the custom in Parliament, this report, like any other report on reproductive health in the developing countries, must be viewed both in terms of what it says outright and of what it implies.
I am sorry that Parliament has not adopted our proposals, which were intended to clarify the concept of âsexual and reproductive healthâ, our guidelines in this field, or our concerns to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/Aids and to guarantee the safe conditions that women need for pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care, in other words, to protect the health of mothers and babies during and after pregnancy.
Instead, the confusion governing action in this field serves only to arouse suspicion.
I am also sorry to note the desire to commit the EU to promoting abortion on the international stage, demonstrated by the fact that another of our amendments has not been adopted.
Lastly, as I also said in the debate, I must distance myself from a biased report that ignores many of the main aims of the Cairo International Conference: economic growth, town planning, the environment, employment, holding fathers jointly responsible for womenâs sexual health and education as a whole, in addition to education focusing specifically on sexual and reproductive health.
I voted against.
Â Â  Together with the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have voted against the report as a whole.
The report was, however, adopted (by 287 votes in favour, 196 votes against and 13 abstentions).
We want population, aid and development policy to combine the fight for democracy and human rights with respect for each countryâs democratically decided legislation, in this case within the area of family and health policy.
The report does not express any such desire and perception, as exemplified by paragraphÂ 20 with its demand for the âfacilitation of medically safe abortionsâ.
We demanded clarification of this paragraph by means of Amendment NoÂ 20, adding the words âin the countries where this is legalâ.
Amendments NosÂ 21 and 30, which I supported, were also designed to promote greater respect for other countriesâ legislation.
These were nonetheless voted down (in the case of Amendment NoÂ 20 by 281 votes, with 207 votes in favour and 18 abstentions) on the basis of the majority view in Parliament that, in its aid efforts, the EU and the UN should not respect but, on the contrary, counter and actively undermine national legislation in a developing country that wishes to protect the unborn childâs right to life, including in its first weeks.
The EU and the UN thus show a lack of respect for other countriesâ legislation.
This undermines confidence in aid work, creates conflicts and clashes of culture, religion and values and leaves a bad taste of self-styled European superiority in the mouth.
Â Â  .â I should like to take this opportunity to express my agreement with Mrs Junker's original report.
Unfortunately, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has tabled a list of amendments which are not acceptable to my group.
In Europe, it goes without saying that women are entitled to good sexual and reproductive health, and it is totally beyond me why the Group of the European Peopleâs Party does not want people in the developing countries to be given the same.
Moreover, President Bush's conservative administration, by reintroducing the Mexico City policy and continuing to make false accusations that abortion would be the UNFPAâs (The United Nations Population Fund) main objective, does rather complicate the work in the field of sexual and reproductive health care, and this should very definitely be denounced.
Finally, I very much question the Group of the European Peopleâs Partyâs viewpoint that the family deserves all protection.
What about the young girls and women who have been raped in war situations or otherwise?
Or what about the women and girls who are forced, by their environment, and particularly by members of their family, to suffer sexual mutilation?
Should we leave them to their own devices?
My group does not think so, and has therefore voted against all these amendments.
Â Â  . I have voted today against the Junker report which calls on the European Union and its Member states to integrate sexual and reproductive health and rights into their development policies.
The Cairo conference term 'reproductive health' was defined by the World Health Organisation as including the term 'fertility regulation' which includes the term 'interrupting unwanted pregnancy', i.e. abortion.
Since the provision of abortion is not an EU competence and since the principle of subsidiarity is enshrined in the Treaties I have no choice but to reject this report.
I believe that true women-oriented development would support women with safe gynaecological and obstetrical care, maternal care and childcare.
Food, safe water and health care are the prerequisite for education which, alongside sufficient energy supply and fair trade, will foster the long-term sustainable development of the individual and the society.
Â Â  . Two typical extracts from this resolution are enough to show that the aim of simplification and improvement seems to be out of reach.
That is what this third report has achieved.
Recital A says: âwhereas the quality and comprehensibility of Community legislation have a direct impact on the welfare and prosperity of Community citizens and businessesâ, while we read in paragraph 6: âstresses Parliamentâs right to call on the Commission to submit a draft legislative act in connection with the latterâs consideration of self-regulation practicesâ.
It will therefore once again be impossible for us to give our support to such a resolution.
The Commissionâs drafts are still basically bad.
Parliament has been unwilling or unable to tackle the matter.
It has remained a prisoner of the system and Community jargon.
Â Â  . Yes, the quality and comprehensibility of regulations does have a direct impact on the welfare and prosperity of Community businesses.
Of course, simplification of the regulatory environment means we must scrupulously check whether standardisation on a European scale is really necessary.
It goes without saying that the institutions must seek to provide greater clarity of definitions and legal concepts.
That is true, but if, as the rapporteur stresses, the Commission communication is a laudable demonstration of good intentions, just the same can be said of this report.
The simplification of the law is here only a pretext for Parliament, which is in reality only seeking to assert its usual claims.
The opposition to any attempt to use the aim of improving the quality of legislation to make changes to legislative procedures and the balance of powers between the institutions is proof of this.
The same applies to Parliamentâs request to monitor the appropriate choice and use of the legal instrument proposed by the Commission.
Everything is being done as if the intervention of this bulimic and power-hungry Parliament were a guarantee of wisdom or of legislative moderation.
Â Â  . The main aim of this report is to contribute to improving the quality of regulations, an aim which cannot be overemphasised or taken too far.
The rapporteur believes that there is a need to go further than the Interinstitutional Agreement âEuropean Governance: Better lawmakingâ, because the aspirations of the European Parliament have not all been realised.
We must have clear, precise, simple and effective Community regulations and this is the raison d'Ãªtre of this agreement.
Let us not forget, however, that the European Parliament has direct democratic legitimacy, because its Members are directly elected by Europeâs citizens, who are those most affected by Community decisions.
The fever to legislate that we have seen, especially in the last decade, heightens the desire to increase Parliamentâs role in the legislative framework.
For this reason I support the rapporteurâs idea to increase the EPâs involvement in the spheres of co-regulation and self-regulation.
Furthermore, this third report was adopted unanimously in committee.
Nevertheless, this report removes the flexibility and closeness that the interinstitutional agreement seeks to achieve, by assuming the means required to put these measures into practice.
The a priori and a posteriori controls that it seeks to add do not warrant my support and I consequently abstained.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
Â Â  The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I was not recorded as present in yesterdayâs Minutes.
Please excuse me. Can the matter be corrected?
Â Â  That will be corrected.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0107/2004) by MrÂ Andreasen on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the Guantanamo detainees' right to a fair trial (2003/2229(INI)).
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has always given the highest priority to the fight for human rights.
It means a lot to us that individual persons each be guaranteed both their fundamental freedoms and their basic rights.
It is therefore a special honour for me to be rapporteur for this report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the GuantÃ¡namo detaineesâ right to a fair trial.
Everyone in this House agrees that international terrorism must be fought.
There is therefore no intention behind this report to place a question mark over the fight against terrorism.
It has been prepared in order to emphasise that, even in a just cause, there are some quite fundamental rules that have to be obeyed, namely respect for the individual personâs rights, as laid down in the UN Convention on Human Rights and in the Geneva Conventions.
In this case, it is, as has already been pointed out, particularly a question of the right to a fair trial and to treatment in accordance with international law.
Since January 2002, approximately 660 people from 38 different countries have been held prisoner at the American naval base in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba.
We know for certain that 87 of them, and perhaps more, have now been released, but by far the majority of them are still there.
They do not know of what they have been accused, they have still not been brought before a judge, and no one knows whether or, if occasion should arise, when they are to be so.
The detainees are in a legal vacuum.
They are regarded either as ordinary criminals or as war criminals.
As ordinary criminals, they should be safeguarded by American law but, according to a court of appeal in Washington, the naval base does not fall under American jurisdiction since it is not a proper part of the United States.
Another court of appeal in San Francisco has rejected this argument, but this court of appeal is also the court in the United States whose decisions are most often overturned in the Supreme Court, so it is doubtful whether its pronouncement will be of any consequence.
On its own initiative, the American Supreme Court has decided to investigate whether American jurisdiction should also apply to the GuantÃ¡namo naval base, and a response is awaited by no later than June of this year.
Nor, according to the American authorities, are the detainees at the naval base prisoners of war, and they are thus not protected by the Geneva Conventions, either.
The detainees were not part of a regular army when they were taken prisoner.
They had no rank or uniforms and did not openly bear arms.
Instead, the detainees are regarded by the American authorities as illegal combatants who do not come within known legal systems and who can be detained for an unspecified period without being tried or given access to lawyers.
That is the situation of the prisoners.
They do not know what they are charged with, and whether or when they can be given fair trials.
This is a clear violation of human rights and a breach of international conventions, and the report therefore requests the United States immediately to bring the detainees out of the legal vacuum they are in and guarantee them immediate access to legal assistance, which will clarify the legal status of each individual detainee.
It is important to emphasise in this connection that the report applies not only to the European prisoners, but to all the prisoners and to their individual rights as human beings.
The report supports the Council position according to which the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 on the treatment of prisoners of war is to be interpreted in such a way that, in case of doubt, the detainees at the GuantÃ¡namo naval base are to be treated as prisoners of war until and unless it is decided that they do not fulfil the conditions.
Thereafter, they may, if occasion should arise, fall within either the Third Geneva Convention, which applies to legal combatants, thereby affording them status and protection as prisoners of war, or within the Fourth Geneva Convention, which applies to civilians.
In the report, we also request the American Government to confirm that the temporary military commission, set up in November 2001, is complying with all the international laws, just as we request the American authorities to give representatives of the states concerned and of international institutions, as well as family members and independent observers, access to the detainees as visitors.
The EU and the United States have always been allies.
We have always had, have now and shall in the future retain a good relationship with the United States.
The report states that the transatlantic relationship is invaluable and irreplaceable and could be a formidable force for good in the world, but only if basic human rights â such as the right to fair trial and the prohibition on arbitrary detention â are respected and remain the core values shared by the United States and the EU.
We therefore call upon the United States fully to comply with the obligations it has itself assumed in relation to international law and international humanitarian law.
The report recommends to the Council that the issue of the conditions under which the GuantÃ¡namo detainees are being held be addressed at the summit that is to take place between the EU and the United States in June 2004.
We want a common action plan for the fight against terrorism to be devised â an action plan that combines resolve and action against terrorism with full respect for international humanitarian standards.
I should like to thank my fellow MEPs in this House for the many positive contributions I have received from them in connection with this work and for the almost unanimous adoption by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy of the proposal for a recommendation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on his report.
It touches on an issue which is central to our concerns in the European Union, namely the protection of fundamental human rights.
No-one in this Chamber doubts the vital importance of the fight against international terrorism, nor will or should any of us ever forget the horrible tragedy which we saw on our television screens when those planes crashed into the twin towers in New York on 11 September 2001.
But we all understand the essential need to combat this evil in a way which strengthens the cause of freedom and human rights.
The terrorists win if we lose sight of this fact.
The United States, as the honourable Member pointed out, detained several hundred men during and after the fighting in Afghanistan and some have been detained for as long as two years or slightly more.
Some of them are nationals of our Member States but wherever they came from they need to be treated fairly and humanely, as the report says.
We welcomed the release of a number of detainees recently and we look forward to the release of more in the future.
The European Union has been a staunch and committed member of the international coalition against terrorism.
However, as the European Union has repeatedly underlined at both the sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly Third Committee, it is imperative that we and our allies uphold the values of international human rights and humanitarian law when fighting terrorism.
The forthcoming session of the Commission on Human Rights will provide a further opportunity to tackle the issue of human rights and terrorism, and to build on the endorsement by the Third Committee of the proposal that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should examine the protection of human rights when fighting terrorism.
I need to make it clear â and I do so without in any way suggesting a lack of interest in this problem which rightly is of considerable concern to many Members of the House â that the European Commission does not have competence in a number of the areas which are raised in this report.
In the absence of a common position on this question, it is for individual Member States to make diplomatic representation on behalf of their nationals.
Equally, the question of the agenda for the US Summit is a matter for the presidency and for the United States.
However, I am sure that the Council will take note of this report and of the strong feelings of many honourable Members on this subject.
The House is very keen to have answers to a number of questions.
Are these men to be tried and if so for what crimes and under what jurisdiction?
Are some of them to be released to the jurisdiction of their own countries, and if so, will guarantees be sought and obtained for their humane treatment?
There are many more questions which are raised by this case and are touched on in the report.
I want to make this clear: to ask these questions is not to question for one moment our strong partnership with our friends and partners in the United States in the fight against terrorism â terrorism which has a global reach.
But one of our most potent weapons against this evil is our unshakeable commitment to the principle of freedom under the law.
We as Europeans must avoid the danger of raising these issues in a confrontational way which ignores the trauma which the people of the United States have suffered.
That is why I welcome the fact that the honourable Member has raised this subject in his report in such a careful and measured way and I am glad to have had the opportunity to respond to him today.
It is crucial that we always try to keep in mind how the fight against terrorism and the promotion and protection of human rights impact on each other.
We constantly underline that the fight against terrorism must be conditioned on maintaining respect for human rights, not the other way round.
I would even go one step further.
In my judgment, fostering human rights should become an integral part of the fight against terrorism.
Only then can we hope to defuse the social tensions on which terrorism feeds.
Once again I would like to congratulate the honourable Member on his report.
It raises issues of considerable importance.
It raises the sort of issues which I have had to tackle before in other circumstances, for example in reorganising the police and security services in Northern Ireland and basing that reorganisation on the fundamental proposition that the forces of law and order are there to protect and maintain human rights and should have no truck with the undermining of human rights.
We all stand four-square in the fight against the evil of terrorism and the lethal combination of terrorism and technology.
But we also, I believe, stand four-square in our belief that the best way of fighting terrorism is to retain a proper respect for human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, the General Secretary of the American National Council of Churches has recently branded the denial of human rights at Guantanamo Bay as a sin against God.
I do not take a religious perspective, but it is clear that it is not only Europeans who feel strongly that the situation at Guantanamo Bay offends against our sense of justice.
One of the senior justices in the United Kingdom, Lord Steyn, branded the proposed military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay as a stain on US justice and the term 'kangaroo court' springs to mind.
The British Court of Appeal has branded the detention of prisoners there as a legal black hole.
The Bush administration has argued that the Geneva Conventions are obsolete when it comes to dealing with terrorists and has chosen to apply neither these conventional laws of war nor the criminal law in which human rights norms should apply, that is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the US Constitution.
It has tried to straddle both by inventing a new, residual category of 'unlawful combatant' in the potentially unlimited war on terror, which is transformed from a metaphorical to a literal term.
However, that status is unknown in international law.
Sadly, the denial of the prisoners' right to access to normal civil courts and the protection of the US Constitution has been backed by the US courts on the grounds that Guantanamo Bay â even though the US is in actual control of the base â is not sovereign US territory.
But it is welcome that the Supreme Court has now said it would decide on whether the US courts have jurisdiction.
I would end by saying that I regret the absence of the Council in this debate since, as Commissioner Patten has pointed out, the Commission does not have jurisdiction, and the failure of the Council to adopt a common position and a strategy to implement the upholding of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay is a sad omission.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, this is an important report about an important matter, on which I am happy to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I value the way in which the rapporteur has tackled the topic.
It is positive that he, in line with my group's approach, has strengthened the foundation of this report.
I should like to share with him my appreciation for the good working relationship.
This topic touches the very heart and foundation of our constitutional state.
More than two years after the United States transported some 660 foreign detainees to Guantanamo Bay in the framework of the fight against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, there is, unfortunately, still uncertainty: uncertainty about the charge, uncertainty about the duration of the detention, uncertainty about the possible judicial process, uncertainty about legal aid and uncertainty about contacts with the country of origin.
In short, there is a legal void.
The American Supreme Court is now looking into the question whether the American courts are competent to assess the legal status of the detainees.
Although the great effect that terrorism has had on our American ally in the wake of the dreadful attacks of 11Â September speaks for itself, we are now a few years further down the line and the prisoners on the Cuban base have still not had access to the courts.
This situation cannot, and should not, be sustained.
Precisely because the transatlantic dialogue is so meaningful and irreplaceable, it is important to keep the lines of communication with our American friends open.
Allies are allowed to make urgent appeals to each other.
I appreciate that the Convention of Geneva of 1949 is no longer fully adequate to accommodate new threats such as terrorism.
It is important that international law should develop in such a way that a legal basis is in place for addressing new security issues.
Even the worst terrorist is entitled to a fair trial.
That is a basic principle underpinned by international law.
I would mention by way of example both the principle and the need to properly safeguard the administration of justice, as well as, among others, such important treaties as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention of Geneva, to which the rapporteur has already made reference.
All those treaties involve the task of guaranteeing a humane treatment of prisoners and the right to a fair trial.
In the final analysis, this is about human dignity; every person counts.
I gladly subscribe to what the rapporteur has raised in this respect.
Finally, I urge the Council to continue to bring the case of the Guantanamo detainees to the attention of the authorities of the United States.
This case is deserving of this, and more.
Â Â  Mr President, Guantanamo Bay should send a message to all citizens who are concerned about human rights in the world.
In this American concentration camp on Cuban territory, international law and American law have been outlawed to almost universal indifference.
The whole world can see this place where there is no law, this legal black hole as Amnesty International calls it, but does nothing.
Individual liberties won with great difficulty over hundreds of years have met their death on the beach at Guantanamo Bay.
As the victim of the 11 September attacks, the United States was perfectly within its rights to arrest, charge and try everyone presumed to have been involved in those attacks.
But there was absolutely no need to act unlawfully, or to lock the 660 detainees in animal cages that are floodlit day and night.
The days of the lawmen of the Wild West are over.
Nowadays, no one should be able to set themselves up at one and the same time as accuser, defender, judge and executioner â you might as well say torturer.
Such, however, is the macabre scenario adopted by President Bush for his âoffshoreâ justice in Guantanamo Bay.
With the allied governments wallowing in cowardly silence, it was time for the European Parliament to react in a credible and audible manner.
MrÂ Andreasenâs report on the Guantanamo detaineesâ right to a fair trial therefore comes at just the right moment and I congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group.
The resolution on which we shall be voting tomorrow is addressed to the Council and calls on it to adopt a common position on this serious violation of the fundamental principles of law.
As Commissioner Patten very rightly pointed out, such a common position is very sorely lacking.
But that call will doubtless remain a dead letter so long as the absurd method of unanimous voting continues, allowing Europeâs voice on foreign policy and human rights to be silenced by just one dissenting vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate Great Britain which will today welcome home five of the British citizens imprisoned at the naval base in GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
According to the Swedish media, they will be arrested and interrogated when they land in Great Britain this evening.
A further four Britons still in GuantÃ¡namo Bay will not be released, at least not yet.
The Swedish detainee, Mehdi Ghezali, is also still there, with no immediate prospect of being released.
That is how the situation has looked for more than two years.
Where the Swedish citizen is concerned, the Swedish Government indicated at the beginning that the issue should be taken up with colleagues in the Council of the European Union.
Here we are today, more than two years later, and this is as far as we have got.
Like so many of these detainees, Mehdi Ghezali is young.
The people concerned are young, and quite a few of them can even be regarded as children.
Mehdi Ghezaliâs family has heard nothing at all from him for 13 months.
The officials from Swedenâs Ministry of Foreign Affairs who have been able to visit Mehdi Ghezali are not allowed to tell his family how he is.
His lawyer has not been able to visit him, either.
Commissioner Patten said that we must have a good relationship with the United States.
Yes, we must have a good relationship with the United States, but we must also have good relationships with all other nations.
I think that the old saying, âIt takes two to tangoâ is apposite in this case.
The United Statesâs conduct on this issue does not, unfortunately, encourage much in the way of confidence.
Of course we remember 11 September, but I also remember the pictures that, in spite of everything, have come out of the base at GuantÃ¡namo Bay, showing young people sitting handcuffed in cages.
We are committed to human rights.
We cannot just have debates at regular intervals about them.
They must also mean something, and I therefore wish genuinely to thank MrÂ Andreasen for a very good report.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
This is a very important initiative and this is an opportune time for it to be brought forward.
The existence of internment-without-trial camps in Guantanamo Bay has to unacceptable to anyone in a civilised society.
Any prisoners captured during the invasion of Afghanistan should have been treated according to international law and, at the very least, should have been classified as prisoners of war.
They have the right to a fair trial.
They should also have the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, have access to legal representation and have the right either to be charged or released.
The Irish presidency should be doing everything in its power to ensure that these people are not denied their basic human rights for a minute longer.
I agree with what Mrs Ludford said concerning the failure of the Irish presidency to be here today, which is an appalling message to send out to the European Community and indeed to the international community.
As Commissioner Patten said, it is up to the Council to raise this matter with the United States, and the EU Council has failed abysmally to do so on any occasion.
I would also question why it is that the Irish presidency is not here today.
Is it because that presidency is afraid of offending the United States by saying something at that country would take offence?
The Irish presidency is also letting down the Irish public, which views this matter as an absolute scandal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I find it strange that the European Parliament should be so busy with these efforts on behalf of enemies of democracy.
The detainees are not a bunch of scouts that have got lost on an outing.
All the evidence suggests that the detainees have been treated humanely.
Pictures from the naval base show cells considerably better than those in many of the EU countriesâ prisons.
It is only a few of the EU Member States that are actively participating militarily in the fight against the reactionary forces that would use terrorism to change the direction in which the world is moving.
That is a fight we leave to the United States and its true allies.
To listen to some of those with a professional hatred of the United States, one would imagine that, in their view, the Taliban and al-Qaâida are a species of freedom fighter who wish to help poor and oppressed peoples.
They are the opposite.
The terrorists must be given the kind of fright that will deter them from continuing with their criminal acts.
Only by crushing their networks can freedom and democracy be developed in the world.
The detainees at the GuantÃ¡namo naval base are not soldiers in an organised army.
They are not an underground movement in an occupied country.
They are terrorists who fanatically oppose the human rights that some in this House now believe they should enjoy.
Some of the prisoners have acquired citizenship of EU countries.
When, subsequently, they take part, with or without visible weapons, in an armed struggle in which some of our soldiers are killed, then they are traitors and must be treated as such.
I am certain that there are EU countries which would not have shown the United Statesâs forbearance, but would have shot a whole lot of them on the spot.
It is unfitting that we, who are not waging war in Afghanistan and who have not ourselves been exposed to genuine terrorist attacks in our countries, should think we should tell the United States what to do.
I wish to thank Commissioner Patten for making it clear that the Commission has no competence in this area and add that the Council has no such competence either.
I wish to recommend to Parliament that it vote against the report.
Â Â  Mr President, September 11, the attacks on the twin towers in New York, opened up a new chapter in the concept of war â namely, an asymmetric, large-scale attack by a well-organised and well-resourced, fanatic, international, Islamist grouping affiliated to al-Qa'ida, with no respect for the traditional rules and conduct of war as we know them and very difficult to formally classify under the Third and Fourth Geneva Protocols of 1949.
Therefore, all the demands made by this resolution to treat the detainees either as innocent bystanders caught up in American crossfire in Afghanistan or common-law criminals subject to due process are legally not sound, and not necessarily desirable either â particularly if we are to protect Europe's security and people from further attacks.
Also, the state's first duty is always to protect its innocent citizens from future attack from any such terrorist groups.
The US would not waste valuable public resources detaining those who pose no security risk.
Indeed, after exhaustive enquiries, many have been returned home, including three juveniles â one who in an interview to the British press testified to the humanity of his captors and was grateful for formal English-language instruction on the base.
The rest â including the EU citizens involved â are undoubtedly dangerous or a source of ongoing useful intelligence and should either be tried for war crimes, if appropriate, at standards compatible with international norms or held in humane conditions as illegal combatants for the duration of the war, with Red Cross and consular access, until Mr Osama bin Laden is captured and formally surrenders his terrorist network and their declared war on the West.
I do not accept that habeas corpus applies in emergency situations like times of war or national emergencies, so its inclusion is totally inappropriate.
No prisoners of war during the Second World War were allowed to have a fair trial â everyone knows that they were detained for the duration of war.
Furthermore, historically, citizens of any country â and the UK in particular â who in times of war went abroad and fought against their own armed forces or their allies were potentially indictable for treason, historically a capital offence and even today a very serious offence.
Therefore, the Liberal motion before us today will not be supported by me, as its primary purpose is to bash the United States of American in its global war on terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall not respond immediately to Mr Tannock, but will begin by stating dispassionately that the notion of human rights, including the right to a fair trial, is the highest priority for all the parliamentary groups.
Terrorism and terrorist groups have won when the rule of law is set aside.
Mr Camre, the rule of law is not an enemy, but the basis of a civilised society.
When you discard it, you discard your civilised rights.
One has to look at the charges brought against these individuals.
If charges had been made, then they would have the right and the opportunity to defend themselves, but no charges have been made.
Three of my constituents are amongst those about to be released.
What of their families?
What of their concerns?
What of their human rights?
I start, as I believe everyone in this House starts, from the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty.
The two previous speakers would seem to accept the opposite.
The calls made in this House are not anti-American.
Indeed, we have asked the United States to uphold the rights of the free world which are at the heart of its own constitution.
Here we come to the crux of the matter: the argument that somehow these people are outside US national jurisdiction.
They are not, and it was on this basis that the Supreme Court petitioners called for the releases of detainees that we have seen recently.
They should be subject either to US law or to the rule of international law: legal representation, a fair trial and the right of appeal.
It is in exceptional circumstances that the unexceptional, normal and rational rule of law is most needed.
Mr Camre, I cannot agree with you.
You have denounced these people and even you will not give them a fair trial.
We must never forget that 11 September altered the American psyche forever.
Hence the actions that have been taken.
This House has therefore chosen a noble route: not to condemn, nor to cast out those who have been detained â perhaps in horrific circumstances â but to ask quite simply that the rule of national or international law be upheld and fully respected.
I, the PSE Group, the ELDR Group and other Groups will uphold those principles.
It is a sad day when all the Members of this House cannot do the same.
Â Â  â Mr President, Guantanamo is not war, but a return to tyranny by a sovereign ruler, as now symbolised by the logic of a permanent state of emergency championed by the worldâs only hegemonic superpower.
The pressure being put on the principle of the rule of law this way may gradually crush the whole legal tradition we have had so much difficulty achieving.
This is a historic challenge.
Fortunately, regarding the cases of Mounir El-Motassadeq and Abdelghani Mzoud, the courts in both the United States of America and just recently in Germany have stood up for the most fundamental human rights principles of all, one of which is the right to a fair trial.
This illegal confinement is not in Americaâs interests, but only makes the legitimate fight against terrorism more difficult.
That can only succeed through cooperation and lawful courses of action, and it is actually giving into terrorism to ignore them.
It is a dangerous signal in every respect.
Â Â  Mr President, it is absolutely unacceptable that more than 600Â people, including children, have been held for two years in Guantanamo Bay without charge or trial, in circumstances which no democratic state could legitimately stand over.
It is a recipe for feeding hatred, not for coming to terms with the awfulness of terrorism.
This is a debate about defending democracy and the rule of law, and an appeal to the good sense and the democratic instincts of the American people in circumstances where good sense and democratic instincts are all important.
It is right and proper to condemn and continue to condemn the atrocity of 11Â September 2001 and all other atrocities engineered by terrorists, whether in the United States or in Europe, in Spain, Ireland or indeed in Israel or the Palestinian territories.
Terrorism deliberately sets out to destroy freedom: its purpose is to destroy freedom.
If we attempt to undermine the terrorists by using means which themselves destroy freedom, we undermine the very foundations of our own society.
If we go down the route of denying basic human rights and basic democratic rights to those we suspect of terror, then we are giving them a victory and we are shaping a society which in the long run will not be in the best interests of the people of this world who want to live in a sustainable peace.
I would appeal to the Irish presidency to put this matter on the agenda of the EU-US summit in June this year.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the interesting things in the discussion on Guantanamo Bay concerns language, not least the new definitions of war that we begin to hear, which have no legal basis in any international jurisdiction.
Mention has already been made of the UK releases today, and of course I welcome that development, but I am also interested in who is defending the interests of the remaining detainees, whose governments may not have a special relationship with the United States.
I welcome this report because I think it is very important to keep the whole issue within the international arena.
As others have said, we have seen a deliberately created legal limbo here, which has provided a green light for other regimes to act in similar ways now, not least China, Yemen, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia and other well-known democracies, with their policy of internment of so-called fundamentalists.
We have seen the United Kingdom derogate from Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights in order to legitimise the internment in Belmarsh of UK residents.
It is important to respect the rule of international humanitarian law, even when it is inconvenient for governments.
Â Â  Mr President, I was surprised to hear a few minutes ago that Guantanamo Bay was a centre for English language teaching.
That is quite extraordinary because the holding of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay runs contrary to human rights.
The prisoners have no access to an independent lawyer, and we do not know who exactly is being held or what precise charges are being brought against them.
Under such conditions, there is reason to be concerned about the detaineesâ mental health.
Without the prior assistance of an independent lawyer, we can say that there is an obvious risk of negotiation to reach an agreement and doing so in order to get the charges reduced.
If that is the case, detainees will be able to choose to plead guilty, even if they are not, in order to escape the death penalty.
It is clear that President Bush and the US leadership want show trials with confessions because it is presidential election year.
The European Parliamentâs position must therefore be intransigent against terrorism, but also intransigent on respect for international law.
It is unacceptable to sentence someone before a verdict has been reached.
That is what is happening here, sometimes even in this Chamber.
We must all therefore denounce this legal black hole in which the detainees find themselves.
We can all remember the horror of what happened, but we do not want terrorism to win and we must demand fair treatment for all and show that we defend values that respect the law.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is the best means we all have of combating barbarity.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0112/2004) by MrÂ Lagendijk on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of European Partnerships in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process (COM(2003)684 â C5-0574/2003 â 2003/0267(CNS)).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank MrÂ Lagendijk very sincerely for drafting the European Parliament legislative resolution on the Commission's proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of European Partnerships in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process.
The amendments proposed address some of the key points in our relations with the Western Balkan countries.
We have noted all the proposals and carefully considered them.
The Commission and the Council need Parliamentâs full support and commitment in their efforts to assist these countries with their reforms and in bringing them closer to the European Union.
Let me briefly describe the background to this proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of European Partnerships, which goes back to the European Council held in Thessaloniki in June 2003, at which the Heads of State and Government reiterated their determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries.
The Stabilisation and Association Process has now been strengthened and supplemented by several elements that have been implemented in the course of the ongoing enlargement process.
The introduction of European Partnerships is one of the most important proposals to this end.
The Commission was requested to present the first European Partnerships for approval at the end of this month, together with the next Annual Reports on the Stabilisation and Association Process.
Like the Accession Partnerships for candidate countries, the European Partnerships establish short- and medium-term priorities that those countries are required to comply with in order to move closer to the European Union.
They will be adapted to the countriesâ specific needs and respective stages of preparation, and to the specificities of the Stabilisation and Association process, and will also take account of regional cooperation.
In accordance with progress achieved, the European Partnerships will increasingly be steered towards adoption of the .
Progress will be monitored by the Commission and assessed in the annual reports.
The texts of the individual European Partnerships will be transmitted to the European Parliament, and, exactly as in the case of the Accession Partnerships, the European Parliament will be kept appropriately informed about the progress made by the countries concerned.
The Commission has noted the rapporteur's comments about financial assistance for countries in this region.
I would like to stress once again that the proposal does not have any financial implications.
The priorities of the European Partnership will continue to form the basis of the programme of assistance, which will be provided under the CARDS programme.
I should, however, emphasise that the Partnerships have their own priorities, the achievement of which has no financial implications whatsoever, such as the acceptance of legislative provisions.
I fully understand Parliamentâs concerns about the conditionality of Community assistance.
Respect for the principles of democracy and constitutionality, and for human rights, minority rights and fundamental freedoms are a prerequisite for the granting of Community assistance.
If these general conditions are not met, the Council can decide to suspend financial assistance.
The Commission has agreed to make specific reference to this point in draft Council decisions on the individual partnership priorities.
The priorities of the European Partnerships are just as much EU priorities as the priorities for Accession Partnerships were for the accession countries.
Of course, the governments of the countries concerned will be informally consulted on the European Partnership.
Their agreement will not come as a surprise.
The Commission agrees with Parliament's proposal that a passage on the consultation of the national governments should be added to the regulation.
In the context of the mechanisms established under the Stabilisation and Association Process for this purpose, we have regular contacts with these countries.
We assume that these countries are working out plans setting out a time frame for compliance with the requirements for further integration with the European Union.
This work is intended to give them an increased sense of responsibility and a better understanding of the process.
Implementing the priorities of the European Partnerships requires commitment, political will and the provision of appropriate funding.
The partnerships will provide a solid basis for steering the reform efforts in the Western Balkan countries to moving closer to the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, before I discuss the Commission proposal, I should like to ask whether we ought to attach any political significance to the fact that Mr Patten has left the Chamber and has been replaced by Mr Verheugen, because as far as I know, Mr Verheugen is still responsible for candidate Member States and acceding countries.
Is this an indication from the Commission that the Western Balkan countries, although, officially, they are not yet among candidate Member States, have now suddenly been included among their number?
Let there be no misunderstanding: I would welcome it.
It is, in any case, striking.
As far as the proposals themselves are concerned, the Commissioner has already referred to their source, namely last year's Thessaloniki Summit.
At that summit, the European Council, under considerable pressure from the Greek Presidency, wanted to make a gesture towards the Western Balkan countries, the most important political message being that they have very definitely turned into the road to Europe and that the EU wants to help them on that path by offering them an additional instrument in the form of European Partnerships.
The reason for this initiative was that there is no doubt, including in this House, that those countries will be members one day.
The question is only when and under what conditions.
However, when I read the Commission proposal implementing the fine decision of Thessalonica, I am, quite honestly, very much starting to doubt whether that decision was such a wise one.
What is â and that is at the same time the central question in my report â the added value of introducing a new instrument, namely the European Partnerships, at this present time?
We in the European Union â you know this better than we do â are involved in an extremely complicated process of concluding Stabilisation and Association Agreements with all the countries of the region, or at least, that is the goal towards which we are working.
We managed to do this with Croatia and Macedonia, and we are still negotiating with the three other countries.
This process is jerking along.
It is not easy.
There are still major problems in three of the five countries, and there is still a great deal of work left to be done.
Now all of a sudden, in the middle of that process, along comes a new instrument, the European Partnerships.
These do not follow the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, but cut right across them.
Commission, I really have to say that I fail to grasp the meaning of this; I think that the Commission, like Parliament, is bound by the Council's brief, although it, like we, cannot say so out loud.
I fear that the new instrument that has been created is one that nobody needs and for which nobody is waiting.
It creates uncertainty in the region and I think that we have to be very careful not to hand those countries an empty shell, while we ourselves are unsure as to what we want from this initiative.
Here, politics is being played with symbols, and we have to tread very carefully indeed.
If we persevere with this initiative after all, I should like to make two observations.
First of all the finances which are normally speaking part and parcel of partnerships such as these â suffice to look at the great example of these European Partnerships â namely the partnerships that have preceded the status of candidate Member State.
If we create a new instrument after all, why do we not set aside some new money at the same time?
Your colleague, Commissioner Patten, has repeatedly told this House that, as far as he is concerned, it is no trouble to spend the money that he now has at his disposal, and that he would like to receive more money from Parliament in order to help those countries.
That is why I can accept the concept of European Partnerships, provided that it is clear how much money we are willing to contribute.
If no additional funds are being set aside for this than are already available, then the whole initiative is nothing but an empty shell.
What is more important is the conditions.
The new instruments should not impose yet another set of new conditions.
We have subjected EU assistance to those countries to very strict conditions as it is: the return home of refugees, the fight against corruption and cooperation with the Tribunal in The Hague.
I urge you to leave it at that.
Whilst I am pleased that the Commission has stated in this context that the existing conditions will not be changed, this should be made sufficiently clear.
The new instruments should not involve any new conditions.
I am, however, very much in favour of the European Union adhering to the existing conditions to the letter, because now and again, I have noticed in the Council a tendency to go over these lightly and not to adhere to the criteria that were established in the past.
This is, however, necessary.
The root-and-branch approach has to be adopted, because the problems in that region are extensive and if we create the impression that the countries in question will automatically become members at some point, things will go wrong.
Let it be clear: I am in favour of carrying on, of giving the reforms and reformers my warm support.
The European Union has no choice but to back those countries and the pioneers who carry out reforms.
If we need new instruments to achieve this, so be it, but if we can make a good deal of progress with the present instruments, whilst the new ones only create uncertainty, I will reject the new ones.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our external policy in relation to the Balkans is an inevitable consequence of the enormous mistakes we made at the beginning of the 1990s; at that time we did not have a common policy for this region, but today we do.
The Stability Pact is the right answer to the region's problems.
The negotiation of the Stabilisation and Association Process, together with financial assistance such as the CARDS programme and the annual progress review, assists progress towards the frequently mentioned objective of the ultimate accession of these countries to the European Union.
So this is the right way to go.
What then is this new clichÃ© about âEuropean Partnershipâ?
The Stabilisation and Association Agreements are the launch pad for a partnership and if all the criteria are met, the application for membership is the next step.
Is there any room for a new catchword without any new financial backing?
This proposal from the Council is meaningless, and the Commission knows that, but it cannot say that in so many words.
We, on the other hand, can say what we think!
Commissioner, the Commission and the Council could demonstrate how serious they are about this much-vaunted partnership by taking Croatia as an example.
Croatia has been on the right path for years.
Cooperation is good in all areas.
The extent of cooperation with The Hague is also positive.
Two more generals have just been sent to The Hague.
We should not be setting ever-higher standards just because one general with a French passport is still at large and is nowhere to be found.
We should remember what has been achieved already.
This positive view of Croatia would give a signal and add impetus to compliance with the European Union's criteria throughout the region for which European Partnerships are envisaged â and I know what I am talking about.
Our common foreign policy in South Eastern Europe is currently being put to the test, and a rigorous one at that.
The proposal for a European Partnership without any substantial added value as compared with the Stabilisation and Association Process and without any additional financial assistance will not, I regret to say, enhance our credibility.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything that MrÂ Lagendijk and MrsÂ Pack have said actually militates against the adoption of the Lagendijk report.
I personally will not be voting for it; not because I think that MrÂ Lagendijk's report is a bad one, but what sort of a parliament is it that attacks the Council and the Commission over their proposals and then says, fine, but because we are a parliament we will vote for them?
I, for one, will not be voting in favour, and I say that because I believe that, although the arguments put forward by MrsÂ Pack and MrÂ Lagendijk are valid, an instrument has been dreamt up here without any real foundations.
I can well imagine that something could be made of the European Partnerships, but clear objectives and criteria need to be set.
However, the present proposal at least contains nothing of the kind.
I hope that Commissioner Verheugen will push for that, as I am assuming that he will play a key role in the new Commission â he certainly deserves to â and I assume that he will also have a corresponding influence in ensuring that the European Partnerships become an instrument based on clear criteria.
My recommendation, which was not accepted by the committee, was that the Stabilisation and Association Agreements should be successfully implemented over a period of years.
Successfully, mind you, not just any old how!
My visit to Kosovo as part of the delegation led by MrsÂ Pack made a lasting impression on me.
That impression is that neither the Albanian side nor the Serbian side have come under enough pressure to do what they ought to do â to work together for the future of Kosovo.
That impression also applies to several other countries.
But Croatia, both under the previous administration and under the present government, is an exception to that, because they have grasped what is at stake and also wish to move forward accordingly.
The Commission and we in this House bear a certain part of the blame for this situation, and we should endeavour to ensure that Europe's voice is heard more clearly and distinctly.
Our meeting with President Rugova was symbolic of this.
I have a high regard for him and have known him for a long time, although not so well as MrsÂ Pack does, but I have a very good relationship with him.
But when we visited his official residence â and I know that we are only talking about Kosovo and not yet an independent state â Albanian, Kosovan and American flags were flying, but not a European flag, and nobody seemed to think anything of it.
What does that say about Europe's voice, I wonder?
We will be taking him a European flag in the hope that it will find a place at his residence.
He is not the only one, however, to whom this applies, and this is in no way intended to be a personal criticism.
I believe that just as Europe is not represented amongst the flags flying at his residence, Europe's views are unrepresented or at least underrepresented in many parts of the Balkans.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament must work together to make our voice more widely heard.
Commissioner Verheugen, if we are debating this in a year's time and you can convince me that the European Partnership has achieved this much, or has at least made progress in that direction, then I will support the Lagendijk report retrospectively, but I shall not be voting for it tomorrow.
Â Â  I ask the Members of this Parliament not to draw any particular conclusions from the fact that I am representing Commissioner Patten here today, but it has worked out rather well, as I am perhaps in a better position than he is to respond to your comments.
What, then, is at issue here?
The issue is that the Thessaloniki Council asked whether we could not draw a few conclusions from the successful progress of the enlargement process with a view to bringing the countries of the Western Balkans closer to the European Union more effectively.
The question was a simple one: are there lessons that we have learnt, are there instruments that have been successful in that process, and which we could apply here as well, subject to any necessary adjustments?
The answer to it is âyesâ.
In the case of the accession countries we had the âEurope Agreementsâ as a legal basis.
These correspond to the Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the Western Balkan countries.
We developed the âAccession Partnershipsâ as an instrument for implementing those Europe Agreements, and I will tell you in a moment why that was a good thing.
The corresponding instrument in the Stabilisation and Association Process will be the European Partnerships, because we could not very well talk about âAccession Partnershipsâ.
The great advantage of this instrument is that it is very flexible, very exact, easy to monitor, and that progress can be assessed very precisely.
It is the Commission's intention to prepare these partnerships following exactly the same pattern as for the Accession Partnerships.
That involves describing in precise terms what is to happen in the first year, as a short-term priority in other words, in all areas â political governance, economic governance, adoption of the â and then medium-term priorities, for which we will give ourselves two or three years, and lastly the long-term priorities.
The big advantage of all this is that it can be checked and fine-tuned at any time, and that the other instruments at our disposal can then be adjusted to meet the objectives of these partnerships, for example the technical assistance instrument that we intend to use in future.
But I also have in mind the instruments already at our disposal and all the other instruments available.
I can tell you from my own experience of the enlargement process that this instrument will be helpful, that it is a very manageable instrument, and one with which we had very good experience during enlargement.
I therefore urge you to at least give this instrument a chance.
I would like to ask my friend MrÂ Swoboda to perhaps give the instrument two chances, and in a year's time we will be very happy to carry out a joint assessment of whether or not it has achieved anything.
I am quite convinced, though, that it is an instrument that will help the Western Balkan countries, which will be more manageable for them, and which will make the direction in which the whole process should proceed clearer and more credible.
For that reason I can indeed give this instrument my wholehearted support.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen has won me over.
I will be voting in favour.
I trust him to do the right thing, and hope that he will do so.
Â Â  I did suspect this was not going to be a point of order.
As I know you, it does not matter; today is one of my good days.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I rejoice that we are now at the start of the final stage of a short but intensive process.
We are able to complete the programme and thereby guarantee that young people and youth organisations will be able to implement their programmes.
This has been a very intensive period and we have again been under pressure of time.
I would like that to be different for new programmes in the future, so that we have a bit more time available for more precise elucidation of the individual positions and more opportunities for discussion.
What this is primarily about is supporting youth groups, something that must be of particular concern to us if we want to build up confidence in Europe or in the European Union, for then it is young people who best understand Europe and who are least likely to have problems when it comes to abandoning their prejudices.
Because that has to be encouraged, they also have to be got more involved in the European process.
There are various ways in which this can be done: one central office is the Youth Forum, which maintains contacts in the various countries and does many difficult, necessary and useful things alongside young people, enabling them to live in democratic association within Europe and beyond it.
Today we are debating three reports; although this is a joint debate, they cannot all be considered in the same way, as their substance has to do with different responsibilities, which need to be taken into account appropriately.
It has been proposed that the action programmes be harmonised as regards the long-fought-for share of cofinance, the principle of degressivity, and their duration.
It will, no doubt, be very difficult in practical terms to have them running until 2008.
We have had lengthy talks about the 20% equal share in cofinance, which will not quite work, as several organisations, especially in the educational sphere, get such minimal support that further cutbacks would mean that support would effectively lapse.
For youth organisations, then, the figure 20% is just about acceptable, as finding sponsors is a recurrent problem.
Businesses are unable to devote themselves to young people on top of the economic situation.
Organisations in many other areas of activity find it significantly easier to find sponsors than do those dealing with young people, which is why the latter need our particular support.
I would also like degressivity, according to which two and a half per cent of the previous yearâs grant is to be retained from the third year onwards, to benefit the groups and youth organisations that have not been covered by that date.
This will become particularly important in the aftermath of enlargement.
After 1 May, there will be more young people for us to reach.
We have to invest more and we have to give them strong support.
Those youth organisations whose aim is to advance international dialogue among young people and to present information on relevant topics to as large a young public as possible are also conduits for the European Unionâs views.
What matters is not just promoting young peopleâs interests, but also communicating material that relates to what they are interested in.
Whilst we have to take their interests into account, they also themselves have to make their own contribution and thereby further reflect the whole range of European policy to their fullest extent.
The future of the European Union is in the hands of young people, and we should not forget that.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, todayâs debate on these three much-needed programmes finds us seeking a common legal base for the areas of culture, education and youth.
We have had a concertation procedure â I am grateful for the very fine support we got from the Committee on Budgets in that â and now we have some fairly substantial financial resources at our disposal.
We could, of course, do with more â these are, after all, areas in which we are dealing with the public, and in particular with young people â but we can be satisfied with what we have.
As far as my own area is concerned, I can tell you that EURÂ 77 million for the action programme for educational institutions is not a trifling amount, but, again, we could do with more.
Within all three of these areas there are institutions and associations that are, putting it in the broadest possible terms, educational and cultural ambassadors for Europe and which promote awareness of Europeâs common cultural heritage.
For years, often with the help of this House, all these organisations have been doing their work.
Without them, Europeâs soul would atrophy even more than it is apparently slowly doing now.
I am especially glad that Mrs Iivari has been able to gain acceptance for the idea that cultural institutions should be able to retain their subsidies, at least for a transitional period of two years.
Among other things, this is an acknowledgement of these organisationsâ work.
They can then prepare themselves for the applications they will have to make in response to future invitations to tender.
It is at this point that I would like to stress that we MEPs are of course closer to the public than are those who sit in the Commission in Brussels, and so it is a fact that we are more aware of what the public needs.
There are three points I would now like to make.
As for the first, I would like to take this opportunity to shed more light on the Financial Regulation.
Under no circumstances must the lawyersâ mania for regulation be allowed to obstruct our striving for greater transparency and efficiency in our political work on the ground, and I know that the Commission suffers from it just as much as Parliament.
The Council, having absolutely no interest in such things, does not, but the problem is that we have the impossible task of defending these things on the ground.
Let me just say, with reference to this, that this Financial Regulation and the Commission have now â to take just one example â wrecked the network of Europe Houses that has existed for 50 years.
There is a place for that in this debate.
I also want to point out that in respect of neither 2003 nor 2004 has the Commission been able to pay to this network the sums of money that this House allocated to it.
It is refusing to do so.
It is not Mrs Reding who is to be blamed for this, but others; the point simply has to be made that it is the Commissionâs fault.
It may be that the Financial Regulation that we now have was necessary. The only thing is that it cannot stay the way it is.
We have to recognise that a rigorous, not to say fundamentalist, interpretation of this Financial Regulation gives rise to a bureaucracy that distances the public even further from the EU.
How are members of the public meant to submit applications if they have to get a consultant to do it for them?
It is scarcely credible that all these things should have become so complicated.
We must not allow ourselves to be taken hostage by a sort of budgetary imperialism.
We should make a real attempt at changing something, and, in the new parliamentary term, join with the Committee on Budgets in finding a new approach.
We are neither an assembly of managers nor a board of directors seeking the maximum in bureaucratic efficiency.
Rather than being either of those things, we are a political assembly, and our principal task is to respond to the European publicâs desires and needs.
It is for that reason that I believe we have to make it our business to ensure that money is spent properly, but we must not allow ourselves to be tied into a corset that nobody will find it easy to get out of.
My second point is that we expect more from the soul of Europe, and so future budgets need to take more account of education and culture.
The third, Commissioner, has to do with the new generation of educational and cultural programmes that you want to speak about today.
My expectation of this new generation of programmes is that they should include manageable instruments, by which I mean action at Community level that is capable of being practically implemented, equipped with operational and financial resources in line with what the public want.
Everything we do must focus on the public, and let me once again stress that they must not be used as a justification for bureaucratic machinery.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, it comes as a relief that the subject of our debate is the common position with regard to financing European cultural organisations and networks.
A decision on the issue must really be taken now, so that the organisations that are entitled to funding receive their grants starting this year.
I wish to sincerely thank all those whose cooperation in conciliation led to our success at the end of last year.
Terence Wynn, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and many others helped enormously.
My own collaboration with the Commission and the Council has gone well at the various stages of the process.
The Commission proposal for an action programme to promote bodies active in the field of culture became necessary when we switched to an activity-based budget.
The cultural organisations, which were formerly financed out of Budget Line A signifying administrative expenditure, need a legal basis for their funding to continue.
