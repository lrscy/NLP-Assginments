Furthermore, this team seems particularly mediocre, starting with yourself, MrÂ Barroso, who owe your election to your great skill in playing the waiting game.
Furthermore, the composition of your Commission reflects a true deference to the United States, since the more countries have followed the United States, particularly in relation to the Iraq crisis, the better represented they are.
In addition to this we have the choice of certain surprising characters: a Commissioner with very close links to multinational interests who is responsible for competition; an Ayatollah of the WTO and free trade who is responsible for commercial relations. It seems to me that Mr Buttiglione is the only one who can rise above the general mediocrity and that begs the question of what he will achieve amongst all these anti-Christians.
Finally, if there were to be one single reason, it would be this, the most simple reason: in our opinion, Europe would be much better if there were no Commission at all.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate at least shows that the European Parliament is becoming more political and has more political power than is apparent from the Treaties.
This is a further sign that, in terms of the way Europe works in practice, Parliament is often ahead of constitutional developments and it takes time for the Treaties to catch up.
That is why, MrÂ Barroso, the CDU-CSU Group â and I mean all of its 49 Members â want you to take office and want you to work closely with the European Parliament, more closely than is laid down in the Constitution.
Now the Socialists want to prevent you from taking office.
They are clearly prepared to trigger a full-blown European crisis, even though the Chairman of the Socialist Group has taken the precaution of explaining that it would not be a crisis but a normal parliamentary act.
The only problem is that it is so ânormalâ that it has never happened before in Europe.
And why?
There is only one reason for this that will stick in the mind of the general public and that is the fact that a candidate for the post of Commissioner dared to express his religious convictions.
And, because this is what it is actually all about, I should like, once more, to make our position clear.
We are in fact under an obligation to respect the principle of non-discrimination.
The state has no right to poke its nose into such matters.
Nobody should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or their gender, either.
That is what is stated in the Charter and in the Constitution.
I thought this statement would have been greeted with applause; in any case, I can see heads nodding in agreement, and so I can tell you that what I just said was a quote.
I quoted word for word what MrÂ Buttiglione said in the hearing. And that is what you are arguing about.
It is laughable, ladies and gentlemen!
Â Â  â Madam President, we will not, tomorrow, be able to vote in favour of the new Commission as it currently stands; there are too many question marks for that.
There is one against the President, who unashamedly wishes to do as he pleases with this freely elected Parliament.
There is another against MrÂ Buttiglione, who has drawn public attention and disqualified himself from the post of Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs by making unspeakably discriminatory remarks, and there are many more.
I should like to single out MrsÂ Udre, the Latvian candidate.
She is quoted as saying that the European Union as a whole is superfluous.
At the hearing she praised improvements, but that is not enough.
This Commissioner of all people, who is to be responsible for customs duties and tax, is not so very particular about money.
The financing of her party is shrouded in mystery.
There is compelling evidence of dubious relations with the Russian oil industry, which transports a large proportion of its oil to the West via Latvia, greasing many palms on the way.
What the public expects of us is that we approve members of the Commission only if they are beyond reproach.
In this case it is personal integrity that is lacking, and, along with the other question marks, this is a further reason to reject the whole Commission.
Â Â  â Mr Barroso, in July my colleague Mr Pannella and I declared our confidence in you but also suggested that you should add an agenda for democracy to your proposed agenda for peace and development.
Perhaps we had the gift of premonition, because today we are in fact discussing whether our Union is a parliamentary democracy or not, whether Parliamentâs prerogatives are being upheld by the President of the Commission, who is the guardian of the Treaties.
To us, this certainly does not seem to be the case.
It is not the Buttiglione affair that is at stake today but the Barroso affair, and that means the relationship between Commission, Parliament and Council.
It is purely and simply the democracy of our European Union that is under discussion today.
It is not an institutional crisis at all, but rather a mere political crisis which, I believe, may even have highly positive consequences.
Mr Barroso, this Parliament and this parliamentary democracy are the essence of our European Union.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President-designate, this debate is taking place on the eve of the signing of the first European Constitution, on the eve of a historic event for our Union of 500 million people.
Tomorrowâs Europe must take a leading role in international politics, in a fair, mutually supportive and balanced relationship with the United States, as you said yourself in your speech.
That, Mr Barroso, is why we ask you to commit yourself to obtaining a seat for the European Union on the UN Security Council.
We ask you to continue to make the Union play its part for peace in the Mediterranean, its face turned towards the south, towards the African continent.
That is where future emergencies will lie; that is where we must seek solutions to problems; that is where we must act to address the urgent immigration question.
The Europe that we need to develop within a framework of a balance of powers â between Council, Commission and Parliament â must also, however, be the homeland of rights, respect for peopleâs individuality, non-discrimination, subsidiarity, transparency and equal opportunities â in short, the homeland of freedom.
The Barroso Commission is perfectly capable of steering Europe towards these goals and of protecting the interests, rights and freedoms of the people.
I agree with your choices, Mr Barroso, just as I also agree with the Italian Governmentâs choice in appointing MrÂ Buttiglione as a member of this Commission.
He is a European politician who is pro-Europe and who, as the Italian Minister for Community Policies, has demonstrated that he upholds the interests of the Union.
I must remind this Chamber that the majority of the Members who listened to Mr Buttiglione in committee came out in favour of him as a candidate Commissioner â a Commissioner who must now and in the future be judged by what he does and not by his religious beliefs.
Judging him and the entire Commission on the basis of this one factor would be an anti-European decision, and doing so on the eve of the signing of the Constitution would be not only a grave political mistake but also a serious blow to the European institutions.
Mr President-designate, under my leadership the Italian delegation in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, places its trust in you and your Commission.
We are sure that it will be a factor for change in the institutional framework.
Good luck, Mr Barroso.
Â Â  â Madam President, this is the first time such a political crisis has come about following the hearing of the Commissioners, especially in the Commission as a whole.
This is an institutional confrontation between the three Community institutions, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The crisis in question, of course, was started by the Council itself but I think that you, MrÂ Barroso, with your stand today and with what has been promised, will perpetuate this crisis, without having understood that, if the Commission continues on this course, you will end up becoming a punch bag between the European Parliament and the Council.
I should also like to say that this crisis is not present only in Buttiglione's policies and communications; it is also present in the poor performance of numerous Commissioners, such as those in charge of competition, agriculture and taxation, who were unable to convince the members of their committees of their perspectives and political commitments.
Â Â  Madam President, the President-designate of the Commission called on Parliament to be responsible on this issue.
I agree with him.
But that does not necessarily go in your favour, MrÂ Barroso.
We are not judging or voting here on the religious beliefs of anyone.
We are judging your Commission's commitment to fighting for the basic values of the European Union and your Commissioners' ability to implement policies based on principles that they do not believe in and do not support.
We are judging whether this Parliament has a decisive voice in Europe's political future, or whether we want it to be reduced to an advisory board within the Council.
Finally, we are judging your own respect for Parliament and your independence from individual governments.
It is time to be serious, that is true.
It is time to show citizens our commitment to democracy and our commitment to them, and thereby to strengthen Europe.
Whatever happens, this will not be an institutional crisis; it will be a development of democracy.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President of the Commission, on behalf of the Polish delegation in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to pay tribute to the way in which you are performing your duties.
We are paying close attention to your initial actions, and in our opinion these actions are convincing and demonstrate the will of the strong leader we need.
We believe that under your Presidency the European Commission should place particular emphasis on three points. These are completing enlargement, standing by the principles of solidarity and cohesion, and developing the EUâs eastern dimension.
The first challenge will be to involve the new Member States in all aspects of EU policy.
Enlargement of the institutions has now taken place, but a great deal more work and time is needed for the new Member States to achieve full rights and equal treatment.
Only then will it be possible to regard enlargement as being complete in the real sense of the word, and not merely in the institutional sense.
The second task is to close the economic gap and to ensure social and economic cohesion within the EU, in the name of the principle of solidarity.
Your most immediate challenge will be to convince the Council of the need to ensure the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective does provide for a correlation between the EUâs increasing number of tasks and competences and the funds necessary to implement them.
âYou cannot have more Europe for less moneyâ, as you said before this House in July, and we expect you to remain true to these words.
The current enlargement is very cheap, but attempts should not be made to make it even cheaper, thus depriving the EUâs poorest countries of the chance to overcome the development gap, a chance that was given to other countries.
Your Commissionâs goal should be to implement the Prodi Commissionâs proposal for a budget based on 1.24% of gross domestic product.
We also expect you to keep the promises you made to the House in this regard.
The third issue is that of the EUâs eastern dimension and its new neighbourhood policy.
We need a policy that is generous but not permissive, and one that is demanding and effective.
We hope you will have confidence in us, and we intend to vote in favour of your Commission, including MrÂ Buttiglione.
I thank you.
Â Â  â MrÂ President of the Commission, you said that the Commissioner-designate MrÂ Buttiglione had been successful in one hearing and had failed in another.
I fear that this is a further example of your not listening carefully to Parliament, because the letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs also definitely contained critical remarks.
Personally, I very much regret the fact that MrÂ Buttiglione would not, or could not, take the opportunity of a second hearing in the Legal Affairs Committee, but he did clearly emphasise to that committee that his religious views were not in fact simply private views but principles that he wanted to guide his political actions.
He would want to assess proposals that ran counter to his personal convictions and proposals from other Commissioners on the basis of his private ideas.
Personally I am in no doubt that this goes beyond any definition of what private views are.
I should also like to say that I am still waiting for an apology for the attacks on the Commissioner-designate MrÂ Å pidla.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Barroso, you were appointed as Commission President after many meetings, negotiations and compromises behind the closed doors of the Council.
That is not an ideal way to proceed.
The questioning of the remainder of the Commission is a way of democratising the whole of this process.
The procedure is fully open and is followed with great interest by the media and the general public.
It forces each Commissioner to reflect upon his or her visions and ideas.
Many members of governments would not have survived such scrutiny.
Now, one of your Commissioners has been rejected for the first time.
It is someone who would be in an extremely sensitive post, with responsibility for controversial issues concerned with discrimination, civil rights, refugees, police cooperation and the fight against terrorism.
There are many of us who do not have confidence in the person who would be responsible for these issues, which would be at the centre of European debate.
Unlike the Eurosceptics in this House, we believe in a strong Commission.
We want constructive cooperation with the Commission, but we cannot support a Commission with MrÂ Buttiglione still in this post.
Replace him, and we shall support you.
Â Â  In my opinion, Mr Barroso is a capable politician, a politician who can find new solutions and a politician who will shake up EU structures which have become rusty around the edges, particularly in economic terms.
I therefore believe that he must be given a chance, and that his authority should not be undermined at the very outset.
We should also not allow this House to become an arena for domestic political battles, and instead we should seek a constructive and positive solution, and not allow ourselves to be manoeuvred into a crisis.
MrÂ Barroso will therefore have the support of the Czech delegation in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I should further like to note that Mr Barroso spoke before this House as a guardian of the Treaties and as a guardian of the spirit of the European Treaties, and this is something which I welcome.
I should also like to point out that the Treaties state clearly that any amendments to them must be agreed unanimously, and that this also, above all, applies to the European Constitution.
It would require only a single state not to ratify this Constitution for it to be nullified.
It is therefore unacceptable that various politicians should make statements to the effect that it is immaterial whether one, two or three states do not ratify the Constitution, and that its validity will anyway be unaffected, or even that any state which fails to ratify the Constitution will have to leave the European Union.
I hope that the Commission will support clearly the position set out in the existing Treaties, that it will state its opposition to flexible interpretations of the Treaties and to statements such as those mentioned above, that it will signal clearly its preparedness for an alternative scenario in which the European Constitution does not enter into force, and that it will be willing to help find a solution to such a future scenario, not that I would wish to anticipate it.
I therefore hope that the Commission will act as a catalyst for constructive debate on the European Constitution, and that it will play a positive role in this debate.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, investing means having confidence.
When we do not have confidence, we do not invest.
So what are our reasons?
I cannot condone your presence in the Azores.
Since then we have found out that the war in Iraq was based on a lie and, to use an expression which has been used a lot, do not forget the Ten Commandments.
To lie is a sin: with a grain of repentance on this issue, you could have earned a tiny bit of neutrality from quarters other than those which are supporting you today.
Secondly, the team: everything possible has been said about the team, or almost.
You could have won a grain of confidence if you had changed part of it.
You announce an agency, but you keep the money.
That is of no use to anybody.
Clemenceau, in France, used to say: âWhen I want to bury a problem, I create a commissionâ.
I have the impression that we can already express our condolences.
And then there is your orientation.
You could have sent a small signal to the left of this House by saying: more public services in order to counterbalance competition; I will develop the services directive in order to prevent dumping; in the Lisbon strategy, I will introduce certain minimum social rights.
Even with the Commission you propose, you could have made a few gestures.
You have not done so, and you will therefore not have neutrality.
Â Â  Madam President, we are not persecuting Mr Buttiglione, but trying to save European citizens from being led on justice issues by someone so eminently unsuitable.
It is not only that he is prepared to implement his reactionary prejudices against women and gay people in public policy â and what signal is he sending to his eight female colleagues? â he also has a very poor record on asylum and immigration, security and the rule of law.
You gave us a list of initiatives the Commission would take, but they are already in progress, or should be priorities in any case.
Mr Barroso, you say that it is impossible to change the portfolio at this stage.
You are thereby showing complete contempt for this Parliament, since it is precisely what it has asked for.
You need to stand up to the Council.
I backed you in July because I thought you would be independent.
I understand that Mr Blair is personally phoning around British Labour MEPs to try and twist their arms so that they do not vote against.
He would be better using taxpayers' money on his phone bill telling his mate, Mr Berlusconi, to switch his candidate.
Â Â  â Madam President, one of the basic conclusions which can be drawn from the recent hearings of the Commissioners-designate is that the role of our Parliament has been confirmed because, in previous similar proceedings, the Commissioners-designate were not subjected either to such substantial or to such extended and penetrating hearings.
However, what is of decisive importance is the Commission's clear and honest intention to cooperate with the European Parliament.
In this way, the two institutions will acquire a stronger role and a stronger place in the mind of the citizens.
Let us not beat about the bush.
The basic criticism was with Mr Buttiglione.
Of course, Mr Buttiglione used certain expressions which were unfortunate, but his letter of explanation and the President's personal guarantees have convinced me that Mr Buttiglione will not mix his religious or philosophical views with the exercise of policy.
I personally believe that the new Commission will consist of people who are able to meet the challenges of the next five years, which is why we MEPs of the Greek New Democracy Party will vote in favour of it.
Of course, our vote for the Commission will not give it ; on the contrary, we shall monitor their work closely, in order to safeguard a successful response to the challenges it has to face.
Â Â  Mr President of the Commission, in June we Spanish Socialists offered you an opportunity.
I must tell you that you have not taken it.
Furthermore, since we are talking about the Constitution, we should remember that the PPE asked that its approval be brought forward and that the results of the elections be taken into account.
The PPE coalition received 36%, the Socialists, 27%.
Precisely for that reason we gave you that opportunity.
But there is another golden rule in the Constitution, and that is that Europe, Parliament and the Commission, operate in terms of the budget and codecision by absolute majority.
And that must be the rule, and it cannot be resolved simply by means of telephone calls to the members of the Council.
Today, three months after being voted in, you are proposing a team to us and in three months time you will propose a programme.
This will have to be dealt with in the future, but, in any event, you have said something important today: you promise to remodel your Commission if we vote for you.
The problem is that, right now, we do not trust you after what happened in July.
With a view to the application of the Constitution and also for the sake of democracy, we are offering you the opportunity to take account of this Parliamentâs constructive comments following a ânoâ vote from this House.
Â Â  Madam President, we Swedish Moderates are adopting a position on the Commission as a whole.
We do not want to help bring about a situation in which voting in this House is on the basis of the private opinions or moral views of individual Commissioners.
We do not like the views of a number of the individual Commissioners.
It surprises me a little that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has not presented any criticism at all of the nominated Commissioner who has still been unwilling to repudiate the Prague invasion of 1968 and who knew nothing about his own political area.
We dislike some of the views expressed by individual Commissioners, but we assess the Commission as a whole, and largely in the light of the fact that we also think it only right that the individual countries should be able to nominate their Commissioners if European cooperation is to work.
Our task would be a hopeless one as far as European cooperation is concerned if religious views and private moral opinions were to be presented at European level for judgment in this Parliament.
Our task would also be a hopeless one if Parliament were to reject the candidates presented by the various countriesâ governments.
We shall therefore support the Commission with President Barroso at its head, partly in view of the fact that there is now a long list of important tasks before us.
There is the new Constitutional Treaty.
We have to ensure the success of the enlargement that has now taken place and to negotiate successfully with new candidate countries, especially Turkey.
The Lisbon process too has to succeed.
We do not intend to conduct a discussion that leads to Europeâs failing to make this process succeed.
We give MrÂ Barroso our support.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, I am a journalist who has been prevented from continuing to do his job.
In Italy, the Prime Minister controls money, politics and television.
I believe, however, that it is up to the Italians to put an end to this aberration, to turn the page and to put their country back on track for the future.
The Buttiglione affair, in contrast, is mostly up to you.
First, because it did not arise out of prejudice or religious conflict but out of the Commissioner-designateâs own words and actions, which have revealed him to be totally unsuitable.
He would also have appeared unsuitable to Jesus Christ and not just to homosexuals and women, since Jesus taught that only he who was without sin could cast the first stone.
You are trapped by a diktat from the Italian Government which prevents you from finding a reasonable and dignified political solution.
The shadow of a great many conflicts of interests hangs over your Commission.
The conflict of interests of a government, however, is not just a shadow but rather a boulder, which is why I do not think that voting against you would be damaging to the Union.
You could have avoided the situation but you did not, and so you end up by ripping up your promises of autonomy and independence from the national governments in this same Chamber where you made them, before this same Parliament that you had vowed to respect.
Â Â  Madam President, I will be supporting the new Commission tomorrow at the vote in the European Parliament, but my heart is heavy.
The success of the European project rests on tolerance of diversity and difference and, if necessary, agreeing to disagree.
Issues of personal morality are not matters to be legislated for by the Commission, nor for us here; they are for our national governments and private individuals to decide.
While I have registered serious concerns about what I viewed as the reported lack of tolerance expressed by my former colleague Mr Buttiglione â a PPE-DE colleague for the last five years â in his statements on certain issues such as Baltic minorities, homosexuality and sinning, single mothers and fathers, I agree to support his candidature on balance.
I accept his right to his strongly-held orthodox Catholic views.
As a Catholic, I do not happen to share some of his very strong fundamental views on that matter, but we can agree to differ.
That is what the whole principle of the European project is about.
I have strong reservations in relation to up to five of the Commissioners, but based on his curriculum vitae and experience, Mr Buttiglione has the ability and aptitude for the job of Commissioner.
Could it be, Mr Barroso, that he is the right man in the wrong job?
He has said that he will not change his principles or conscience for political convenience, and I would not expect him to do that, but it is going to be impossible for him in his particular portfolio, given the challenges that will be before him.
There are so many issues before us.
You have our support, Mr Barroso.
Generally, you have a very good lineâup.
I would much rather be talking about problems of conflict of interest in relation to the Commissioner-designate for Competition, or ineptitude in relation to the Commissioner-designate for Energy.
Â Â  Madam President, I voted in favour of your appointment in July.
I therefore regret the difficulty that we are experiencing in appointing the Commission that you are now proposing to us.
You think that your strength comes from these strong-arm tactics with Parliament.
You are mistaken.
The problem is not only tomorrowâs vote.
The problem is in ascertaining the political basis that will guide your term in office for the next five years.
You think that you only need the Councilâs support.
You are mistaken.
Look at how they have left you to your fate today.
Your strength, and that of the Commission, comes from the confidence placed in you by both the Council and Parliament.
Without Parliamentâs solid support your Commission will always be a weak Commission.
In the next twenty-four hours, do what you have to do to win Parliamentâs solid support.
If you do not make the most of this opportunity, do not play the victim or dramatise the rejection of the Commission.
Please take such a rejection not as a personal defeat but as a clear mandate to obtain from the Council a Commission that is worthy of Parliamentâs support.
The decision right now is yours, and yours only.
You must decide if you want Parliamentâs support, or if you want to remain a hostage of national government proposals and, in particular, of those of the Berlusconi government.
Please make the right choice, and we will be fine.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Madam President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, two things have become clear to me in this debate.
Firstly, there is surely no doubt about the abilities of the President of the Commission, MrÂ Barroso.
Secondly, in some cases we have got so carried away that we are no longer listening and are no longer capable of reading texts in full.
We must therefore recognise that MrÂ Buttiglione stated that he is in favour of non-discrimination and in favour of compliance with the Charter, and that he draws a distinction between a moral code and a legal code to which I believe we could all subscribe.
I have further observed in this debate that the lack of technical knowledge that has been noted here in the case of a few Commissioners appears, in many cases, to be completely irrelevant, provided â perhaps â that they are of the right political hue.
In any case this issue has been pushed right into the background in todayâs debate.
This brings me to the conclusion that there are a number of Members for whom this decision is a decision about values: political correctness instead of an attachment to values that stem from a religious conviction.
This is, I believe, a statement that it is not proper for us, as a Parliament, to make.
It is our job to judge the knowledge that these people have of their subject and not their personal religious beliefs.
I believe that this is an important and decisive point that we should keep to the forefront of our minds.
That is why I believe that we need to have a bit more tolerance and liberality, rather than being slaves to the same, fashionable opinion.
This is the point that we should keep in mind.
And in the light of the fact that the Barroso Commission is actually giving ground to Parliament and doing good work on foreign policy, the Constitution, enlargement â which needs revitalising â the rights of the European Parliament and the Lisbon Process, I would make this appeal to my fellow Members: do not bring it down because of a difference of opinion over someoneâs values.
Â Â  Madam President, when we elected you in July as the Commissionâs future president, we Socialists asked you some hard questions.
Nowadays, there are fewer questions, there are more disillusioned, embittered statements and these statements are based on experience.
There is nothing wrong with what you say, or with what you said today.
For you know exactly what needs to be said in this House and with imposing self-assurance you listed the encyclopaedia of European values and fundamental rights.
There is, nevertheless, a problem with your decisions, the harmony between words and deeds.
When allocating the portfolios you wanted to please Europeâs most conservative elements.
So far you have not shown very much of the promised flexibility and tolerance and there is no guarantee that your deputy Commissioner-designate will not turn against the results achieved so far in Europe.
We prepared for the birth of the first Commission of the 25 like a celebration.
You have one day left to replace the tension and distress with the joy of celebration.
We too have a conscience, not only MrÂ Buttiglione.
The responsibility is yours.
Â Â  Madam President, I have been in this Parliament for some time and the honourable Members who know me are perfectly aware that I am not in favour of a complacent and docile Parliament which bows down to the Commission and the Council, but rather a Parliament which fulfils its responsibilities, which invests the Commission, rather than attacking it, which controls it democratically, which rejects, debates, ratifies and rectifies.
In order to exercise its competences responsibly, however, this Parliament must be demanding rather than complacent, it cannot resort to haughtiness nor act with the arrogance of a mandarin.
This means that if the Commission does not satisfy every one of our demands, we cannot simply refuse to invest it and send it out into the street.
The Barroso Commission must be judged exclusively on its capacities and its competence, not on the personal, ethical or moral convictions of its members, because if we had followed that criterion, Madam President, we probably would not have been able to vote in favour of the President of the European Parliament.
That is what is so great about our kind of tolerance, Madam President.
I would like to say to the few members of the Liberal Group who are still here that they taught us a lesson in sensitivity and responsibility in July when they voted in favour of the President of the Commission, despite having been left outside the pact which led to the election of a Socialist President for this House.
There are capable people in Mr Barrosoâs Commission, former Members of this Parliament, who must be judged â I would insist â not on the basis of their personal opinions, but on their capacities and competence.
I would therefore appeal to the members of the Liberal Group to consider their vote seriously, to reflect carefully and to consider the virtues of voting for this Commission.
This is the best way to achieve the positive complicity which the President of the Commission has spoken about and which has led to the progress made by the European Union.
Â Â  â Madam President, the vote for the European Commission is of particular institutional and political importance.
Unfortunately, the hearings have given rise to serious misgivings as regards the general political direction which the Commission will pursue in that, apart from a few shining exceptions, a strong neo-liberal perception prevailed, without any corresponding convincing social commitments.
Our misgivings also arose as a result of the hearings on the questions of competition, taxation and agriculture, which require additional clarification and specific political commitments.
However, what was decisive in shaping our position was the hearing on the questions of security, justice and civil liberties.
The statements made by Mr Buttiglione touched at the very heart of our values for the European society we wish to build, a society we want to be mutually supportive, tolerant and non-discriminatory.
Mr Barroso, our position is clear.
Unless there is a material change in Mr Buttiglione's portfolio, we shall be obliged to vote against your Commission.
You referred to the danger of institutional crisis.
However, the exercise of the jurisdiction of the European Parliament, a jurisdiction provided for by the Treaty itself, cannot under any circumstances cause a crisis.
On the contrary, it is an expression of democratic institutional function.
The ball, Mr Barroso, is now in your court.
You still have the opportunity, you have the jurisdiction to find an institutional and political solution to the situation which has arisen.
Â Â  Madam President, in common with you I have the honour and responsibility of taking part for the first time in the decision-making process regarding the European Commission of the enlarged European Union.
I would like the European Parliament to perform this task with both dignity and credibility.
I was happy to vote for the future President of the Commission, not because he is from the beautiful country of Portugal, but because he presented a vision worthy of support.
Today he has reinforced that vision with a number of programme elements, with a clear desire for close collaboration with the European Parliament and also with the desire to lead the Commission in the spirit of the European Constitutional Agreement.
I am not interested in discussing today the outcome of the American elections or the fate of Berlusconi, nor should we be going right back to Adam and Eve.
We should be concerned with the future of the European Union and the strength of its Commission.
It is not our role to make judgements about the personal views of the candidates but to decide on the competence of the proposed Commission.
We have more than enough challenges ahead of us for us to be playing little games.
I am not happy about much of what I have read about the hearings, either on the left or on the right.
However, even if I did agree with the criticism, I cannot put the whole Commission at risk for the sake of one single majority vote in one of the committees for one of the candidates.
If we adopt the practice of making judgements according to some ideological yardstick fuelled by one or two sentences, or quotes taken entirely out of context, we will have difficulty finding a candidate who would survive, as everyone has, at some time in their life, said something that could easily be the subject of long political debates.
I will, of course, support a Commission which will operate in a collegial manner, based on the assurance of its President, and I wish it every success.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President of the Commission, in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties, one of the tasks of your Commission will be to continue the process of EU enlargement.
This process involves an assessment of whether a candidate country respects human rights and whether it is transparent and free from corruption.
I have serious doubts as to whether your Commission will be able to carry out this task well. I therefore feel bound to ask whether a Commissioner who has clearly shown that he does not understand, or does not wish to understand, the European system of human rights of which we are so proud, can be entrusted with carrying out an assessment of the extent to which human rights are respected in Romania, Bulgaria, and maybe even in Turkey.
I have a second question to put to you too, MrÂ Barroso.
The formation of your Commission is also a lesson in European democracy, and a lesson that citizens throughout the European Union are observing closely.
What kind of a message are you currently sending out to citizens?
Why, that the opinion of the European Parliament need not be taken into account.
Is this a positive message?
Does it bring the European Union closer to its citizens?
Is it the right kind of message to send out two days before the European Constitution is signed?
MrÂ Barroso, please listen to what the European Parliament has to say, rather than fighting against it.
Â Â  â Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a moment before I give the floor to MrÂ Barroso.
The formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands at 12Â noon means that we will not be able to finish our debate, despite our efforts to be strict about time.
The last three speakers will therefore take the floor after the formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands and after that we will begin the votes.
I would crave your indulgence for this.
MrÂ Barroso has the floor.
Â Â  Madam President, I do not have time in ten minutes to respond to all the questions, but I will try to respond to the fundamental issues.
First of all, with regard to the doubts expressed about certain Commissioners, I went into detail at the meeting with the Conference of Presidents.
In particular, in relation to the issue of independence in the competition portfolio, we will make public all the opinions of the legal services, which show that we can guarantee the independence of the Commissioner and the Commission on issues of competition.
With regard to the accusations about the previous priority activities of one of the members of the Commission, despite what certain Members have requested, I cannot hold enquiries into the pasts of all the Commissioners-designate.
It is not possible.
I must take an objective view.
You are well aware that, in political life, many of us are subject to unfounded accusations.
I cannot accept a culture of intolerance, a culture of suspicion, simply because there are rumours or simply because there are attacks in our respective countries.
Nevertheless, in the event that there is evidence of unacceptable practices, you may rest assured that I would have the means to act.
I now come to the fundamental issue on which I very much wish to express my feelings: the institutional question.
Ladies and gentlemen, before becoming Prime Minister, I was leader of the opposition.
I am also a parliamentarian, I have a great respect for all genuinely democratic parliaments and a great respect for your Parliament.
The debate has shown, however, that, on more difficult issues, particularly on the issue of the portfolio of Mr Buttiglione, there was a division.
It is true, it exists: some of you are asking me to replace MrÂ Buttiglione and others are asking me not to replace him.
There has been no common position at your Conference of Presidents, quite the opposite.
You have sent me letters from all the committees.
On the subject of Mr Buttiglione, I have received two letters: one said that he deserved your support and the other, but for one vote, said that he did not deserve it.
In these circumstances, I must find a balance.
As far as we are concerned, you have the right to represent all the peoples of Europe, I know this and I respect it.
I have the greatest respect for you.
The European Union requires a difficult balance, however.
The governments also have the right to represent the nation states and I myself, or the Commission once invested, must think of the general European interest.
I can tell you, in all honesty, that it was precisely by considering the general European interest, not the interest of any particular State or of any particular electorate, that I came to the conclusion that the best solution was, I believe, the one I have proposed to you.
I have not given way entirely to those who wanted a shake-up, it is true, but I have gone a long way towards dealing with your concerns and I have given significant guarantees with regard to the substance, fundamental rights, civil liberties and non-discrimination.
I believe I have been very clear and I can tell you that my Commission, if you place your trust in it, will be the most advanced Commission in terms of freedoms, civil rights and non-discrimination, as demonstrated by the composition of my Commission.
To be very frank, ladies and gentlemen, I expected certain criticisms, particularly from those of you who were opposed to my investiture from the outset.
I expected ideological criticisms, but the only criticism of my Commission I did not expect was the accusation of a lack of commitment to human rights and non-discrimination.
Our attachment to those values can be seen in the very composition of the Commission.
I must therefore ask for your trust, because I have sought a balance.
It is necessary to seek a balance, not just the balance between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission, but also a balance within this Parliament.
Are the honourable Members who are critical of my choice sure that if I were to grant your request, the other side of the House would support the Commission?
After all the consultations I have held, particularly with the leaders of the political groups represented here, I am convinced that any other approach could lead to a crisis.
That crisis could be resolved, I am sure: in a democracy, all crises can be resolved.
I would, however, ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether it is normal for those amongst you who are most committed to Europe to be able to vote now alongside extremists who do not want Europe, members of the extreme right who are against Europe, people who are completely opposed to the advancement of our European project...
Do you not find it strange that populists, those who wage a constant battle against the credibility of our institutions, can vote against this Commission alongside committed Europeans, as most Members of this House are, I am sure?
So, ladies and gentlemen, I am committed to respecting the principles of institutional balance.
I have made a great effort to deal with your legitimate concerns, but I must tell you, quite responsibly, that European culture is also a culture of tolerance and compromise.
It is not a question of demanding everything you want from the other party.
I do not want a show-down with Parliament, because I am well aware that you represent the peoples of Europe, but what I can tell you is that we must move forward and meet each other halfway in terms of our concerns.
That is what we must do.
Some people were against the Commission from the outset and now they have found an opportunity to gain more support.
I would, however, say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that if this Commission does not receive the necessary support, I honestly believe it would be difficult to talk of victory for the one side or defeat for the other.
It would be a bad moment for the whole of Europe.
I do not believe we would be able to commit ourselves truly to what we need to do in terms of the harmonisation of the Lisbon strategy, the debate on the financial perspectives, the cohesion of our Union, making a great success of this enlargement, putting ourselves on an equal footing with the United States or holding a debate with Russia at the summit planned for November.
I believe that would be bad for Europe.
I have therefore fulfilled my responsibility and I believe that everybody should now fulfil theirs.
I can tell you in all honesty, however, that you can count on me to work with you, in a spirit of compromise.
I appeal to you to show the same spirit of compromise for the good of Europe.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, we will now suspend our debate for the formal sitting with the Queen of the Netherlands, after which the debate will resume with three further speakers.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Your Majesty, it is a great honour for the European Parliament to welcome you to this sitting of our Parliament.
Your presence amongst us, Your Majesty, represents a significant milestone in relations between the European Parliament, the European Union and the Netherlands.
Over recent months we have witnessed the work your country has done during its Presidency-in-Office of the Council, which will last until the end of the year.
The skill of the Dutch Presidency has shown us that the size of a country bears no relation to the quantity or the quality of the work it can do.
You have done an immense amount of tireless work, taking a pragmatic view and always working in favour of the European Union and the values on which it is based.
Your Majesty, our institution is well aware of your personal work and your commitment to the least-favoured social classes.
Your dedication to those who have little or nothing has always amazed us, and the love and profound respect your country feels for you and your family is testimony to the great work you do.
Your Majesty, it is a great honour for me to offer you the floor of the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, if we had to name one thing with which we identify most of all, it would probably be our mother tongue.
It follows that all Member States value the fact that their language is recognised in the Union.
Based on that achievement, I shall speak to you in Dutch today.
At the same time, I am convinced that cooperation in Europe will increasingly demand that we make concessions in this area.
If we do not want to turn the Union into a Tower of Babel âŠ
we will need to make an effort to understand each other the best we can.
In a multilingual Europe, it is therefore of great importance for young people, in particular, to be encouraged to speak one or more foreign languages in order to be able to talk directly to their fellow Europeans.
It is precisely in a unifying Europe that good communication â the direct contact between people â forms the best basis for mutual understanding.
In 1950, the Founding Fathers took the first initiative to set up the European Communities, which were the precursors of our Union.
This idea appealed to the older generation, mainly, as a means of banishing war from our continent.
To the younger generation, this was, above all, an inspiring ambition and a challenge.
When I was 23, I was asked to deliver a speech on this very topic in front of an international group of young people who felt connected with this European ideal.
They subsequently urged me not to remain stuck in the rhetoric, but to encourage young people in other countries to think together about Europeâs future.
We set out on this task with much enthusiasm.
Europe then offered us a whole new perspective.
We saw the opportunity of communicating with our contemporaries, establishing contacts and developing initiatives together across the borders.
What had started with such prosaic concrete building blocks like coal and steel, grew into a movement which would raze Europeâs dividing walls to the ground, would keep the peace and would inject renewed resilience and energy into our continent, certainly not, as Robert Schuman stated, as a â a leap into the unknown â but as a leap into a joint future which, this time round, was clearly defined and anchored in treaties.
We, the young people in those days, were delighted to take part in this and thus help shape our own future.
I made that speech at a , a European studentsâ congress, in Toulouse.
When I re-read those words now, I recognise the enthusiasm in whose grip we were then.
We admired the vision and courage of the Founding Fathers of the European Communities, but thought that the older generation was too much stuck in fine words and took too little action in order to actually establish European unity.
During the final meeting at the congress, I stated âWe should conclude that instead of common ambitions, it is only problems that are uniting Europe at the moment'.
Fortunately, 43 years down the line, those words are no longer true.
European unity has taken shape in a convincing manner and has become part of our life.
There is little trace, though, of the enthusiasm of those days.
Many are now critical and, above all, concerned about the obstacles that are yet to be negotiated.
Sometimes, delivering on promises appears more difficult than at first thought, and unanimity about the course to be followed does not always last.
Fortunately, we can establish that the looming problems are often the direct result of swift progress that has been made with European unification.
Indeed, those in doubt overlook the many achievements that our countries have now made.
The original idea â Europeâs unification â has taken off enormously, to an extent that would probably astound the great Founding Fathers back in the years following the catastrophic Second World War, despite their vision and ambitions.
The Union has banned wars from its territory, has subordinated power to law, and has brought the participating countries unrivalled prosperity.
Despite times of tardiness and misfortune, the unique European experiment has led to impressive results.
The Union now unifies 25 European nations.
As the first Head of State to address your House since the accession of the new Member States, I should like to express a heartfelt word of welcome to their representatives in this Parliament.
Anyone who takes the European ideal to heart has looked forward to that moment.
After all, your countries traditionally belong to Europe.
Many have thrown off the yoke of years of oppression, which kept our continent divided in two camps.
We have the deepest respect for the conviction and decisiveness with which they have done this.
We also admire the untold efforts all countries have made to take the many and often far-reaching measures that were necessary to join the Union within a short space of time.
Their joining has made the European family a , an extended family, as it is termed so enchantingly in French.
We expect a great deal from this enlargement.
The major contribution of the new Member States could well be that they introduce in the Union the same fervour which they demonstrated when they liberated themselves from Soviet rule and when they made the impressive efforts in preparation for membership.
The Union as a whole will almost certainly find power and a source of inspiration in this fervour and enthusiasm with which you begin this new chapter, in many cases with the help of the younger generation.
Anyone who joins a new family will always face problems of adjustment, certainly if the family is outside their own country.
We in our family have some experience of this!
In most cases, the greatest adjustment is required from the newcomer, even though it would be fairer if this task were spread over both parties.
This also applies to the enlargement of our Community.
The new members will need to make an effort to fit into what already exists in the Union, but the older members will equally need to show willingness to adapt.
That is not only the fraternal attitude one may expect in these circles, it is also the quickest way of securing good cooperation.
The EUâs fundamental principle is that it is based on a Community of Law.
The countries forming part of this, including those which were among Europeâs most powerful countries, have, in the interest of their common future, placed themselves under the authority of the law.
This is a unique step in the history of Europe.
This also entails respecting the rights of each individual citizen.
This anchoring of the Union in the law is strikingly symbolised by its highest officials taking the oath in front of the entire European Court of Justice.
Our 25 countries are united â but âin diversityâ.
They value their own identities, their own languages and their own cultural heritage.
That is the great distinguishing power of Europe, and it is in the interest of all of us to guard and preserve this carefully.
The constant confrontation with other cultures makes us more aware of both our own culture and our common heritage.
As a result, we are also in a stronger position to face the spirit of materialism and mass culture which is undeniably spreading across the world in increasingly threatening forms.
To be able to function effectively, the Union needs to have clear-cut powers in a number of areas.
In other areas, where success is less dependent on the bundling of powers, it may prove useful, by way of counterweight, to leave more room for governments, local authorities and the citizens themselves to find their own solutions either at national level or at regional level.
A good balance struck between central and delegated government can avoid the Union conjuring up the image of an all-encompassing bureaucracy that alienates people.
If responsibilities are clear and are placed and carried where they best serve the Community, the citizens will have a better grasp of, and more respect for, the common interest.
Europe is not so much about meeting a final objective as it is about the process of getting there.
To some, the progress of this process is too slow, while to others, it is too fast.
Success often attracts counter forces.
These should not discourage us but rather encourage us to persevere.
Sometimes, it is about waiting for the right moment.
Rome was not built in one day. The same is true of the edifice that was founded on the Treaty of Rome.
Our Union gains in strength if it opens itself up to countries that share our legal norms and commit to meeting the criteria.
This awareness can be an encouragement to conduct the consultation with those wishing to join the Union in an open, fair and unbiased manner.
If nations exert themselves to making the transition to the democratic form of government as effectively as possible, they deserve extra appreciation and support.
In three daysâ time, the Constitutional Treaty will be signed in Rome.
The preamble contains the solemn declaration that Europe wishes to continue to apply itself to establishing peace, justice and solidarity in the world.
That is a far-reaching ambition and is an indication that this organised Europe feels affiliated with the ideal of an equally organised world.
We respect and support the United Nations as a global structure propagating those self-same principles.
Peace is the primary condition if any progress and development are to be achieved.
Peace is vulnerable and requires intensive care.
The EU countries that have managed to keep the peace within their boundaries are now supporting peace operations in other parts of the world and are sending their troops to those regions for that purpose.
With the Constitutional Treaty, our countries are giving a clear signal that they are taking responsibility in respect of the rest of the world and will continue unabatedly in their efforts to fight poverty, inequality and injustice.
Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, there is on our continent a historical mental affinity, a feeling of togetherness which makes us Europeans.
In the Treaties we have forged, we have each time described more clearly the civilisation we would like to live in.
Our European institutions, including your Parliament, are the pillars of that civilisation.
As you acquit yourselves of the challenging task to represent 450 million Europeans, I warmly wish you the inspiration that Europe requires of all of us today.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your words, Your Majesty.
Â Â  We now continue with the debate on the statement by Mr Barroso, Presidentâelect of the Commission, presenting the College of Commissioners and their programme.
Â Â  Mr President, we all know that the Commission is made up of a President and 24 Commissioners, from different political backgrounds and with different personal beliefs, yet it has the legitimacy of having been proposed by democratically-elected governments.
It therefore comes as no surprise that each of us appraises each of these Commissioners differently.
That appraisal cannot, however, be based on their personal convictions or religious beliefs.
If this were one day the case, this House would no longer be a Parliament but a court of opinion with a morbid taste for censure.
Our appraisal must be based on the Commissionersâ skills, and at this point one should remember that in the hearings an 80% majority was in favour.
At this time, what we must do is decide how Parliament will behave towards a Commission led by a strong President with a clear mission to ensure that the European project and the balance between the Member States will be safeguarded.
We have seen in this debate that President Barroso was attentive to what the Members of this House were saying, and acted accordingly.
He has made commitments to this House, not least in the area of non-discrimination, and has received a letter from each of the Commissioners, and this makes him worthy of Parliamentâs confidence.
What remains to be seen is whether Parliament is attentive to President Barrosoâs message and also acts accordingly.
It is understandable to vote against a Commission if one is not 100% in agreement with it.
It is not understandable to vote against a Commission of 25 people if one disagrees with the religious beliefs of one of its members; that is intolerant.
Mr Buttiglione was sincere when he expressed his beliefs, and I believe that he was sincere when he said that he would not mix his personal beliefs with his duties.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must judge the Commission and its Commissioners by their acts.
Consequently, to put a Commission in an untenable position before it has taken up its duties, due to the religious beliefs of one of its members, is tantamount to prejudice.
We will be carrying out our duties responsibly, however, if we assess it during the course of its mandate.
Lastly, Mr President of the Commission, I do not know how tomorrowâs vote will go, but, coming from Portugal, I can tell you that you can count on our vote, and I hope that the Commission is not rejected because of 12 votes from the Portuguese left of this House.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commission PresidentÂ Barroso, half of Europeâs citizens are women: women who have been told that, in marriage, they are to be provided for and subordinated and that single mothers are worse mothers.
Those are not the EUâs values, and they are unacceptable.
The same values and rights also apply to the EUâs homosexuals.
According to the UN and the EU, human rights are also womenâs rights.
In the same way, the Lisbon strategy affirms womenâs right to employment and to equal wages for work of equal value.
These are facts and not just words, as you said in your introduction.
The EU and the Commission must respect women for the sake of the EU and in the interests of an equal Europe with gender equality.
You have not listened today, either, to ourselves as elected representatives of the people.
More is the pity, MrÂ Barroso.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Barroso has presented the Commission as a single whole, a collegiate body, which is quite right, and he ties his political approach to that.
The President of the Commission has accepted the governmentsâ nominations, but he has put his trust in his Commissioners because he, and he alone, is the guarantor of the programme: if Mr Barroso is the conductor of the orchestra, as Mr Cohn-Bendit says, it is he who must tune the instruments and tell us whether the musicians know how to play.
Cultural arguments external to this Parliament and cultural intolerances that are foreign to this Parliamentâs democracy must not be brought into this Chamber.
A moralistic Europe, secularly fundamentalist in a way that Catholic culture never succeeded in being, is not part of the dream of Alcide De Gasperi or Robert Schuman, our forefathers, because it is an intolerant Europe.
Tomorrowâs vote will be a vote for the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
Those who have no regard for the people, those who have no political or social tolerance, those who have no regard for the institutions, will vote âNoâ.
Those who believe in a liberal, tolerant, even-handed, persuasive and institutional Europe, in which the relationship between Parliament and government is one of democratic control and not control by bureaucrats or the unions, will vote for Mr Barroso in order to strengthen the balance among the twenty-five countries.
In an interview released in Italy a few days ago, Jacques Delors said that the Commission is a collegiate body and does not provide for individual personalities.
We, who always refer to what Mr Delors says, can on this occasion play our parliamentary role correctly by approving both the Commission as a whole and the commitment that its President has made before this House today.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote on the approval of the Commission will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  Mr President, with your permission, I would like to raise a point of order.
In his opening statement in the debate earlier on, Martin Schulz, Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, was being very condescending towards Her Royal Highness, Queen ....
Â Â  â Mrs Kauppi, this is not a procedural matter.
Â Â  â We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  It is clear that the amendments voted for or rejected have completely reversed the meaning of my report, since our Parliament believes it is not desirable for living beings to appear on the future notes of the European Union, that our difficulties are caused by excessively short working times in Europe and that, contrary to Article 2 of the Treaty, the Central Bank need not concern itself with sustainable growth.
I would therefore urge that you vote ânoâ to this report and if it is, unfortunately, adopted, which would send an immense signal about the future of Europe, I wish my name to be removed from the text.
â That concludes the vote.
We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of Mr Garganiâs report (A6-0012/2004) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community.
I feel that the work begun by the Commission to simplify and clarify Community legislation is essential.
I believe that this work is also highly valuable because it preserves in full the content of the codified acts; all it does is bring them together.
It is crucial that Community legislation be made more accessible and easier for ordinary citizens to understand, as this will offer them new opportunities and the chance to enjoy the specific rights accorded to them.
Â Â  . I share the Commissionâs concern that, in order to make the EU more accessible to the general public, great emphasis should be placed on simplifying Community legislation.
I believe that, in this way, ordinary citizens can be better informed as regards their duties and the rights they are accorded.
The dispersed nature of Community provisions, and the fact that many of them have been repeatedly amended down the years, makes it extremely difficult to identify the rules in force, a task that requires considerable analysis and can virtually only be done by people with legal training.
Consequently, and in order to ensure clarity and transparency in Community legislation, I believe that it is essential that Community legislation be codified, as provided for by the Commission in 1987 and by the Edinburgh European Council of 1992.
Accordingly, I endorse the aim of the proposal before us, which is intended to set about codifying Council Directive 76/464/EEC of 4Â May 1976 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community, replacing the previous dispersed legislative acts.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of Mr Garganiâs report (A6-0011/2004) on the proposal for a Council directive introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs (Codified version).
I feel that the work begun by the Commission to simplify and clarify Community legislation is essential.
I feel that this work is also highly valuable because it preserves in full the content of the codified acts; all it does is bring them together.
The aim of the proposal before us is to codify Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22Â December 1995, establishing minimum Community measures for controlling diseases affecting bivalve molluscs.
The new directive will replace all of the legislation incorporated therein.
It is crucial that Community legislation be made more accessible and easier for ordinary citizens to understand, as this will offer them new opportunities and the chance to enjoy the specific rights accorded to them.
Â Â  . I wish to reiterate the opinion expressed by the Commission that simplifying Community legislation will result in an EU that is more accessible to its citizens, who will in turn become better informed as regards their duties and rights.
The dispersed nature of Community provisions, and the fact that many of them have been repeatedly amended down the years, makes it extremely difficult to identify the rules in force, a task that requires considerable analysis, and can virtually only be done by people with legal training.
Consequently, and in order to ensure clarity and transparency in Community legislation, I believe that it is essential that Community legislation be codified, as provided for by the Commission in 1987 and by the Edinburgh European Council of 1992.
Accordingly, as I did with proposal for a Directive 76/464/EEC, I endorse the aim of the proposal before us, which is intended to set about codifying Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22Â December 1995, establishing minimum Community measures for controlling certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs, replacing the currently isolated legislative acts incorporated therein.
Â Â  We are voting in favour of the cooperation agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia in accordance with this report.
The agreements should not be aimed at strengthening the EUâs foreign policy and the EUâs efforts to become a global player.
The agreements should mainly emphasise economic development and respect for human rights.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of Mr Brokâs report (A6-0023/2004) Partnership and Cooperation Agreements â on the proposals for Council and Commission Decisions on the conclusion of the Protocols to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, on the other part, to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union.
These Partnership and Cooperation Agreements (PCAs) are âmixedâ agreements that entered in force before the last EU enlargement.
The aforementioned agreements therefore require the addition of a protocol enabling the accession of ten new Member States to them.
The Council has authorised the Commission to begin negotiations with these countries, on behalf of the Community and its Member States, with the aim of concluding protocols for the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements.
Â Â  . The purpose of this report is to resolve a problem that arose due to the absence of a response from the Council to the creation of a new Regulation in the area of aid to uprooted people in Latin America and Asia.
Given that the current Regulation expires at the end of the year, it must be extended, as it provides assistance to some of the most vulnerable groups in the world â those forced to flee their homes due to armed conflict.
The aim of the assistance is to foster the voluntary return or integration of these groups into their host communities, either in their places of origin or to reconcile the parties to a conflict and to help uprooted people.
Although we voted in favour of the report, which aims to limit its implementation until the end of 2006, requiring a new global process and a Commission report on implementing the regulation, there are questions that must be brought to the fore:
- the little importance the Council attaches to the issues of aid and cooperation;
- the contradiction in the positions taken by the Commission, which, on the one hand, proposes to extend the Regulation indefinitely, yet, on the other hand, only provides funding for it until 2006;
- the Council and the Commissionâs contradictions as regards aid for cooperation and development, the funding for which is often reduced by being transferred to support for reconstructing countries ...
Â Â  We believe that the European Unionâs policy in the area of development needs to be reviewed.
We are well disposed to humanitarian aid and to support for people in situations that make them vulnerable.
We are nonetheless of the view that individual EU Member States should decide about the forms to be taken by their different commitments in terms of aid.
The United Nations is the international organisation through which the Member States have the opportunity to coordinate their aid efforts.
We are opposed to extending the EUâs competence to ever more areas and do not believe that aid is an issue for the EU.
We have therefore chosen to vote against the proposed report.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Morgantini (A6-0018/2004) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 2130/2001 on operations to aid uprooted people in Asian and Latin American developing countries.
I feel that the work being done by the European Community to help uprooted people of Asian and Latin American developing countries is crucial.
Regulation (EC) No 2130/2001, of 29Â October 2001, provides assistance to some of the most vulnerable groups in the world â those forced to flee their homes due to armed conflict.
This Regulation expires on 31Â December 2004, and states that extending it depends on the possibilities for âintegrating this Regulation within a single framework Regulation for Asia and Latin Americaâ.
This inconvenience may be averted by reducing the period of validity to two years â 2005 and 2006.
I feel that this amendment is essential for the Communityâs work with these communities to continue.
Â Â  . I welcome the support of the Committee on Development for the Commissionâs proposal aimed at extending the application of the existing Regulation on uprooted people â comprising refugees, displaced persons forced to take refuge outside their place of origin and former refugees or displaced persons â and âdemobilised former soldiersâ.
This instrument, which falls within the EUâs broadest policy on development assistance and aid, is extremely important and is so often the only hope, and the last hope, for thousands of people in particularly precarious situations.
I also welcome the trend in recent years towards gradually increasing appropriations.
Experience has shown the significant help provided by this type of action in preventing conflict, in reconciling the parties to a conflict, or in helping uprooted people or demobilised former soldiers to recover their personal effects and their property rights, and often represents their last hope of a fresh start.
Â Â  â We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have just voted in favour of the report as a whole.
We would like to stress, however, that we voted against publishing the outcome of individual votes in the ECB.
Despite this one vote against, we nevertheless approved the overall report.
We are, however, against the publication of individual votes.
Â Â  The choice of the Swedish people is that their country should not enter the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union and introduce the euro.
In spite of this, we ought to have views on the work of the ECB when it comes to actions that also affect the countries outside the eurozone.
The June List believes, however, that we should not adopt positions on the more specific proposals affecting the work of the ECB or the way it is set up, and we therefore choose not to adopt positions on the amendments before us.
We cannot however support paragraph 14, according to which Parliament wants to see increased propaganda for the euro.
Nor do we wish to support paragraph 15, according to which Parliament wishes all the old, and also the new, Member States to adopt the euro.
Sweden wishes to reserve the right to stay outside the eurozone.
We wish to emphasise that it is especially important for new countries strictly to comply with the requirement that the public debtâs share of GDP should not exceed 60%.
This requirement should not be applied as loosely as on previous occasions.
That is important in terms of the whole EUâs financial stability.
Â Â  I am voting against the report on the activities of the ECB.
The report endorses the ECB's monetary policy, despite the fact that it is partly responsible for the lack of growth in Europe and for a situation unfavourable to employment.
In fact, the ECB has rejected any strategy likely to favour a euro-dollar parity more favourable to exports and industry, in particular with a view to preventing too significant a fall in the dollar.
In a similar way, the ECB appears to have refused to tackle parities with currencies such as that of China. These parities hinder our exports and favour relocations (in many cases, this has more to do with the competitiveness of companies than do labour costs).
Its attitude makes it clear that the ECB does not have full employment as an objective.
I regret that the draft Constitution does not in any way change the situation and allows complete independence to continue without balancing the objectives of price stability and employment.
In conclusion, nothing about the situation in the eurozone can justify this blank cheque for the ECB.
Inflation has picked upÂ âÂ and whatever some people may have said, the introduction of the euro has unfortunately led to a rise in prices -Â exchange rates remain high and growth is weak.
Â Â  I have just voted in favour of the report on the ECB, from which MrÂ Lipietz has removed his name.
I was opposed to all of the amendments that would have led to its being watered down.
The ECB has done a very good job: it has maintained price stability and always safeguarded its independence.
In so doing it has won the confidence of the public and thus overcome much opposition to the euro.
We have reason to thank the former President, Wim Duisenberg: Jean-Claude Trichet is continuing where he left off.
As the independence of the ECBâs Executive Board must be preserved, I think it would be wrong to publish the results of roll-call votes.
There is sufficient transparency because the public and Parliament are informed directly of its decisions on monetary policy.
The quarterly âmonetary dialogueâ with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and our visits to Frankfurt deserve to be given wider public exposure.
The ECBâs commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact is exemplary.
It rightly points out that any patches of weak growth in the eurozone have not been caused by the Pact, which brings sustainable, inflation-free growth because of its insistence on sound budget management.
The âintelligent new interpretationâ being advocated by the EU Commission is an unintelligent manipulation of the principles of the Pact and gives tax evaders an improper alibi.
Â Â  . â The creation of the euro was identified in the mind of the workers with a wave of rises in the prices of basic consumer goods, with a harsh austerity policy and with rising unemployment and poverty for workers and benefits for employers.
The European Central Bank pioneered the pressure to squeeze wages, to reduce social spending and to change the insurance system for the benefit of private capital.
The European Central Bank's exclusive focus on the objective of price stability not only failed as regards basic consumer goods, it also contributed towards the emergence of worse working and living conditions for workers, more difficult access for small and medium-sized enterprises to the money market and the redistribution of wealth for the benefit of big business.
The single currency policy has proven to serve the united interests of big business and to exacerbate the significant differences which exist between national and local economies, putting the burden on the shoulders of the working and grass-roots classes.
We are and we always have been opposed to EMU because we support the workers' interests.
Today, the 'vision' of the euro has turned into the nightmare of the grass-roots family, which is why we are voting against the annual report of the European Central Bank, which has helped to increase unemployment and the social problems which blight the lives of grass-roots families.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report before us, because I believe, as the report says, that after five years, Economic and Monetary Union can thus far be considered an enormous success, thanks largely to the work of the European Central Bank and its predecessor, the European Monetary Institute.
It should be acknowledged that this is due to the diligence of Member States â particularly Member States such as Portugal â that have made sterling efforts to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact.
Nevertheless, also in accordance with the report, I recognise that the fragility of the European economy is not the result of its monetary policy, but is essentially due to the absence of structural reforms aimed at greater international and global competitiveness.
Â Â  . The report before us, strengthened in the final version that was rejected by the rapporteur, portrays Economic and Monetary Union as a âsuccess storyâ and offers unconditional support to the monetary orthodoxy pursued by the European Central Bank.
This is not a story that tells the truth as we understand it, and so we have rejected it.
People talk about the success of macroeconomic stability, yet there is proof that recent years have been characterised by slow economic growth and rising unemployment, and by the transfer of the workersâ productivity gains to the employers; there are still high levels of unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and salary inequality in the EU; restrictive monetary and fiscal policy have had a negative effect on economic growth and on employment, instead of helping economic recovery and combating unemployment.
The EU is a long way from being a homogenous economic area, given that considerable discrepancies still exist between Member States as regards the level of economic and regional development, of inflation and unemployment.
These discrepancies have been exacerbated by the single monetary policy and the cost of economic adjustments has been passed on to salaries and jobs, to the workers and the people.
Let us also not forget the inflationary effects of the euro on essential items and on bank rates and commissions that are not subject to suitable scrutiny.
Â Â  . I endorse various comments made by the rapporteur in his appraisal of the activities of the European Central Bank (ECB).
I agree that the ECB has been a factor in institutional and economic stability and that it has met the majority of its objectives.
It seems, however, increasingly peaceful â particularly given the increasing importance accorded to this body â that its mandate also encompasses âspecific support for the Lisbon objectivesâ.
Accordingly, it is important that we pursue more actively monetary and currency policies that promote the objectives of full employment based on competitiveness, of support for investment, and of combating the effects on the market of extremely high oil prices.
Lastly, I should like to highlight the fair criticism made by the rapporteur regarding the fact that many banks still charge a commission on transfers and exchanges of cheques between countries in the Eurozone.
Indeed, âas long as this is the case there will never be a âsingle currencyâ.
I regret that the rapporteur distanced himself from the adopted resolution during the final vote â and I find it strange that he left it until then to do so â because the adopted text does not differ a great deal from what had come from the committee concerned.
Â Â  Mr President, in my opinion, the way in which Martin Schulz, Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, set out to criticise the Dutch Presidency for not being present at the debate earlier on was most inappropriate.
The fact that he directed his remarks at Her Royal Highness, Queen Beatrix, was most inappropriate on a day when we were having a ceremonial debate in the presence of Queen Beatrix.
It is not appropriate for him to attempt, for political reasons, to attack the Dutch ...
Â Â  â Mrs Kauppi, excuse me for interrupting you, but what you are saying is not procedural.
Â Â  Â We will now move on to the next item, which is a joint debate on two reports on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the draft general budget for 2005.
Firstly, the report (A6-0021/2004) by MrÂ GarrigaÂ Polledo on the draft general budget for 2005 (SectionÂ III);
and the report (A6-0020/2004) by MrsÂ ElisabetÂ Jensen on the draft general budget for 2005 (SectionsÂ I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII).
There is a long list of speakers for the debate on these items, and I should like to ask the rapporteur, MrÂ GarrigaÂ Polledo, to take the floor.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the September part-session we said that the draft budget presented to us by the Council took an accounting approach rather than a political approach.
On Thursday we will vote here in Parliament on a clearly political reading of the budget.
It is political in that it reflects the political priorities on the basis of which the parliamentary groups and Members stood for the European elections on 13 June.
And we must remember that it was Parliament â the honourable Members â who stood for those elections, not the Council.
All the honourable Members have thereby made commitments to the electorate which include defending and promoting measures which I hope are reflected in the draft budget I am presenting for your approval.
It is also political in that it responds to one of the Councilâs habitual strategies, which is to fund its own priorities before it funds Parliamentâs.
In other words, through the vote on Thursday we shall try to create an interinstitutional balance, and without that balance the European Union cannot function properly.
I would like, Mr President, to address a few words to the Commissioner, because today is her last day as a member of the European Commission.
The Commissioner for Budgets always has a very difficult role to play between Parliament and the Council â two budgetary authorities which have no choice but to reach agreement, although on occasions it seems that agreement is a very long way off.
The Commissioner is to a large extent responsible for the budgetary peace over recent years and I would, therefore, like to point out that, thanks to the agreements she and her team have presented at the last minute, we have managed to resolve certain complicated situations.
I hope that she will be just as successful over the coming years in her new life beyond Brussels.
In any event, I want you to know that it has been a pleasure for everybody involved in the budget to work with you.
The patience and negotiating skills of the outgoing Commissioner â and of the new one, let us hope â are going to be required for this first reading of the European Parliament, because it is very different from the first reading by the Council.
As rapporteur and a veteran member of the Committee on Budgets for ten years, I am perfectly able to distinguish between the limits of what may be required and those of political reality.
But this House has positions on certain items it will not relinquish.
The reality is that the European Parliament is defending its priorities at a time when the budgetary situation is very difficult and very restrictive.
In general terms, we accept the Commission's preliminary draft budget as amended by the competent committees, the political groups and individual Members who have proposed amendments.
You are already aware that there has been a technical adjustment to the maximum limits of Headings 3, 4 and 5, which in themselves create an almost insoluble problem in terms of achieving the figures for the 2004 budget.
Mr Mulder â rapporteur for the 2004 budget â did a brilliant budgetary job.
I am trying to do the same thing this year, although I am aware that the financial resources available to me are less than last year.
The Council has cut internal policies by EUR 55 million from the preliminary draft budget, creating an impossible margin of EUR 108 million.
The amendments which the honourable Members have presented to this draft budget, in this Heading 3 alone, represent more than EUR 350 million.
And every single amendment is perfectly justified.
The Council has cut external policies by EUR 129Â million in comparison with the Commissionâs preliminary draft budget, leaving a margin of 14 million, when the negative margin in committee was EUR 115Â million and that already seriously jeopardised Parliamentâs traditional external priorities.
The amendments to this Heading 4 represent more than EUR 400 million, and I must consider them, in part, because they fundamentally respond to the wishes expressed by two important parliamentary committees: the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
In Heading 5 â the heading in which agreement may, in principle, have seemed the easiest to reach â the Council took it upon itself to make cuts which reduced the administrative spending of the Commission and the other institutions to one and a half points below the amount provided for in the Commission's preliminary draft and it is very difficult â as the Commissioner well knows â to maintain an administrative budget calculated to the last penny, if another institution then comes along and reduces it.
Thank heavens that the Commission â and I would congratulate the Commissioner once again in this regard â has managed to make an additional effort to save without reducing efficiency.
In any event, I would like to say that the European Parliament wishes to re-establish the administrative spending laid down in the preliminary draft budget.
Given these circumstances, we have had to establish a series of priorities. They are the following:
Firstly, the Lisbon strategy and its job creation and growth policies, because they are included in practically all the political programmes on the basis of which the honourable Members stood for election.
At a time of difficult and weak economic growth in the European Union, it would be suicidal not to strengthen those policies which are aimed precisely at growth, development and job creation.
We have therefore voted for amendments which increase these lines relating to the Lisbon strategy by EUR 80 million.
Secondly, communications strategy, in particular, because of the European elections and the low turnout at those elections, because of our enlargement and the need to explain the idea of the Union much better to the new citizens and because we are in the midst of a constitutional debate on the future of the European Union, this is another priority for Parliament and we have, therefore, presented an amendment to the tune of EUR 24 million.
Thirdly, strengthening security, the fight against terrorism and the consolidation of a European immigration and asylum strategy.
I believe this is a priority for all of you and, unfortunately, there is no need to explain why it must be a priority for Parliament and the European Union in 2005.
Fourthly, another of our fundamental priorities is the consolidation of the European Union's external action, with a particular emphasis on combating disease and poverty and assistance for geographical regions.
In this regard, we follow the principle that the European Union's new commitments cannot be achieved at the expense of Parliament's traditional priorities, or to put it another way, new commitments require new resources.
Fifthly, we want a very serious debate with the Council on the funding of the decentralised Agencies, which I shall analyse later.
I would like to emphasise the support received by the political groups in translating the priorities into budgetary amendments.
From the other coordinators I have received nothing but support and positive suggestions.
They have all sacrificed other priorities and they have all had to offer their colleagues complicated explanations of the decisions taken.
And this is a message I would like to make very clear to the Commission and the Council: this first reading expresses a clear and unequivocal political compromise for the November negotiation.
We are not going to vote for a second reading which abandons our priorities unilaterally.
If there are going to be any sacrifices, they must be made by all the institutions, by all of them.
Let us now move on to the reading by headings, remembering that the vote the European Parliament will take on Thursday will be on the budget as a whole and that, as such, when it comes to the negotiation, we will take it to the three-way dialogues and to conciliation.
In Heading 1 â Agriculture â we have voted for EUR 50Â 779 million in commitment appropriations.
Our reference has been the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission, but we still have to provide the appropriations necessary to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
In subheading 1b) we have a political priority expressed by the Committee on Budgets and which, as such, will be included in the vote on Thursday.
According to that, we raise the sum of EUR 57 million above the maximum limit of subheading 1b), the item which would go to the establishment and training of young farmers.
We have also increased appropriations on measures to eradicate animal diseases and food safety, because they are also Parliamentâs priorities.
In Heading 2 we are going to vote for EUR 42Â 378Â million in commitment appropriations.
Payments are the essential in this category, the category in which the amendments we present on payments have the greatest impact.
In order to prevent and absorb the RALs, which now amount, ladies and gentlemen, to EUR 122Â 000 million â which represent one budgetary year â we raise the draft preliminary budget in those lines in which the RALs double the annual commitments.
In the other lines, we support the Commissionâs requests for payments, which we hope the Council will take into consideration.
We are therefore raising our request for payments to EUR 3Â 800 million.
In Heading 3 â Internal Policies â we are voting for EUR 9Â 012 million, we leave a zero margin and are voting for an amendment with asterisk.
In any event â apart from the traditional horizontal amendments relating to performance facilities and improvements in execution â our fundamental intention in this heading is to hold very serious discussions with the Council on the funding of the Agencies.
Ladies and gentlemen, between 2000 and 2005 the number of decentralised Agencies has increased from 7 to 23 â this was Parliamentâs idea; I remember the budgetary procedure during which we adopted it.
The budgetary increase for the Agencies has risen from EUR 96 to 281 million and for the next 2005 budget we expect an increase of 20%.
The number of staff posts for the Agencies has risen from 418 in 2000 to 2695.
All of this has meant a reduction in the maximum limit for the heading of around EUR 134 million in order to fund other priorities.
I cannot accept this situation and I intend to hold very serious negotiations with the Council.
For the purposes of the negotiation with this Parliamentâs rapporteur for the Agencies â Mrs Haug â we have presented an amendment which affects all the Agencies and which represents a reduction of EUR 40Â million, leaving the budget for them at the level of the 2004 budget.
Our intention in this case is, firstly, to point out that the funding of any additional increase the Council intends for newly-established Agencies must be discussed with this Parliament, because with the financial straitjacket we are in, with the financial perspectives set from 2000 to 2006, this annual increase in the Agencies already has to be at the expense of Parliamentâs priorities, and the Agencies are not Parliamentâs only priority, although the Agencies do, of course, need to be funded and we are committed to that as well.
I would like to talk about pilot projects.
We have already agreed on a package acceptable to the political groups.
Some of them are extremely important, such as the pilot projects for small and medium-sized businesses, combating terrorism, nuclear arms reduction and conflict prevention.
I believe we are producing a broad and ambitious package.
In a similar way, in terms of preparatory actions I would like to stress the parliamentary agreement on the voluntary return of immigrants, on aid in the fight against poverty-related diseases â for which we allocate EUR 10 million, which I believe constitutes significant financial support â and, furthermore, the new strategy we have employed of treating certain pilot projects as studies.
Finally, in Heading 4 we have voted for EUR 5Â 119Â million â plus an amendment with asterisk.
What is basically happening in Heading 4 is that we are once again faced with having to fund Iraq.
This funding was not scheduled for 2005 and what is being proposed is that we fund it at the expense of Parliamentâs traditional priorities, like the external policy voted for by Parliament this year, the previous year and in 2000.
This is not acceptable either.
Taking account, therefore, of the suggestions of the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have requested that this heading be funded with the new resources provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement in the additional sum of EUR 190 million.
At the same time we call in to question â or we place within the same package â the common foreign and security policy, which is very important to this Parliament, but its funding must be considered within the general framework of what needs to be funded in Heading 4.
Mr President, we are presenting a proposal which I hope will be voted for by a large majority of our fellow Members on Thursday and which will provide us with a serious position for negotiating with the Council, because I would insist that what we are taking into consideration are the political priorities this Parliament has set itself.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Minister, Commissioner, I wish firstly to say thank you to Commissioner Schreyer, who is taking part in her last budget reading today, and, in common with MrÂ Garriga, I find that quite sad.
I can remember, when you started a little over five years ago, how relations were between Parliament and the Commission in the area of the budget.
There was almost a chill in the air on entering a committee room to talk about budgetary matters, because relations were not good after the fall of the Santer Commission.
There was quite a lot of mistrust between the Commission and Parliament, and many hard words were spoken.
I think that, through your way of working, MrsÂ Schreyer, and through the way in which you have tackled things, you have made a very large contribution to rebuilding trust between Parliament and the Commission.
You deserve thanks for that.
I really do think there have been fantastic successes throughout these five years.
I must say something about the budgets for the other institutions.
We together decided, MrÂ Garriga and I, to follow a strategy in which we tried to find as many funds as possible under expenditure heading five so that we might return many of the savings agreed by the Council and so be able to meet the desire for staff increases as a result of enlargement, staffing reform and changes to financial management.
If we look at the budgets for the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, the budget that we are now presenting, and that was adopted in the Committee on Budgets, has increased by EURÂ 10Â million in respect of the preliminary budget from the Council.
We have, then, returned close on two thirds of the Councilâs savings, and that in actual fact makes it possible for all the institutions to implement the desired staff appointments as a result of enlargement and staffing reform and the reform of financial management.
I am pleased that, in dialogue with the institutions, a solution has successfully been found that can satisfy everybody, or at least I hope it can, and I would thank you for your constructive work in this process.
I think it was especially unfair that the Councilâs savings hit the budgets for the Ombudsman and the Data Protection Supervisor.
These are small new institutions which are in the process of development, and I feel that the solution we have found in the Committee on Budgets is a reasonable result for these two institutions.
On the other hand, we have only a very modest margin below the ceiling for the administrative expenditure.
We have, in a way, almost used up the margin.
I understand that new statistics from Eurostat show that wages will increase less than we had originally expected in 2005.
When we reach the budget figures during second reading, the pressure on the administrative expenditure will therefore be less than we had at first believed, so we may perhaps, in spite of everything, find a margin.
We have also, in different institutions, investigated the possibility of whether, through accelerated payments this year, we might help create some leeway in the budget for next year.
Last but not least, the institutions should of course continually ensure that administration takes place as efficiently and inexpensively as possible so that financial surpluses are prevented through cooperation between the institutions.
Where Parliamentâs budget is concerned, we have kept this down to 20% of administrative expenditure, that is to say 20% of the money under expenditure heading five.
That level seems quite reasonable in relation to needs.
I nonetheless wish to emphasise that, in recent years, it has been possible, within our budget â that is to say, within the 20% â for Parliament to expend quite a significant amount on buildings, thereby saving ourselves rent in future yearsâ budgets.
There is a clear desire in the Committee on Budgets for us, in connection with such investments, to obtain increased transparency in Parliamentâs budget.
We are in the process of having two new buildings constructed in connection with Parliamentâs building in Brussels.
These two new buildings will cost more than EURÂ 300 million, and it must be assumed that the contractual negotiations are now at last progressing quickly enough for it to be possible, both this year and in 2005, to pay off a portion of this sum.
There is still the hope that it will soon be possible for a statute of members, which will guarantee MEPs uniform financial conditions, to be adopted for Parliament.
The fact remains, however, that, even if a statute of members is adopted very quickly, it will take some time getting the new system to operate in practice.
It is uncertain to how many MEPs a statute of members will apply at first, for there will obviously be a number of transitional arrangements.
We have therefore thought it most sensible not to state an actual amount for what the statute of members might cost in 2005. A figure with what is called a âp.m.â () is quoted.
In the 2005 budget, EURÂ 17.5Â million has, moreover, been appropriated to increasing the remuneration paid to MEPsâ secretariats.
At the moment, some investigative committee work is under way in which we are looking at whether our rules can be written out in a clearer and more easily understandable way, and we in the Committee on Budgets have entered the amount for increasing the secretariatsâ remuneration in the reserve while we await an actual decision from the Bureau.
An amount has also been appropriated from Parliamentâs budget to a campaign concerning the new Constitutional Treaty.
It is not a campaign in the sense that we have to go out and engage in propaganda, but Parliamentâs leaders have felt that we in the European Parliament have a quite specific duty to ensure that the population of the EU is informed about what this Treaty really contains and is given a knowledge it can use as a basis for the votes that are to take place in the individual countries.
It will be the national governments and national parties that do the information work with a view to the actual campaigns prior to the votes.
It was felt that we have a special obligation, and that is something with which, in a way, I agree.
We have a special obligation to provide information about what is contained in the new Constitutional Treaty, and that is what the amount appropriated from the budget is to be used for.
In its agreement, Parliamentâs Committee on Budgets maintained the gentlemenâs agreement with the Council.
We, for our part, do not interfere in the Councilâs budget, and the Council does not, for its part, interfere in ours.
In the course of our negotiations, amendments were, however, tabled that, in actual fact, cut into the Councilâs budget for administration of the common foreign and security policy and, at the same time, cut into Parliamentâs budget, namely that for the buildings reserve.
The proposal was not accepted by the Committee on Budgets, but was retabled here in plenary.
However much sympathy I may have for the intention behind the proposal, I did not, as rapporteur, recommend or support it.
The intention behind this proposal is, of course, to press the Council to bring about greater transparency in the administration of the common foreign and security policy.
It is, to a large extent, the growing expenditure in this field that has led to a rate of increase of almost 5% in the Councilâs budget for 2005, while the budgets of the other institutions have increased by a little over 3%.
I very much agree that we should ensure transparency and also ensure that no items are entered in this part of the Councilâs budget that should properly be part of the action expenditure.
I would therefore repeat my appeal to the Council to keep a tighter rein on the budget and to ensure greater transparency.
I must emphasise that, from Parliamentâs point of view, the expenditure on the common foreign and security policy does not form part of the gentlemenâs agreement.
It is obviously an area that we shall discuss further over the next few years.
In turn, we in Parliament shall, of course, also keep an eye on our administrative expenditure and continually look to see whether there is scope for savings and increases in efficiency.
That is something I believe we owe our taxpayers.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Garriga Polledo, on the excellent work he has done and his tireless quest for an always difficult consensus in the field of foreign policy.
As in previous years, it has not been easy, as he himself has pointed out.
It has not been easy because we have once again had to deal with the funding of new priorities on the basis of the same resources and at the expense of the European Union's traditional foreign action priorities â and I am referring of course to the Balkans, to the policy of neighbourliness, to CFSP actions, to action in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia.
We therefore hope, Mr President, that a solution can be found to these difficulties which arise every year by revising the financial perspectives so that we do not have to resolve these situations every financial year âfrom hand to mouthâ.
We therefore fully support the rapporteur's approach of obtaining EUR 190Â million in extra funding â and I would like to add that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has asked the Commission to present a report on the application of the democratic clause â and at the same time to intensify action in the field of cooperation with the United Nations.
Mr President, I would also like to repeat Parliamentâs demand that the Commission consider creating a bi-regional solidarity fund between the European Union and Latin America which would not involve additional sums.
I would also like to join the other Members in offering Commissioner Schreyer our best wishes in the next stage of her life, while not forgetting that Commissioners leave but officials remain.
I do not wish to recall the climate of the discussion we have held this morning in Parliament, but I would like to ask you to be very attentive, to take into consideration and not forget the decisions and priorities established by this Parliament as an arm of the Budgetary Authority.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to thank MrÂ Garriga Polledo for his extremely competent work on the budget in a difficult situation.
I also wish to express my satisfaction at the fact that, during the last five years, the Commission has appreciably improved reporting on activities in the development area, which is the area with which we work in the committee that I am representing in the House today.
A lot remains to be done, especially on developing measurements of results, but progress has undoubtedly been made.
There is considerable agreement in the committee I represent as to the need for the EU, in its external activities, to give maximum attention to the issues of poverty and the millennium objectives.
If this is to be possible, a larger proportion of the budget must, however, give priority to efforts in countries with low incomes.
At present, only slightly more than 40% of the money ends up in those countries.
We have therefore proposed changes to the distribution and, of course, also additions to the Councilâs proposals, both to strengthen efforts to combat HIV, malaria and TB, and specifically to allocate more aid to Asia, the region in which far and away the largest number of poor people live.
We also propose a new budget item totalling EURÂ 10Â million to enable us to be proactive in efficiently tackling diseases other than HIV, malaria and TB that claim many millions of lives each year, especially among children.
These proposals can only be put into practice if use can be made of the flexibility mechanism.
We have no objections whatsoever to contributing to the reconstruction in Iraq.
On the contrary. We cannot, however, accept its impairing our long-term efforts to combat poverty.
Since the Committee on Budgetsâ proposals were presented, I have, finally, tabled three amendments at the request of the Committee on Development.
They do not involve more money, but are about moving a number of budget items from Title 19 of the budget, External Relations, to Title 21, Development Cooperation.
We do not understand why efforts to combat poverty in Asia and Latin America should be given a different heading and position in the budget than corresponding efforts in Africa.
The budget should reflect political objectives and not the Commissionâs organisational structure.
I hope our demands are supported, not only at first, but also at second, reading.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Committee on International Trade's demands are very modest and we are pleased that the Committee on Budgets has agreed to the two key demands that we made.
First we objected to the Council's reductions from the preliminary draft budget in terms of staffing for DG Trade.
Given the extent of the talks taking place at WTO level, the number of disputes that now go before the WTO disputes panel and the need to open further external offices of the European Union, we thought that to cut the DG Trade's budget was unacceptable.
I am pleased to say that the Committee on Budgets agreed with us and through the global amendment has restored those cuts.
The second issue that the Committee on International Trade had concerns about was the need to have a parliamentary forum to follow the work of the WTO.
Again we wanted to make sure there was a budget line to finance that parliamentary forum and again the Committee on Budgets agreed with us.
So the Committee on International Trade is very happy that the Committee on Budgets has approved, in their entirety, both the amendments we put forward.
I hope now that this House will back the Committee on Budgets and that the Council will accept the amendments made by Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, respecting Parliamentâs desired political guidelines is an almost impossible task every year.
For 2005, it was completely impossible, as it has been in other years, because, despite the agreement on the financial perspectives in force, the Councilâs priorities mean not providing the resources our ambitions require.
Respecting our priorities has, therefore, more to do with squaring the books than with reality.
That has led the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to follow the strategy proposed by our rapporteur, MrÂ GarrigaÂ Polledo, whom I thank.
This strategy consists of prioritising the policies decided on by Parliament, while calling on the Council to fulfil its commitments in terms of the operation of the agencies, just as for Heading V and the Unionâs external policies, where the aid promised for Iran can be funded without difficulty from the sums available from the flexibility instrument of more than EUR 450 million.
Only this strategy has allowed us to produce a budget which reflects the very reasonable orientations established by the Socialist Group for the European Union in 2005.
With regard to Heading I, we are aware that we are only consulted and, with regard to HeadingsÂ II and V, which do not raise any great problems today, we have followed the rapporteur.
Nevertheless, by providing this draft budget with such reduced funding and distributing money in a random manner, the Council is expecting us to abandon what we hold most dear in terms of European integration: solidarity.
By that I mean solidarity between the peoples of Europe, but also solidarity between Europe and the rest of the world.
Without the involvement of the European Parliament, we would have had to choose between the geographical regions benefiting from the Unionâs development policy.
This is contrary to how we European Socialists view the geographical scope of the Unionâs cooperation.
We cannot create a hierarchy of suffering, hunger or oppression.
We must act in any region we can, and provide ourselves with the necessary resources to do so.
That is why, when we voted in committee, all the lines dedicated to cooperation were reinforced, regardless of geography.
Similarly, we have reinforced the budgetary lines dedicated to the Lisbon strategy, for SMEs, employment and social dialogue.
We believe that solidarity means prioritising growth and employment, because solidarity means sharing the fruits of growth.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, our last priority is inspired by European solidarity and consists of making the European Unionâs information policy one of our fundamental policies.
For the Union to be able to continue its actions, it is urgent that people understand the work it does.
Our priority is to make the European Unionâs intentions clear and visible.
In our societies faced with violence and the spectre of recession, and witnessing the war in Iraq and in the world, the Union must be seen as a model for economic growth based on solidarity.
This is the main requirement if we are to combat terrorism and continue to bring peace.
Our budget, which we are presenting and on which we will vote on Thursday, must respect our priorities and be our main tool for implementing our political project.
Finally, I do not wish to end without thanking our Commissioner, MrsÂ Schreyer, most warmly for the all the work she has done over the last five years.
Like MrsÂ Jensen, I must acknowledge everything she has contributed to the budgetary procedure, to its renewal and modernisation.
Mrs Schreyer, on behalf of my group, I would like thank you most warmly for what you have done together with us, the European Parliament, over the last five years, and wish you every success in continuing your work of pursuing our Unionâs greatest possible democratic well-being.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to echo the words of thanks, not only to Commissioner Schreyer, but also to our rapporteur, Mr Garriga.
There were times when he enabled me to keep my good temper.
The Committee on Budgets has wanted to simplify matters on a number of scores, which has been at the expense of some amendments tabled by us on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Indeed, the Committee on Budgets has divided all the proposed amendments, that is to say, it has voted on the amendments pertaining to agencies and subsequently on everything related to Lisbon, the information strategy and pilot projects.
That means that in this vote takes as its starting point the obligations and payments for 2004.
That is not straightforward, because no consideration has been given to the fact that ten new Member States have joined and that for those ten new Member States new activities need to be developed.
For example, Bilbao has been given additional tasks relating to small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is not easy to keep these within the budget of 2004.
We at the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are therefore not happy with the failure to adopt some of our changes to certain items.
We do hope that the amendments tabled by the members of the Socialist Group in the area of social affairs, including our own amendments, will as yet be adopted.
Indeed, I would very much like to be able to join with Mr Ferber, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, in once again raising a glass to our future successful cooperation.
With regard to the technical bureau and information that the employeesâ organisations have tabled by way of a proposal, we hope to reach agreement again.
I would like to thank Mr Ferber, as well as the rapporteur, at this stage for the way in which they are meeting us halfway.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Environment Committee is a committee with significant legislative powers, but it is also a committee with a very small budget, and the only financial instrument for the environment, the LIFE Programme, has had its funding cut yet again in the 2005 budget compared with 2004.
We are actually very thrifty.
Expenditure under the environment heading is not even 0.25% of the European budget, that is, less than a quarter of 1%.
In addition, it is our impression that the Environment DG has insufficient staff to implement the policies that we want.
The same applies, incidentally, to the Health and Consumer Protection DG.
And when we hear the word âhealthâ of course we all immediately think âtobaccoâ.
That is clear.
We spend more than EURÂ 950 million on subsidies to tobacco growers.
That is more than five and a half times as much as the entire environment budget.
However, we allocate only EURÂ 14 million to developing alternatives for tobacco growers.
This has to change!
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that this debate on the future of the European Union is happening today, for the future is always about money and where it is invested, and I believe that we are going the right way about investing in the Lisbon agenda, having allocated EURÂ 92 million to preparatory measures and pilot projects, and EURÂ 49 million to the financial environment, concentrating on the economic divide in the border regions.
I believe that it is the latest developments â the crisis in the motor industry, the rise in energy prices â that demonstrate the necessity of our gearing the European Budget up for growth, and appropriate communication also has a part to play in this.
Over the next five years, we will be devoting much attention to the theme of information policy.
We have to do a much better job of explaining Europe.
In the run-up to the elections, we could see that there were various elements strategically ganging up on the European Union and on democracy in Europe.
I believe that we have the task of explaining to the public what goes on in this place and how important Europeâs position in the world will be for us in the future.
It is for that reason, too, that we are committed to the infopoints, to the campaign for Europeâs future, to the Carrefours, to Prince, to all these important things, in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens and to explain it.
We all see the âIntelligent Energy for Europeâ programme as being very important too.
With energy prices in mind, I hope that we will add more in future.
In this House, we should even now be starting to get our technical infrastructure, whether it be information and communication technology or the Internet and television up to the very latest state of the art and trying to become the most modern parliament in the world.
Â Â  . Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen.
I, too, will gladly do my bit towards our becoming the most modern parliament in the world, even though my contribution, in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, will be a modest one.
In considering the Budget, we set clear priorities, particularly with regard to the Lisbon agenda.
Concrete initiatives to push forward the Lisbon agenda, including in this Budget procedure, are more important than a constant succession of statements, whether by the Heads of State and Government, or sometimes by us ourselves, that cost those who make them nothing.
We still regard the internal market as being at the heart of our competition strategy, and, seeing as there has been no change in the obstacles to it, we have proposed allocating funds to the holding of another forum on the internal market in order to discuss the various minor obstacles remaining in the internal market with those who are affected by them, thus enabling us to fashion forward-looking legislative instruments to deal with them.
We in the Internal Market Committee also regard the eastward enlargement as potentially crucial in promoting growth, prosperity and employment, but we do of course also see that there are still difficulties involved in getting economies to grow together across borders.
For that reason, we are proposing a pilot project for the formation of clusters in the border regions, through which strategic alliances can be forged.
We also regard the internal market for consumers as still having considerable potential for enhancing our competitiveness and have, to this end, allocated funds for the fields of food safety and the combating of diseases in animals.
I myself would also like to extend warm thanks to Commissioner Schreyer for her cooperation.
It is a fact of life that those responsible for the Budget may make a lot of enemies and annoy a lot of people, but they also make some friends.
When it comes to the border regions, though, they have become friends, as has the rapporteur on our Budget, Mr Garriga Polledo, and for that many thanks.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, we too in the Committee on Transport and Tourism would like to thank Commissioner Schreyer for the work she has done.
The same is true of us as of the other committees: sometimes our expectations are greater than the funds available to us, and that is why, rather than setting new priorities, we have tried at least to allocate the necessary funds to what has been agreed jointly by the Council, the Commission and Parliament, so that the public can have confidence that what you announce will then be done.
I want to give three examples of this, and one thing they relate to is safety and the environment.
Frequent reference has been made to the agencies in this debate.
We do not take a sympathetic view, when, for example, the three partners come to a clear consensus on policies on railway safety, safety in the air and the combating of marine pollution, and then along comes the Council and reduces the funds for these to nothing.
When that happens, we are no longer talking in terms of technical decisions about finance, but about policy decisions on the Budget.
I think the indications from the Transport Committee have been very clear, namely that we have to make the funds available at least for our shared policy objectives, particularly when it is the environment and safety that are at stake.
We are familiar with the problems of transport, which affect us internationally, nationally, and also locally.
The public expect more than just crisis management; they expect signs, and a sustainable policy in these fields.
Secondly â and I regard this as having been very important â we also give priority to the trans-European networks.
We must not forget that there are now 25 of us, rather than 15.
We were realistic in our estimates of the expenditure authorisations, bearing in mind the current situation and the Commissionâs depiction of it.
Although we know that there is no point in providing money in excess of the projects currently being tackled, we also want to send a message to the effect that we aspire to planning, in future, a trans-European network including the 25 countries and more besides, and the new countries, who are represented in this House, expect the same priorities to be set.
Mobility and transport fall between the economy, safety and the environment and affect all the citizens who want to live together in Europe.
For that reason I would like to see good financial provision made for these well-known priorities.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of the Regional Policy Committee, I too would like to express my gratitude â both to the rapporteur and to the Commissioner â for the good cooperation over the past five years.
As far as Structural Funds and regional policy are concerned, there are three prominent aspects of the 2005 Budget procedure to be noted.
The first is that 2005 is the first complete financial year for the Europe of Twenty-Five.
Secondly, and in consequence of that, it is only right that the overall funds available in the preliminary draft Budget for regional policy were increased, the payment appropriations to a greater extent than the commitment appropriations, where the increase was more modest.
Thirdly, the way in which the funds have been appropriated makes it clear that, in the case of eight new Member States, there is a continuing transition from the pre-accession instruments to support being given from the Cohesion Fund.
The Council has made cuts in the preliminary draft Budget that we regard as unacceptable.
In the Budget procedure, the Committee on Regional Development has done no more than avail itself of its right to use amendments as a means of restoring the amounts cut by the Council â with reference, of course, to the Budget expenditure as a whole.
To sum up, every one of the amendments we called for and adopted provides only for the restoration of the Budget line to what it was in the preliminary draft Budget, thereby preventing the regional policy budget from being cut.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, for his work, since he has shown great sensitivity towards the issue of agriculture in the budget for next year, and also the members of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Agriculture because, amongst all of them, they have cooperated and their work has helped to make the agricultural part of the budget for next year magnificent.
The amendments have moved in the general direction for the agricultural budget of re-establishing the draft preliminary budget presented by the Commission, because the Council had cut it in an arbitrary manner, using saving as their only criterion and without taking account of the different agricultural items.
I am pleased with the increase in aid to young European farmers and I would like to point out once again that the average age of a European farmer is over 50 and that henceforth this is the biggest problem facing European agriculture.
Furthermore, I wish to reject the proposed cut to aid for tobacco, reminding all of you that this issue has already been debated in this House and that we decided on a cut of 50% from 2010 and that from 2006 the cut should begin in a modulated fashion from a minimum of 40%, and the debate was therefore settled at that point, to the satisfaction of the opponents of tobacco cultivation.
I therefore do not believe we should return to this issue during the current budgetary debate.
In addition, I also believe there is no place for Amendment No 285, which opposes aid to cattle rearing, because there is no legal basis for combating cattle rearing and this would therefore create discrimination.
If we want to open a debate on that, it will have to be about bull-fighting: this aid is not for Spainâs national fiesta.
Furthermore, with regard to the cuts to aid for exports, and particularly for exports of beef, I believe that the COM is still open and the Doha round will tell us what the solution must be when it closes.
This is not, therefore, the time.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to thank the general rapporteur for the budget and I must point out that the majority of our amendments have been accepted by the Committee on Budgets.
What have been the essential objectives of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries?
Firstly, to reincorporate the appropriations unjustifiably cut by the Council from the draft preliminary budget presented by the Commission in relation to two important issues: international fisheries agreements in relation to cuts of payments from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance.
Secondly, there has been an amendment, also accepted by the Committee on Budgets, relating to the new Community agency for fisheries control, in which this Parliament has shown great interest and which requires a contribution so that it can be implemented urgently.
I would like to insist on two amendments, which have been rejected by the Committee on Budgets, and which I would like to present once again.
They are Amendments Nos 98 and 99.
The first, relating to the regional advisory councils, and the second, relating to the increase in aid for improving scientific information.
Mr President, the fisheries advisory councils have been the great innovation of the reform and the only instrument we have for ensuring the participation of the sector in the decision-making process.
This Parliament's objective is for all the councils provided for in the Community legislation to be operational during next year and in order to achieve this, we need an increase of some EUR 500 000.
In the second case, relating to improving scientific information, neither the Council nor the Commission have provided for an increase on last year.
Neither does the Sixth Framework Research Programme provide for anything.
We believe that a budget of EUR 1.5 million for this issue is not too much to ask.
Mr President, I believe that we, unlike other committees, have only proposed an increase of EUR 3 million compared to the preliminary draft budget; I would therefore ask you to support the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, speaking as rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education, I would like to start by stressing that our Budget policy over the coming years should reflect our identity as a continent of art, culture and cultural diversity, in which we, as Europeans, take such pride.
For that reason, it is not fortuitous that all the members of the Culture Committee took the view that we had to reject the Councilâs reduction in funds for cultural policy, for there can be no credible cultural policy in a Europe of 25 Member States if the funds for it are cut in 2005, the first year in which there is a single Budget for all of them.
For that reason members of the Culture Committee, from whatever political groups they came, demanded above all the restoration of the Commissionâs Budget estimates for town twinning and information policy, in order to gain the publicâs acceptance, as also for the youth programmes.
These in particular are the areas affecting the public.
We should do something to show that, in the cultural field too, we are prepared to take up the cudgels for this wonderful Europe of ours.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs, too, is one of those with small demands to make on the Budget, for our share in it, on the management of which we are consulted, is probably in the order of a few thousandths of the whole.
The point to which I want to draw attention is extraordinarily significant, quite simply because it is the only one, and it is that the Legal Affairs Committeeâs remit includes the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance.
The public often complain that proceedings in them often take a very long time and that decisions are taken only at a very late stage in them; this often happens when they deal with matters of great public importance.
Let me make it quite clear that the reason for this is not to be found with the judges but elsewhere, namely in the inadequate capacity for translating documentation and forms.
If we were, by means of this Budget, to succeed in making an appropriate contribution to adapting the ECJâs equipment to current circumstances and requirements, that would be a great triumph, and one that would benefit the many members of the European public who have recourse to the law to resolve their disputes.
Finally, there is no doubt that the ECJ plays an outstanding part in the further development and integration of Europe, and so I think it appropriate that it should be properly equipped to enable it to do justice to its task.
If this Budget helps to do this, we in the Legal Affairs Committee will be content, for then an essential objective will have been achieved.
Even if not everything can be completed this year, it will be a step in the right direction if there is continuous development towards this end.
That concludes my statement on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, I would like to begin by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets and in particular the general rapporteur, our friend Mr Garriga Polledo, for having supported and approved the majority of the amendments presented by our committee.
I would like to highlight four of them.
Firstly, following the Fourniret affair, which has recently shaken Belgium and France, we have provided for a new budgetary line to allow the Commission to make proposals with a view to organising the interconnection of national registers of criminal convictions for crimes such as paedophilia, sexual assault and serious crimes committed by repeat offenders.
Secondly, with regard to the visa information system, commonly know as the VIS, we have put most of the appropriations in reserve, and they will not be released until the Commission has presented a second proposal precisely defining the architecture and functioning of the VIS system itself, as it has said it will.
This is a delicate area in terms of the protection of personal information.
Thirdly, with regard to the Agency for the management of external borders, we have placed all the appropriations in reserve.
It is not that we question the importance of that agency and the need to make it operational as quickly as possible, quite the opposite, but we shall release the appropriations in reserve when the Council has made the decision on the final headquarters of the agency.
We call on the Council to give its opinion before the end of this year.
If this is a strategic agency, it cannot be content with a provisional headquarters with all the costs and operational inconvenience that would entail.
Fourthly, we have also put in reserve most of the appropriations requested for the line relating to the rights of passengers.
We all know the differences of opinion between Parliament and the Commission on this, with regard to the level of protection for the personal information which airlines must communicate to the American customs authorities.
The Commission has promised on several occasions that the current passive system for communicating data, the PULL system, would be replaced with an active system, the PUSH system.
So far, the Commission has done nothing.
The appropriations will be released when the Commission has fulfilled its commitments.
I must end by mentioning a final amendment which the Committee on Budgets has unfortunately not retained, to my regret.
It concerns the Commission's desire to launch a preparatory action in the field of managing the return of immigrants who are not authorised to remain in Union territory.
Of course it is desirable and urgent to organise better cooperation amongst the Member States in this field, but it must be done according to rules, and in a preparatory action there are no rules.
In accordance with DeclarationÂ 5, annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Heads of State or Government have formally been calling on the Council to rule on this issue since 1 May 2004, pursuant to the procedure laid down in ArticleÂ 251, that is to say, qualified majority and codecision.
The Council has done nothing, ignoring the will of the Heads of Government and the rights of Parliament.
I would like the Councilâs institutional infringement to be penalised, in accordance with Amendment No 146 presented by the Committee on Civil Liberties.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, how can the views of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs be summed up in sixty seconds?
It is very simple.
First of all, we wanted to re-establish what the Council had taken away: I am referring in particular to the budget lines relating to the information relays or the Jean Monnet action programme.
It was, however, when we came to the Prince programme in particular that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs had to pinch itself to see if it had really understood the figures before its eyes.
We were amazed to discover that the Commission had divided the sum for 2004 by three at a time when we are about to enter the decisive stage in the public debate on the Constitution.
Was it really possible that it had escaped the Commissionâs attention that a debate on the Constitutional Treaty was going to start on 18 June?
The Council, however, had no such excuse, since the Council knew in the summer that a draft Constitution was on the table and that it was essential that it be debated.
That is why our committee is not content simply with re-establishing this budget line, but wishes to multiply the figure proposed by the Commission by five, raising it to seven and a half million.
Democracy does not have a price but it does have a cost, and I hope that the Council will finally understand that.
As my fellow Members have done, I would like to end by congratulating our Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, on the excellent work she has done over the last five years with this Parliament, and on another more personal note, I would like to express my hope, my dear Michaele, that tomorrow, on the turn of a vote, your mandate will be extended by a few weeks.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I too wish to thank the Commissioner for having, over recent years, supported the Committee on Womenâs Rights in its endeavour to advance gender budgeting.
As our committee does not have that many Budget lines to administer, this horizontal policy is of particular importance to us.
I have to say, however, that I agree with Mr Prodiâs assessment that successes have not been conclusive everywhere.
As with the Lisbon strategy, we have given gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming a fixed place in the Structural Funds, but, at the end of the day, only 6% goes to gender-centred projects.
Hence it has been our great concern that the amendments should be used to achieve progress in this area by laying down minimum margins in the major programmes, in MEDA, in the major cooperation programmes, including those with other countries, in aid for Afghanistan and for Iraq.
It is regrettable that the Committee on Budgets was unwilling to go down this road; it stated that part of these sums was to be used for gender-centred projects, but actually lacked the courage for this.
If we really want change, minimum rates must be laid down.
I think more debate on this is called for, and we need to muster the courage to do this.
Where the Committee on Womenâs Rights does have competences is in the field of gender mainstreaming under the Framework Programme, but it is again and again becoming apparent to us that we lack reliable data on how EU funds are spent on women and on men.
It is therefore very important that we should get the gender institute started.
Although the Council has voted in favour of the idea, the whole thing is meant to be run in a budget-neutral way, in other words, it is not allowed to cost anything, and women are allowed to do as they like if it does not.
That is not acceptable, so what we want is to introduce at least a token entry for the gender institute.
I would also like to mention a project from the DAPHNE programme, that being the European Year against Violence against Women.
Many approaches have been made to the Commission seeking its support for this, but if you want something done, you do it yourself, so let us declare the âYear against Violenceâ!
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my first speech to this House as a member of the European Commission five years ago was, of course, about the 2000 Budget.
It was a Budget for only 15 Member States, for a Union of only 375 million people.
It was in that Budget that pre-accession aid was adopted for the first time, from which funds flowed to six states with which negotiations were in progress.
What I expect to be my last speech to this House has to do with the first Budget for a European Union with 25 Member States.
That sums up the historic change that we have brought about in those five years.
Not one day goes past when I do not rejoice that we have managed to overcome the division of Europe, and that now, here in Strasbourg and in Brussels, policies can be made for a Union of 450 million people.
What a great development!
The European Budget has also become steadily more important and an important tool for European policy.
For that reason, it must be solid; it must be developed within a reliable framework; it must be set out transparently and implemented efficiently.
I am glad that, in these five years, we have managed to reform and modernise the Budget procedure as a whole â not only in drawing up a now more political Budget, but also in structuring one that is activity-based.
The Budget itself has become more political.
The new Budget Regulation and the reformed accounting system were major feats of strength on the part of all the institutions together â Parliament, Commission, Council, and the Court of Auditors as well.
I would like to extend very, very warm thanks for these great shared efforts and for this very efficient cooperation, particularly of course to the members of the Committee on Budgets, of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and to the members of the Councilâs Budget Committee.
It was another feat of strength on the part of the Budget Committee to package, process and prioritise the many amendments tabled by Members to the Budget for 2005, and I compliment the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, who has drafted this report and the many amendments to it with the sure-footedness of one who is very experienced in budgeting.
Congratulations on this achievement!
My compliments also to the new chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
It is always a very difficult task to take over such an important and difficult task in the midst of a Budget procedure.
The committee under your chairmanship is also a very fine one, with very fine members.
Over recent years, Budgets have been at their lowest in the recent history of their kind in the European Union.
As Commissioner for the Budget, I am very proud of the fact, for it shows that we are working in strict accordance with the principles of budgetary discipline, but the relative reduction in recent yearsâ budgets was intended to make room for the taking on of new tasks, in particular of expenditure destined for the new Member States, which they will indeed receive.
Agenda 2000, the current Financial Perspective, made provision for this.
The Financial Perspective makes corresponding provision for the 2005 Budget to have an upper limit of EURÂ 119 billion in commitment appropriations, equivalent to 1.14% of the gross national income of the Union of Fifteen, and we always have to remind ourselves of that when considering what the Financial Perspective should be like in the future.
According to all the institutions â the Council, Parliament and the Commission â the 2005 Budget requires at least EURÂ 116 billion in commitment appropriations.
The three institutionsâ proposals for commitment appropriations differ only very slightly.
Why is this so?
It is, of course, because there is very little room for manoeuvre, as so much was laid down both by Agenda 2000 and in the accession treaties.
There is, however, a great disparity in the estimates of the actual amount to be spent or paid next year.
It does, of course, depend on what is being estimated, and on how much is to be taken up.
We have to be serious about ensuring that voting commitment appropriations actually results in the money being paid out in succeeding years, and so the Commission cannot in fact support the cuts that the Council has proposed in this area.
We are grateful to your House for insisting that at least the funds we proposed must be reinstated, and indeed, for proposing an increase in them.
We are talking specifically here about the take-up of funds from the Structural Funds.
All the parties concerned have joined together over recent years in making an effort to improve implementation, and now we have succeeded, in that, this year, take-up of funds is much improved in comparison with what it had been in the past.
For this year, then, we have applied for an additional EURÂ 2Â billion as means of payment for the Structural Funds, as there is demand for them on the part of the Member States.
We can therefore safely work on the assumption that implementation will work very well next year too.
Let me move on to personnel issues and to administrative expenditure.
2005 will be the second year of the enlarged EU, and the Commission is asking for a second of additional staff in order to be able to handle the greater requirements of an enlarged Union.
Mrs Jensen noted that the Council is awarding itself a far greater increase in administrative expenditure than it is allowing to the other institutions.
To you too, Mrs Jensen, I would like to express my congratulations on your work; being the rapporteur for all the other institutions makes all kinds of demands on you.
I wish to thank your House for accepting the 700 posts that the Commission had requested, but you can well imagine that I am not equally enthusiastic to learn that you are saying that 150 of them should be put in reserve in the first instance.
It goes without saying that it is one of Parliamentâs important duties to constantly monitor what is done with these posts and whether the right priorities are being set for their use, but I would like to argue in favour of the imposition of conditions on the release of the reserve that can actually be met in future.
We do of course know that the whole recruitment process will take time.
I would also, on behalf of the Prodi Commission, like to thank Parliament for always having approved the increases in posts for which we asked, for you are of course aware that increased expectations cannot be met without the resources to do so being in place.
Throughout all these years, it was the foreign policy section of the Budget that was under the greatest pressure; this was partly in consequence of events around the world and also because the European Union has actually started to take more joint responsibility, and the resources have to be provided for it to do so.
This was in part facilitated only by drawing on the flexibility reserve.
Likewise, in 2005, it is highly probable that we will find it impossible to manage the foreign policy budget without having recourse to funds from the flexibility reserve.
The letter of amendment that you have received from the Commission in respect of the 2005 Budget frees up funds in the foreign policy sphere and in the foreign budget, and so we are able to propose that support grants for Croatia be made in future out of Category 7, as accession negotiations with Croatia are to begin next year.
We have also proposed that economic aid to the Turkish Cypriot community be funded from the category for pre-accession aid.
It is gratifying to learn that the Council has now decided to treat this financial package as additional.
I would ask your House to treat this proposal as a matter of great urgency and endorse the aid that we are proposing for the Turkish part of Cyprus.
In so doing, we should also be aiming to help both communities to arrive at a final solution to the division of Cyprus and to overcome it.
In response to a request from the Council, the Commission also proposes, as part of the 2005 Budget, the continuation of the PEACE programme for Northern Ireland for another two years.
Although this, too, is a sensible course of action, let me observe, as regards the last three points I have mentioned, that it was always the Council that made the request, and always had very good reasons of policy for doing so.
I must remind you, though, that resolutions at lofty summits, right though they are in policy terms, must always be followed by Budget resolutions laboriously hammered out on the down-to-earth environment of the Budget.
In comparison with the current year, we will see the greatest increase in the 2005 Budget in the agricultural budget, which will rise from EURÂ 44 billion to EURÂ 50 billion next year.
There are important and good reasons for this.
Firstly, this will be the first time that the Budget includes direct grants to farmers in the new Member States.
Secondly, the exchange rate is higher than it was.
Thirdly, there have been agricultural reforms decided on by the Council, which have resulted in increased â rather than reduced â outgoings.
Taking everything into consideration, then, the agricultural budget will next year require 0.48% of each Member Stateâs gross national income, and nearly 45% of the total European Budget.
Although this structure, with its bias towards the agricultural sector, has its own history and sound reasoning behind it, we have to ask ourselves the simple question as to whether this structure is appropriate to the challenges of the future, or whether we need to set other priorities for the future and for the next Financial Perspective.
One of these priorities will of course be to achieve the Lisbon targets, and all must be called on to help do this.
Targets have been set, they have been agreed to by all, and either we take seriously these targets that have been set or we do not.
If, though, we take them seriously, more must in future be made available from the European Budget for such investments in the future as research, education and innovation.
This is a quite crucial challenge.
It is apparent from some of the debates among the Member States at Council level that the Member States are advocating a future reduction of the Budget to 1% of gross national income, expressed as commitment appropriations, which would mean that the absolute level for the 2005 Budget would be perpetuated in the future.
If, at the same time, agricultural expenditure were to be included in this area on a permanent basis, it would mean that little of the structure would change in future, but the European Union will not be capable of mastering the tasks and challenges of the future with a structure from the past.
A change is therefore needed.
Before you lie difficult negotiations; there have been others in the past, but what must be given attention is the discrepancy between what the European public have been promised and what is actually done later; it must not be allowed to grow, or else Europe will be a cause of frustration and disappointment.
We are all endeavouring to ensure that this does not happen, and that the European Budget will instead have a structure appropriate to the demands of the future.
I now hope that the European Parliament, the European Council and the future Commission will take very wise decisions, not only in relation to the Budget for 2005, but also, and in particular, to the next Financial Perspective.
I hope that the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in matters relating to the Budget will continue to be as good as it has been over the last five years.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stands for transparency and maximum efficiency in the use of European Union budgetary funds.
The PPE-DE Group considers the Councilâs approach, which implements reductions of 1.5% in the expenditure of other European Union institutions but does not apply the same reduction to its own budget, to be unjustified.
Our group supports austerity measures with respect to administrative expenditure and supports maximum efficiency in the use of European Union budgetary funds, and the elimination of wasteful expenditure and of duplication of functions between European Union institutions.
We consider that such an approach should be applied to all European Union institutions, including the Council and the European Parliament.
That is why the PPE-DE Group has, for example, repeatedly moved motions calling for a reduction of the European Parliamentâs expenditure to below the traditional ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure.
Of course, the enlargement of the European Union has caused the European Unionâs budgetary expenditure to increase.
The PPE-DE Group is in favour of providing the means necessary for satisfying the requirements arising from the enlargement of the European Union.
That also applies to administrative expenses and new staff posts.
However, the PPE-DE Group considers the creation of new posts to be permissible only on submission of a clear and comprehensive justification of the need for such posts.
The same principle applies to supplementary budget requests connected to the introduction of the new Financial Regulation and the new Staff Regulations in the European Union.
The proportion of total expenditure that is represented by administrative expenses is one of the indicators in evaluating the effectiveness of the policies implemented by the European Union.
An unwieldy and costly administration reduces that effectiveness.
Our task and that of all other European institutions is to strive to increase the effectiveness of the policies implemented by the European Union.
I call on fellow Members of the European Parliament to support the PPE-DE Groupâs stance in voting on the 2005 budget for the other institutions of the European Union and to remember that we also bear on our shoulders responsibility to ensure the most efficient use of European Union taxpayersâ money.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my high regard for the work done by the outgoing Commissioner.
Over the past five years, I have been able, as spokesman of my group, to work closely with her, and I can say that I have the greatest respect for her and for the work she has done, for hers is not an easy portfolio, and she has not always had the steady support of those around her; on the contrary, she has often had to make a very great effort, and that is why we respect her so highly.
