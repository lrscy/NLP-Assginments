Although meant well, the proposed amendments will, in my view, in fact, hamper the proper implementation of the directive on account of their subjective content.
Accordingly, an asylum seeker must be given the benefit of the doubt when he makes conflicting statements as a result of traumatic experiences.
In evaluating whether fear of persecution is real, consideration must be given to the gender, sexual identity, sexual orientation and health of the refugee and the habits and customs in a country.
The Member States should retain a certain level of policy freedom.
In addition, a workable system requires that the officials who carry out the policy should have a certain level of discretion.
The proposals tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs unnecessarily restrict this discretion.
They will at best lead to more bureaucracy and less freedom in the assessment of individual cases.
I will therefore not be endorsing these proposals.
Mr President, the proposal for a directive presented by the Commission to set out the conditions for granting refugee status does not reflect the state of the world, nor the current needs of Europe.
This text constantly seeks to broaden the definition of refugees provided by the Geneva Convention.
For example, the persecutor does not, from now on, always have to be a State, it could also be a non-State organisation.
To take another example, the probable causes of persecution have been drafted in a broad and open manner, as acknowledged in the Explanatory Statement itself, which explains, for example, that a person, persecuted on account of membership of a social group, may also be persecuted on the grounds of sex or sexual orientation.
That is not all, however.
The proposal for a directive creates a whole new category, subsidiary protection, which is in addition to the status of refugee provided for under the Geneva Convention.
So, Mr President, I believe that we must stop.
There are many - often tragic - crises in the world that we have a duty to attempt to alleviate.
The countries of the European Union cannot receive any more refugees, however.
How many refugees, by the way?
We do not know.
The text gives no evaluation.
What will be the financial burden for the taxpayer?
It is a mystery.
We do not know.
No evaluation is proposed for this either.
It is strange, nonetheless, that, at a time when the Member States are seeking to put a stop to bogus asylum applications - which have become the main source of illegal immigration - the Commission is, for its part, trying to open the floodgates.
This is not a responsible course of action.
We, for our part, believe that our main task is to protect our people.
In such circumstances, the communitarisation of the immigration policy at Amsterdam, giving the Commission a monopoly on initiative after 2004, would appear to be a serious mistake.
If the Member States do not want to pay a high price, they must find a way to change this situation during the next intergovernmental conference.
Mr President, Commissioner, I share the view that the directive to be drafted here is a fundamental one, and it is our common opinion that asylum law is in urgent need of harmonisation.
Between the rapporteur's approach and that of the European People's Party, however, there are fundamental differences.
What are these differences?
You propose a common approach to dealing with subsidiary protection and the protection accorded to refugees.
We are opposed to that; we want separate directives.
You propose extension of protection far beyond the bounds set by the Geneva Convention.
We want the Geneva Convention retained.
You want to take family reunification much further than consensus in this House has previously allowed.
We want the nuclear family.
You want to grant subsidiary protection, for five years and with a residence permit, immediately.
That does not make sense, so we want protection to be given for as long as it is reasonably needed.
So it is that the measures you are presenting here do not ensure that help is speedily given to real refugees under the Geneva Convention, but rather incite the use of asylum for immigration by economic migrants, and that tends towards its misuse.
What we find lacking in the Lambert Report, though, are primarily calls for quick procedures enabling us to decide in the minimum of time who is a refugee and who has a chance of asylum.
At present, that amounts in any case to some 90% of applicants for asylum.
Your report contains no reference to an EU-wide list of safe third states and states of origin.
It contains nothing about applicants being required to go back if they are not given permission to remain, nor does it contain measures to ensure that they do so.
Nor does it contain any demand for the European Union to conclude agreements with third countries, countries of origin and transit countries, to take applicants back.
Finally, it contains no firm demand that Dublin II be used to prevent asylum shopping.
In so many respects does this report contradict our thinking that I have to say that the European People's Party is unable to support it unless the relevant changes are made.
Commissioner, Mr President, the main aim of the report that we are discussing this evening is to provide asylum seekers with a minimum level of protection in all the Member States and to reduce the differences in legislation and the practices of the Member States in this area. This is essential.
Some Members are criticising efforts to bring into line the status of refugee and that of beneficiary of subsidiary protection.
Subsidiary protection exists, however, to bridge the gaps found in some interpretations of the Geneva Convention, under which a refugee is defined as a person persecuted by a government.
Yet we know that some refugees who are not, strictly speaking, persecuted by their government, are, in fact, in real danger and in genuine need of our help.
The needs of all those requiring international protection are, by and large, the same.
This is precisely the area the committee worked on to have amended in the proposal for a directive and I believe this has been done in a very constructive manner.
As an improvement, it is proposed that refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection enjoy the same rights with regard to the granting and the length of the residence permit, access to employment, possibilities of vocational training and access to integration facilities.
It is undeniable that access to employment encourages people to acquire greater autonomy and enables those concerned to support themselves and thus, to live without the assistance provided by the host country.
It is obvious that minors benefiting from international protection must have full access to the state education system; this is an obvious fact recognised in several international conventions.
We believe that it is dangerous to fail to protect minors, to fail to educate them, to fail to give them the minimum they need to be able to live together.
We welcome the new definition of the term family members, which is both wider and more accurate, and we stress the possibility of family reunion that is introduced in the proposal.
Similarly, we welcome the fact that the rejection of refugee status, and its withdrawal, is more clearly defined.
We are pleased to note that the persons who are persecuted for their sexual orientation, for their state of health, who suffer corporal punishment or genital mutilation are protected.
I now urge the majority of forward-thinking, humanist Members, who are often a credit to Parliament, to reject the amendments which could completely change the nature of this report and to send a clear signal to the Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, by voting in favour of the Lambert Report tomorrow, we shall be responding to an expectation of our peoples.
Whoever votes against this text tomorrow can no longer claim to truly condemn the current reception conditions which are not worthy of humanity, which are not worthy of the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's draft directive is meant to provide a minimum level of protection in the Member States for such third-country nationals as are actually in need of protection.
This implies, though, that secondary migration, in other words, the misuse of asylum to which Mr Vitorino referred, will thereby be kept under control.
So, Mrs Lambert, the prime requirement when it comes to dealing with economic migrants is support for impoverished countries, in order to prevent human resources from haemorrhaging away through emigration and to promote economic growth with a better quality of life for the people.
The subject of asylum is seen as sensitive in all the Member States, as is shown by the fact that it has been impossible, to date, to get any of the previous draft directives on this subject adopted by the Council.
I therefore regard the rapporteur's approach, which involves extending the already very far-reaching Commission proposal still further, as being quite utterly wrong.
It may soothe our own conscience to grant asylum also on economic grounds, but it does not help this Parliament to be taken seriously in our Member States.
The proposals for extending the scope of asylum to citizens of the European Union show how some MEPs regard ideologies as more important than sensible solutions.
Solutions, though, are what the citizens of our countries have every right to expect.
We and the people in our Member States are of one mind in believing that those who are persecuted must be given humanitarian aid.
This does not mean, however, that the granting of asylum can solve all this world's social, economic or environmental problems.
On the contrary, that leads to the great benefit of the right to asylum being nullified.
We, the representatives of the people, have the task of finding pragmatic solutions, on the one hand for the European Union, and on the other for the asylum-seekers.
A forward-looking asylum policy in the EU must also take into account the circumstances and needs of the people in our Member States.
The report before us does nothing of the sort, and so the PPE-DE Group rejects it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one thing I believe to be true is that, with a report or a draft of this sort there are points that have to be discussed, one of which, for example, is the differentiation between the rules for refugees and the rules on subsidiary protection.
We all, probably, have different opinions on it.
In my own country, Germany, there could also be difficulties as regards the way we handle the reunification of families, if the whole thing is framed in such generous terms that we, in Germany, perhaps have to tackle it in a different way.
On the other hand, though, it is of course a good thing that we at last have a directive, or are at least making the attempt to lay down minimum standards, which, once in place, will enable us to achieve our objective of preventing secondary movement.
I can understand my fellow-Members from other groups not being in agreement with all points, but I would also remind you that we are delegates.
I am not a minister of a nation state, and am therefore not obliged to take a stringent line and consider how to persuade and convince my Danish or Dutch counterparts.
I am a member of a Parliament in which I enjoy the freedom to act according to my conscience, a Parliament in which I can contemplate visions and draft proposals about them.
I can frame my ideas in such broad terms that, in the final analysis, they do not absolutely have to be passed by a Council in the form of a directive, but can be a parliamentary position paper and an eventual contribution to discussion.
It is in this sense that I hope that we will pass this draft tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's plenary has been studying various proposals to establish a common European asylum system, thereby pursuing the aim of gradually developing a genuine area of freedom, security and justice, which must be open to persons who, in various circumstances, legitimately seek protection in our Community.
Recently, at the Estoril meeting, the PPE-DE Group attached importance to these matters by holding their own seminar on this issue, the conclusions of which were reproduced a short while ago by Mr Pirker.
We agree with a common asylum policy that contains minimum rules designed to ensure a minimum level of protection for persons in genuine need of it.
We also agree with the aim of restricting the secondary movements of asylum seekers by reducing the differences that exist between the legislation and practices of the various Member States in this field, as well as imposing a fair division of efforts between the States.
We also agree that refugees, like any persons benefiting from other forms of protection, should be able to live with dignity in the Community of which they are a part, which can only happen if we protect their personal and social rights.
In these matters, however, it is better to move slowly and appropriately rather than rapidly and get things wrong.
Policies that appear to be very generous end up creating feelings of rejection and increasing xenophobic reactions that we can only condemn.
Even following 11 September, we have seen, amongst the public, suspect attitudes and increasing hostility towards asylum seekers, refugees and immigrant communities.
From this point of view, we must acknowledge that the Lambert Report has not helped to generate the consensus that would be useful and desirable in these matters.
Without wishing to dramatise, Mr President, this proposal contains a core of minimum standards that reveal the legislative courage to respond effectively to the issue of citizens of third countries in need of international protection, at the same time eliminating national differences in the way in which persons are treated, avoiding the need for secondary movements.
This, at least, is our view.
I therefore wish to highlight an extremely positive aspect of the Commission proposal, which is the complementarity of the dual status of international protection in which, in addition to the narrow approaches of the 1950s, the concept is extended to subsidiary protection, clarifying the concept of the perpetrators of persecution not limited solely to the State and its agents but also to material circumstances and others in which the outcome is that the State does not give protection, either because it cannot or because it does not want to, and we can all recall such situations in Africa and in Latin America. We also have the concept's inclusion of the protection organisations of stable quasi-State authorities, which must be held responsible in practical terms for the protection of individuals who fall outside the scope of simple peace or military security missions, which often relegate into second place the effective protection of individuals and respect for human rights.
Lastly, extending refugees' rights in terms of periods of residence, employment and integration mechanisms, which concern every aspect of refugees' citizenship.
The violence arising from poverty and from other social scourges is not included but I hope that this will be covered in future by means of a broader concept of common asylum policy.
For the moment, however, a good part of the ground has been covered, as have the bases for a common European asylum policy.
The Commission should, in our opinion, be congratulated on its work, but the Council must not continue to defraud us, demonstrating its congenital inability to take a decision, as is traditional and as usually happens in these matters.
Nor, Commissioner, will the Council be receiving from this House, from this Parliament, an endorsement for its inefficiency, ineffectiveness and for failing to vote.
Mr President, I should like to respond to a few of the points that have been raised in the debate this evening.
The first point concerns Mr von Boetticher's contribution, the first of the right-wing Christian Democrat hit-and-run contributors.
He hits out at the left in the Parliament, he hits out at the governments in the United Kingdom and Germany, and then he runs out of the Chamber so that he cannot hear the debate.
He runs away from the debate and he runs away from the reality.
The reality is that there are millions of people in the world who are seeking sanctuary in the European Union.
It is a situation that needs a sympathetic response.
It needs Member States to look at the situation and to try to address the position with compassionate moves.
This is why my group on this side of the Chamber makes no apologies for supporting a common European asylum policy, believing that it is the only way forward for the European Union.
I say to those Members opposite who say they are going to vote against these measures tomorrow and who, like Mr Coelho and Mrs Klamt, have said nice things about a common European asylum policy: you cannot say nice things about it on one occasion and then, every time there is a vote, vote it down.
Mr Pirker has spelled out the objections but it is not being consistent when one Member of your group, Mr Helmer, is writing that they should end the automatic rights or end the Geneva Convention and end the automatic right of entry for those deemed to be suffering from persecution.
We need to be absolutely clear where they are coming from.
On this side we are quite clear in our approach.
We will support this report.
We very much believe that there need to be minimum standards.
There need to be proper standards for asylum seekers, to recognise that they are invariably desperate people seeking desperate measures to escape from the appalling situations in their own countries.
We should be compassionate in the role that we seek to play.
We should be compassionate in our reports.
That is why I am very happy to commend the rapporteur on this and to congratulate the Commissioner for bringing it forward.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for this debate, which has raised some extremely important questions, to which I should like to respond.
Firstly, the Commission unequivocally defends the primacy of the implementation of the 1951 Geneva Convention, which is binding on all Member States.
We have also covered rules on subsidiary protection and, on this matter, I should like to put Mr Berthu's mind at ease: we have created nothing new; this is not the invention of a Commissioner's Machiavellian mind.
Subsidiary protection is already in place in our fifteen Member States. It arises from international commitments given by these countries, for example, when they signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the criteria laid down in its Article 3.
With regard to the scope of this directive, I should like to say that the Commission does not accept the proposals for amendments tabled by some Members, seeking to add new grounds or to add an exhaustive list of exclusion clauses for the definition of a refugee under the Geneva Convention.
We cannot accept these because the European Union does not have the authority to amend the content of the Geneva Convention. It can only be amended with the agreement of the 150 States that are parties to it.
This process has been opened by the United Nations High Commissioner but we are not in a position unilaterally to amend the Convention.
Similarly, we believe that the proposals on procedural guarantees, as generous as they are, should not be included in this directive.
The issue of procedures should be dealt with in the proposal on that subject, on which the Commission has tabled an amended proposal.
By the same token, I wish to say to Mr Pirker that this is not the proper place in which to deal with issues of return, the Dublin II Regulation, or cooperation with third countries.
These issues are important, I agree with you - and the Commission will be working on them, as indicated at the Seville Council.
Last week, therefore, the Commission tabled four new proposals for negotiating readmission agreements with Turkey, Algeria, Albania and the People's Republic of China.
Over a year ago, the Commission presented a regulation on which State should be held responsible for studying asylum requests, known as the 'Dublin II Regulation', which, I hope, will be concluded by the end of this year and the Commission will, in November, present its action plan for returns policy, as well as a framework for financial action for cooperation with third countries in the fight against illegal immigration.
With regard to the issue of equal rights amongst refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, the Commission believes that the rights pertaining to the beneficiaries of these two different types of protection must be the same. We feel, however, that there should be a 'cooling-off' period and, therefore, we proposed that there should be a distinction, precisely in order to acknowledge the primacy of the implementation of the Geneva Convention.
Finally, why did we include subsidiary protection in this proposal?
Let us be quite clear about this.
Today, in all Member States of the European Union, the majority of persons receiving international protection do not receive this protection under the Geneva Convention but under systems of subsidiary protection.
And if we wish to combat secondary movements, if we wish to combat 'asylum shopping' it would be of little value merely to include only the Geneva Convention.
The essence of 'asylum shopping', the essence of secondary movements lies in the competitiveness of subsidiary protection systems, to which we can add - please forgive me for saying so, ladies and gentlemen - that it is unfair to accuse the Commission of extending the concept of economic refugees by means of subsidiary protection.
On the contrary, only by dealing with the harmonisation of subsidiary protection will it be possible to adopt the so-called single procedure, which has been welcomed, as a matter of fact, by an increasing number of Member States, in which requests for asylum are studied in order of priority in a single administrative process and are subject to a single final decision.
This is known as 'streamlining procedures'.
This is a way of rationalising procedures that saves time, administrative means and money without having to provide unnecessary resources.
Finally, Mr President, Mr von Boetticher claimed that I bear a major responsibility for this matter and in doing so paid me a compliment which I really do not deserve.
It is not the Commission proposals that are blocking the Council's decision-making ability.
I must tell you sincerely that this is an area in which the Member States have initiative of legislation.
Can Mr von Boetticher have asked himself why if, in these matters, the Commission proposals are as bad as he says, no Member State has tabled a proposal that has rapidly achieved the consensus of the fifteen Member States and has been adopted?
This is an issue which I believe is relevant.
The only innovation in this proposal, admittedly, is to extend the concept of cause of persecution to cover persecution by non-State actors.
This is true.
This is the situation in thirteen of the fifteen Member States, and has recently also been incorporated into German law.
Am I really the most appropriate target for Mr von Boetticher's words?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0328/2002) by Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission's proposal with a view to the adoption of the proposal for a Council Framework decision on attacks against information systems (COM(2002) 173 - C5-0271/2002 - 2002/0086(CNS)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, who has studied this matter, to which she has dedicated considerable energy and commitment here in Parliament.
As she points out, hacking, viruses and denial of service can have very serious consequences, both as a result of individuals acting in their own interests and as part of organised crime or terrorism.
The Commission proposal aims to approximate criminal offences of unauthorised access or illegal interference with information systems and follows consultation with professional sectors and with the authorities responsible for implementing the law, as well as discussions with experts in the European Union forum on cybercrime.
The Commission is seeking to establish a degree of approximation in legislation at European level, but which is in line and coherent with the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention of November 2001.
Article 3 of our proposal defines unauthorised access to an information system as an offence.
What we are attempting to do is to punish hacking.
Such unauthorised access must be punished when perpetrated against an information system that is subject to specific protection measures or with the intent to cause damage to a singular or collective person, or with the intention of obtaining economic benefit.
Equally, we are making illegal interference with information systems a crime, thereby addressing the issue of attacks by means of viruses and denial of service as well as the disruption of websites.
The Commission proposal requires all offences to be committed in an intentional and unauthorised way and focuses above all on serious cases, the criteria for decisions on which must be decided on by the judges of the courts in each Member State.
The proposal caters for aggravating circumstances and also seeks to force Member States to designate operational points of contact, available around the clock and seven days a week, with a view to facilitating the exchange of information on attacks against information systems.
The Commission considers that the rapporteur is entirely right to emphasise that the actions to be punished should not be considered to be insignificant or minor.
Recital 12 of the Commission proposal therefore suggests that we must avoid excessive criminalisation, particularly for behaviour which is not very serious or which is even insignificant.
The Commission agrees, for example, with the proposal for an amendment tabled by the rapporteur on this issue.
With regard to the issue of data protection under the third pillar, we are working on this matter, but I would like to ask Parliament not to suspend implementation of this proposal for a framework decision until there is a specific instrument to protect data under the third pillar.
Instead, I think that specific reference must be made to respect for the principles established in the Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection, which must be fully complied with in this field of the framework decision's implementation.
As a matter of fact, this was the solution adopted for the issue of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
I wish to thank the rapporteur once again for her contribution to this important debate which, I believe, has been much hoped for by public opinion in the Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld on the excellent report she has presented, which the European People's Party supports and will vote for.
We are facing a problem of considerable topical interest, which has assumed worrying dimensions and which has today become a form of organised crime, with a transnational nature, which must be responded to at Community level, because the new information and communication technologies have a fundamental impact on the daily life of the citizens and on the economy of our societies.
It is therefore crucial that there should be rigorous protection against potential abuses or criminal acts.
Hacking, in whatever form, is an economic risk, risks a loss of confidence in electronic commerce and also poses a threat to individual privacy.
The targets of these attacks are not only network operators, Internet service providers and electronic commerce businesses, but also private persons who have no commercial intentions.
The protection of information systems is a crucial element in creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
We must, however, guarantee that no restrictions are imposed on fundamental rights and freedoms, that fundamental principles of law are not changed and that individual acts that take place purely as a result of mistakes in the use of new technologies are not punished.
As I have already said in this plenary, security is and must be only one tool for safeguarding these fundamental rights and freedoms.
The CederschiÃ¶ld Report contains five essential points: firstly, the approximation of criminal law in the Member States in the field of attacks against information systems; secondly, stepping up police and judicial cooperation in this field; thirdly, enhancing prevention, promoting a culture of security, making actors aware of security risks to information networks; fourth, the existence of flexibility in criminal law on unimportant issues or those of lesser importance, thereby avoiding imposing binding, criminalising measures at European level; fifthly and lastly, and this demonstrates special consideration for young people, to allow judges the possibility to acquit minors who are charged for the first time with this type of offence, and who did not commit this misdemeanour with the intent of causing damage or procuring an economic benefit or creating prospective profits for a criminal organisation.
Mr President, despite the excellent work of Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, who has made considerable improvements to the Commission proposal, we will vote against the motion, for there are at least four basic problems whose importance cannot and must not be underestimated: firstly, the typically European obsession with over-regulating the Internet with specific laws; secondly, the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice based on the harmonisation of permitted terms of imprisonment; thirdly, the excessive control measures which automatically criminalise all behaviour which could be described as an attack against information systems; and fourthly, the illusion that it is possible to clamp down on crime by making sentences harsher rather than by improving the effectiveness of controls.
Basically, we believe that it would be preferable to address the issue of crimes committed on the Internet with criminal law instruments already in existence rather than producing piles of specific legislation based on technological considerations which, moreover, would be characterised by the flaws which I have mentioned.
These are the reasons why we will be voting against the motion.
These problems were essentially also raised by Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld and Mr Coelho, but we feel they are vitally important and cannot be ignored.
Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, data processing and information transfer, and the assurance that these activities can be free from interference, are vitally important in today's information society.
Who of us has not been afraid a virus might have got into their computer or actually suffered damage caused by a computer virus?
Viruses can have unforeseen consequences for those using computers.
Examples might include data altered or destroyed by a virus in air traffic control systems or in files held by healthcare units such as the intensive care department of a hospital.
This could have fateful consequences for both individuals and large numbers of people.
Computer viruses in the future could cause legal uncertainty on a large scale and prevent electronic commerce and people's private business from being transacted electronically by sabotaging the reliability of electronic documents.
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, our efforts to promote electronic commerce, for example, by creating the necessary legislative frameworks, will be in vain if these systems are not dependable.
I am very concerned about the opinions of experts who say that those who are creating new viruses these days are less and less those who are just playing around.
At first viruses were turned out by schoolchildren and students, who produced them mainly for fun and publicity, but more and more frequently viruses can destroy hard disks and all installed programs.
According to the experts macro viruses already account for 80% of all viruses.
People want to protect their privacy from intruders.
I therefore agree with the views expressed earlier that hacking is turning into one form of organised crime, one that must be prevented particularly in the international context, because it is, by its very nature, a cross-border crime.
The Commission proposal to prevent attacks against information systems and for the approximation of criminal law measures taken by Member States is thus a step in the right direction.
Finally I want to thank our colleague, Charlotte CederschiÃ¶ld, for the valuable work she has done.
I especially agree with her observation that the Union still has not enough data protection rules to deal with third pillar matters.
The European Parliament on many an occasion has called for such rules to be drawn up, and I would urge the Commission to commence drafting them immediately.
Mr President, I wish to say that, in the Commission, we are not simply obsessed with issues of suppressing crime; there are many other initiatives underway in this field; in prevention, security, and encryption and in guaranteeing the privacy of information systems.
This was not the subject of this debate, which is why I did not refer to our actions in this field, but was taking them for granted.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0264/2002) by Mrs Fraisse, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the importance and dynamics of the theatre and the performing arts in an enlarged Europe (2001/2199(INI)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what strikes a new Member, such as myself, on joining the European Parliament, and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, is that there is no coherent vision with regard to culture in Europe.
I prefer to use the expression 'vision' rather than cultural 'policy'.
Those who call it cultural policy are referring to the debate or dispute that we could have.
When we say, however, that there is no coherent vision, this quite simply means, for example, that cinema is dealt with from the point of view of industry, that music may feature in the budgetary lines, but that it all ends there, and that it is not clear how language or languages used in the theatre can be taken into account.
That is why, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to draft this own-initiative report.
From my perspective, this own-initiative report was a means of reducing, in this vast European area of culture, the difference between industry and music which is so marked.
If you are interested in languages, theatre and the performing arts, what one also discovers is that, fundamentally, these areas make up our heritage.
The theatre and the performing arts make up the heritage of Europe, and it is as much our literary heritage as our political heritage, since there is no theatre which has not been shaped, both by the birth of democracy and by the life of the streets and the city.
That is also why I believe that the issue of the theatre and performing arts is of great importance in the European area.
When I began meeting performing arts professionals, what I heard first of all was their demand for freedom.
They were adamant that they would not lose their freedom, or agree to us keeping checks on them, or creating an official art policy which would not be, in any shape or form, on the scale that they were seeking.
That was the first thing that they said.
The second thing that they touched upon was all the difficulties, the vast number of difficulties, such as double taxation, social and fiscal, but also the vast number of difficulties that they face when travelling.
Because artists travel, they are already within Europe, they do not contemplate the issue of whether to stay in their own country or whether they are becoming uprooted, they travel and they need us to help them do this.
This is a kind of reality that exists and that we must support.
Of course, I do not believe - and this is increasingly evident with each passing day - that we can apply market and competition rules to the area of culture.
We have seen this elsewhere: within the cinema, State aid is now recognised, even promoted or mimicked in countries other than those where this already exists.
Even for the audiovisual industry therefore, we are aware of the importance of the role of State support.
I believe that, for the performing arts and theatre in particular, it is the same thing, we must have State aid and this aid begins with the responsibility that the States must assume to facilitate the movement of individuals and productions in Europe, as well as to encourage training.
In one respect, this is quite simply the conclusion that my report reaches.
Member States must also make an effort to cooperate.
Eventually, we might stop thinking in terms of a divide.
I feel that, in our never-ending debate on culture, we still mean that either culture will be dealt with by the Community, or it will be a matter of subsidiarity, and therefore we must not touch it.
I do not feel that this divide is of any use or that it helps in any way, and I believe, on the contrary, that if we go back to Article 151 which calls for cultural cooperation, this is exactly what we must use in order to think in terms of a Europe of culture and a Europe of the performing arts.
As I said, there are barriers, such as double taxation, the lack of legislation, and a common technical vocabulary.
There are, however, remedies as well, such as sub-titling, the White Paper which could help us to harmonise legislation - and I hope that the Commission will listen to us - databases, and the sharing of vocabulary.
Perhaps we should also take the advice of experts, artists, who know of current developments within the industry, when it comes to making decisions.
To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must think about the way in which culture will be preserved, dealt with properly in the Convention and the future Constitution.
I think we must also think about the European Council resolution put forward in June, which proposed a plan for cooperation in the area of culture.
I think that we will be able, with the European Commission and Parliament, to support the resolutions of the European Council as well.
Mr President, I speak as shadow rapporteur on behalf of my group.
We congratulate Mrs Frays on her report and will broadly support its adoption.
We have tabled two amendments which we hope the House will accept.
The report constitutes a useful analysis of measures to encourage theatre and the performing arts throughout the EU, particularly focusing on the need for mobility.
Presaging the enlarged EU, the rapporteur's explanatory statement notes that the candidate countries could not support cultural programmes through the PHARE and TACIS programmes but that artistic cooperation has been enhanced through the THEOREM programme, by which they gained access to the Culture 2000 programme last year, as Commissioner Reding has just reminded us.
In Mrs Fraisse's speech she drew attention to the need for vision and coherence in cultural matters in the EU and particularly in the enlarged EU.
I very much support that.
It is timely, following the Commission's announcement of approval for the ten candidate countries to accede to the EU and this weekend's referendum in Ireland, which cleared a potential obstacle to the enlarged EU.
The EU's character is going to change very dramatically, particularly with the accession of the Central and East European countries.
Culture surely has a huge role to play in this respect.
To what extent does the existing programme deal with the years of collective amnesia in Western Europe, perhaps not so much in Germany and Austria, where there were always historical and family links, but in other countries where the shadow of the iron curtain still exists.
Bearing in mind Mrs Fraisse's call for vision and coherence, have we really done enough to bring home to the public in the present EU what completing the European family is going to mean, in the theatre and performing arts as well as other cultural fields?
When Stalin outlined his project for Central and Eastern Europe, Winston Churchill's reply was 'the eagle must let the small bird sing'.
I wonder whether we feel today that all the institutions of the EU have done enough to let the small bird sing.
Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur for having made a quantum leap and married her vision to political considerations, a rare feat indeed here.
We all want a revival of the arts, and the performing arts in particular, and we feel that enlargement really will allow us to enter a new era in Europe.
I am sure that each and every one of us, like the Commissioner, is eager to contribute to this revival in our own way, by providing a number of political tools.
I have to say that the report, which I made a point of sending to numerous theatrical agencies in Greece, has excited a great deal of interest and they are waiting to see how tomorrow's vote goes and who votes against it.
I think that political intervention to bring about an area of performing arts is extremely important and I just have one or two comments to make.
Commissioner, I know that you are not responsible, but the statistics are so late, they are causing confusion and muddying the waters.
We need these statistics and your support is important here.
It is also important for dramatic works to be translated.
They cannot appear first in book form and then as translations.
Dramatic works really do need to circulate among artists as translations if they are to travel.
And finally, the whole situation is in a state of flux.
We have a Canadian initiative on international cultural collaboration, we have the ongoing discussion within the World Trade Organisation, and we shall have to wait and see how these situations develop.
So we have to harness our vision to political ideas which will bring about a cultural policy which revives rather than renationalises the performing arts, a policy that offers specific ways of making our dreams come true for European culture.
Since time immemorial, people have been involved in theatre in one form or other, and each nationality has developed it own preferences and forms of expression.
I would therefore like to thank Mrs Fraisse for her initiative to map out the state of affairs with regard to performing arts in the EU and the candidate countries.
Given the wide area and the many variations in the different countries, it is a valiant and successful effort.
Nevertheless, I should like to make a few observations.
Firstly, theatre exists by the grace of its producers, directors and actors, and I should like to add the theatre-going public to this list, for without an audience, there is no theatre.
Many theatres and theatre forms have followers who unite in one way or another in 'friends of ?', and I believe that they too deserve a mention when the topic of supporting the dramatic arts is mooted.
They offer incentives, information and bring theatre to the attention of a wide public.
This aspect is, sadly, missing from the report.
Secondly, I should also like to expressly draw your attention to the role of information technologies in modern theatre.
Modern theatre productions increasingly incorporate modern technology in their performances.
This trend deserves our attention and must certainly be included in fresh theatre policy, for it indeed pertains to a typically European task in the field of innovation.
Thirdly, my group has major objections to the appeal for more financial support.
We believe that enough attention is being given to this aspect by 'Culture 2000', the structural funds and the Socrates and Leonardo programmes, upon which the Commissioner, in fact, enlarged.
Finally, more tax allowances for the mobility of those who are culturally active is a taboo subject in my group.
We agree that double taxation is naturally exaggerated, but the award of special tax allowances would be a reason for us to abstain from Mrs Fraisse's entire report during the final vote.
Mr President, Mrs Zorba, Commissioner, on the contrary, theatre is not dead.
It has been pronounced dead at regular intervals ever since it came into being.
It lives!
Deserving protection as the biotope of every democratic society, the theatre lives not only thanks to the antics of its exponents, but also thanks to public interest and childlike curiosity, and thanks to national policies.
We all know that this responsibility is borne by the Fifteen, soon to be twenty-five and more.
Like Mr Beazley and others who have spoken before me, I wonder whether everyone is truly aware of the enormous political and delicate task that we have been set to do.
The business world has galloped on ahead, but the EU's citizens are still tottering along behind integration.
Europe must help where it can.
Let me first thank you, GeneviÃšve Fraisse, for your initiative, and for this wonderful report.
If, within the internal market framework, we enact laws relating to culture, we must also make full use of every instrument at our disposal in the service of the many kinds of theatre - whether houses rich in tradition, buildings commandeered for alternative uses, streets between Lisbon and Helsinki, Athens and London - to protect this diversity, helping it to develop further and come to full bloom.
This will call for a shared effort on the part of all of us.
It is primarily to the Member States that I appeal.
We have to do away with fiscal discrimination as part of European mobility policy and as an essential contribution to integration.
We have to exploit to the utmost all the options that the framework of the sixth VAT directive offers us and win over the media, for they - especially the public broadcasting institutions - are our partners.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your observations.
Take this report as a mandate and as a support.
Do not let it gather dust in a drawer; it is too valuable to be eaten away by moths.
No holes in the Budget are stopped if we cut back on art and culture; we are just the poorer thereby.
Mr President, I am not going to speak to you about those working in the entertainment industry on short-term contracts, the number of which has doubled in France in five years and has reached the incredible figure of 90 000, and whom the rapporteur is trying to federate. I shall, instead, speak about pluralism in French television, particularly as far as the so-called public service networks are concerned.
We must do everything necessary so that these television channels, which receive more than EUR 2 billion in subsidies from the French Government every year, at last respect the principles that are at the very core of their public service duty, in other words, the principles of democracy and respect for all political opinions.
I am speaking of the so-called journalists and big prize-budget producers who are behaving in the manner of the worst campaigners of politically correct misinformation.
In this respect, the disgraceful behaviour of Antenne 2 and FR 3 between the two rounds of the French presidential election was unacceptable and flouts the most basic rules of the professional code of ethics of journalism.
It would be a great credit to the current government to impose the necessary penalties against the two or three presenters who were guilty of professional misconduct.
Lastly, in order to avoid confusion between journalism and propaganda in the future, each state or private television channel should organise a debate involving the main representative political views ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
You do not have any time left.
Mr President, I assume that it had escaped Mr de Gaulle's mind that our discussion today is on theatre rather than television or journalists.
I would prefer to speak to the matter on the agenda.
I wish to congratulate Mrs Fraisse and say something on just a couple of points that have not yet been mentioned today.
First of all, I am glad that a Member has taken up this matter again after an interval of ten years, in the course of which the issue has lost none of its topicality.
It was in 1992 that I produced a report on the state of artists, and I can only say that I still search in vain today for the practical results that the Commission could have brought about in these ten years.
Whilst believing that the topics addressed today are very multi-faceted, I would nonetheless like to limit myself to two things, the first being the way in which the cultural sector is financed at both national and European level.
It is the subject of politicians' speeches, but does not give rise to political action, and it is for that reason that I believe much is still amiss in this area.
I would like to observe that there are two things that are in need of improvement.
Firstly, the Culture 2002 programme, to which Mrs Reding has already referred, has to have more money allocated to it; if the Council of Ministers suddenly attaches such importance to culture, then it should provide funds for it.
In addition, we should also bear in mind that it is the performing arts that are popular with quite specific viewers and listeners.
So far, these are small-scale projects, for which the Commission has no love, but which we want because the public likes them!
Secondly, the private sector must be involved more than it has been before.
Patronage and sponsorship are important.
There are no Budget resources available, and so we have to look for ways to enable people with a lot of money to spend it in the right way.
That is why we should do more about this.
I regret the way that the coalition agreements in my own country mean that it is precisely this that is to be done away with.
Thirdly, artists face a very large number of technical obstacles in terms of the material they have to work with, and here in particular the Commission could really do something, for example, for circuses and small travelling theatres.
Please do something in this area; it would be a great help to the performers!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fraisse's Report contains many positive points, which require answers at Community level if we persist in hoping that Commission policies will produce a genuinely European stamp for these projects.
Recital F rightly points out that the vitality of the theatre and performing arts should not depend chiefly on public subsidies.
It is, in fact, extremely important to boost the diversification of funding sources and to strengthen sponsorship policies, with the corresponding tax relief likely to attract sponsors.
It is also important, however, that the performing arts develop a satisfactory business dimension.
We live in a market economy and neither the State not the European Union should act as a wet nurse or a nanny for cultural creation.
There is no justification whatsoever for the performing arts as a rule to be directly supported by a system of public subsidy for productions.
It is more important for cultural creation to run the risks inherent to it and that public resources facilitate international promotion, distribution, greater accessibility of content through translation and subtitling and proper co-production, in the spirit of the 'Culture 2000' Programme.
There is, however, every reason why artistic training from childhood, as well as contact with cultural creation in all spheres - and therefore with the arts and performing artists - judiciously promoted from school onwards, should make a decisive contribution to finding new publics, which we can expect will lead to an increase in the demand for cultural consumption likely, at least in part, to sustain the corresponding supply.
What makes no sense is to reduce supply and funding for supply without seeing any significant growth in audiences, which are still lacking.
Let us hope that the Fraisse Report is also a step in this direction.
It was a misunderstanding.
I thought that you were asking to take the floor, when in fact you were applauding the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 9.50 p.m.)
Medicinal products
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy by:
Mrs Rosemarie MÃŒller (A5-0330/2002) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products [COM(2001) 404 - C5-0591/2001 - 2001/0252(COD)];
Mrs FranÃ§oise GrossetÃªte (A5-0340/2002) on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use [COM(2001) 404 - C5-0592/2001 - 2001/0253(COD)];
Mrs FranÃ§oise GrossetÃªte (A5-0334/2002) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/82/EC on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products [COM(2001) 404 - C5-0593/2001 - 2001/0254(COD)].
Commissioner Liikanen has the floor.
. Mr President, before briefly introducing the three Commission proposals, I would like to thank and congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs MÃŒller and Mrs GrossetÃªte, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all the work and effort they have put into finalising these three reports.
Let me start with the objectives of the proposals.
There are three.
First and foremost, to guarantee a high level of health protection for European citizens, and that is always the starting point.
Secondly, to increase the availability of innovative medicinal products and, at the same time, favour competition with generic products, and, thirdly, to prepare for enlargement, which will very soon become a reality.
As far as the concrete proposals are concerned, I will concentrate on three of them.
First, the need to reinforce the role of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the centralised procedure.
Why?
Because the objective is to make new innovative medicines available to all EU citizens, at the same time.
This is a question of equality of all patients in Europe.
Thus, the Commission has proposed that the centralised authorisation procedure for all medicines containing new active substances be made mandatory.
This is the Community solution to the issue of innovation availability and I hope that this House will support it.
Additionally, this would produce economies of scale, save resources and time and, finally, lead to improved regulatory efficiency.
The Commission wants, especially in the enlarged EU, to ensure that patients have quicker access to innovative medicines.
The mutual recognition procedure has shown its limits.
The evaluation process at the London agency takes an average of 180 days - clearly fewer than the maximum of 210 days provided for in the legislation.
The centralised procedure would also be positive for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Let us take the example of biotechnology.
SMEs are very active in this field, where centralised authorisation is already mandatory.
Experience has not brought any major problems to light.
The benefits of a centralised procedure for SMEs are obvious in areas such as orphan drugs, where most of the marketing authorisations are granted to SMEs.
This said, the Commission could, with a view to an overall solution, seek supporting measures for SMEs if there are particular obstacles, to help SMEs overcome them.
Secondly, we need to find the right balance between innovation and competition from generics.
Why is this so important?
To put it in a nutshell, we need innovative products for the benefit of patients and we need generics to help reduce the pressure on health care costs.
How then are these needs to be balanced?
For innovative medicines, the Commission proposes a new data-protection period.
For generics, entry to the market will be speeded up.
How will this happen?
First, the Commission proposes to harmonise the national data protection periods at 10 years across the board.
This will provide a harmonised solution for Europe.
The protection period will give the innovative pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to recover its R& D investments. This will also allow for the smoother operation of the internal market.
To reward further innovation and research in new products, the proposal provides for a possible extension of the protection period up to 11 years.
For generics, the Commission proposes to change a long-standing EU policy.
We propose now, for the first time in EU legislation, that trials may begin on generics before the expiry of the patent or other form of intellectual property protection.
This will speed up the marketing of generics on most of the national markets and will substantially help to increase competition.
The Commission believes that this is a balanced proposal.
It takes account of the interests of the innovative European pharmaceutical industry, which is losing ground compared with the industry in the United States.
It means fewer jobs and less research in Europe unless we do things differently.
At the same time, it will facilitate the development of a competitive market in generics, and that means medicines at lower cost for European citizens.
Finally, I should like to say a few words about controlled access to information for patients.
I knew this would be a difficult discussion, but, first of all, the Commission is not proposing an American type of direct advertising to patients.
The discussions have concentrated to a large extent on the US model, but this is not our model.
The facts of the matter are that a lot of fragmented information is already available on the web, at least for English-speaking patients.
This has two major drawbacks: firstly, it discriminates against non-English-speaking people and, secondly, it means that the information can be piecemeal and unreliable.
Our proposal is that European citizens should obtain information that has been validated by European regulatory authorities and that follows guidelines to be agreed between the Member States and the Commission.
It is a prudent proposal.
It is a European pilot project, and has nothing in common with the US model.
The alternatives to what we have today are, on the one hand, the continuation of massive direct advising to patients via the web.
We cannot change this situation by our legislation.
The alternative is to enable patients to obtain sound information, validated by the competent European authorities, on medicines for a small number of diseases.
I think that this second option increases both choice and security for European patients.
In conclusion, the Commission proposals aim to guarantee a high level of public health to European citizens, to increase, in a balanced way, the availability of innovative medicinal products and generic products and also to be ready for enlargement.
This is a challenging piece of legislation.
I am looking forward to the debate in the House today and to continued cooperation with Parliament and the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in examining the legislation before us, we need to consider whether more EU involvement is needed when it comes to approving innovative medicinal products, or whether the mutual recognition procedure is the best approach.
In other words, do we want a more integrated internal market for medicinal products with a view to giving patients throughout Europe swifter access to new, safe and effective medicines, or is the idea that extremely complicated authorisation procedures should continue to keep new medicines out of patients' hands for as long as possible?
I would like to argue in favour of the wider registration of medical products with new active substances.
This has advantages not only for patients, but also for companies, because they can market medicines more quickly than up to now and thus enhance their competitiveness.
The support proposed for SMEs should compensate for the drawbacks of the centralised authorisation procedure, which do hit them.
As I see it, legislation should focus on patients and their needs.
That means that safety and the effectiveness of medical products must play a key role in the authorisation procedure.
The procedure must be transparent.
Patients, doctors and companies alike must therefore have access to any information not covered by business secrecy protection.
In future, comprehensive information on progress with the authorisation procedure, on clinical tests carried out and on side effects and the prices of medical products will be downloadable at any time from a public database.
In this connection, I regret that the Commission's information project on asthma, diabetes and AIDS did not receive the support of a majority of the committee.
The Commission proposal was certainly ambiguous and gave rise to fears that advertising for prescription medicines was to be permitted.
However, the committee's decision meant that an opportunity to improve patient information has been lost.
I feel sure that this ought to be put right over the next few years.
Pharmacovigilance, that is to say monitoring and reporting of side effects, is important to the safety of a medical product.
The obligation to report side effects and submit periodic reports to the authorisation authority ensures continuous comprehensive assessment of any given medical product.
There is a very effective safety net in the field of pharmacovigilance.
This makes it easier to ascertain side effects and makes it possible to act quickly in the event of a crisis.
For these reasons it will be possible to dispense with the procedure for relicensing products every five years.
Another key aspect of reform is the plan to prepare the boards and committees of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for their future remits and for the enlargement of the EU.
The structure of the EAEMP is intended to reflect that of the EU Food Safety Authority, with an open application procedure for the Management Board and the Executive Director.
Anyone wishing to become a member of one of the agency's boards or committees should have a high degree of scientific expertise and must declare any relevant interests.
In addition to the existing scientific committees, there will in future be a committee for herbal medicinal products with the same status.
This will make voluntary central authorisation for herbal medicines possible, giving patients throughout Europe the option of using tried and tested herbal medicines.
In addition to health protection, which is important for patients, there is also the issue of competitiveness and innovation in Europe's pharmaceutical industry.
The harmonisation of data exclusivity is certainly a step towards increased competitiveness.
Under the present arrangements, data exclusivity in Europe ranges from six to ten years, and this is in urgent need of harmonisation.
The 10-year-rule gives a signal to pharmaceutical companies to intensify research and market truly innovative products.
However, it also gives a signal to generic drug manufacturers to use the Bolar provisions.
As I see it, the Commission proposal is a successful attempt to strike a balance between the justifiable desire of pharmaceutical companies to protect their data and the need of public health systems to improve access to cost-effective generic drugs.
All in all, the legislation before us will make an important contribution to improving health protection in Europe, which will be of lasting benefit to patients.
Mr President, Commissioner, the subject that we are discussing today is one of the most important themes of our parliamentary term, since it ultimately concerns every European citizen.
Allow me, first of all, to thank all my fellow Members from all the political groups for the discussions that we have had and the work that they have performed via the 800 amendments.
In my opinion, there are rather too many amendments, which may be very detrimental to the quality and coherence of our work.
The main objective of the proposals is to ensure a high level of health protection for each citizen, particularly by providing rapid access to innovative and safe products, by developing a preventative and on-going system of pharmacovigilance, as well as by improving the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry within the framework of its search for new treatments.
We must not forget the essential boost which must be given to the generic medicinal products industry.
A medicinal product is a product unlike any other.
It is not purchased or consumed like an ordinary, everyday consumer item.
Its use is unique and everyone expects a medicinal product to be safe and to work effectively.
Safety, quality and efficacy are the three essential pillars of the European medicinal products market.
Before being made available to patients, medicinal products must pass through specific and restricted phases in order to obtain a marketing authorisation.
At present, there are two procedures for registering medicinal products: the centralised procedure, managed by the European Agency, under which authorisations valid for all EU Member States are issued, and the mutual recognition procedure, for which the Member States have jurisdiction.
It is not our intention to alter the existing dual structure; the main task is to optimise the way it works.
In reality, the question raised concerns new, active substances.
We all agree that there is a difference between new active substances, which number almost 20 per year, and the new drugs, which amount to between 200 and 300 each year.
Therefore, the Commission is proposing to introduce the registration, by means of a centralised procedure, of new molecules, so as to ensure that everyone has access to the most innovative therapies.
Some Members wanted to question the principle.
I would like to say to them that we are faced with a critical choice.
You will choose between either health or the market.
By adopting the amendment which calls the scope into question, we must respond to the following: how do we explain to those who are ill that their European neighbours will be able to benefit from an innovative and effective treatment, but that they will have to wait a few years until the authorisation is granted to their country?
Faced with this perspective, let us take an extreme case involving enlargement: citizens from Slovenia and Portugal could, for example, be treated with a new therapy, but a German or Cypriot citizen could not have access to it.
What do we do, in this case, as regards equality in the area of health?
Some Members will say that the centralised procedure is costly for SMEs, but in the case of enlargement, the cost of 25 applications for market authorisation using the decentralised procedure will be much higher.
We are all mindful of the recent examples of medicinal products withdrawn from the market on public health grounds.
We know that the issuing of an authorisation for a medicinal product does not, however, mean that checks are no longer needed on its efficacy and safety.
It is thus essential to step up pharmacovigilance requirements, in order to offer patients the best possible guarantees, in other words with ad-hoc inspections at the source of manufacturing, using purely public funding, which is indispensable if independence is to be guaranteed and, lastly, by means of a rapid system for exchanging data collated by all the partners, which will make it possible to achieve coherence in pharmacovigilance systems between Member States.
In order to manufacture a medicinal product, the applicant first needs to carry out extensive research in order to discover new molecules.
We all know that innovation comes at a price.
Industry therefore needs to guarantee the protection of this data.
It is our duty to encourage research to ensure that science moves forward, hence the interest in retaining our best researchers.
We also need to ensure patient safety, but equally to prevent Europe's industries from falling too far behind other countries, from the United States and Asia.
Of course, the usefulness of generic drugs has already been demonstrated.
They illustrate the success of our European health systems.
The introduction of adequate measures, therefore, particularly by means of the Bolar system will speed up their launch on to the market.
We must also remember that generic products are only developed due to innovation.
I am also expecting all the Member States to run an information campaign for the general public, in order to explain what a generic product is, whilst stressing it is the therapeutic equivalent of the reference medicinal product.
With regard, more specifically, to veterinary medicinal products, the main challenge is to contend with the problem of the availability of these medicinal products.
A balance has been sought between making some provisions more flexible, such as the 'cascade provisions' and maintaining the highest level of safety for the consumer, in the case of food-producing animals.
When there is no medicinal product available for a condition or a given animal, the cascade system allows the use of medicinal products designed for other species, for other conditions or even the use of medicinal products for human use.
This system was improved and broadened for optimal effectiveness and safety.
The Commission is proposing to extend the compulsory prescription to all medicinal products designed for food-producing animals, which poses a problem for some Member States, including Ireland and the United Kingdom.
A compromise amendment, adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy makes this measure consistent with the national provisions.
Lastly, we cannot speak about the revision of European pharmaceutical legislation without addressing the issue of information and the Commission proposal, which seeks to provide authorisation, on an experimental basis, over five years. We must also address the communication, by industry, of information relating to specific medicinal products for the following conditions: asthma, AIDS and diabetes.
The medicinal products market is unique and our objective must not be to encourage maximum sales.
It is vital to maintain a very clear distinction between information and advertising and to place a strict ban on the latter.
There is no better information than that given by a doctor or a pharmacist.
Information systems, however, particularly via the Internet, have been widely developed and it appears quite unfair that only those who have access to the Internet and can speak English are able to gather this data, and not other people.
We must avoid, however, any move leading to the development of deceptive and misleading information that seeks to promote the prescription, sale or taking of a specific medicinal product.
The Committee on the Environment rejected the Commission proposal by a huge majority, as it was deemed to be overly ambiguous.
This unmitigated rejection poses a problem, however.
I hoped that the concepts of information and advertising would be better defined, and I proposed a system for the prior validation of the information by neutral scientific organisations.
This proposal could pave the way for the foundation of an exhaustive new study, which we are awaiting from the Commission.
On the other hand, there is an essential source of information. I am referring to package leaflets.
All the amendments tabled on this issue seek to improve the way they are written, to make them clearer and easier to understand.
This is a very positive point.
To sum up, I must stress the importance of enlargement.
We cannot deny the fact that the revision which will be adopted will apply to the incoming countries.
That is why I proposed, in particular, what I shall refer to as the 'euro-generic' product.
Within some of the candidate countries and for historical or economic reasons, reference medicinal products have never been registered.
The updating of generic authorisations in accordance with European legal requirements in the candidate countries therefore requires the possibility of referring to a reference product.
The absence of such a product could pave the way for an obligation to withdraw generic medicinal products from the market, which nonetheless conform to the requirements of quality, security and effectiveness.
This is a situation which causes problems of access to generic medicinal products.
It therefore seems important that a reference medicinal product present in another Member State be able to serve as a reference.
Each new candidate country has an important role to play as a fully committed player in the integration and development of this 'Europe of health' that we are all hoping and praying will be realised.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as permanent rapporteur for agencies in the Committee on Budgets, I have been following these reports, which regulate the operation of the London-based medical products agency, that is the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.
I am very grateful to the rapporteur and to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for having taken our suggestions on board in their reports.
There is, however, one thing I would to make very clear to this House, and this also applies of course to the Commission and the Member States. If we are to give an agency new remits, then we also need to consider where the money for carrying out those tasks is to come from.
We cannot just keep increasing the size of an agency.
We have a General Budget that only provides us with a certain amount, and Parliament cannot top it up - we can only restructure it.
So if we wish to allocate financial means to an agency in future, we have to take those means away from another agency.
I know that I am not making myself popular by making these statements, but I am not here to be popular.
We need to bear in mind in future that an agency can only carry out the tasks assigned to it with the money at its disposal, and that it cannot act as it likes beyond that.
That is not possible, because we do not have the money for that.
Mr President, I should like to offer my congratulations to the two rapporteurs on an enormously complicated and difficult task.
They have highlighted - as will I - the importance of this industry a major employer of this industrial research base.
It is so important to keep in the European Union, both for the European Union and, above all, for consumers who want safe, effective and affordable medicines.
Added to that are the complex needs of the sectors in the industry, of which there are at least three: the in-patent sector, the generic sector and the over-the-counter sector.
Many of the amendments are seeking to strike the correct balance between them.
We have to encourage the in-patent sector to develop new medicines but the generic sector also provides affordable medicines.
If you add to this the whole question of access and affordability on a global scale, you can see just how complex an area this is.
I want to draw attention to just three points.
One is the authorisation procedure.
I am urging colleagues to accept duality, at least in the immediate future.
Mrs GrossetÃªte perhaps needs to re-examine the whole question of the centralised procedure and access.
The fact that medicines are authorised does not mean that they are automatically placed on the market. This applies particularly to veterinary medicines.
In their case I really believe that duality should continue.
On the question of advertising and consumer information, I urge Parliament to accept the amendment that asks the Commission to look again at this issue.
The Commission is right - information is available to some, but not to all.
That is almost beyond our control.
On data exclusivity, the balance that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has come up with is the right one.
I hope that Parliament will look at it sensibly.
We are going to have an important second reading and possibly a conciliation, so we still have time to try and get this even more right that we have done so far.
. (IT) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs MÃŒller and Mrs GrossetÃªte for their work and for the goodwill they have displayed in working on reports on subjects which are certainly difficult and complex for all but the experts.
The primary objective of all the institutions - Parliament, the Commission and the Member States - should be to introduce, at last, new legislation which is better than the previous legislation and which will provide all patients, including those suffering from serious, terminal illnesses, with as rapid access as possible to new medicinal products which are more powerful and easier to tolerate than existing medicinal products, to alleviate their suffering and extend and improve their quality of life.
In the short space of time available to me, I will focus on just a few points.
As regards the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, I am completely opposed to the proposal regarding the membership of the management board.
A management board such as that proposed by the Commission, and by the rapporteur, Mrs MÃŒller, too, would certainly be doomed to failure.
The presence on the management board of members representing the institutions and, in addition, of members with conflicting interests - such as industry, patients and insurance companies - would only lead to confusion, wasted time and major disputes.
The second point I would like to make concerns the centralised procedure, where evaluation is carried out by the European Agency.
The concept of 'new medicinal product' needs to be better defined, Commissioner.
What is meant by the term 'new medicinal product'?
Does it refer to a medicinal product which has the same structure as existing medicinal products but with a very small change, or does it actually refer to medicinal products with a new chemical structure?
I hope that you and the Council will think again on this matter.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs.
I would add my great thanks to Mrs GrossetÃªte with whom I have worked extremely closely on this particular issue.
I am only here to represent the Committee on Agriculture on the veterinary medicines side.
It would be remiss of me if I did not say at the outset that one of the problems facing agriculture is that it is going through the worst time it has ever had - I will not mention the problems facing British beef today.
Any legislation that this Parliament adopts and pushes through the Commission could have a detrimental effect on industry if it is not put through correctly.
Mrs GrossetÃªte has worked extremely well with me and other members on the veterinary medicines bill and, therefore, we will totally support all the legislation in that bill.
I would like to raise three issues.
Mrs Read briefly covered one.
I totally endorse what she says about what is termed 'duality'.
One of the problems we have in the European Union is that animals in the very far north, for example, are not necessarily the same as animals in the south.
I use the term 'the reindeer syndrome', which many colleagues will have heard me say before.
Duality is something that will help to promote the proper use of medicines for species that are not found across the European Union.
It may be difficult to get someone to spend the money to test these products for one particular species.
Therefore, we have retabled Amendment No 137, which I hope the Commission and Mrs GrossetÃªte will consider.
I hope this House will consider supporting it.
As I have mentioned, this would help those species that are not widespread.
Mrs GrossetÃªte mentioned the way that medicines are dispensed in certain countries.
I am delighted that she has taken this on board.
I fully support the compromise amendment, which is something I worked particularly hard in the Committee on Agriculture to get through.
We are in a situation where Member States differ, firstly, in their definition of what a veterinary surgeon is and what it means and, secondly, in the dispensing of these drugs.
In many instances in the United Kingdom, Ireland and one or two other countries, qualified people dispense minor medicines - in particular, products such as worming pills and flea powders.
The real worry is not particularly with food-chain animals.
But, if this option is removed, we are in a situation where the pets in the animal world will suffer because people will not be able to afford to go to a veterinary surgeon, for example, to get a worming pill for a cat.
Therefore, it is important that we have flexibility.
I am delighted that both rapporteurs have taken this on board and am totally in favour of it.
The final point concerns the use of medicines for equine species.
Again, if we are not careful, we are going to inflict hardship on animals that do not deserve it.
For example, horses are not eaten in the United Kingdom.
It may be that horsemeat is accepted in other countries.
If the medicines available to us are restricted, then again it is the animal that suffers.
Therefore, it is vitally important that the new Amendment No 65 for equine species is adopted.
I shall leave it there, as I have covered the agricultural scene totally.
I thank the two rapporteurs for taking on board the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and look forward to a worthwhile result.
I hope the Commission will also follow my opinion.
Mr President, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for the exceptional reports they have tabled here for debate, especially Mrs GrossetÃªte, with whom we had an excellent and highly productive working relationship.
As regards the proposal to revise pharmaceutical legislation in order to maintain high standards of public health and complete the single market and, in the field of medicinal products, to meet the challenges of enlargement, apply a more functional and simplified procedure for authorising and supervising medicinal products - by which we mean medicinal products at affordable prices - and, finally, guarantee transparency and access to information on medical products for patients, I should like to comment briefly on the following points.
Innovation: we depend on scientific research and innovation for new combinations of substances and new drugs to fight and cure disease.
But this sort of research needs bold investment by the pharmaceutical industry and this is only feasible if we provide a framework of financial incentives.
Incentives: these are based mainly on exclusivity, by which we mean protecting industrial property rights and inventions.
As a result, the cost of developing a medicinal product is borne by the market and social security systems which, because of the ageing population, are now under tremendous pressure.
So we need to strike a balance here between patented exclusivity, the price of medicinal products and the period of protection.
This is a hard balance to strike.
However, I think that the arrangements achieved in the regulation and now being proposed do strike a balance between exclusivity on the one hand and a reasonable period of protection on the other.
Safety of medicinal products: this is also a serious requirement and the elements of quality and vigilance are also taken into account in this excellent report.
Authorisation: I am in favour of a centralised procedure with a degree of decentralisation to the Member States.
Finally, subsidiarity: this is a very important factor because it is the Member States that foot the bill and provide medical and medicinal care.
Yesterday President Bush made a move precisely because the Member States are under huge financial pressure in this sector.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, revising Community legislation on medicinal products, with the aim of providing improved levels of care, is a good thing and we welcome this new process of harmonisation of veterinary and human medicinal products.
Health policy in Europe should not, however, be limited to the text on which we are about to vote, and should have been the subject of a more thorough deliberation.
We must once again look at medicine in a context of public health that serves our citizens, as, although medicinal products exist, they must still be accessible to all men and women, and we regret the fact that we have not had a debate on social protection.
For public health policy to take precedence over industrial policy, the Agency for medicinal products must be part of the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection once more, rather than the Directorate General for Enterprise.
We are also disappointed by other aspects of the Commission proposal.
The first I shall mention is that of patient information.
We live in a society of high-speed communication and the Internet enables those, who wish or are able to, to access a great deal of information.
Although the quality of this information is not always satisfactory, the solution proposed by the Commission to resolve this problem is not the right answer.
Giving the pharmaceutical companies the option of communicating information on their products will not make it possible to eradicate erroneous information, but will authorise advertising on prescription-only medicines.
This formula, which is permitted in the United States and in New Zealand, has shown its limits.
During the last decade, spending by the United States on direct advertising has risen from USD 55 million, reaching USD 2.5 billion in 2000.
Out of the total increase related to medicinal products, 47% was spent on advertising 50 medicinal products.
There is no doubt that this is a commercial strategy and is not out of a concern for information.
This is not what we want for European citizens.
What we need is independent information provided by independent sources, which do not harm the relationship between patients and doctors and which do not lead to the excessive consumption of medicinal products.
The proposals on the transparency of data provided by the Agency are heading in this direction.
We could certainly have gone a little further.
In demanding information, patients are also demanding safety and it is doubtful that the withdrawal of the five-yearly renewal will help to achieve this.
Let us wait for the new proposals in the area of pharmacovigilance to prove their worth and let us maintain the option of carrying out a genuine scientific evaluation of a medicinal product, five years after it has been placed on the market, in the case of a new medicine.
This evaluation could also provide an opportunity to weigh up the therapeutic value of the medicinal product.
Lastly, I will say that although patients need effective medicinal products, some, unfortunately, need treatment urgently and hope to have access to new treatments, which, although they have not yet provided all possible safety guarantees, are a last resort for these patients.
We must listen to them and provide a response to their appeal.
This report highlights some considerable challenges.
They will have an effect on the policy regarding medicinal products, but also on health policies.
Mr President, in its proposal, the Commission has tried to reform the pharmaceutical industry, or at least has tried to make a start on it.
In the pharmaceutical industry, Europe is losing out to the United States.
It is not for nothing that an increasing number of companies have decided to carry out their practical research and development in the United States.
European legislation is too opaque, which dampens the companies' motivation to carry out their activities in Europe, and in order to counter this, better European coordination in this field is therefore necessary as a matter of priority.
I am greatly in favour of opening up this fossilised market.
We must therefore strive for more competition within the European market, and one of the ways of achieving this is, for example, by making generic medicines available sooner, something on which a sound compromise has been reached within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Furthermore, I would insist on the centralised procedure, which is carried out by the Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in London, being reinforced so as to guarantee the equal treatment of all pharmaceutical companies and to give patients throughout Europe access to the same medicines.
This centralised method also promotes all the objectives pursued by the Commission, such as a high level of health care, completion of the internal market, more transparency, improvement of competition and preparation for enlargement.
I also set great store by the provision of information.
It remains a mystery to me why the pharmaceutical industry is not allowed to inform patients about its products.
I have said it before, but I should like to repeat it here: the European Union has thus been taken over by events and is discriminating against patients.
At the moment, information of this kind is only available to people with a command of English and with access to the Internet, as this information is available in the United States.
Patients who have no access to these resources are kept in the dark by Europe, and it is for this reason too that I think that the Commission's proposal to come up with a trial project is sound and is in any case a good first step.
I do believe that by only making information on asthma, AIDS and diabetes available, patients suffering from other diseases are discriminated against, and I would call for this list to be extended.
Finally, I should like to remark that the reinforcement of the role of patient organisations in this context is of course important at European level as well, including with a view to enlargement and to this centralised procedure.
The Group of the Greens has tabled amendments to this effect, which I should like to endorse.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, since these are very difficult reports and it is not easy to balance the different interests.
I agree with them that our main concern must be attention to and clear information for patients.
Neither must we forget what the honourable Member said in relation to the budget of the Agency and the different agencies.
This is a restrictive budget, and in the end those of us who continue to say that the European Union's general budget is very low if it is to confront enlargement and the spending the new countries will generate will be proved right.
Since I do not have much time, Mr President, I would like to stress certain aspects of the report: firstly, the guarantee that the officials, experts and authors of reports do not have financial or any other type of interest in the pharmaceutical industry.
Secondly, something that has been said here on many occasions, the clear differentiation between publicity and information.
The free database with different levels for users, health staff, companies and others is all very well.
However, as has also been said here, not everybody has access to the Internet and not everybody knows English and the Member States will have to provide patients with other important types of information so that they can decide between effectiveness, side effects and counter-indications.
A system of penalties for holders of authorisations who fail to comply with the directive, making the actions of the holder in question public.
And an increase - as the rapporteurs have said - in the monitoring of pharmaceuticals, because the effects of medication do not end with authorisation, and furthermore there must be continued monitoring.
Finally, Mr President, access to generic medications that reduce pharmaceutical spending should be facilitated and furthermore there should be a guarantee that the Member States will provide information explaining to users that a cheaper medication is not necessarily any less effective.
Mr President, for our part, the revision of the pharmaceutical legislation must aim, first and foremost, to ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products available on the European market, in order to protect public health.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has taken this into account by voting - by a broad majority - against any direct to consumer advertising for prescription medicines, whilst increasing the transparency of market authorisation procedures.
Patients have a right to objective and reliable information on illnesses and on the therapies available to treat them.
What better information can we give than to make available to the public the database containing all the medicinal products registered at the Agency, together with the evaluation report on these products, the reasons for their authorisation or their rejection and the explanatory leaflet on the results of clinical trials, be they positive or negative?
On the contrary, information obtained by the pharmaceutical industry alone cannot be objective and more or less equates to advertising direct to consumers.
Furthermore, it seems important that stricter rules be adopted when promoting medicinal products for use by professionals, which is what, in fact, happens in my own country.
We must increase the transparency and independence of the Agency by making it accessible to consumer and patient representatives.
The safety and the quality of medicines are based on a scientific evaluation, which highlights the risks and benefits of the product.
The risk/benefit relationship makes it possible to determine whether or not the market authorisation can be issued.
This must be re-assessed, however, in order to take into account the effects related to its use as well as any new scientific data available.
The administrative burden involved in the five-yearly renewal of the market authorisation in no way justifies the immediate withdrawal of any periodic re-evaluation of new medicinal products, in particular.
That is why we are proposing that at least a re-evaluation takes place once the product has been on the market for five years.
Far from running counter to the new provisions on pharmacovigilance, this measure clearly strengthens the safety of medicinal products.
Similarly, we are refusing to reduce the time spent on the scientific evaluation of medicinal products, under the centralised procedure as well as the decentralised procedure, and even in the case of the accelerated procedure or the reduction protocol that we support.
Lastly, the effectiveness of a medicinal product can only be demonstrated when it is compared to that of other medicinal products available to treat the same conditions.
Is it any good developing new medicines which add nothing in therapeutic terms or to maintain products that have been overtaken by new medical technologies?
The initial evaluation, and that carried out after five years, provide the opportunity to weigh up the added therapeutic value of medicinal products.
This measure can only motivate European research and innovation.
Finally, we are opposed to the amendments which seek to limit the centralised procedure and to encourage the procedure of mutual recognition, or even to delay generic products coming onto the market.
We welcome the adoption in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of the amendments on the impact of medicinal products on the environment.
My fellow Members have supported us on this issue and we are rather pleased by this.
To sum up, Mr President, although pharmaceutical companies have, by and large, been backed up in the Commission's initial proposals, we have a duty - and this must be the mission of the European Parliament - to protect the interests of citizens, patients and consumers.
Mr President, medicinal products are something quite ordinary and everyday.
Virtually all of us have used them and come into contact with them.
In other words, Parliament's power of co-decision in this area is important as a tangible example of the way European Parliament decisions can affect people's lives.
Indeed, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I have come to expect representations from many organisations across the board.
On this occasion, I have been contacted by farming organisations, veterinary groups, agricultural co-operatives, pharmaceutical interests, health stores and numerous individual constituents.
Each group has its own particular concerns, but one common theme emerges: the proposed legislation does not take sufficient account of the different situations in the Member States.
This is surely a lesson for the Commission.
In an ideal situation, the legislation proposed would take account of such diversity.
We in Ireland breed horses primarily for sporting purposes and meat does not end up at the end of the food chain.
Consequently, the same safeguards are not required for medicines given to horses.
I could cite many more instances and I have tabled a number of amendments for my group to deal with some of the difficulties.
I would say to the Commission that if we are to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of decision-making, we must reassure our citizens that their specific concerns have been taken into consideration.
If we proceed with 'one size fits all' legislation which ignores the particularities of individual countries or regions, we risk alienating our citizens.
In conclusion, we have just concluded a long referendum campaign in Ireland, with a successful outcome for the Nice Treaty, and one of the major issues throughout the campaign was the sense of powerlessness and distance.
We, as legislators, have a responsibility to ensure that we bring the people with us and keep in touch with their everyday concerns
Finally, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs.
Mr President, every human life is unique and valuable because it is a gift from God.
Accordingly, every life deserves the best possible protection and care from the cradle to the grave.
A smoothly running European medicines market fits in well with this ambition.
Our group believes it to be of major importance that Europe does not present any obstacles which could frustrate the operation of the medicines market.
We are therefore of the view that manufacturers of medicines must continue to have the choice between the centralised and decentralised registration of medicines.
Compulsory centralised registration would hamper the necessary flexibility which regional products enjoy, it would lead to a brain drain from the national registration authorities and it could present too great a financial obstacle for SMEs, preventing them from introducing certain products onto the market.
In addition, we are in favour of more research into the effects of medicines on children.
To date, a large proportion of medicines administered to children has only been tested on adults, even though it is surely obvious that children are different from adults in terms of their metabolism, the necessary dosage and the administration method.
Finally, we are against allowing medicines to be advertised, because this could lead to an unnecessary increase in the use of medicines.
We are, however, in favour of providing patients with extensive information.
We therefore await with interest the outcome of the trial proposed by the European Commission in which patients are actively provided with information.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us today a wide-ranging revision of the law on medicinal products in Europe.
This will have an impact on the competitiveness of companies of all sizes in this sector and accordingly on a great many jobs.
However, it also of course affects the entire trade, pharmacists and, last but not least, the patient.
This mammoth document is, amongst other things, the result of a new strategy that the Commission has already been pursuing for several years.
The volume of Community law, which currently stands at over 80 000 pages, is to be simplified and tightened up.
In the case of this particular revision, a single legislative act is to be adopted, taking account of the various substantive changes required and codifying the remaining provisions.
The many amendments tabled in committee and now once again in the plenary are just one indication of how difficult this undertaking is.
I have enormous respect for the massive amount of work put in by the Commission and by our two rapporteurs, Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mrs MÃŒller, but I am genuinely concerned that we may to some extent have lost track of the overall picture, so that some apparently less important issues have not perhaps been attended to.
That is why I would like to draw your attention to homeopathic medicines, not just for humans but also for animals, and I urge you to support these amendments too.
The European Parliament is a co-legislator here and we need to make sure that we do our work carefully.
At first reading, we still have a lot of opportunities, but we should also leave the way open for the second reading.
That is why I am asking for your support, but I am also calling on the Legal Service and on our rapporteurs to check whether the final outcome is coherent.
Only the future can tell whether this pharmaceutical legislation will be easier for the Member States and other stakeholders to apply because of its reduced linguistic complexity.
I would like to thank everyone involved and hope that this magnum opus will be a success.
Mr President, in this brief time I would like to make two points, both in relation to veterinary medicines.
In a way, they have been the poor relation in these debates because of the immense complexity of the situation with regard to human medicinal substances.
Firstly, I would like to warn against the Commission's proposals under Article 67 that all veterinary medicines intended for food-producing animals should be available on prescription only.
Some Member States, including my own, have a well-established distribution system that allows medicines for which veterinary involvement is not considered necessary for safe and effective use to be obtained without a veterinary certificate.
I can see why some professional organisations in some other Member States would be opposed to that, but it has worked effectively for very many years in Ireland as well as the UK.
When we now look at the enlargement of the Union, all kinds of problems will arise if we allow ourselves now to move towards a centralised system which allows only by prescription use of such medicines as are currently administered by qualified persons in countries like the UK.
I therefore commend Amendment No 43 to the House.
My second and last point is that on the mandatory centralised procedures proposed by the Commission, the committee decided to move to a more flexible system for human medicines, but did not follow that same route in terms of animal medicines.
We should rectify that and we can do so through Amendment No 171.
Finally, I would make the point that it is a mistake for the Commission to propose that we remove the five-year renewal requirement for marketing authorisation.
That is a safety precaution we should retain.
Commissioner and rapporteurs, I would like to thank our rapporteurs for their excellent work on a quite impenetrable matter.
I normally do not thank the rapporteurs, but there is good reason to do so in this case, as it is extremely difficult to attempt to master the whole of this large area.
Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the costs of medicines in many EU countries constitute the fastest growing element of healthcare costs.
In many countries, the shortfall in funding specifically for medicines is quite large.
I therefore believe it was important that the Health Ministers were involved in this issue before the Council was restructured to increase efficiency.
I hope that the Health Ministers will also be involved in the future.
I usually also remain highly sceptical when Parliament asks the Commission for more reports.
This time, I believe, however, that it would be important for the Commission to follow up trends in medicine prices, taking into account differences in different countries.
This may provide us with very valuable information on various restrictions.
I support what my colleague Mr Maaten said on access to information and what the Commissioner said regarding the fact that the issue is not advertising but access to information.
We have many examples of information and other support being given to doctors in an unacceptable manner.
Monitoring information would allow us to keep better track of how much money is being used in this sector.
I see this as important.
I believe one of the major problems, which many of the amendments also seize upon, is that we have what has been referred to as paid research.
Many respected newspapers have also given their pages over to this.
Finally, I, like Mr Rod, stress that I am glad that the effect of medicines on the environment will also be taken into account.
It is not that we wish to set up obstacles to medicines but that the positive effects must be evaluated in relation to other effects.
Mr President, the - apparently essential - aim of the proposals for a regulation and directive put forward by the Commission is to strengthen the short-term competitiveness of pharmaceutical companies.
It is proposed, in particular, to extend the length of time that clinical data is to be protected, to increase the flexibility of and accelerate the market authorisation procedure and, above all, to lift the ban on pharmaceutical companies advertising prescription-only medicines to the general public.
What is essentially being proposed is the model used in the United States, where this ban was lifted in 1997.
Based on an exclusively market-driven approach, these proposals consider medicinal products as an everyday, consumer article, almost a product like any other.
This approach is combined with that which is increasingly common in international trade negotiations, which seek to subject health and education to the laws of the market within the framework of the liberalisation of services.
In the light of this deteriorating situation, a group was set up at European level, bringing together consumer organisations, family organisations, patients' associations, insurance companies, and health insurance bodies.
The 'Europe and Medicines' group has been working to provide information and clarification to European bodies and governments.
This action, which enabled us to get a better feel for the economic, political and ethical challenges of this dossier, has delivered results.
Due to this, the majority of members of the Committee on the Environment approved the reports which are not in line with the Commission's approach and I welcome, in particular, the fact that the reports are opposed to the advertising of medicinal products.
My group, in conjunction with the 'Europe and Medicines' group, will pursue its efforts to have a responsible policy applied throughout the European Union, one which improves public health, therapeutic progress and consumer protection.
In order to do this, three principles should be strengthened in the European medicines regulation system: harmonisation between countries in order to guarantee evaluation and monitoring of a high quality, the independence of institutions responsible for medicinal products, and the transparency of the system for all.
Mr President, the centralised procedure is our preferred choice.
Medicines should be accessible to all Europeans, particularly following enlargement.
The fact that we have 500 amendments is to do with the different lobbies and, above all, with the conflict between new and generic medicines.
I welcome the compromise that has been reached, which offers protection that lasts eight years.
I can just about endorse the ten-year market protection for new medicines within the EU.
However, it should be possible for manufacturers of generic medicines to sell their products in countries outside of Europe.
Those countries are invariably poorer and would benefit from these cheaper medicines.
My group is delighted that the Commission's proposal to authorise advertising for prescription medicines for AIDS, asthma and diabetes has suffered a crushing defeat in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Despite this, the Liberal Group has re-tabled this absurd proposal.
In the USA, advertising for prescription medicines has been decontrolled for the past five years.
Sales have increased by 80%, admittedly not only thanks to advertising, but even so.
The American population has not become any healthier as a result.
The pharmaceutical industry's profits, on the other hand, have soared.
Patients are in great need of more information, but only if they ask for it.
At the moment, they have to make do with American websites.
Via the Internet and telephone helplines, it should be possible for patients to obtain information about medicines in their own language. The five-yearly re-evaluation of medicines has now become a formality.
My group would prefer to see an improved re-evaluation procedure put in place, a re-evaluation with substance.
Does a medicine have value-added?
The pharmaceutical industry is decidedly against this.
I should, however, like to repeat that it is not commercial interests but health care that should come first.
Many medicines are toxic substances.
When they leave the body, they are often still toxic, also to the environment.
This is why my group is very pleased that consideration will now also be given to the environment in the assessment of new medicines.
The European Commission has dropped a major clanger in this respect.
Is that because the Directorate-General of Industry is responsible?
Mr President, this is an area in which we have had considerable experience over the years, especially in respect of organophosphate pesticides, which are used as sheep dips and for a variety of other purposes.
It is our experience that the licensing system in toto provides a false guarantee of safety, in that no predictive testing could accurately ascertain the full extent of toxicity and the potential health threat to humans or animals.
Thus the key to safety is an effective post-licensing surveillance system, sensitive enough to identify adverse reactions speedily and to enable swift and effective action to be taken.
This requires effective administrative and medical systems, including diagnostic systems, in each Member State.
Again, our experience is that these systems are far from adequate.
We therefore believe that it would be better to focus on this area, rather than extend an already over-complex code.
Mr President, the problem of the great discrepancies in medicines policy in our Member States cannot be solved today.
We are, however, taking a step in the right direction as far as greater harmonisation in registration is concerned and also with regard to the conditions for placing medicines, particularly generic medicines, on the market.
Admittance to Member State markets, however, remains at the discretion of the individual Member States.
One of today's important areas of discussion is the relationship between the original medicine and the generic product that is introduced onto the market once the patent and data protection have lapsed.
A fragile compromise has been tabled, in respect of which I have tabled a better worded amendment.
I would ask my fellow MEPs for their support, but I do endorse the compromise.
In fact, I should also like to take this opportunity to issue a warning that speeding up the launch of a generic product will not automatically lead to lower costs.
In the Netherlands, I have noticed that the price of a generic product there is higher than the price of the original medicine in a large number of Member States.
I should also like to comment on pricing policy.
Although we are once again bringing transparency to your attention, it is frustrating - and I am also addressing this comment to the rapporteurs of 1989 - that the directive on transparency is not being fleshed out.
There are large discrepancies, and we will not solve them today.
It is too ridiculous for words that medicines from the Netherlands, where the price paid by consumers for generic medicines is so high, are exported to other Member States in parallel.
We should put a stop to this.
Finally, I am not in favour of advertising.
I am in favour of making self-regulating information accessible on the web.
Whether this information originates from national agencies or the industry itself is irrelevant, as long as it is self-regulating.
In my view, articulate consumers should not have to resort to websites in America but should also be able to access this information in Europe.
I should ask you to carefully reconsider my amendments on this score.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the pharmaceutical industry is doing well, boasting high profits over a long period of time.
Health budgets, on the other hand, are not in such good shape, unfortunately.
Spending on medicines is increasing in most Member States.
The development of medicines is not going well either.
There is little real innovation in Europe and, what is worse, the development of medicines to fight the worldwide health crisis, is seriously lagging behind.
Although this is a wholly unsatisfactory situation, we can use the review of pharmaceutical legislation to take steps in the right direction.
We should first of all adopt a sound price policy.
The price of medicines is determined at national level, and currently differs widely across the various European Member States.
For new medicines, the Commission should lay down a guideline on the basis of the development costs involved.
Many countries would like to cut down on public health spending by raising the patients' own contributions for medicines.
This is unacceptable.
Savings should, in fact, be sought in joint and improved negotiations with the industry instead of by increasing patients' own contributions.
Secondly, legislation should not hamper, but rather promote, innovation.
Industry wants to do this by extending the data protection period, but this is no guarantee for innovation.
Quite the opposite, in fact; there is more innovation happening in the United States, which has a shorter period of protection.
We must stimulate innovation by emphasising the therapeutic value-added and, above all, by displaying public leadership and by raising questions in the area of research ourselves.
Agreements can be reached about the research agenda during the price negotiations.
Good prices in exchange for investments in medicines for which there is a worldwide need are a step in the right direction.
Thirdly, we must put provisions in place which enable the production of generic versions of essential medicines that are still patented but that are unaffordable in developing countries.
This should only apply to medicines for countries that do not yet have the production capacity available themselves.
Major steps were taken in Doha to make medicines more affordable in developing countries.
All that remains for us to do is to make a small, yet important, step.
Finally, we must single-mindedly uphold the ban on advertising medicines.
Providing direct information or advertising that is aimed at patients is not the right way forward.
The pharmaceutical industry is already spending huge amounts of money on marketing.
Even more marketing will hike up the price of medicines unnecessarily.
At least as important is the argument that we must prevent the industry from talking healthy people into illnesses.
There are other ways of ensuring that good information is available to patients.
I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to Mrs GrossetÃªte and, above all, Mrs MÃŒller for all her intricate work.
All her efforts to make medicines more suitable for children and women receive my wholehearted support, as does her plea for a European approach, for which I should also like to express thanks.
Mr President, I would also like to thank Commissioner Liikanen's staff, and above all Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mrs MÃŒller, for the quality of their work on one of the most important public health dossiers of our parliamentary term.
Since the main points have already been covered, I shall devote my speaking time to the points on which there is still disagreement.
Firstly, as far as the European Agency for the evaluation of medicinal products in London is concerned, I feel it is important to stress the essential role this body has played for seven years, a role which, in view of the forthcoming enlargement and of improving the way the internal market works, deserves to be extended to all medicinal products using a new active substance.
That is why the Liberal Group is categorically opposed to Amendment Nos 136 of the report by Mrs MÃŒller.
Regarding the protection of commercial data, the compromise adopted in committee, by 8 Members with 2 abstentions, balances the requirements and is, in my view, perfectly suitable.
Why is this?
Because no one has been able to demonstrate a direct and unique link between industrial protection and the success of generic products.
The case of Germany and the United Kingdom, with ten full years of data protection and generic products which in fact have a 20% market share, illustrate this point remarkably well.
If we attack research and development, we are attacking the wrong target and putting the very foundations of health protection at risk.
It would be more honest, I believe, to acknowledge the genuine influence, on the development of generic products, of a genuine policy that works as an incentive in terms of price and refunds and, in parallel, of an effort by health professionals to enlighten their patients, and I support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's arguments on this point.
My last point concerns the 'Information for patients' section. Like other Members, I am not satisfied with the vote that took place in committee.
Firstly, because the European Commission had the courage to tackle head on a considerable and practical problem which, whether you like it or not, must be resolved.
Medical information on the Internet, freely accessible, is not monitored at present, which may have damaging consequences, as Commissioner Liikanen mentioned at the beginning of the debate.
Next, because accurate information, it must indeed be pointed out, is not necessarily advertising, and because the equation between the two that some skilfully maintain is simplistic and misleading.
We should therefore clarify and refine the Commission's text, which is what Mrs GrossetÃªte tried to do, rather than delete everything.
To sum up, Mr President - and this is the most important point, the rapporteurs have emphasised this sufficiently - it is vital to maintain a fair balance between the essential priorities of public health and those priorities which aim to encourage the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry, and therefore research in Europe, and the completion of our single market.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, this report is written from the point of view of defending the interests of the pharmaceutical industry.
Yet, the quest for profits cannot be reconciled with the defence of public health.
When one claims to protect public health, one must put the interests of the community first and one must take into account the health of all human beings, whether or not they can afford to pay.
As for the pharmaceutical industry, well, it is only interested in those who can pay.
This is the reason why it wants to work quickly, in order to release medicinal products which yield a high return.
In other words, in their jargon, they want 'blockbusters' which earn more than one billion dollars per year.
Spending insufficient time, however, on research and trials in order to rake in profits more quickly will certainly have a detrimental effect on the safety and health of patients, not to mention those working in these industries.
I would also like to condemn the other consequence of the quest for profit, namely job losses, including within the research sector.
This is what is happening at the moment at the pharmaceutical company, Aventis, which is cutting 10 000 jobs world-wide and closing factories and research centres in several countries.
You speak about transparency, but the pharmaceutical industry has always kept its margins under wraps, which are amongst some of the highest in industry, due to the very fact that they are guaranteed by the national health systems.
We are told that it would be awful if terrorists were to contaminate populations with smallpox, since we would not have the necessary medicinal products to treat people.
Whilst that may be true, this disastrous scenario is already happening.
Every day, thousands of children die from diseases that we know how to treat, such as measles, and for which medicinal products exist.
It is the thirst for profit of large pharmaceutical companies that is responsible for this, and they enjoy the compelling support of the governments.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know from our own experience that there is really no such thing as an internal market in pharmaceutical products in the European Union.
There are price differences of as much as 400% between Belgium and Germany, and you cannot simply explain that away by different VAT rates!
I am afraid that these reports concentrate too much on approval.
I hope, however, that the transparency that we have flagged up here and that we are calling for will in future make it easier for consumers to understand why there are such great price differences between individual Member States.
It is not acceptable for Europe's internal market so obviously not to include the pharmaceutical industry.
I hope that by achieving transparency the links between public research and industrial research will also become clearer, and that databases will also make it easier to see who has been involved in given clinical tests and to what extent public research receives external funding.
I too am pleased that we managed to leave advertising out of the equation, because that would have simply raised expectations on the part of patients that could not be met.
We are talking about better and more favourable prices, not about more advertising.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciate the fact that my colleague, Mrs GrossetÃªte, has repeatedly highlighted considerations of public health and safety in her amendments.
These are areas which, from the outset, medicinal products were intended to safeguard.
These brief comments are not unnecessary.
If, after all, medicinal products have, in many hands, become an end in themselves, and have gone against their original aim, Mrs GrossetÃªte's approach is a welcome restoration of discipline.
I genuinely hope that spirit will remain in this directive up until we have finally achieved a result.
Furthermore, Amendment No 16 concerning the identification of the ingredients of generic drugs is in order, as that will promote a more judicious use of them, that is to say, generic substitution.
It is a question of using medicinal products rationally and exploiting the price potential of medicines in official drug substitution systems after medicinal product patents expire.
Patients' contributions also go down when they are put on medicines that are similar to, but cheaper than, the original ones.
Promoting the use of generic drugs fully meets with the European Union's objectives in the areas of policy on medicinal products and public health.
These objectives on the other hand include ensuring the supply of medicines that are new and regarded as important in terms of their therapeutic value to the patients that need them.
These medicinal products are patent protected and in general expensive.
Experience in my country, Finland, and in many others has shown that practice with regard to prescribing medicines does not move sufficiently in the direction of cheaper alternative medicinal products or alternative imported products unless there is guidance in the shape of government action, in other words, legislation.
Such guidance comes in the form of inter alia reference price systems, doctors' own budgets for medicinal products, and generic substitution.
In addition, I should like to thank those of my colleagues responsible for tabling Amendment Nos 95, which obliges manufacturers to guarantee an adequate supply of medicinal products to wholesalers.
Restrictions on supplies, as practised by some manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, cause problems for wholesalers of medicinal products and, ultimately, the patient.
Mr President, the reports by Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mrs MÃŒller which we are discussing today share an implicit but fundamental premise: medicinal products are products like no other, which affect health, and health is non-negotiable.
I do not know if it is a divine right, as has been said, but it is, in any case, an unassailable right.
That said, the rapporteurs have - virtually - achieved the impossible.
In other words, first of all, they have reconciled the interests of the patient in terms of independent information, safety and rapid access to generic products, even though, in my view, we could certainly have gone much further.
That said, the compromises in this area are still acceptable.
Next, they have helped to control the budget of insurance companies and health insurers, because, although health is non-negotiable, it comes at a price which is rocketing, due to the progress being made in medicine, the army of pharmaceutical products available and the ageing population.
Last, but by no means least, they have managed to preserve the interests of the pharmaceutical firms whose concerns over data exclusivity and financial resources invested in research have been taken on board.
I do not believe their competitiveness will suffer as a result, because I know that, through competition, we are also protecting the jobs that these firms provide.
The compromises reached in the Committee on the Environment actually manage to reflect the specific nature of the European social model, which attempts to ally social issues with competition.
I am particularly pleased by the rejection of all advertising of prescription-only medicines, which acknowledges their unique character and prevents a dramatic rise in their use.
There are still two contentious points, but these merit our attention as they are more scientific in nature.
The first concerns the renewal of the five-yearly revision of the marketing authorisation of the medicinal product, which is yet to be resolved.
Too many previous examples, however, such as thalidomide, show us that the side effects of a medicinal product can last for much longer than five years and, in addition, developments in medicine happen so quickly that treatment for the same condition can swiftly change.
This problem cannot always be prevented by pharmacovigilance, even though it is very important.
The second point is the idea of added therapeutic value for a new medicinal product.
This simple idea, very different from the cost-benefit ratio, should however be understood by researchers within the pharmaceutical industry.
Since, what use is an innovation if it cannot demonstrate its therapeutic advantage?
If we agree to allow pharmaceutical companies to recoup their investment in research through the cost of the product, we have a right to expect that they will do this by adapting to the most widely-used scientific criteria.
Mr President, I have admiration for the accomplishment of scientific research in developing medicines which have proved of great benefit.
Yet I also have a healthy scepticism towards both the pharmaceutical industry and our exaggerated confidence in some of its products, many of which cause a great deal more harm than the illegal recreational drugs which attract the bulk of public attention.
For that reason, it would be wrong to place more unnecessary burdens and regulations upon food supplements and the health-food shops that sell them.
Many believe these products to be beneficial, and at least they do not cause harm.
I regard homeopathic medicines in the same way.
Today we have more patients who are better informed than ever before - that is a good thing.
I want people to have access to objective information about medicines and treatment.
However, that is quite different from opening the door to the direct advertising of medicines.
The result, I fear, will not be better public information, but greater public confusion, stimulated by the marketing techniques of a used-car salesman.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to compliment both rapporteurs on their excellent work.
I believe that these proposals provide a good basis for ensuring that the internal market in medical products operates properly for medicines for both human and veterinary use.
As far as I am concerned the hallmark of an internal market is not price stability, but comparable prices, which is something altogether different and really has nothing to do with the internal market.
These proposals will also give a continuing boost to research, making research worthwhile again and also enabling manufacturers of generic drugs to make a living.
I also believe that these proposals will make it possible to take advantage of all the options for maintaining public health.
Harmonising data exclusivity in the European Union will particularly promote research, and at the same time make the task of generic drug manufacturers easier.
I fully support this and those affected should not need to make any further demands.
However, as I see it, extending the centralised authorisation procedure for medicinal products, as advocated by the Commission in committee, is not in accordance with the principles that have been mentioned.
The present twofold authorisation procedure fully meets the requirements of the internal market and guarantees a greater variety of medicinal products, and with lower charges.
The new plan to impose use of the centralised procedure for products with new active substances will undermine competition between the authorisation procedures.
We can include as many processing deadlines as we like in the regulation, but without any competition these figures are meaningless.
I know a great many SMEs that carry out research and in particular companies that are doing research and development in the field of 'orphan drugs' or veterinary medicines.
That is where active substances of this kind are developed.
Authorisation for these would have to be applied for in London, and I believe that these companies cannot afford that, nor can they put it into practice.
So what we will end up achieving is to halt this kind of research, which really is not acceptable.
We should therefore refuse to support the change proposed here.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for their work.
As many colleagues have said, pharmaceutical products are like no other.
We must guarantee that these products are all safe and effective.
Therefore, on the debate on the centralised procedure, I believe we must have flexibility.
We should not restrict choice but allow for choice and support flexibility between the two routes.
On the renewal of authorisation, I oppose the Commission's proposal to remove five-year renewal of marketing authorisation and rely on enhanced pharmaco-vigilance to ensure product safety and, indeed, exclusivity.
I think the compromise which has been reached is a fair one.
I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment has rejected direct consumer advertising.
We must be very clear that we all want patients to be informed.
We all want patients to make informed decisions - no one can argue with this.
But we cannot have what happens in the US, where the ten most advertised drugs are the ten best selling drugs.
This is where the amendments adopted in committee requesting a report and the question of how information to patients is used and enhanced are so important.
Information to patients from the industry varies from excellent approaches and partnership with patients to situations where some patient organisations are being accused of being mere fronts for the industry.
We must get the balance right.
We have an opportunity in the review to do this, to improve research, to secure jobs, to improve availability of products to patients and improve information given to patients.
It is an exciting time, and I look forward to the review returning for second reading.
Mr President, the effective new medicines have brought about a major revolution in healthcare.
They have been a great help to many patients.
One example is the modern medicines to combat heart failure, which have not only increased survival rates but have also radically increased the quality of life for sufferers.
When, twenty years ago, I was a newly-qualified general practitioner, the information available to me on medicines used to be locked away to prevent unauthorised access.
Much has happened since then.
Today, everyone with access to the Internet and with sufficient linguistic ability can find out about treatment principles and information on medicines.
This trend is good for healthcare as well as being a requirement from patient organisations.
The trend certainly places higher demands on doctors, but a doctor will achieve the best relationship with a patient who is well informed.
Mr President, trying to block or limit information to patients ties in very poorly with the principles of transparency in modern healthcare.
Finally, a comment on Mr Rod and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: Your proposal for double testing of medicines is not just poor but could even be dangerous.
Reviews of approved new medicines should not take place after five years, but must be carried out on an ongoing basis.
Mr President, I agree with those who have said that public health protection is the most important objective, but that research also needs to be promoted.
By means of the research incentives envisaged we will not only be making industry more competitive and thus safeguarding around 500 000 jobs in Europe, we will also be promoting the development of new medicinal products.
The proposal for a regulation and the two directives before us do, however, at the same time demand that the pharmaceutical industry, in view of the almost ideal framework conditions - data exclusivity standards are nowhere else as high as in Europe - should demonstrate its capacity for innovation.
Patients need innovative new medical products and not analogous products that burden our health systems without providing any extra benefit for patients.
I believe that as the consultation procedure moves forward, Parliament should not lose sight of the triple objective of improving health protection, enhancing productivity and safeguarding jobs.
Mr President, Commissioner, I will focus once again on a number of what I feel to be key points.
The Commission's proposal to allow a data protection period of ten years must, in my opinion, remain a solid, immovable pillar.
This position is well-balanced and will provide European industry with new incentives and impetus to continue to invest new resources in the development of more effective, safer medicinal products and make them competitive at international level at last.
I feel it is important to have a sufficiently long period of data protection for well-known medicinal products too, wherever there are new therapeutic indications.
As I said before, I do not support the line taken regarding the membership of the management board, which I believe should be made up solely of institutional representatives.
I therefore call upon you, Commissioner, and the Council to come up with a balanced model for a management board which can work calmly, free from dispute or conflict.
I am amazed, reading Amendments Nos 153 and 154, for example, to see that the directive still mentions 'traditional herbal medicinal products'.
I am the rapporteur of another report on traditional herbal medicinal products, and so I do not support Amendments Nos 153 and 154.
However, Mr President, I am in favour of removing the requirement to re-license products every five years.
This is an excessively bureaucratic burden.
I hope that we will, at last, have a system of active pharmacovigilance operating throughout the territory which will allow us to introduce continuous monitoring carried out by highly qualified experts - Europe is teeming with clinical pharmacologists - to ensure that any toxic side effects are made known as soon as they occur.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like thank Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mrs MÃŒller for their very full reports.
Tomorrow we will be voting on the most important revision package to date as regards legislation on medicinal products in the European Union.
The key objectives here are as follows: first, achieving a high level of health protection and giving patients rapid access to innovative products; second, the quality, safety and effectiveness of medicinal products in Europe; and, third, further dismantling existing barriers to trade within the internal market.
Medicinal products need to be used appropriately and correctly.
That is why it is vital for the law to make a clear distinction between information and advertising.
All product information should be scientifically checked before it is published.
Provisions relating to medicinal products should only apply to products that have a therapeutic benefit and are used therapeutically.
Any overlap with food law should be avoided in order to obviate legal uncertainty.
For this reason a clear definition of medicinal products and food is urgently needed, as provided for in Amendments Nos 11 and 18.
The achievements of industrial research as regards innovative therapeutic uses should be recognised by means of appropriate data exclusivity for what are termed 'original products'.
I am, however, also supporting Amendment No 40, which grants existing medicinal products an additional three years' data exclusivity in the event of a new indication.
Generic drugs, which must of course meet all requirements as regards quality, safety and effectiveness, should also be established in the European market and it should be possible to market them as soon as the period of protection for the original drug has expired.
The authorisation procedure is to retain the option of choice between the centralised and decentralised procedures, which has existed since 1995.
It has resulted in a marked increase in the efficiency of the authorisation procedures and has not led to the polarisation that some feared.
It is essential that mutual recognition should continue for the sake of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises.
We need to create a system that promotes innovation in the interests of all patients.
Mr President, these reports deal with very important issues, and I compliment both rapporteurs.
The whole debate on pharmaco-vigilance versus the compulsory five-year review, and the question of whether to centralise the registration procedure or keep the centralised, national and mutual recognition procedures is critical.
With certain necessary changes, we have almost got it right.
It is very important that all citizens have equal access to state-of-the-art drugs, regardless of where they live in Europe.
It is either a single market or it is not.
The same applies to Irish cattle.
It is very important that they should have access to the same veterinary medicines as UK cattle, but at the moment they do not.
We need to get the balance right with access to generic medicines and innovation and research and the needs of the pharmaceutical companies.
This also applies to the Commission proposal on POM, prescription only medicines.
I would ask the Commissioner to take on board the compromise suggested by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which gets the balance right in this area, because the Commission proposal has caused major problems in many countries, particularly the UK and Ireland.
The MRL regulation of 1990 came into force in 1992, and there was a derogation for many countries until 1 January 2000.
This resulted in hundreds of veterinary medicine products being removed from the market and huge welfare problems in Europe for minor animal species - including horses - for many years.
Industry needs to be allowed to place on the market equine veterinary products that do not have MRLs, to be used according to the cascade principle, with a record of treatment and exclusion from the food chain.
Amendment No 65 is necessary, as it ties this principle, which was endorsed by the Committee on the Environment's Amendment No 10, to the passport decision 2000/68/EEC, which amends Decision 93/623/EEC.
I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to look particularly at the passport decision 2000/68/EEC.
We must be consistent here.
As well as listening to the able people in the DG, please listen to the veterinary experts in the field and in research.
No consumer wants to inflict unnecessary pain and suffering on animals for the sake of the food chain, or make criminals of our vets.
We have made mistakes here before.
Please be careful.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I basically support the Commission proposal and the reports by Mrs GrossetÃªte and Mrs MÃŒller.
However, there are a few points on which I differ.
One point was not mentioned in the debate at all, although I believe it to be very important: the Commission has proposed that prescriptions would also be required for medicinal products under the decentralised procedure.
I believe that this is a step in the right direction, but we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater.
I think we need to be careful about ending up in a situation where all medical products that are at present available over the counter require prescriptions, because that would certainly create problems for consumers and would impose unreasonable costs on the health system.
I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 151, which I have tabled jointly with several of my colleagues.
The second important point has already been mentioned many times, but we cannot consider it often enough.
We need to come to an arrangement that is acceptable for small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies.
We cannot adopt legislation that, ultimately, only global players like Pfizer can comply with.
We need rules that are appropriate for SMEs.
In this connection there are a number of important issues, such as the amendment tabled by Mr NisticÃ². Three years' data exclusivity in the event of a new indication is something that SMEs are perhaps in a better position to implement than data exclusivity for a totally new substance.
In committee, I spoke against the pilot project on information and advertising, as I simply cannot understand why the information provided should be extended for three special indications but with far tighter rules in other areas.
