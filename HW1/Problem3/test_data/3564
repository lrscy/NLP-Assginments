Companies will be encouraged to opt to be competitive by the fact that competitive companies will be able to refuse to be taken over by non-competitive companies.
We have established the benchmark and we have protected it, which is better than a directive merely laying down transparency procedures such as that which exists in the United States.
All in all, we can be proud of what we have achieved.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a huge task has been carried out by a lot of people over many years.
In spite of this, the compromise now before us is, in my view, unacceptable.
The proposal would mean that vote differentiation in the matter of shares could be permitted to remain for a transitional period, as an exception to the general rule.
Subsequently, a revision would take place, involving a review of the system of A and B shares and also of other forms of shareholding.
Many believe that this has rescued the Nordic system of shares with different voting values.
Those who maintain that this is a good compromise fail, however, to appreciate the issue of principle surrounding whether the EU is entitled to interfere in how shareholders in private companies choose to organise themselves.
I find it regrettable to see so many in this Parliament so casually accepting infringements of the right of ownership.
No one mentions the crucial issue of the principle of respect for the right of ownership.
It is the business of no one other than the shareholders themselves how they organise their shares.
That is a basic prerequisite of the market economy.
If the compromise is approved, this means in practice that Parliament says it is acceptable to appropriate assets.
If someone has bought a share with a higher voting value at market price, what right does the EU or any state then have quite simply to rob this person of this investment by saying that what he has paid for no longer has any value?
The Swedish Government maintains that this revision clause is a victory because the revision is to embrace more forms of shareholding than simply the system of shares with different voting values.
That may be the case, but the Swedish Government no doubt knows as well as anyone else that, in five yearsâ time when the revision takes place, no one will either be able, or wish, to investigate the multiplicity of forms of shareholding that exist within the EU.
Presumably, the discussion would, then too, be focused upon the system of A and B shares. The reason for that is simple.
Different voting values are a clear and straightforward system.
Unlike with most other systems of shareholding, it is very simple to see how many votes a type of share corresponds to, and it is at least as easy to see what the share is worth in the market.
There are no pitfalls or secrets in this system.
The main aim of the new regulations governing takeover bids is that the EU should be an open market and that obstacles to takeovers should be removed.
The fact is, however, that the number of takeovers in countries in which different voting values are applied is not in any way lower than the number in countries where this system is not permitted.
In summary, the proposal now before us is, in my opinion, unacceptable, for, in the first place, it infringes the right of ownership; secondly, does not respect agreements entered into; and, thirdly, identifies vote-differentiated shares as an obstacle to takeovers.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I would like to refer to certain amendments.
As I said earlier this evening I cannot accept Amendments Nos 5 or 21 because they introduce the optional arrangements which the Commission rejects.
I also have some difficulties with Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 20, last paragraph, concerning special rights, which mix in an undesirable way special rights provided for in the articles of association of certain companies which could be exempted from the application of Article 11, and special rights provided for in law which, as I said earlier, are not within the scope of this directive in any case.
Much has been said tonight on this subject but only two questions have been addressed to the Commission.
The first question is about the inclusion of consultation and codetermination rights for employees and I would like to say in answer to that question that this is not a social directive.
It would therefore not be appropriate to introduce through this directive new consultation and codetermination rights.
Following Parliament's request, we have included in our new proposal a new Article 13 which makes it quite clear that all existing information, consultation and, where appropriate, codetermination rights which are part of Community law, also apply here.
It is also stated very clearly that Member States are free to introduce rights that go beyond Community law as long as they respect the rules concerning insider trading.
Furthermore, following Parliament's request, we have now stated in Article 8 of the directive that all information concerning the offer should be made available to the representatives of the employees or to the employees of both the offeree company and the offeror.
The second question was addressed to the Commission by Lord Inglewood.
He asked whether any more measures may be proposed by the Commission.
Of course the Commission will review on a regular basis what is happening in this area, in particular how the market will react to this proposal if it is accepted, but the moment for reviewing the situation and revising the proposal is five years after its adoption.
If one takes into account the normal period for adoption that date will then be in 2011.
That is also a reason why the Commission is profoundly unhappy with the proposal as it now seems to be approved by Parliament, because the world is going to change a great deal between now and 2011 and, as I said earlier, this will only be reviewed in 2011.
That is a long way off.
The Commission agrees with Lord Inglewood in his assessment of this proposal.(1)
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0467/2003) by Mr Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards value added tax on services provided in the postal sector (COM(2003) 234 C5-0227/2003 2003/0091(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, in 1977, the Council adopted the Sixth VAT Directive.
It was a tremendous step towards the effective removal of restrictions on the movement of persons, goods, services and capital and the integration of national economies.
For the first time, the Community had a harmonised base of taxation and a harmonised list of exempted goods and services.
Among them, the Community legislator, in 1977, included those supplied by the public postal services.
This exemption dates from a time where in most Member States, the post office was a branch of the government with a monopoly on postal services.
At the time, the post office undoubtedly was a public postal service and the exemption of its services caused no distortion of competition because no competition was possible.
These facts no longer hold true.
In most Member States, the post office is no longer a branch of the government, but a commercial enterprise operating under commercial law.
In some cases its shares are sold on the stock markets.
Some Member States already apply VAT to post, or to some or all services provided by the universal service provider, recognising the problems caused by an outdated exemption.
Some of these companies are now expanding their operations to other Member States in order to reap the benefits of the internal market just like other third-country postal operators are doing.
Consumers now demand services that only companies with a presence in several European markets can provide.
But, under current rules, a company which supplies exempt postal services in Member State A is obliged to charge VAT in Member State B, because that country does not recognise it as a public postal service.
The postal market is now largely liberalised.
Although, as is often the case, post liberalisation advances at a different pace in each Member State, in all of them - in great measure due to the approval of Directive 97/67/EC, operators other than the former monopolies can and do operate.
Since several operators provide postal services and VAT legislation does not treat them equally, distortion of competition inevitably occurs.
A VAT exemption is not an unmixed blessing.
Notably, it results in an inability to deduct input VAT, which in turn discourages investment.
At a time where competition exists in the postal market and the communications revolution has created new channels that to some extent compete with post, lower rates of investment put public operators at risk.
As is often the case with European tax legislation, the VAT Directive has lagged behind all these changes and now requires urgent changes since it no longer reflects the needs or the factual situation in the Community.
Under Article 93 of the Treaty, provisions concerning VAT must be adopted to the extent that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market.
The Commission, in presenting its proposal, is fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty.
It has done so after extensive consultation with universal postal services and other postal operators, as well as representatives of postal consumers.
It has taken into account their opinions, in particular, those of private customers and charities by proposing that a reduced rate be applied to those services such as letterpost, small packages and direct mail which such customers need most.
The combined effect of the savings to postal operators resulting from the right of deduction which the proposal would open to them and the application of a reduced rate to a wide scope of postal services is intended to limit or even neutralise any increase in postal prices.
The Commission was the proponent of the universal service concept at the heart of Directive 97/67/EC and considers that every citizen in the Union has the right to a wide range of affordable and high-quality postal services.
Universal postal service providers will not be in a position to provide such a service if they are discouraged from investing and modernising and as a result can no longer compete with other operators in the parts of the market which are already open to competition.
In order to compete in such markets they need a Europe-wide presence and tools such as package tracing, which private and third-country operators already offer to European customers.
The current VAT exemption makes the required investment more expensive.
Universal postal operators in Europe recognise such challenges and accordingly most of them support the objectives of this proposal.
To conclude, I would invite Members to support the Commission's proposal.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising for failing to present a consistent report.
This report might be my last in this Parliament and, Commissioner, I am not proud of the result.
MrÂ President, the postal market is in the process of being liberalised at European level and also at national level.
As Commissioner Bolkestein has said, the current situation has led to an uneven playing field.
Public operators have a competitive advantage over those customers who are not able to claim back VAT, such as private individuals, charities and banks.
Private operators are more attractive to VAT-registered companies, although the overall price may be higher, as the customer can reclaim the VAT, which generally results in a lower net cost to the business.
A further disadvantage of the VAT exemption for public operators is that it favours self-supply.
It is therefore more cost-effective for the operator to carry out a service itself than to use subcontractors.
It is against this background that the Commission proposes that the exemption should be removed and that VAT should be charged at the standard rate for all items of mail over two kilos in weight.
At the same time, the Member States must be given the option of applying a reduced rate of VAT to items of addressed mail weighing less than two kilos.
I agree with the Commissionâs assessment.
As rapporteur, I also proposed only minor changes in the committee reading.
All my proposals were voted down by the committee.
In practice, the committeeâs proposal means that the European Parliament must reject the Commissionâs proposal in its entirety.
I think that this would be unfortunate and, together with my colleague MrsÂ Lulling and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have therefore tabled a series of compromise proposals.
Personally, I am not entirely delighted with all these amendments, but I can live with them.
I also hope that Commissioner Bolkestein is able to live with them.
The amendments are along the right lines and will mean the start of a more properly functioning market.
The big changes we are now proposing are aimed, for example, at removing the two-kilo limit for the reduced rate of VAT.
It also means clearer demands for a harmonised five to ten per cent VAT band.
Allow me, in the first place, to address those fellow MEPs of mine, in particular the British ones, who have been concerned about price rises.
As is well known, VAT can be applied and removed.
The Commission estimates that the price of a first-class letter in the UK would, for example, increase by 0.3 euro cents in the case of VAT being applied at a reduced rate of 5% and by five euro cents in the case of VAT being applied at the standard rate of 17.5 per cent.
It is worth noting that the UK mail regulator, Postcomm, has arrived at the same conclusion.
Talk of price rises is seriously exaggerated.
Certainly, postal services fulfil an important social function, but postage and related costs do, in spite of everything, represent only 0.1 to 0.2 per cent of the average household budget in the EU.
The postal operator in my own country, Sweden, has noted that the annual average cost per household for letters and Christmas cards is SEKÂ 190, or EURÂ 21.
In the case of the UK, figures for 1996-1997 indicate that the average annual spend for a UK household was Â£Â 29.40, or EURÂ 42.
On the assumption that this was all spent on sending standard letters costing 28 pence, the impact on the household would be that the annual cost would increase by Â£Â 1.05 to Â£Â 30.45 if the national operator were to increase the postage by one penny.
I think that this should be borne in mind during the vote tomorrow.
Another sensitive subject is the impact on charities.
Just like Commissioner Bolkestein, I think that this impact should be countered by the option of being able to claim back the VAT or by special tax rates.
Finally, all those of you in this House who believe in a better, efficient market without obstacles and injustices cannot reject this proposal.
I wish, in particular, to address MrsÂ Lulling and thank her.
I wish to thank MrÂ Radwan, MrÂ Brunetta and MrÂ Karas.
You have, in any case, helped to obtain some form of unity.
MrsÂ Randzio-Plath and MrÂ Goebbels, who have such good judgment on so many other issues, I am relying upon your judgment tomorrow too.
If nothing else, you could all listen to your own postal operators, or those that support the proposal.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has considered this dossier in very great depth, having been privileged to follow the development of postal services in the past, and having the hope of being able to do so in the future as well.
It was for this reason that we examined the possibility of introducing VAT in the liberalised working conditions for which we are all striving, and I hope that we will have completed this important task by the end of the decade.
Let me start by saying that the proposal that the Commission has put forward is a serious attempt at resolving this problem, but that, at the same time, it is true that good things can still be improved.
That was the approach that the Committee on Regional Policy took, and there are, essentially, three things that I would like to address.
The first is that, in principle, we wanted the minimum VAT rate of 5% to apply to postal services.
We are aware of the legal problem involved in certain Member States being required to introduce what would be their fourth rate of VAT.
We also take the view that this needs to be handled with particular care.
Secondly, consideration should be given to what upper weight limit would apply to a reduced rate of VAT.
The Commissioner was right to refer to the obligation to provide a universal service, but there is also the Universal Postal Union Convention, which also describes the consumersâ rights, and we therefore propose, taking the Convention as our guide, the provision of reduced rates of VAT on the sending through the post of items up to 10 kg.
Thirdly, we propose that the entry into force of the directive should be harmonised with the further liberalisation of postal services scheduled for 2006.
The Commission should, following a study of this issue, draft and submit proposals on the subject to Parliament and the Council of Ministers for their consideration.
I would be glad if these proposals by the Committee on Regional Policy could be taken on board.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Bolkestein was right to remind us that the Sixth Directive on Value Added Tax makes no provision for the payment of VAT on postal services.
This applies to the traditional providers of postal services, namely the former monopolies, whilst private postal service providers already have to add VAT to their bills.
Some time ago, in order to make the internal market a reality in the postal services sector, we made a start on the sectorâs progressive liberalisation, thus making it possible for private enterprise to operate in it to an ever-greater extent.
The new private firms have to charge VAT, whereas the former monopolies are exempted from it, and distortions of competition will, sooner or later, be the result.
For a start, the VAT is reflected in the price of the private firmsâ end product, but not in that of the traditional postal operators, who â and this is my second point â cannot deduct the VAT that they have to pay on purchases and investments.
I am given to understand, though, that the amount of VAT that would be deductible would be quite minimal, as almost 80% of the costs â in Luxembourg at any rate â are accounted for by wages, which are not subject to VAT in any case.
The rapporteur and I have joined in putting forward a solution, one that provides for a reduced rate of VAT on all postal services, although those Member States that already impose very much reduced rates to other products and services would also be able to apply these to postal services.
This is a balanced solution, taking into account to the greatest possible degree the interests of all parties; it should also not result in increased prices for stamps.
In addition, the Commission has proposed a new definition of postal services, which has left me rather surprised.
Ever since the 1997 Postal Directive, we have had a definition recognised by all participants in the market and used by them without problems.
Any new definition would only make for legal uncertainty, as the parties involved would then be left wondering whether the postal services provided in accordance with the 1997 directive were the same as those that have now had tax imposed on them.
In order that we may avoid such legal uncertainty and the confusion that it would entail, the rapporteur and I have proposed that, when defining postal services, the VAT Directive should simply refer to the definition in the 1997 directive.
A final and important amendment deals with the point in time at which VAT is to be imposed on postal services.
As we are dealing here, in essence, with a problem of potential distortion of competition, VAT should only be levied when such a problem actually becomes apparent.
As things stand at present, some national markets are more liberalised than others.
The amendment we are tabling provides for the introduction of VAT only when at least 50% of the national market has been liberalised.
It remains to me to thank the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation, and to appeal to those Members who, in the Committee, voted to reject the Commission proposal outright, to reconsider their position, for it would be inappropriate to reject it now.
I appeal to our Socialist Members in particular.
We have to take a constructive approach to this matter, for only then will we have a chance of our proposals getting a favourable reception from the Council and the Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, the postal services have been a state monopoly for 150 years.
In the current parliamentary term, the majority has endorsed international, service-oriented companies taking over parts of this work.
In the discussion on this subject, various drawbacks have been mentioned, including the fear that in future, an ever-higher price will be charged for an ever-worsening service.
Hardly any attention was then paid to the impact on taxation.
The complications are now evident.
Public companies do not pay any VAT, but if customers can claim back their VAT, sometimes a private company becomes the cheaper option.
As continuing to farm out postal transport to the rail services becomes too expensive, the companies' own use of environmentally-unfriendly lorry transport increases.
It is uncertain whether the Member States will declare their high VAT rates or their varying low VAT rates to be applicable.
Prices may well increase for the users in many cases.
It is useful for the rapporteur now to propose postponing the application until such time as the market has been further liberalised and for the draftsman of the opinion to express the wish to increase the weight limit to ten kilograms.
Not to privatise would be the best solution.
Not the market, but the employees and customers deserve protection, and this is ideally done without this measure.
Â Â  â Mr President, I must confess that I have found it hard to speak in this debate and I would, in fact, start by remarking that we must all bear in mind the words of MrsÂ Lulling.
Above all, however, we must consider the enormous effort made by CommissionerÂ Bolkestein in order to complete the internal market, which is absolutely crucial to European integration and also to Europeâs economic recovery.
I therefore believe that this Commission initiative basically makes sense, but unfortunately, the European Parliament should not give its support to it just yet, because such a move, in isolation, would add little to the real discussion, which concerns the crucial liberalisation of the postal services sector.
At this stage, given the current structure of the market, the Commission proposal could lead to various unwanted effects, the most perverse of which would surely be the widespread increase in the price of postal services for citizens, without this yielding any immediate benefit.
Not even the proposals for amendment and there is no guarantee that they will be adopted would prevent this.
It is indeed sometimes legitimate to sacrifice this benefit in the short term, especially in the case of public services, although this must only be done if this interest will be safeguarded in the medium and long term, with the clear benefits that this provides.
This does not, unfortunately, appear to be the case before us or at least it is not clear that the proposal accepts this fundamental principle.
The postal services sector has been exempt from VAT since 1977, a time when, it is true, the sector was dominated by State monopolies, which meant that competition was practically non-existent.
Despite the changes that have taken place since then, there is absolutely no basis for the idea that this area of public service provision now operates in an open market.
And yet, this is the only situation in which the State would be justified in exerting its exclusive power for political regulation without having to resort to tax or other types of incentives that guarantee social effectiveness.
If, therefore, we acknowledge that upholding the current status quo for a long time to come could harm the much-needed development of this sector, we must also accept that this proposal alone will not eliminate or reduce existing distortions of competition, especially given the diversity of VAT rates still being applied in the Union.
Rejecting this initiative can, therefore, only be seen as a recommendation to the Commission to include the proposal in the framework of a broader debate on the total liberalisation of the sector, ensuring that the services provided are completely effective, without overcharging citizens who use the service from the outset.
Â Â  The report deals only with those distortions of competition that are liable to be detrimental to the private enterprises that are taking over the postal sector; in no way does it reflect the interests either of users or of postal workers.
For over a century, the European states have established public postal services that worked in more or less acceptable fashion until criteria of public service began to give way to those of profitability.
The efficient running of public services, and of the postal services in particular, has for some considerable time been one of the most reliable indicators of a countryâs level of development, and, dare I say it, of its level of civilisation.
It was precisely because the postal services were to some degree sheltered from competition and from the pursuit of profit that they were able to perform their role; it was because they did not exist to be profit-making but to provide a service that they served the most secluded villages and criss-crossed the land with a dense network of post offices.
Such is the progress that both the nation-states and the European institutions are engaged in systematically demolishing.
We are absolutely opposed to this exercise in the destruction of public services, which is both regressive and socially unjust.
To this fundamental reason for voting against this report, we would add another, namely that we are indeed opposed to VAT and hence to it being applied, as also to the price increases that it will entail, and from which users on lower incomes will suffer most.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I must, all the same, ask MrÂ Bolkestein whether or not he supports the amendments that we tabled.
What is this all about?
Either we follow the socialists and all those that did not understand the interests of those they claim to protect and we purely and simply reject the Commission proposal, or we follow the route that I was proposing, but that I did not have enough speaking time to explain.
I was calling on all those who want to purely and simply reject the Commission proposal to think about it.
If they adopt the amendments, tabled by MrÂ Schmidt and myself on behalf of our groups, then we are giving the go ahead for a rational directive, which will not cause prices to rise.
Could MrÂ Bolkestein indicate whether or not he supports our amendments?
Â Â  . Mr President, it is with the greatest of pleasure that I shall reply to the question put by Mrs Lulling.
I could have done so earlier but she did not ask for it and therefore I did not think it was necessary to reply.
In answer to her question, the Commission considers that any study of the postal sector and particularly those which must be done according to Directive 97/67/EEC should take into account the impact of VAT in the sector and that it undertakes to take into account the spirit of Amendment No 6.
As regards Amendments Nos 7 and 13 proposing to delay the entry into force of the directive until each Member State has achieved a certain degree of liberalisation, the Commission's position is that it cannot accept linking two issues which are quite separate, but the Commission could accept a date of entry into force of the directive no later than January 2006, by which date the Community postal market as a whole should have surpassed that degree of liberalisation.
The Commission does not support amendments linking the scope of the proposed place of supply rule and reduced rates to Article 2(1) of Directive 97/67/EC.
Postal services as defined in that Article are those supplied by the universal service provider.
The linkage proposed by that amendment would not eliminate current distortions of competition in the postal market and therefore the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 1, 8, 11 and 12.
For reasons of subsidiarity the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 9 which seek to oblige Member States to apply a reduced rate and to prescribe how a certain part of national VAT revenue should be spent.
Nor can it accept widening the scope of applicable rates as suggested by Amendments Nos 3 and 10.
Such amendments would not be acceptable to a majority of the Council either.
As regards Amendment No 5, the Commission considers that the issues posed by philatelic stamps are no different to those existing today.
Under current legislation, stamps are only exempt when sold at face value.
They are taxable in all other cases.
Since this different tax liability is not causing problems today, it should not cause problems once the proposal is approved.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, at noon.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0461/2003) by Mr Manders, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (10933/5/2003 - C5-0445/2003 - 2002/0021 (COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, I apologise for being late, but we have been trying to reach an eleventh-hour compromise so as to obtain a qualified majority.
Mr President, Council, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, above all, thank you for the pleasant working relationship in this particularly complex and taxing matter, which is both legally complex and politically sensitive.
This cooperation has enabled us to vote in December after all, and I can see a possibility of reaching a compromise with the Council in this.
We have already consulted the Council, and I can see some scope, that is if Parliament dares take a qualified vote about a package I have distributed a moment ago, for I see that as being, after all, a minimum requirement in the large groups.
I also thank you for the option of postponing the vote to Wednesday in view of the translations not all having been received.
They have now been delivered, but at least I now have some extra time to reach those compromises.
And in the final analysis, this is very much to be welcomed.
The whole procedure has turned out to be very difficult.
Parliament had to vote on which committee should lead in handling this report, and that is, as far as I know, unique in the history of this Parliament.
This has exposed quite a few sensitivities, some of which are excessive.
I see the text we adopted at first reading as being a reasonably balanced one.
Unfortunately, the Council has once again toned it down considerably with very many instances of the word 'may'. In other words, Member States are 'allowed' to introduce something.
These should, I think, nearly all be replaced by 'shall'.
Indeed, I take the view that both the environment and the economy would benefit if we could create a level playing field instead of creating this patchwork of environmental legislation about Europe, which benefits neither the economy nor the environment.
This level playing field is of huge importance.
During the discussion of the previous report, I noticed that many Members could talk of nothing else but the fact that it was agreed in Lisbon that Europe should become the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy.
We should therefore have the nerve to take decisions that transcend our national interests, and transcend certain political items which we would like to realise.
For after all, it is the result that counts and not the fact that I can walk up to my electorate and say: âLook how brave I have been to propose this.
I may not have achieved anything, but I have proposed itâ.
I would regret it if we were unable to reach a qualified majority in some key areas at least, thus giving us some negotiating room in respect of the Council to remove some of those 'mays'.
Fortunately, the joint proposal does contain many texts that were included in Parliament's adopted text, albeit considerably watered-down by those 'mays', and, last week, I think, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted a number of pertinent texts, specifically on financial security with a built-in ceiling and the compulsory financial insurances that are possible over a certain period of time.
It is useful and necessary to be able to guarantee insurability.
With unlimited liability, not one insurance company will want to conclude policies, unless they introduce these themselves.
I fear that we then end up with a situation that is completely out of control, one I do not think will work, either for the economy or for the environment.
Consequently, we have once again endorsed state liability, the governmentsâ safety net function.
It is necessary for all Member States to be forced to monitor carefully the permits that are being issued and to check these as well.
We need this big stick.
In addition, an amendment has been rejected on a mitigation system, a system whereby the factors are weighed up.
Since an amendment with far-reaching defence measures, full exemptions and exceptions, has been adopted, this amendment has not made it unfortunately.
As it has been re-tabled, I hope that we can find a qualified majority for these three important points, and that we can also introduce it in Europe.
I think that the environment stands to benefit from this, as does our economy, because we will then have minimum harmonisation.
That is particularly beneficial for the environment, which does not have any boundaries.
Within the internal market that we want to optimise, there are no boundaries for our companies either, so as far as this is concerned, I think that minimum harmonisation is an excellent starting point that benefits both the environment and our economy.
If we fail to reach a qualified majority on these points, I think that, on the eve of the elections, this Parliament should hang its head in shame, because we have given the Council free rein to lay down the detail of something that is tremendously important, and I would regret that.
I hope that we will be spared this loss of face, and that we manage to find a qualified majority, particularly for the points that I have just mentioned.
I will pull out all the stops for this, and we have all day tomorrow as well.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Manders, for his work on environmental liability.
The process of getting the proposal this far has not been an easy one, as Mr Manders has already said.
It took a long time to develop the proposal and the subsequent discussions have demonstrated a great diversity of opinion in the Council and Parliament.
With the overall goals of the proposal in mind, the Commission has shown flexibility in helping a balanced compromise to be achieved within the Council.
This compromise enabled the overall goal of the proposal to be preserved.
The common position aims to establish a Community framework whereby environmental damage would be prevented or remedied through a system of environmental liability.
The main features of the liability regime itself have not been significantly altered except on one point, which is the very broad discretion that is now available to Member States when deciding to remedy or otherwise environmental damage for which no solvent polluter can be held liable.
The amendments under consideration by the Parliament concern several key issues, on which I should like to comment.
Firstly, it is proposed in Amendment No 6 that remedial measures in case of damage to habitats and species are only taken within designated Natura 2000 areas.
This means in effect that the scope of the future directive would be restricted to the Natura 2000 network.
The Commission cannot support an approach which would narrow the scope of the future directive even further than was agreed in the common position, which in itself was less comprehensive than the original Commission proposal.
Conversely, the Commission does not believe it either justifiable or workable to expand strict liability to all occupational activities in the EU.
It cannot therefore support Amendment No 45.
The scope of the directive is also touched upon in Amendments Nos 41, 42, 50 and 51 seeking to ensure that the directive should apply in future when environmental damage caused by an incident involving nuclear activities is not remedied on the basis of the relevant international conventions.
The directive would in a way 'complement' the international conventions.
Regarding the proposed 'complementarity' approach, the Commission does not believe it can work since it would oblige Member States having ratified those conventions to denounce them.
We believe, on the contrary, that the international liability regime for damage caused by nuclear activities should be preserved.
It is true that environmental damage will only be covered by this international regime once the new protocol to the Paris and Brussels Conventions, recently negotiated under the auspices of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, enters into force.
This protocol does not allow the EU to become a party to it.
It thus falls to Member States to ratify this protocol so that it becomes applicable.
I should also like to mention that the application of the relevant international conventions will be part of the review to be conducted by the Commission, as required by Article 18 of the draft directive.
With regard to State subsidiary action, Amendments Nos 11, 13, 47, 59 and 60 require Member States to take remedial action in certain cases.
The Commissionâs view, after 13 months of difficult negotiations with the Member States, was that the time and conditions were not ripe for such an approach.
It agreed consequently to amend its proposal.
The common position leaves a wide measure of discretion to the Member States in deciding whether or not remedial action ought to be taken.
This was a key point in achieving agreement among the Member States.
The Commission will therefore not support those amendments.
Concerning the so-called regulatory compliance and state-of-the-art or development risk issue, some amendments â Amendments Nos 9 and 16 â have been tabled that both seek to exclude from the scope of the directive damage caused by lawful events or which were scientifically unpredictable and to ensure that, under the same conditions, the operator will be entirely exonerated from any financial responsibility.
The Commission stated on the occasion of the first reading that it considered that better specification of the scope of the so-called 'permit defence' would be useful, to avoid any suggestion that this might be tantamount to a 'blank cheque' to pollute.
The Commission does not see that the alternative wording proposed by these two amendments would constitute a further improvement.
Amendments Nos 48 and 61, for their part, seek to ensure that the liable operator will be entitled to invoke regulatory compliance and the unpredictable character of damage as mitigating factors.
These amendments are acceptable in part and in principle insofar as their thrust goes closer to the current thinking on these issues, as it emerged from the debates that led to the adoption of the common position.
Amendments Nos 52, 53, 57 and 58 seek to exclude from the scope of the directive good agricultural and forestry practice, as defined in some agro-environmental regulation.
A total exclusion would be only warranted if the agro-environmental regulation ensured the same level of environmental protection as the liability directive.
This does not seem to be the case.
The Commission would rather see good agricultural and forestry practices as part of the circumstances which would lead to an attenuation of liability.
Amendment No 17 seeks to impose proportional liability in case of damage caused by several parties.
The Commission considers that Member States should retain the right to opt either for joint and several or proportional liability â or a mix of both â according to their national legal traditions.
With respect to biotechnology, Amendments Nos 43, 44, 54 and 55 require the Commission to present a proposal to supplement the regulatory framework on liability for economic damage caused by genetically modified organisms.
The issue of economic damage to conventional and organic farmers has been discussed and is still being discussed in the context of the so-called 'co-existence' debate.
Insofar as this type of damage represents damage which has traditionally been dealt with by national civil liability laws, it is by no means clear whether Community action is necessary and would show such an added value as being justified under the subsidiarity principle.
I believe that the outcome of that debate should not be prejudged here.
On the question of financial security, Amendments Nos 22 and 49 require the Commission to submit proposals for a harmonised compulsory financial guarantee, should no appropriate instruments or markets for insurance or other forms of financial security have developed on their own.
Everybody is convinced of the important role that financial security, including but not limited to insurance, can play in the implementation of the directive.
Member States and market operators, as well as the Commission, will have an important role to play in encouraging a timely emergence of financial assurance systems, products and markets to that effect.
Having said this, it is clear to me that Member States should have the possibility to develop financial assurance solutions at their own pace which are well adapted to their own needs and institutional conditions.
It would be particularly difficult to adopt rules mandating financial security when the economic operators most knowledgeable and economically interested in developing such products have been unable to do so.
The Commission is therefore not in a position to support the amendment on financial security.
It is certainly willing, however, to encourage initiatives whereby further impetus should be given to the market and all financial security providers to develop financial security products that would meet the new demand resulting from the adoption of the directive and the fact that operators will now be exposed to liability.
Finally, on the issue of the extent to which damage should be remedied, there is general agreement that the polluter-pays principle should imply for the liable operator, as for the polluter, payment of all damage caused to the environment.
In addition, there is a clear need to have a common understanding, within the Community, of the costs of environmental damage to be borne by the polluter.
Furthermore, the rules set out in the proposal specify the full range of remediation actions to be carried out by the operator liable.
Amendments Nos 31 to 36 narrow down the scope of damage remediation by suppressing the remediation of interim losses, together with suppressing the concept of compensatory remedial measures.
Deleting elements from this range of actions would inevitably result in the polluter not having to carry the full cost of the damage he has caused.
Having said all that, the Commission can support either fully, in part or in principle several of the amendments proposed.
Those amendments are: 4, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 23, 27, 40, 48, 61 and 63.
We all agree that we want ambitious and workable legislation.
The Commission sees the common position as a minimum in this respect.
Finding a balanced compromise will be difficult, but the Commission will do all it can to help achieve this.
Finally, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, once more.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing especial thanks to our rapporteur, MrÂ Manders, who has been right behind this directive in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and has endeavoured to unite the various views on the directiveâs scope into compromises that all the groups can support.
So, once again, my warm thanks to him for that.
Over 300Â 000 of the European Unionâs industrial sites are contaminated, and so it is vital and right that this directive should be adopted, thereby achieving a substantial advance in the protection of the environment.
Let me emphasise, on behalf of my group, that, although we support this directive, we argued strongly, as early as first reading, in favour of keeping a sense of proportion when dealing with this directive, for the best is sometimes the enemy of the good.
What is good, in our view, is the consensus arrived at in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
What is beyond doubt is that those who cause damage to the environment in the course of their business have to accept responsibility for it.
No attempt is made to interfere with the âpolluter paysâ principle.
If you can be shown to have caused damage, then you are liable for it.
With this directive, once enacted, we will be breaking new ground in effectively protecting the environment in Europe.
In none of the Member States so far has compensation been payable in respect of simple interference with flora and fauna.
This directive changes this, and that is what is new about it.
For the first time, compensation becomes payable in respect of damage to protected species and their habitats, too.
Whilst we stand by this, I have to again emphasise the need for us to keep a sense of proportion as we prepare to take this step, for there is as yet little reliable data that would make it possible to assess purely ecological damage and to calculate what should be paid for it.
Let me consider a few individual points that gave rise to controversy in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Firstly, what are the consequences if an enterprise, in doing its work, remains within the framework of the authorisation given to it?
The âpolluter paysâ principle applies; enterprises that damage the environment must accept liability for doing so.
I do think, though, that fairness requires that those who remain within the framework of the authorisation given to them should be able to have the confidence that the authorities will make allowance for this if damage is actually found to have been done.
The second point at issue is mandatory insurance against damage covered by the directive.
I do not think it right to bring in mandatory insurance for environmental damage until such time as reliable data become available.
Efforts must be made to obtain this data.
The directive helps to do that, in that, for the first time, it imposes a duty to compensate in respect of damage that is done to the environment alone, but businesses, and, in consequence, the insurance industry too, must have time to devise insurance schemes that are affordable and the premiums for which are capable of being calculated.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wants that time to be made available to them.
In practical terms, that means that our group opposes the introduction of mandatory insurance with immediate effect from the enactment of the directive.
The last point I would like to address has to do with farmers and foresters.
If the directive is not clarified appropriately, farmers and foresters will be particularly hard hit by its provisions.
Farmers live with nature and make their living from it.
It follows, then, that they should be excluded from the scope of the directive if they maintain best agricultural practice in the course of their activities.
To frame the directive in these terms is not to give farmers and foresters .
âBest practiceâ is a recognised concept in national and European law, one that the Commission has only recently defined, and it gives expression to an accepted standard.
Let me conclude by summing up our groupâs thinking.
We want the directive passed into law so that it can improve, in the long term, the protection of the environment in the European Union, but let us not make the mistake of being led by good intentions to attempt the second step before we have taken the first.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only for our own sake, but also for the sake of future generations, we need to have proper regard for the environment, for an undamaged environment is one of the most valuable of the goods that are entrusted to us.
It is for that reason that we have before us a directive that makes a priority of caring for the environment and preventing damage to it.
Achieving that objective requires that we be consistent in applying the âpolluter paysâ principle, which states that those who cause damage to the environment or bear responsibility for it, must pay for the damage to be dealt with, and that the burden of proof lies with them.
Only in this way can we put a stop to negligence and the evasion of responsibility at the expense of society as a whole.
The names of two ships, the and the , are synonymous with catastrophes that disproportionately burdened public funds and cost many people their jobs and livelihoods.
Even minor environmental disasters can bring a community to the brink of ruin, and, although we will never be able to completely exclude the possibility of them, unremitting liability for environmental damage will deter those who might be the cause of them.
My group takes the view that there is no room for exceptions to be made, and that is why we want this directive to fully cover sectors with grave consequences for the environment, such as the nuclear power industry or genetically modified organisms.
Amendments to this effect are before the House.
Let me conclude by adding something on the subject of mandatory insurance, which is meeting with such fierce resistance, particularly from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
In Germany, if you buy a house or own a flat, you have to take out insurance against fire and the forces of nature, even though, in cases of doubt, it is only you who will be out in the cold.
No doubt the situation is similar elsewhere.
It is, then, quite incomprehensible that the operators of environmentally hazardous plant or those who use dangerous substances should not have to insure against liability.
Must it always be the taxpayer, by way of the public purse, who is asked to pay up when things get really expensive?
And are we in this European Parliament really going to introduce less protection, less of the âpolluter paysâ principle, into this area, than the Council is willing to permit?
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, this time I cannot talk on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party because we have not adopted positions on a number of the most critical issues.
Just as MrsÂ Gebhardt said, we face an unusual situation.
There is a danger of Parliament impairing the Councilâs common position on environmental matters, a factor that also emerged from CommissionerÂ Bolkesteinâs contribution.
It might conceivably involve a deterioration in relation to the position in the majority of Member States.
That would be a scandal and must not happen.
To MrsÂ Niebler, I wish to say that a strict liability exists that is much more comprehensive on many issues than the situation that would result from this common position.
The proposal is not, therefore, particularly radical, either.
Allow me to take a practical example.
If the committee responsible had its way or if Amendment NoÂ 61 were adopted, we should be approving a situation in which it would scarcely be possible to require the Helsinki port authorities to repair the damage that is in the process of occurring there through TBT Poison being produced due to dredging and then spread in the watercourses in eastern Helsinki and in the surrounding archipelago.
That is because dredging takes place completely under licence, and the authorities had at no stage been able to foresee that this poison would exist in the dredging waste.
This case is now also being dealt with by the Committee on Petitions.
I wanted to mention this in order to show how unreasonable it would be to adopt the reservations, now chosen by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, relating to existing levels of knowledge and to exemptions from liability if permission has been given.
Financial arrangements must be acceptable in the compromise proposal we now have.
They cannot, however, be harmonised too far, because we have different, quite creative arrangements in different Member States.
Finally, I want to ask MEPs to remember that âstateâ is not synonymous with âauthorityâ.
This matter also affects the local authorities to a very great extent, and this fact must be taken account of in the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, the directive we are debating is very important; perhaps it is directive of the parliamentary term.
Because we are not just saying 'the polluter pays' and, consequently, whoever has to pay can pollute; we are saying that the polluter must pay the cost of restoring the damage which he has caused.
Consequently, the directive may respond to our citizens' huge hopes for public health and the environment and we must not water it down.
Various views were expressed during the debate.
We have proven that we can find compromise solutions such as, for example, the gradual introduction of compulsory insurance so that the cost of the damage is never passed on to the taxpayer and the polluter can cover the damage under his insurance, or the compromise whereby the Member States must undertake to restore the damage if the polluter cannot or if the person responsible cannot be found.
We have problems, however, to which it would appear that we cannot find compromise solutions: how can we talk of agricultural and forestry practices which somehow exonerate the use of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and weedkillers when we all know â from the Union's own statistics â the damage which they can cause to biodiversity, the ground and water?
How can we somehow issue blank licences to polluters, accepting the complete exemption of those who hold licences or respect the current state of the art?
We have to find ways here too and the relevant compromise proposals exist.
If, however, we do not do something in this direction, industry will never be persuaded to abandon polluting processes.
So things are still serious and I would say that we should also debate the other issues on which I heard the Commissioner being very negative.
We cannot have a directive that says nothing about genetically modified organisms and the damage which their free use may cause or which makes no reference to the damage caused by shipping or the use of nuclear energy.
Compromise amendments have been proposed which I find to be exceptionally moderate and realistic and I do not understand how citing international conventions, especially conventions which not all the Member States of the European Union have signed, can be the answer to this question.
So greater willingness needs to be demonstrated by both the Commission and by us, ladies and gentlemen, so that this legislation really is legislation of the parliamentary term.
I should also like to say something because certain members spoke of 'teratogenesis'.
Frankenstein, with his technology, produced a monster ever greater than himself.
Let us not therefore put ourselves in the ridiculous position of producing a baby monster which is far inferior to our powers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that we are all aware that this directive on environmental liability is potentially a key piece in the legislative arsenal aimed at making economic activities compatible with protecting the environment.
Its declared objective is indeed to implement the polluter pays principle by making the polluter bear the cost of repairing the damage caused to the environment, but also to act pre-emptively thanks to a financial liability mechanism, designed to encourage economic actors to minimise the risks.
The Commission proposal and, it must be said, the Council common position, leave us completely unsatisfied because they give us a text that, I am sorry to say, does not live up to the stated ambitions.
Indeed, we note that it offers economic actors several ways out, in particular through legal derogations from liability, by having an appropriate permit or by having state of the art technology.
Even these derogations are still considered inadequate by our fellow Members in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which adopted an amendment proposing a supplementary derogation for the agriculture and forestry sector: the respect of good professional practice in agriculture and forestry.
I know that we are now at second reading and I have learnt to be realistic after several years as a Member of this Parliament.
We have little room to manoeuvre.
We must achieve a qualified majority, and this is why I added my name, on behalf of my groupÂ âÂ and I will support further amendmentsÂ âÂ those which can be described as moderate in so far as they stipulate a very gradual entry into force of the restricting legislative measures without, for all that, invalidating the essential basic proposals
I will mention them in no particular order.
The first proposal is to remove the planned derogations but turn them into factors that limit liability.
This is wholly acceptable and I understand that the Commissioner is open to this suggestion.
We are, therefore, concerned here with mitigating factors, which are very different from derogations.
Secondly, in order that the directive is actually a preventive tool, it is a matter of setting up a mandatory system for financial liability, which will be phased in, that is to say, will be implemented gradually.
Thirdly, it is absolutely necessary that, for a certain amount of time, after an introductory phase, the scope of this directive is enlarged.
Fourthly, we are calling, and there are several of us doing so in this Parliament, for additional legislation concerning the liability of producers and users of genetically modified organisms in the event of contamination.
I recall that the Commission promised this when Directive NoÂ 2001/18 was adopted.
Fifthly and finally, the situation must be visibly improved as regards the risks from nuclear energy and of marine pollution by hydrocarbons.
MrsÂ Gebhardt, on behalf the Group of the Party of European Socialists, mentioned the and tragedies I will not remind you of this problem but we know that it led to considerable environmental damage.
I would, however, like to say a word about nuclear energy.
As regards nuclear energy, in particular, operatorsâ liability remains limited.
The fact that there are international conventions does not mean that the situation is satisfactory.
Is it necessary to remind you that, according to a study by a group of researchers at the University of London, a major accident in a nuclear power station would cost USDÂ 10 billion, and an accident similar to Chernobyl with extremely widespread contamination of the territory, USDÂ 40 billion?
These are factors that I ask my fellow Members to take into consideration when talking about nuclear power.
We cannot accept that such a dangerous activity is exempt from such important legislation on the liability of economic actors.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is unacceptable that a directive on environmental liability should not include pollution from the use of genetically modified plants (GMOs).
In Parliamentâs readings of directives on seed corn and the tracing and labelling of GMOs, it has been clear that there is a risk of unintentional pollution, even with the correct use of GMOs.
What is at issue is pollution due to the spreading of pollen and waste seed accumulated in the seed bank.
The experts argue about how much waste seed might be accumulated in the seed bank of the earth and for how long.
That being said, GMO pollution is not included in the proposal for a directive on environmental liability.
That is incredible, partly in the light of the fact that the âpolluter paysâ principle is established in the Treaties.
I am therefore able to support the proposals concerning GMOs by MrÂ Lannoye and others.
I think that the âpolluter paysâ principle should be more than just words.
It is time that the EU lived up to its ideals.
The EU should therefore require the Member States to impose a duty on GMO corn seed and feed â a duty used to fund control and supervision, as well as indemnification for damage that arises from correct use.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on environmental liability has led to extremely complex and, indeed, emotionally-charged debates in the competent committees.
I believe that the continuous search for a balance has made the directive now before us far too vague, but I nonetheless believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its rapporteur, in particular, have done sterling work in their quest to achieve a more or less acceptable compromise.
I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has adopted my amendment on development risks and the permit defence.
Both the development risks â which are, by definition, unknown and cannot possibly be discovered on the basis of scientific knowledge â and the permit defence will be included in the directive in the form of the entrepreneur's exemption of liability.
I would therefore urge the Commission to accept this amendment.
This is absolutely essential if we want to promote the innovation and creativity of European companies, particularly in view of the fact that their American rivals have enjoyed an arrangement of this kind for a long time.
I do, however, regret the fact that the text does not give greater emphasis to the principle that âthe polluter paysâ.
The current wording in the directive is very confusing and can, I believe, lead to legal uncertainty.
I regard this as a definite loophole in the legislative text.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my voice to the unanimous acclaim of this directive as important and fundamentalÂ âÂ maybe the most important directive achieved in the current legislature.
Therefore, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I would like to stress the great balance achieved by Mr Manders in tabling appropriate amendments on a matter in which it is easy to see that exaggeration and underestimation are equally unhelpful.
The directive is complex and theÂ âÂ positive or negativeÂ âÂ impact on the environment and the production system as a whole depends precisely on whether we strike the right balance.
A directive which went beyond what is sensible would be in danger, in practical terms, of imposing heavy, unbearable obligations and costs on companies, possibly even driving them to relocate to other countries where these rules are not in forceÂ -Â and they would be doing so reluctantlyÂ -Â so that they can compete on the international market.
I, too, would stress the fact that theÂ âÂ not trivial, but importantÂ âÂ âpolluter paysâ principle, by which those who cause damage have to repair the damaged goods, is essential in a society which seeks to guarantee sufficient quality of life in the future too.
It is also important to establish what is covered by the protection and, therefore, the ensuing liability: who is liable, for how long and to what extent.
I believe that the Councilâs common position is, in itself, a useful contribution in this sense, and we must support it.
Thus, the principle of âdiscernment and balanceâÂ âÂ which I am repeatedly stressing and which has been a constant theme running through our debateÂ âÂ has led us to identify protected sites, define responsibilities and provide for exclusion from liability for those who have observed legal authorisations and rules.
I will confine myself to adding to the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs, together with Mrs NieblerÂ âÂ the shadow rapporteur who really has done an excellent job, as was clear from her speech yesterday tooÂ âÂ an amendment which I feel to be particularly important, seeking to maker clearer the definition of operator, which, as the text is currently worded, does not make it possible to exclude banks and other financial institutions involved from liability for environmental damage caused by financial operators.
As I understand it, the Commission does not agree on this point, which I would like to see explored in greater depth, so as to give greater consideration to whether it is sensible to produce a definition which does not cover all possible eventualities and which might, in actual fact, lead to a claim for damages being made to a financial intermediary.
This would appear to be a valid request and I do, indeed, recommend that the House support the directive.
In conclusion, I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairsâ position has been linked to a common position; I hope that it will receive broad consensus in the Chamber in the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur. I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs because they have worked very hard and closely with the rapporteur in trying to come to a compromise on this directive.
I should like to pick up on a couple of points.
First of all, the 'polluter pays' principle has been mentioned a few times tonight.
We already have 'polluter-pays' legislation.
In the past the polluter has only paid a fine, but we have had a fundamental shift and now the polluter pays to clear up the damage that he or she has created.
That is a fundamental shift in legislation.
If we are to enact that then we have to look at the financial security systems behind it.
That is why I believe mandatory financial security is important.
It is a key point here.
I accept the point that Mrs Niebler and the Commissioner made that the market is not yet developed.
That is why, in a number of amendments, we ask the Commission to study the whole market and ensure that when we finally bring in a mandatory system at a later date, the whole area is covered.
I should like to add that we have also gauged the points of view of the Member States and given them responsibility for defining low-risk activities, i.e. taking them out.
That is a major step forwards for businesses of all shapes and sizes.
With regard to the Commissioner's point on Member State responsibility, I realise that he had difficulties over the last few months negotiating with the Council on this point and that it has not been easy.
However, we have to come to a situation where if somebody defaults, or an operator goes into insolvency and does not have this insurance, somebody has to clean up.
Who is it going to be?
It cannot fall on the local authorities; it has to fall on a Member State and we cannot allow Member States to just walk away from it and allow pollution to continue to grow.
Therefore the Member States have a responsibility.
Briefly, on the mitigating circumstances, I am glad to see that the Commissioner is accepting Amendments Nos 40 and 61.
I hope they go through.
And I am glad to see the mitigating circumstances taken into account, along with permit defences.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with what my friend and colleague, Mr Miller, was just saying.
At the moment it is a pious platitude to say that the polluter pays - polluters on the whole do not pay or pay only a small part of what they should pay.
It would be a great thing to move forward to a situation where it becomes a principle of law and not a pious platitude that polluters have to pay.
I was grateful for Commissioner Bolkestein's remarks about Amendments Nos 48 and 61.
It is important to take account of permits and state-of-the-art.
However, as the common position indicates, there are permits and permits.
The degree of detail and specificity of what is permitted varies from situation to situation.
In these circumstances, to have an all-or-nothing principle - either something is covered by a permit and, therefore, exempt from any liability, or it is not covered and fully liable - seems like a mistake.
It seems right to adopt a principle of mitigation so that there is a sliding scale taking account of the variability of permits and circumstances.
The Commissioner also talked about nuclear liability.
I happen to be the rapporteur for the still stalled report on the reform of the Paris Convention.
I take his point that this will expand the range and level of liability of nuclear operators, but it remains the case, unhappily, that nuclear power still travels in a boat of its own, subject to a rather special exception to the 'polluter-pays' principle - the polluter pays quite a lot, but not necessarily everything in that case.
My Group resents the special treatment of the nuclear industry.
We said that during the Euratom debate and there will, no doubt, be other occasions to say it.
We are also concerned about going too easy on the GMO cases.
That is another example where deliberate economic activity aimed quite laudably at profit and gain can cause exponentially spreading damage of a most alarming kind, and not to bring that within the scale of this directive would be to create an unjustifiable exemption.
There are other points I could make, but there are many speakers in this debate.
We are very strongly in favour of this directive and hope that it will leave this House in a really strong form.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we feel that the proposal for a directive that we are debating this evening with regard to the prevention and the remedying of environmental damage is very important because it develops a system of liabilities based on the polluter pays principle for a whole range of damage likely to have been caused by economic activities to the natural heritage.
This heritage is our shared asset and, in order to protect it, we must be extremely vigilant.
We must not turn a blind eye to the damage, which sometimes is in danger of going unnoticed because it does not directly affect private property.
This is why, at this second reading, we do not agree in particular with Amendment NoÂ 9 of the European Parliament, which excludes from the scope of the directive activities that have an administrative permit or those not considered to be dangerous according to the state of knowledge at the time when the damage occurred.
Those who take the risk must also assume it, and this is why we do not agree with Amendment NoÂ 39 either, which seeks to supplement Amendment NoÂ 9 to exempt GMOs in advance or to lessen the liability of those who work with them.
On the other hand, we support Amendment NoÂ 22, which, in contrast with earlier ones, moves towards better protection since it reintroduces the idea of a compulsory financial guarantee to be gradually implemented.
Indeed, as regards this point, we cannot be satisfied with the vague wording of the current text.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly, as other Members have done, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and the rapporteur for my group, Mrs Niebler, who has not just been able to reach agreements with Mr Manders, but also to seek consensus within the group and also to inform us punctually of what was happening with this proposed Directive.
As has rightly been said, we are dealing with a really important Directive.
We are all aware of the importance of environmental protection and the fact that this Directive reflects the âpolluter paysâ principle.
However, we must also be aware that polluters are often companies, and we must ensure their survival within our economy.
I therefore believe that there are two important principles: the first, which Mr Gargani has mentioned, is not to promote the relocation of our companies towards other markets, and the second is to find the greatest possible degree of harmonisation within the European Union.
I believe that all the countries of the Union must comply with this Directive, and it must oblige the Member States equally: we must not allow each Member State to apply it differently.
The scope must be as broad as possible, as laid down in the common position, and, with regard to the possible exceptions for operators with regard to compliance with any previous legislation, I believe it is true that Amendments Nos 9 and 16 are excessive, as has been said here, and would allow some companies to escape their duty to pay.
But it is true that we must seek some mechanism according to which the fact that companies comply with the legislation in force is considered a mitigating factor.
With regard to the reparation measures, we must allow the Member States to be able to cover the damage created, as reparation measures, as laid down in Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 12 approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Finally, with regard to the time period during which a company can be held responsible, I believe that the 30 years laid down in the common position is an excessive period.
The environmental contingency it would represent for companies seems to me to be excessive, and I support Mrs Thyssenâs amendment, which would reduce this time period to 10 years: it makes much more sense to reduce the time period during which companies must be held responsible for the environmental damage caused.
Â Â  Mr President, the Council has partially aligned with the position of the European Parliament on the question of the exemption of operators from environmental liability which, in the Commission's initial text, was so broad as to cancel out the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle to all intents and purposes. At the same time, however, in order to mitigate the onerous consequences for companies which are not to blame, Parliament accepted that the licence or failure to diagnose the harmful consequences of the activity at issue in time could operate as mitigating circumstances when charging the operator for the cost of restoring ecological damage.
This moderate position on the part of the European Parliament is now in danger of being cancelled at second reading, in that there are amendments which, if accepted, will result in complete exemption.
The licence and knowledge must be taken into account solely as mitigating circumstances.
Similarly, on the question of insurance, the cost must not be passed on to the taxpayer.
We insist on the need to lay down the implementation stages of the directive, at reasonable intervals, and to define the types of activities and damage covered in the text of the directive as of now.
To conclude, I should point out that the contradictory positions of the PPE-DE cancel out protection and it is worth questioning how it is that, while they are calling here for collective responsibility, they advocate personal responsibility everywhere else.
Â Â  â Mr President, environmental liability is a sensitive topic.
This is also evident from the battle between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The Council has struck a feeble compromise, which just may take effect after the review in a few yearsâ time. At the moment, it is feeble at any rate, and will not do much to help improve the situation of the environment.
Where biodiversity is concerned, we are lagging even behind the United States in terms of legislation.
It is very important to us, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to extend the scope of this directive.
It has been said before: firstly, nuclear energy, secondly, pollution by sea-going ships and thirdly, damage caused by GM crops.
Commissioner Bolkestein, you have the reputation of speaking in no uncertain terms and of not pulling your punches, but I have to say that your hiding behind the coexistence rule is, of course, nonsense.
What is at issue here is that the Commission is frightened of pressure from the United States, and it should simply admit this.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was in favour of extending the directive by these three supplements; the Liberal rapporteur, regrettably, was not.
Another important point is compulsory insurance.
That is essential.
Unfortunately, the Christian Democrats are opposed to this, and so is the Liberal rapporteur.
The crucial question is: who should foot the bill for environmental damage?
In its draft, the Commission wanted to pass the buck to the governments, and it is fortunate that these, in the common position, declined to do so.
The polluter pays, and so he should.
It is the businesses, not the governments, that cause pollution.
I have to get something off my chest. The rapporteur has made rather a hash of things.
He has taken only right-wing views into consideration, as illustrated by the amendments relating to good agricultural practice.
He is responsible for Parliamentâs lack of power, and industry will be grateful to him.
Â Â  Mr President, we in the British Conservative Group have a strong commitment to protecting our environment and this is an important directive which is capable of doing good both for the environment and for business.
However, like many pieces of legislation it could be many years before we see the full impact of it.
It is important, therefore, to take the longer view.
On the one hand, unfettered commercial activity, as we all know, can destroy the environment.
On the other hand, over-regulation closes down commercial life at a stroke.
It is precisely this commercial life which we all depend on, on which our culture and our society is based.
The second reading position is an excellent starting point and one which we support.
However, there are very important points which we need to bear in mind.
The first is the absolute necessity to allow the permit and state-of-the-art defences to remain.
It would be terrible to see companies in 20 years' time facing prosecutions for things which they did now, which are later judged to have been wrong.
I am very concerned also about the workability of the compulsory financial security, whether it is in the form of insurance, bonds or other forms of security.
We know perfectly well that the insurance industries are not yet able to offer schemes which would meet the needs of this Parliament or the Commission in bringing forward this legislation.
We also know that it would lead to a disproportionate burden on small businesses.
Do we wish to be responsible for making small businesses go under because we are putting this compulsory liability on them?
Indeed, mention has already been made of the taxpayer having to bear the burden, but if we made this compulsory, it would be Member State taxpayers who eventually would have to stand in place to guarantee this.
It is much better to leave this on one side for now and see how the directive begins to work and come back to this in the future.
Nor can we be certain that pollution will respect the boundaries of the EU, however large the EU becomes.
It is important, therefore, certainly with nuclear matters and pollution at sea, that we use those models to carry on with our international obligations and work with our other partners around the world.
Too often the best is the enemy of the good with legislation.
We need to be moderate in what we try to achieve today.
If we keep with what we are proposing in the common position, this piece of legislation can do some real good and should be welcomed and we welcome it today and we wish to see the directive in place.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am a convinced supporter of the European model of the environmentally-responsible market economy, which makes it clear that the liberalised market is not the irresponsible thing it is often suspected of being, but has social and environmental responsibilities and hence a responsibility to future generations.
It follows that there is no doubt that a responsible European economic and environmental policy must, together with the approval procedure, ensure that serious damage to the environment can be prevented, and that any damage caused can be made good, with the costs being borne primarily by the persons or bodies that caused the damage.
As yet, not all the Member States apply the polluter pays principle, and so European regulations are needed to prevent the incidence of distortions of competition in the market.
It is in relation to this that my colleague Mrs Flemming and I support the re-submission of two important amendments calling for nuclear damage to be included within the scope of the directive.
I ask to support Amendments Nos 41 and 42, since this directive is meant to cover activities that actually are dangerous.
I regard the decision by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to exclude nuclear power stations from the scope of the environmental liability directive as incomprehensible, as it cover all the alternative forms of energy; whoever is responsible for damage done to the environment by wind power, biomass, biogas and solar energy installations, must be held liable.
Why not in the case of damage done by nuclear power?
In Amendments Nos 41 and 42, then, we are asking for this to be included.
I also want to put the case for greater legal certainty, which is why we are in favour of the period of liability taking the form envisaged in Mrs Thyssenâs amendment, and of legal certainty being created by approved plant being excluded from liability.
The issue of how costs are to be shared between several different polluters must be clarified.
I am very grateful to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the sensible and moderate approach that it has taken.
This is a legal directive rather than an environmental one.
Above all else, I am grateful to our rapporteurs, Mr Manders and Mrs Niebler, for the work they have done.
Â Â  â Mr President, like Mr Karas, I am an adherent of an ecologically-adjusted market economy, and consequently, a strict liability regulation does not worry me.
After all, that can have a significant preventive effect and can, as such, be justified.
However, we should not, in my view, forget that in the proposal we are discussing this evening, we are introducing âliability without faultâ.
Some see it as self-evident that there can be liability without fault; personally, I think it is, compared to the traditional liability theory of the continental legal tradition, a very radical instrument, and it is precisely because it is so radical that we have to treat it with caution.
It is precisely because this instrument is so radical that we have to ensure that a number of pre-conditions are in place.
Those pre-conditions have to ensure that the regulation is legally certain, that it is practically workable, that it is fair and that it does not interfere too much with innovation and development.
I will not list the amendments that are useful in this respect.
Everyone who has followed the debate will know that I am talking about, , the exclusion grounds for licence holders, about the regulation in relation to the state of scientific knowledge, about the exclusion grounds for people who adhere to good agricultural practice and about the replacement of joint liability by proportionate liability.
The Manders report, as we have voted on it in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, provides for those pre-conditions, so I must congratulate the rapporteur and our groupâs shadow rapporteur on the work and on the team effort.
I should like to ask those of my fellow MEPs who have difficulty with the restrictions introduced in the report, and also the Commission in a way â for it, as I understand it, also has difficulty with a number of our amendments â to revisit the concept of liability without fault very carefully, to bear in mind the difficult, serious impact this can have, and to ensure that we will eventually end up with a better regulation which, for economic reasons and reasons of fairness, is showing some clemency.
We must naturally ensure that the earth remains viable, but I think that we must also ensure that we have a viable economy, and that we find people who are willing to go into business here.
Â Â  Mr President, an accident such as the Aznalcoyar accident â which took place in my country in 1998 â plus almost 300Â 000 sites identified as definitively or potentially polluted in the European Union they have been pointed out by Mrs Niebler are direct examples of the need for effective rules at European Union level to make the âpolluter paysâ principle a reality.
I understand and share the concern to make progress in environmental terms while at the same time maintaining the economic good health of companies, although I believe that is an argument which is used too often and which often does not respond to the reality of the effort companies can and must make in order to conform to this and other Community legislation.
I believe that the common position would have achieved, or has achieved in fact, a satisfactory balance between legal certainty, environmental protection and industrial development.
However, I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, despite having done good work, is tomorrow presenting certain amendments â such as No 9 and No 16 â which excessively weaken the common position and which I cannot support.
We cannot accept that the mere fact of complying with legal activities should be a licence to fail to comply or to be able to act irresponsibly.
If measures such as these are applied such as those proposed in these amendments accidents such as the Aznalcoyar accident would once again go entirely unpunished in whichever country they took place.
I would, however, like to point out that I support Amendment No 46, since I believe that, otherwise, we would further weaken the system of environmental responsibility in certain types of maritime transport, which I believe to be important.
With regard to the issue of financial guarantees, I believe that it improves the Commissionâs proposal â which did not provide for them â but that it has not been either as ambitious as initially hoped or as concrete as it could have been.
I understand the need to give companies a period for adaptation and I hope, of course, that they will do so as soon as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market outlined in the recommendation tabled by Mr MandersÂ -Â whom I thank for the enormous amount of work he has doneÂ -Â takes the right line.
Indeed, it does not make any substantial changes to the Councilâs approach but clarifies a number of its fundamental principles so that the directive can be implemented in a more uniform manner over Union territory.
Given the impact that the regulation will have on industrial activity, we deem it necessary to remove the asymmetry between the legislation of the countries of the Union so as to avoid distortions to trade or to competition between companies.
However, a number of principles must be clearly stressed: we need to avoid the concept of âoperatorâ being extended to parties responsible for monitoring activities.
The identification of merely potential damage is contrary to the principles of legal certainty and could therefore lead to lengthy disputes which cannot be addressed with the technical and scientific instruments available.
The operators responsible for the damage must have the option of taking the necessary measures themselves and informing the competent authorities in due time.
Intervention on the part of the authority, where either preventive or remedial measures are concerned, should be limited to cases in which the operator is not prepared to act or is unable to do so, in that it is not acceptable for the authority itself to be given the power to take the unquestionable decision of adopting such measures itself.
Clearly, therefore, such intervention only becomes necessary in the case of what are known as âorphanâ or âpublicâ sites, or in the event that the operator fails to act.
These provisions must be laid down so that decisions are not left too much to the discretion of the Member States.
The text of the common position states that the individual Member States may, at their discretion, grant exemptions for exceptions where damages are caused by an emission or activity or event allowed in applicable laws and regulations or in an authorisation issued to the operator or which was not considered to be harmful according to the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when the emission was released or the activity took place.
As regards the apportioning of the burden of costs where the damage has been caused by more than one party, the Council has given each Member State the right to provide for both joint and several, and proportional liability, according to the national legislation in force.
The apportioning of joint and several financial liability, in addition to being in blatant conflict with the âpolluter paysâ principle, would certainly make it more difficult, if not impossible, for operators in production sectors to calculate insurance premiums and other financial security.
Liability and related costs must, therefore, only be apportioned on fair, reasonable bases, with the requirement, moreover, that each operator performs a part of the remedial operation which corresponds to that operatorâs share of the liability.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall be brief because no questions have been addressed to the Commission and therefore I can confine myself to making the following remarks.
The common position which was sent to Parliament for second reading is clearly a compromise.
The main issue at this stage is whether it is possible to improve it without opening a Pandora's box and possibly jeopardising what has been achieved so far.
I am well aware that this proposal is complex and sensitive.
Difficult choices have to be made among competing interests.
We believe that the common position preserves a generally satisfactory balance and it is with the aim of seeking further improvements, whilst maintaining this balance, that the Commission will consider the amendments adopted by Parliament.
In conclusion, I should like once again to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and may I also thank you, Mr President, for giving me the floor a second time in this debate.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0418/2003) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 74/408/EEC relating to motor vehicles with regards to the seats, their anchorages and head restraints [COM(2003) 361 C5-0283/2003 2003/0128(COD)].
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Commission would like to thank MrÂ Koch for his excellent report.
This proposal to amend the Council Directive of 22Â July 1974 relating to seats and head restraints of motor vehicles is one of the two proposals associated with the 1997 directive on installing safety belts.
This latter directive is, moreover, the subject of a change that seeks to make the installation of safety belts obligatory in all vehicles.
These provisions follow the enforcement of compulsory use of safety belts in vehicles, provided for in the directive of 8Â April 2003.
At the moment, only car seats must comply with the technical criteria and satisfy the resistance tests provided for in the directive of 1974.
From then on all seats, and in particular those in coaches, that are in vehicles put into service in the Community from July 2004 should be tested in accordance with the directive.
They must be compatible with the installation of safety belts.
The Commission proposal also includes a ban on installing side-facing seats in any vehicles designed for transport of persons, with the exception of city buses with more than 22 seats.
The Commission cannot support the rapporteurâs proposal to allow, despite everything, the installation of side-facing seats in coaches.
I must remind you that when the directive of 20Â November 2001 was drawn up as regards safety of buses and coaches, this issue had already been the subject of a debate.
The Commission was then called upon to carry out a study on the safety of passengers travelling in side-facing seats.
This study showed that there were no technical solutions adapted to this layout of seats and it recommended a ban on side-facing seats in all vehicles for the transport of people.
Another study, conducted by the Commission in 1996, had already showed all the risks incurred by passengers wearing a safety belt not adapted for this arrangement of seats.
The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the White Paper on European transport policy, we set ourselves ambitious goals, especially as regards the improvement of road safety.
Far from requiring us to approach this in a spirit of unthinking activism, these goals oblige us to take sensible courses of action in various sectors in order to have an effect.
The measures in question certainly do not always involve high investment costs; one good example is the introduction by law of the mandatory wearing of seatbelts in all seats of a motor vehicle fitted with them.
This strikes me as sensible, effective and much to be welcomed.
Since we already have the requirement to wear a seat belt, it makes sense also for the law to require them to be fitted with few exceptions and this is something to be advocated.
I am grateful to the Commission for doing this.
Even in buses, which are in any case among the safest means of transport in the European Union, safety belts will, in the event of an accident, help to reduce injuries and save human lives.
With this in mind, the Commission is now proposing that side-facing seats, for which there are as yet no effective restraint systems, should be permitted only in buses used in urban and interurban regular traffic, there being, in the Commissionâs view, no particular danger to the persons using such seats.
This covers seats in thousands of buses, used to transport millions of adults and schoolchildren every day.
The fact is that there are no analyses of accidents to which we can refer.
On the contrary, it strikes me as utterly illogical that the Commission, in its proposal for a directive, seeks simply to ban side-facing seats of this kind only from comfortable coaches, in which only a few of these are to be found, as individual seats forming part of comfortable groups of seats of a type with which few of us will be familiar.
These the Commission does see as potentially hazardous for users, but it makes no attempt to motivate or oblige industry to develop restraint systems suited to such seats.
Having no prejudices in this matter, I initially asked myself whether this was an example of carelessness or of an oversight.
The answer, though, was provided by the discussion in the Committee, in the aftermath of which two â admittedly populist â questions forced themselves into my mind: firstly, is the Commission prepared to expose people in the âcheapâ side-facing seats in buses in urban and interurban traffic â which it wants to permit â to a greater safety risk than the people who use similar seats in luxury coaches, or, secondly and contrariwise, is its call for a ban on cosy corner seats in luxury coaches founded on envy and ill-will towards those who can afford to travel on what are regarded as luxury vehicles.
I think we can be clear in our own consciences when declining to answer both questions in the affirmative.
I therefore propose that the tourist industry be allowed the cosy corner seats in its luxury buses, which we made possible only a few years ago by enacting the directive on the use of 15-metre buses. We should, however, call upon the industry to develop appropriate restraint systems for side-facing seats of this kind as well.
We must aim to provide an equal degree of protection for people wherever they are seated in a vehicle, that is, whether in side-facing seats or in those facing the direction of travel.
European policy should be not so much to prohibit as to promote and to support.
That would enhance us as an economic base in terms of the Lisbon targets, whereas the prevention of development would not.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for what is truly an excellent report, closing this big loophole in seatbelt legislation.
I would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the PSE Group, in particular to thank Commissioner Liikanen for bringing forward this proposal.
There is no difference between us on the core of the proposal, but merely on this issue of side-facing seats.
In the short time available I wish to focus on that issue alone.
That does not mean to say that I do not applaud the rapporteur for his efforts on the bulk of the proposal.
However, the issue is an important one.
If we prohibit seats without seatbelts that face forward, why then - if the rapporteur has his way - are we not doing the same thing for side-facing seats?
Far be it from me to defend the Commissioner - I am sure he will respond to these points.
However, we cannot support the committee amendments.
There is no sound logical reason why side-facing seats are safe.
Surely the laws of gravity apply to people facing sideways, just as they do to people facing forwards.
Indeed all the research from the Commission suggests that these seats are simply not safe and that no safe technology exists to secure the occupants of side-facing seats.
To use the comparison of city buses is just not credible.
City buses, in the main, travel at low speeds in towns and cities.
We are talking about coaches, perhaps travelling at 90 kilometres per hour on motorways.
The big question for our Group, for me - and, I am sure, the big question for Parliament, when we vote - is how we can demand that our citizens wear seatbelts if we send confusing signals.
If the bulk of people have to wear a seatbelt in a coach but those at the back, in a so-called cosy corner, do not have to wear one, it simply does not make sense.
Let us not forget that one of the principal causes of death and serious injury on the roads in the European Union is still, sadly, people not wearing a seatbelt.
Parliament has to send out a very clear, simple message when we vote tomorrow, and say that people travelling in one of these vehicles must wear a seatbelt.
Given that there is no technology for side-facing seats, then we must say to industry that these particular seats must be phased out.
To be pragmatic and practical, if industry can come up with a safety-belt for side-facing seats then the PSE Group will of course, think again, as, I am sure, will the Commissioner.
There is not much dividing us.
But it is important that we send out a clear, simple message tomorrow that if you travel in these vehicles in the future, you must wear a seatbelt and that there will be no derogations, no room for doubt.
It must be clear and simple.
I am sure that is what we will say tomorrow.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.

Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- The European Council report and Commission statement European Council (Brussels, 12 and 13 December 2003);
- Council and Commission statements Meeting of Heads of State or Government on the IGC (Brussels, 12 and 13 December 2003);
- Statement by the President-in-Office of the Council The work of the Italian presidency.
I should like at the outset to profit from this moment to share with you a brief report of the summit meeting and the IGC from the perspective of those questions which I raised on behalf of this House so that before we go into our debate proper you will have been informed of what we had to say.
I am bound to say that, as regards the work that was done at the European Council meeting, a very high volume of business was transacted in a short period of time and considerable progress made in quite a number of areas.
Indeed it is worth placing on the record that we in this House enjoyed in those terms a very positive engagement with the Italian presidency in working across our committees on many different areas.
In particular and following the recent resolutions of the House I welcomed the conclusions on EU-transatlantic relations, but I made the point that it is precisely in a phase of deepening transatlantic relations, which is the objective of the conclusions, that our candid friendship with the United States should not exclude our candid concerns about Guantanamo Bay.
I spoke on behalf of the House in those terms.
With regard to the Kyoto Protocol, I recalled that as we were meeting there was a UN-sponsored meeting in Milan.
It seems that Russia still has an open mind on whether to sign the Kyoto Protocol.
We Europeans have a strong interest that the Russians should do so and therefore make it effective.
I believe the Commission and the incoming presidency should take clear initiatives to ensure that in the months to come we who believe in Kyoto should seek to bring it to a satisfactory definition by deepening our contact with Russia, and I made that point also this weekend.
As regards the Intergovernmental Conference we will have a debate today on the wider questions and I look forward to being guided by that debate and our resolution.
When I spoke at the Intergovernmental Conference, I raised two specific concerns of a parliamentary nature.
The first concern was on the financing of the European Union and its budget procedure.
I pointed out in the clearest terms that the European Parliament supports the balanced outcome of the Convention as regards the different institutions and their roles in budget-making.
I explained what that Convention procedure was and what its balances amounted to.
I explained that the European Parliament wholly rejects the interference by Ecofin as an undue, unwarranted and unacceptable interference in the budget process.
I explained that not only was Ecofin an attack on the conclusions of the Convention, but even on the budgetary treaty of 1975, and that in institutional terms it in fact represented a step backwards.
I pointed out that through that period Parliament has exercised considerable restraint on spending.
The House will be interested to know, because it is the product of our collective work, that we have 15 years of budget-making experience since we signed an interinstitutional agreement with the Council on financial perspectives in 1988.
In that period, by discretionary additions in the aggregate, the Council added EUR 33 billion of discretionary expenditure. Parliament, under its discretion, added EUR 21 million.
If there is a relative tendency to stretch the budget, it is found more in the Council than Parliament, and Parliament should not be the object of the presumption that if it gets responsibility it fails to act responsibly.
The final point I made for Parliament regarding the Intergovernmental Conference and Parliament was to invite the IGC to ensure that Parliament should not be used as some kind of last-minute bargaining chip, where the numbers of Members in this House would increase regardless of our ability to be effective.
We are not some kind of globalised rubber-stamp congress of the peoples of Europe; we have serious budgetary and legislative functions.
There must be an upper limit on our size, and we must respect the principles enshrined in the work of the Convention to cope with who gets how many seats.
These were the points I made on behalf of this House to the IGC.
Finally, with regard to the outcome of last weekend, there is no doubt that the failure to agree in the IGC represents a setback.
However, that setback is not necessarily a calamity.
If agreement was not possible last weekend, it does not make agreement less necessary.
It shows the immensity of the challenge we have undertaken together.
Last weekend, although the key players arrived, a collective spirit and a will to settle were absent.
That absence is something for which we paid a price, and that absence of a spirit of compromise on the part of all key players needs to be explored.
Together with the leaders of the Groups, I would like to carry from this House a clear set of messages from today's debate to the incoming Irish presidency.
I look forward to this debate and to what messages you, as the European Parliament, believe we should give to the incoming presidency regarding the next phase of play.
I should like to welcome this morning the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, and to say to him and his colleagues, Mr Frattini, Mr Antonione and MrÂ Buttiglione, how welcome they are.
I should like to say again in Mr Berlusconi's presence that in the course of the ordinary work of the presidency, work with our committees, legislative work and contact with Parliament, we have enjoyed very good, positive relations with the Italian presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today to illustrate the work of the Italian Government, which has presided over both the Union Council and the Intergovernmental Conference in this six-month term of office, which is about to come to an end.
With regard to the Conference, Italy has been committed from the very beginning to achieving consensus on a high-profile document, without any watered-down compromises; a document that would allow the Union of the future to function and to stand as a leader on the world stage.
Added to this commitment was the hope that the enlarged Union would be able to establish a genuine Constitution on the basis of the draft drawn up by the Convention, within the timeframes agreed at Thessaloniki and thus in time for the European Parliament elections next June.
As we know, the hope we all shared that the constitutional negotiations would be concluded within the 60 days we had available from the opening of the Conference in Rome has not been fulfilled.
This fact must be accepted calmly, without drama or exchanges of recriminations but, at the same time, with a clear vision of how we are to proceed now.
Our commitment to keep clear of compromises and agreements, which are difficult for our citizens to understand, has been fully respected.
This was an obligation on which our Presidency focused from the very beginning of this complex negotiation process, for we felt that the contributions of the national parliaments and the Unionâs institutions, first and foremostÂ âÂ as you said, Mr PresidentÂ -Â your own, and the work of the Chairman, Mr Giscard dâEstaing, and the Vice-Chairmen, Mr Amato and Mr Dehaene, combine them into a document, which should form the basis on which to build a unanimous agreement, without further delays on the key points of the draft approved last July.
At the formal opening of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Presidencyâs intention was to reaffirm these concepts by means of the Declaration of Rome adopted by the Heads of State or Government of Member States, of acceding countries and candidates to the European Union, President Cox and President Prodi.
We have remained faithful to this approach throughout the negotiations, reconciling the desire to preserve the Conventionâs draft to the greatest extent possible with the obligation to give due consideration to the legitimate needs of all the Member States with regard to their priority issues.
Our working method has been visible and transparent. We have fully involved the European Parliament representatives in the work of the IGC, going beyond what was done in previous Intergovernmental Conferences, and we have ensured that all the documents presented during the negotiations were made fully public and available for consultation.
Thanks to this impressive, patient, meticulous workÂ âÂ for which I would like publicly to thank all those involved, in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs, MrÂ Frattini, who is sitting here on my right we have been able to resolve almost all the questions raised by the IGC participants without much diminishing the overall level of ambition of the Conventionâs draft.
During the initial exchanges of the Conference, we reviewed over 80 controversial issues on which the different States were in disagreement, and for each one of them, with the exception of a purely institutional point, adequately mediated solutions were found.
I would add that, on some aspects in particular that absolutely crucial aspect of defence the IGC has supplemented and improved on the Conventionâs draft, succeeding in defining permanent structured cooperation that is fully compatible with the Atlantic framework and respectful of the political needs of certain Member States.
This fundamental step forward will be made in accordance with the decision-making procedures of the Union using an inclusive approach that will allow some countries to proceed more rapidly on the basis of a specific protocol governing the military capabilities required for participation in this permanent structured cooperation.
In practice, to start with, this point seemed very problematic.
We succeeded in reaching agreement, fully in harmony with Nato summits, and, as you know, the three pillars on which the Spring Council can take action and decisions have been taken on board by all.
The first pillarÂ âÂ the regulation establishing structured cooperation and making it operationalÂ âÂ will have to be approved by the European Council; the second pillar will make it possible for each Member State to become part of cooperation at any time; the third pillar stipulates that European defenceÂ âÂ necessary to give Europe independent power and dignity, enabling it to sit down at all tables with the other world military powersÂ âÂ must not be seen as in opposition to Nato but must, on the contrary, work hand in hand with Nato, the means having been found to establish a European military planning and command cell in the Nato operational base in Europe.
The final IGC session has thus had to concentrate its efforts on the major institutional issues which, because of their particularly high political sensitivity, it had not been possible to resolve in the previous phases of the negotiations.
Thus, the final meeting had to decide on the composition of the European Parliament and the Commission, there were still some points to be clarified regarding the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council, and, most importantly, the method of calculating that vote remained to be defined.
In the course of the most recent bilateral meetings that the Presidency conducted at a spanking pace through the days and nights of Thursday, Friday and Saturday, a solution to some of these issues appeared possible, although all the Heads of State or Government assembled felt the need to point out that the institutional framework of the future Union should ultimately be evaluated in its entirety by means of a general, all-encompassing agreement.
Agreement on the composition of the Commission and on the matter of the qualified majority was within armâs reach.
As regards the number of Members of Parliament, Mr President, there was practically no debate: the countries with smaller populations asked for one more Member, taking the number from four to five, and all the other countries assented.
On the other hand, it was not possible to bring positions sufficiently close on the point qualified majority voting despite all our efforts, and, therefore, after consulting all the delegations, we decided to put an end to a debate that was in danger of causing conflict and that, at best, might have resulted in a watered-down compromise of the kind we had excluded from the very beginning.
True failure would have been precisely a watered-down agreement incapable of ensuring the proper functioning of the Union in the future and its ability to act as a decisive political entity on the world stage.
As the meetings concluded, all my colleagues expressed great appreciation of the work of the Italian Presidency which, of course, gave my team and myself great pleasure but, most importantly, I can tell you that I perceived the firm desire not to waste the heritage that we have built up in the negotiations of these past months.
Indeed, we counted 82 points on which agreement has been reachedÂ âÂ 82 points which, before that, were under discussion and many of which even seemed impossible to resolve.
Thus, an of negotiations remains from the Conference which all felt to be important and, I would add, not to be reopened.
For this reason, all the speeches made at the Council table recommended that the Conferenceâs next task should be to focus on the points, or rather the point, on which agreement has not yet been reached.
We should not reopen the chapters of the major work carried out on the other points, in which all the delegations of the Member States were involved.
It will therefore be possible to resume the constituent process completing the great project launched by the Convention, on the basis of the Conferenceâs precious of negotiations, which covers almost all the previously controversial points.
I have to tell you that we were genuinely close to concluding the agreement.
Late on Friday night, agreement seemed possible, for some of the countries who had initially appeared to have taken up certain specific defensive positions became much more open, but then, the following morning, a step backwards was taken and, by mutual agreement with all the delegation heads, we decided that everyone needed more time.
Some even asked to be able to consult their national parliaments.
Thus, rather than starting a debate which would have given the failure to achieve an agreement a higher profile, we decided to close while everyone was feeling positive.
All expressed the willingness to resume the debate, to preserve the on which all had agreed and to proceed with the goal of giving Europe a Constitution which would make it able to function properly, to take timely decisions and to act on the world stage as a political giant, not just an economic giant.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to illustrate the most important results of the European Council that has concluded the Italian Presidencyâs six-month term of office.
I do so with particular satisfaction, not only because we addressed important matters, but also because the decisions we have adopted are the result of intense work carried out with all the countries sharing responsibility.
The tangible results affect the direct interests of the European citizens and reinforce the Unionâs overall image.
These results have been made possible by an excellent relationship of cooperation with the CommissionÂ -Â which I would like to thankÂ -Â and worked on in a spirit of open, constructive dialogue with Parliament, to which I would like to express my appreciation once again.
I would like to begin precisely with the economic issues that we addressed in order to boost development, to boost employment, to increase the competitiveness of European industry and to complete all elements of the internal market.
Firstly, the December European Council formally approved what we have called the âEuropean Initiative for Growthâ, a measure proposed by the Italian Presidency which was developed by Ecofin and the Commission with a contribution from the EIB.
This is an initiative with which you are familiar, seeking to promote a substantial programme of investment in the sector of major trans-European infrastructure that includes transport, trans-European energy networks and the telecommunications sector, as well as investment in human capital, in other words in research and development, innovation and technology.
We set ourselves a two-fold objective: to create, by means of these projects, the conditions for improving the quality of material and immaterial infrastructure networks dedicated to linking up the great European market, especially with a view to enlargement, but also help to boost economic growth overall, and therefore employment, with adequate financial support.
We are hoping to use both public fundingÂ -Â from the Union budget and, in part, from the individual Member StatesÂ -Â and private sector financing, thanks, not least, to the decisive role of guarantor played by the European Investment Bank.
I would like, in this regard, to stress that this is the first major economic policy manoeuvre at European level decided on in a framework which fully complements the Lisbon Strategy and is also fully compatible with the Stability Pact.
There is no point in hiding the fact that, as individual States, now that the single currency has been adopted, we have no means of implementing monetary policy or economic policy; we cannot devalue our currency in order to support our products and exports; we cannot use deficit spending policies, even medium-term policies, to observe the Maastricht criteria.
This right, this power, which the individual States no longer have, must, therefore, be replaced with a higher power.
Unfortunately, our European Bank, the European Central Bank, has the task of controlling price increases, of controlling inflation, that is; it does not have the task of supporting the economy, unlike, for example, its counterpart in the United States of America, the Federal Reserve.
Therefore, Europe must muster the will and give itself the ability to take steps to support its economy.
With regard to a different, more specific matter, although still in connection with strengthening the internal market and boosting growth, we then reached agreement on the adaptation of the trans-European transport networks TENs to the new context of an enlarged Europe.
In this same framework, the European Council has ratified the agreement on the decision to double the contribution from the Union budget increasing it from 10%, as provided for up till now, to 20% for interventions on cross-border sections.
This is a highly significant result in terms of the capacity to mobilise private funding for large-scale infrastructure projects.
The European Council has stressed the importance, in terms of the free movement of goods, of overcoming the difficulties posed by mountain passes and natural barriers, and by traffic congestion along the main communication routes.
We hope that, on this basis, it will be possible in the near future for the Commission to evaluate and quantify the negative impact of mountain passes and natural barriers on the proper functioning of the single market.
I would say that, as regards trans-European networks, extremely important work has been carried out, in that we are completely without roads and communications, both rail and road, to provide links with the countries which are to become the new Members of the Union as of 1 May.
It was absolutely essential to update the plan of trans-European networks, which was laid down some years ago, and this has been done.
There is something else I would add: we have produced a list, known as the quick start list, which provides for a series of projects.
I would, however, like to make it clear that this is not a closed list: quite the opposite, it is an open list to which all the projects which are ready for implementation can be added, projects which are ready for presentation to give the go-ahead for contracts and for the necessary funding to be sought.
Among the matters on the Lisbon agenda, we have focused, in particular, on the issue of employment and competitiveness in order to underline once again the need to pursue structural reforms.
These reforms have already been launched by a number of Member States, and are measures that, at times, impose short-term sacrifices and costs on society but which constitute the necessary conditions for ensuring reinvigoration of the economy.
I am talking about labour market and pension reforms.
With regard to employment, we have assessed and evaluated the report by Mr Wim Kokâs Task Force and its recommendations.
I have to say, Mr President, that Mr Kok has done a truly outstanding job and his work is the fruit of his experience as both a trade union leader and a head of government.
We all owe him thanks, for not only has he identified solutions to general problems but his Task Force has gone into the situations in the individual countries and has recommended for each individual country the measures that it feels need to be taken.
I can say that, where my own country is concerned, the Task Forceâs analysis is absolutely spot-on.
It is to this report that the extraordinary Social Summit was dedicated, which I chaired on the eve of the European Council, a summit of trade associations and trade unions. This summit revealed the shared desire of the social partners to proceed with the implementation of the European Employment Strategy within a framework of greater flexibility and commitment to the greater enhancement of human capital.
With regard to competitiveness, the European Council has noted the progress made over these six months in line or almost in line with the expectations of European enterprises and economic operators.
I must make something clear regarding this point: I was able to participate in a conference held by UNICE last month in Brussels.
The symbol of the conference was a giant created by Jonathan Swift, the giant Gulliver, held prisoner by the Lilliputians.
The image was intended to convey to the political representatives of the individual States and Europe that the European economy is a giant held in the grip of too many traps and snaresÂ âÂ as industrialists call the excessive amount of regulations, directives and laws which prevent them competing fully with external economies.
We must give this fact all due consideration, for the European economy is going through a difficult time, which I fear will become even more difficult given that the economy is gripped in a vice consisting, on the one hand, of the United States economy, which is expanding rapidly with the support of an injection of USD 350 billion decided upon by the Bush administration, an economy sustained, first and foremost, by rates of taxation which are the lowest in the Western world, and, on the other, by the Far East economy, which is in a state of almost total anarchy, with no rules being observed where either workers or the environment are concerned and not even minimal fiscal control.
European entrepreneurs welcomed the creation of the Competitiveness Council, which will, from now on, have the task of assessing the impact of measures adopted by authorities and European institutions on the competitiveness of our businesses.
We must all cultivate awareness of this dimension if we do not want our economy to stop being competitive with other economies.
I would also like to mention the understanding reached recently on the proposal for a directive on takeover bids.
This is a highly significant political agreement that brings to a close almost 15 years of negotiations.
Thanks to this agreement, we can now say we have helped to define a key element for the completion of the internal market.
In this connection, I must thank the Italian minister, Mr Buttiglione, who engineered this agreement.
Much work remains to be done, however, to give firms operating in Europe those general conditions associated with the legislative framework and the state of the job market that can guarantee their genuine competitiveness on world markets.
This is an important undertaking to be pursued in the coming months and to be formalised at the spring European Council.
This brings us to the matter of security.
With the objective of putting the Community institutions increasingly in touch with the citizensâ real needs and interests, the Italian Presidency has worked on strengthening the security of the Unionâs citizens in the knowledge that, even more so than other issues, it is on this matter which is particularly relevant to the daily lives of us all that the effectiveness of the Unionâs action will be judged by public opinion.
One of the central themes of our work has been the development of common strategies in the field of the management of migratory flows.
In the first place, the concept of âcommon external bordersâ has been further reinforced, and, in that sense, the European Council has taken note of the agreement reached on the main constituent elements of a special Community border management agency.
The decision has been taken to set up the agency and the Commission has committed to making it operational as of 1 January 2005.
The European Council has also taken note of the adoption, at the Presidencyâs proposal, of a special programme of measures on immigration by sea, a tangible sign of the Unionâs particular concern over the often tragic phenomenon of the attempts of illegal immigrants to reach our coasts with results, I would point out, that are often genuinely disastrous.
As regards this point, too, we must inform the European Parliament of the meeting, held in the presence of the Presidency and the Commission, of the five European countries bordering on the Mediterranean and the five countries of the North African coast.
These countries are traversed by increasing migratory flows which they describe as characteristic of our time, by citizens travelling from Africa to Europe, which they see as heaven on earth.
These countries, when invited to take part in bilateral agreements by individual European countries, declared themselves willing to participate in cooperation, which would make it possible to control departures from their coasts.
However, during this âfive plus fiveâ meeting, they did call for greater involvement in this measure and, of course, for us to bear the substantial financial costs which they incur for the benefit of Europe.
In this connection, the Council has invited the Commission to look into the matter and put forward solutions.
The Presidency has paid due attention both to the issue of the reception and integration of legal immigrants and to the issue of persons in need of international protection.
We are awaiting, in particular, a Commission study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration, a study that should also include the matter of the establishment of European entrance quotas.
We have, nevertheless, taken note of the progress that has been made in the matter of asylum, even though I am afraid that it has not been possible, as we had hoped, to reach agreement on the two directives under examination, relating, respectively, to minimal procedural regulations and to the definition of the status of refugee and beneficiary of subsidiary protection.
Effective management of migratory flows must, moreover, go hand in hand with fruitful cooperation with third countries of origin and transit.
To this end, we have gone ahead with the process of fully integrating migration issues into the Unionâs external relations.
We have noted the implementation of a mechanism for the evaluation of third countries in combating illegal immigration.
This is a mechanism called for by the Thessaloniki Summit, on which we very quickly achieved an interinstitutional agreement with the European Parliament by means of a regulation establishing a new programme of technical and financial assistance to third countries in the field of asylum and immigration.
This programme will endow a sensitive sector with new financial resources, EUR 250 million for the coming five-year period, as the first step in a more substantial increase in funds for immigration, an increase that should take place with the next Financial Perspective.
Still on the subject of immigration, but with aspects clearly associated with citizensâ security and combating terrorism, as the European Council we noted the agreement reached on the inclusion of biometric data in visas and residence permits. In the near future, this innovation will be extended to the passports of Community citizens as well.
Significant results have also been obtained with regard to combating drug abuse.
I would mention, in particular, the political agreement on the framework decision on combating drug trafficking an agreement patiently brokered by the Presidency.
The European Council has highlighted the importance of interfaith dialogue, a matter to which the Italian Presidency dedicated a special conference in Rome in October as an instrument in the integration of the immigrant communities in Europe and, more generally, as an instrument to aid understanding and cooperation in international relations.
The issue of relations between the West and Islam, between Christians and Muslims, is a matter which comes up every time we meet with the countries of the Arab League.
We need to work hard on this, for an Arab minority is still emerging which sees the challenge as to be taken up at all costs.
There can be nothing worse than going down that road.
I believe, therefore, that we must make every effort to achieve genuine, ongoing, constant, far-reaching dialogue between the West and the Muslim countries.
I would also point out that the Heads of State or Government have formally confirmed their firm opposition to every form of extremism and intolerance and their condemnation of terrorism and all other kinds of violence, and their explicit, unambiguous condemnation of all forms of anti-Semitism.
The European Council has also adopted the European Security Strategy: an excellent document, the work of Mr Solana and his team, which analyses security threats to the Union and how to address them.
On this basis, we should be able to improve our capacity for intervention in the area of both conflict prevention and crisis management.
Finally, the European Council has noted the progress achieved in the development of the CFSP.
Acquiring more capability remains our primary commitment and, to this end, the decision to create a European agency specifically dedicated to fostering the development and acquisition of new military capability has particular importance.
In this context, the European Councilâs decision to accept the proposal presented by the Presidency, on the basis of discussions with various partners, to boost the Unionâs planning capacity according to procedures compatible with the role of Nato and the âBerlin Plusâ agreements, takes on special significance.
With this decision, a matter that, up until a few months ago, was the object of far-reaching division among the Members of the European Union has now been brought to a positive conclusion in an institutional framework.
Lastly, I would like to mention that, at the Brussels Summit, the agreement on the location of 10 European agencies was concluded something that had been left on hold for about two years.
On the basis of this agreement, which was the result of diplomatic preparatory work in the months preceding the Summit, we will now be able to work with greater peace of mind to provide the operating conditions in the respective locations for agencies which will supplement the work of the Union institutions in a number of major sectors.
The Italian Presidency is justifiably proud of this major agreement, which deserves to be emphasised all the more as it was achieved under conditions certainly not facilitated by the difficult negotiations over the Constitutional Treaty taking place at the same time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Brussels European Council has taken place just a few months before the entry into force of the Accession Treaty.
The enlargement set to take place in 2004 looks increasingly set to be a complete success, thus confirming the wisdom of the decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government at Copenhagen in December 2002.
We noted that the acceding countries are continuing with the full transposal of the Community and will, I am sure, by the deadline of 1 May 2004, be capable of shouldering the responsibilities deriving from their full membership.
The Commissionâs recent strategy document has confirmed without a doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have made considerable progress towards entry into the Union. These two countries are now ready to complete the decisive steps that precede accession.
The European Council has drawn up a timetable with specific deadlines: 2004 for the conclusion of negotiations: 2005 for the signing of the Accession Treaty and, finally, accession to the Union in January 2007.
Turkey, too, has completed a substantial part of its institutional reforms and has made further progress towards compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria.
We have therefore duly recognised these positive developments in the conclusions of the European Council.
Moreover, we have also given Turkey our recommendations and encouragement to continue in this direction, while also highlighting the areas in which Ankara is being asked to make a particularly intense effort.
The medium-term goal remains Turkeyâs adequate preparation with a view to the decision to be adopted by the European Council one year from now.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council has also devoted great attention to the major developments which have taken place over these six months in the European Unionâs relations with its partners, its neighbours and the rest of the world.
We have, first and foremost, noted significant progress being made towards achievement of the objectives of the Stabilisation and Association Process for the Balkans and the major work carried out by the Italian Presidency in this field, and we have reiterated the Unionâs determination to support the European prospects of the countries of that region, inviting them to intensify their commitment to reforms, especially in the sectors essential for integration into the Union.
Equal importance was accorded to the results achieved in these six months in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and, in particular, on the occasion of the Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003.
I would like to point out that, on that occasion, the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly was formalised, we agreed to set up the Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations and we provided for a substantial increase in the EIBâs Euro-Mediterranean Facility, all in the anticipation and hope of a genuine Euro-Mediterranean Bank being set up handling capital from the countries of the African continent too.
Transatlantic relations remain an irreplaceable cornerstone in the Unionâs external relations.
The European Council has devoted a specific declaration of major political importance to the matter.
Moreover, it comes at the end of a period that we will remember as one of the most difficult in relations between Europe and the United States.
Among the declarationâs most important points, I would mention the statement that constant dialogue between the Union and the United States on an equal footing is necessary and fundamental if we are to deal successfully with global challenges.
Therefore, the Union will have to commit itself to strengthening cooperation with the United States in order to convert that community of values that lie at the root of our historic relationship into a community of actions.
A common commitment to combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction will be central in this regard.
Lastly, the development of the CFSP and the EU-Nato strategic partnership will increase the overall effectiveness of the transatlantic community.
We have also stressed the strategic value of our relationship with the Russian Federation and the importance of developing a broad-based partnership with Moscow aimed at facilitating and promoting the increasing integration of Russia with the European institutions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as outgoing President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, I would like to leave you with a message of confidence.
Indeed, I can assure you that all the countries have defended legitimate interests with respectable arguments, and, most importantly, that no one has denied the existence of a prevailing common European interest at all.
It is normal now that there be a pause in which our countries and public opinions can reflect more deeply on the debate, but we are certain that the negotiations will be resumed on the basis of the Conventionâs draft and of the results achieved through the work carried out by our Presidency and all the Member States together.
Each Member State will have to make its contribution in the coming months to the process of integration, for the European undertaking must remain unified and inclusive, without shortcuts or fragmentation.
The Constitutional Treaty is a goal that will certainly be reached.
The upcoming presidencies, with your support and the support of the future European Parliament, will certainly be able to work to this end thanks, not least, to the work already done and the results already achieved.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by thanking you for having responded so actively to my invitation to cooperate closely in every phase of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.
I have handed over the texts of the agreements already concluded to the Irish Presidency with my very best wishes for successful work in creating that great Europe that we all want.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the six months that are drawing to a close have been full of events and projects.
You will remember that, at the opening sitting on 2 July 2003, I listed 13 legislative proposals that the Commission hoped would go through by the end of the year.
I am very happy to note that, thanks to the efforts of the Italian Presidency, agreement has been reached on five important items on that list: I am thinking, in particular, of the amended directive on the traceability of GMOs and the framework agreement with the European Space Agency which will give a great boost to the development of our space policy; the introduction of the Single European Sky and the rules on public procurement are other major achievements of these six months and both will be formally approved early next year; lastly, clear outlines have now emerged on a political agreement on takeover bids, which Parliament will be considering during this part-session.
The Italian Presidency has carried the flame responsibly and with a great spirit of cooperation, for which the Commission is grateful.
For this and for the strenuous efforts they have made, I want to express my thanks publicly to the political leaders of the government and the whole team, both those working in the various institutions in Italy and the Permanent Representation in Brussels.
The last act of these six months was the Summit of Heads of State or Government that ended in Brussels last Saturday.
The part devoted to the Intergovernmental Conference rightly attracted most of the public's attention, but we must not overlook the other important issues on the table that were successfully resolved.
Of course, the topic to which I attach most importance is the European Initiative for Growth, which the Council approved unanimously.
This Initiative is the most visible part of a general plan of measures to stimulate the European economy.
Indeed, the measures adopted by the Council include measures to enhance our competitiveness and encourage job creation. Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity offered by the current recovery needs to be grasped now so we can reinvigorate the Lisbon agenda, which remains the key strategy for sustainable growth for the continent as a whole.
Lastly, I welcome the agreement reached in the Council on the seven new European Agencies which will deal with transport safety air, rail and maritime safetyÂ -Â food safety, fisheries, chemicals and disease prevention and control.
I want to stress the role played by the Commission over the now four years of work which have led to this achievement.
It is all the more satisfying to reach this outcome because the course has been uphill all the way.
The task was difficult and called for quiet work behind the scenes, but the Commission never doubted we would succeed in our undertaking. There are two reasons why the agreement on the Agencies is so important.
Firstly, it provides a more flexible and more efficient model for Community structures, a model that will bring the Union increasingly close to the European citizens.
Secondly, it is the result of a comprehensive approach that reconciles individual countries' interests, which can hold up or impede progress towards the common interest if they are not aligned.
I will now move on to the other major topic of the Brussels Summit: I am sad and disappointed at the failure to adopt a Constitution for the European Union. Let us cast our minds back two years to the Laeken European Council and the reasons behind its historic conclusions.
The conclusions were a response to a need felt by all at that time: for the Union to be given a more coherent, better-structured institutional framework.
At the time, the Member States were agreed on three basic points.
Firstly, the need to improve the functioning of our institutions, following that famous night at Nice. Secondly, the need to rationalise our legislative and institutional structures.
Over the decades they have grown so complex that this has diminished the coherence of the Union's policies and procedures. Thirdly, the need to involve the European citizens more in European integration.
The great innovation at Laeken was the Convention, the most ambitious and democratic institutional project in our history.
We have invested years of work in the undertaking, bringing together under the same roof 105 delegates from democratic bodies across Europe: national parliaments and governments, representatives of the European Parliament and members of the Commission.
The Convention did a good job.
After 18 months, it presented a draft Constitution that we concluded was a good basis for the Intergovernmental Conference to work on.
Moreover, as we have stated repeatedly, the text needed just a few amendments on certain points, because we were convinced as we still are that it strikes a delicate balance for the whole systemunderpinning the European Union and its work.
On the major points, the Convention's work was excellent.
I am thinking of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the method of qualified-majority voting and the distribution of political responsibilities.
I am also thinking of the increased role of the European Parliament, to which the draft Constitution gives, at last, greater decision-making powers in the area of the Union's budget.
As regards other issues, in particular the procedure for amending the Constitution, there was just not enough time.
Lastly, on the issue of the drafting of the Constitution, the principle of one Commissioner per Member State was already there in essence.
The practical arrangements were not satisfactory, but work carried out after the Intergovernmental Conference sorted this out.
Like every working basis, the Convention's draft was intended to take us forward, but some Member States have used it to take us backwards.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is why I am here expressing my sadness and disappointment to you today.
Last week, the European integration project ground to a halt and we all, all of us, missed a great opportunity.
The consequences will not be tragic, however, if we can keep resolutely to the course set by the Convention.
The problems identified in the Laeken declaration still need resolving; the basic text is still that produced by the Convention.
Although there is no sense in pointing the finger and pinning the blame on any particular national delegation, I must stress that we cannot shape our institutions with the possibility of blocking decisions as the only parameter.
That is not our role, it is not the role of Parliament or the Commission.
The deadlock at Brussels means that the Council as a whole failed to reach consensus on a unified proposal.
Sharing the blame is not enough, however, ladies and gentlemen.
We will now have to explain to the citizens how best to protect their future.
Alone or together?
Divided or united?
There is only one answer: we just need to open our eyes.
In line with the Laeken declaration, I still believe the solution cannot lie in a combination of vetoes but in the convergence of interests and proposals.
The right of veto is not an expression of democratic will and our institutions cannot side step the rules of democracy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently seeking a common solution and I realise that this is terribly difficult when there are still so many important issues on which agreement has yet to be reached.
Having said that, however, I am convinced that the right solution will be found with time and patience.
I therefore hope that future European Councils will come back to the issue of our Constitution with a realistic timetable and also with an overall perspective that we have, perhaps, lost in the course of recent months.
We all need to display courage and imagination, the qualities that major political decisions demand.
Only a few days have gone by since the Brussels Summit. It is too early and could even be presumptuous to put forward a full response as yet.
However, we clearly have a duty to reflect on what has happened and what we need to do in the future.
Some are thinking about a vanguard of pioneering States paving the way for greater cooperation and serving as the foundations for a stronger and more closely integrated Union open to all.
Solutions of this kind are part of the tradition of European integration, and if we cast our minds back, we see that such solutions emerge first and foremost when things are at their toughest and most complex.
Today, we are at one of those moments of crisis, and we therefore need to be courageous, responsible and forward-looking as we start to reflect on the future.
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to close this brief speech with an appeal from the heart.
I ask you to bring your political wisdom, your farsightedness and your experience to bear in the service of the first Constitution for a united Europe.
I know there are many of us in this House who see the European Union as the only viable answer to the challenges of history and politics.
As the directly elected representatives of our fellow citizens, you are very familiar with their views: thus, you know that they are perfectly aware that Europe is not an abstract ideal or a whim but a historical necessity.
Just step outside our geographical borders: from a Chinese, Indian or American perspective, the individual countries of our continent grow indistinct and merge; what people see increasingly is Europe as a whole; just cast your mind beyond our own age: in the eyes of history, the integration of the whole continent is the only chance of survival for the individual States.
Only Europe can give us the strength to maintain and develop our cultures and the regional and local traditions we are so proud of.
If we do not all stand shoulder to shoulder and defend this Union we have started to build over the last half a century, we will lose our autonomy and our influence in the world.
The Union will be the loser, but the biggest losers will be the Member States and our citizens, and we will all inevitably end up on the sidelines of history.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say â speaking on behalf of the Members belonging to the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â that 13 December 2003 was not a good day for Europe.
We are disappointed, but, in our disappointment, in the darkness, a light shines, for it was on 13Â December 2003 that we got the news that the Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen had been awarded to the President of the European Parliament and thus to Parliament itself, which shows that we have allies in the cause of a strong, democratic, and active Europe.
Mr President, we congratulate you on this distinction.
That the Intergovernmental Conference has failed must not mean that the Constitution has failed.
Let me say, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that there must be no doubt about our desire for a European constitution, that we declare our determination that there should be one, and that we are striving to have one as soon as possible, because without a constitution, Europe has no future in the twenty-first century.
We want a European constitution, because, in a community of 450 million people â and perhaps eventually even more â it is the only foundation for our peaceful progress through the twenty-first century.
We need a constitution so that the problems that arise in our society can be resolved on the basis of law.
We need a European constitution in order to be able to defend our European values in the world.
Let there be no doubt about our desire for a European constitution founded upon Community law.
We will stubbornly resist any attempt to take us back to mere intergovernmental cooperation or to the formation on our continent of axes squaring up to each other.
I would like to thank the Italian Presidency and the President of the European Council for having managed to get agreement â as you said â on 82 points.
My appeal to all those in positions of leadership is this: let us not again unwrap this package; let us instead focus on the few contentious issues that remain.
No one European government is in the right, and nor will we get caught up in apportioning blame, for once started on that, we will soon come to recognise that almost all of us bear a large part of the responsibility for Brussels having been inconclusive.
Rather than holding just one, two or three countries responsible, we now need the good will of all.
We need a compromise; our willingness to compromise has always been a distinctive characteristic of Europe, for compromise is an expression of our shared goodwill, of our mutual trust, and of our desire to go forward into the future together.
Let me make it perfectly clear that if a government thinks â and I am putting this in very abstract terms â that it can get out of European solidarity and defend only its own national interests, then such a government will, if that is how it behaves in future, be excluding itself from European solidarity.
Solidarity is not a one-way street; it is binding upon all, and so it is that the practice of solidarity is in the national interest, because those nations that withdraw from European solidarity will end up having no part to play in Europe.
Today, we hear people pondering the idea of a âcore Europeâ, but how is that meant to work?
A âcore Europeâ is no solution, for the problems on which the few agree are always different ones.
One group will agree on monetary issues; another on defence matters, and yet another on questions relating to the environment.
It is for that reason that a âcore Europeâ is no solution.
We must walk together; together we must take the road that leads to Europeâs future.
I urge everyone to join in seeking out this road.
Peopleâs questions to me betray their concern; this very morning, a renowned European journalist asked me whether the euro would still be there in ten yearsâ time.
Let us defend what we have achieved in Europe rather than jeopardising it.
Certainly, what we need right now is a moment to pause and to consolidate, but let me tell you that we should now be thinking about Europeâs need for clear foundations in the shape of a constitution.
We should not already be talking about further enlargements of the European Union that could put the whole concept of European integration even more at risk.
I would like to conclude by reiterating my gratitude to the Italian Presidency for its goodwill.
We know how difficult things are in Europe, but Europe will indeed suffer harm if we now lack the will to keep on working on the basis of what the Convention produced.
Next Thursday and Friday, we will be in Dublin, and I hope that the Irish Presidency will do everything in its power, starting by sounding out the individual governments as to their positions, so that the foreign ministers can then achieve a result that will enable, in due time, a summit of the European Union to be held, at which the European Constitution can be adopted.
In this responsibility we all share.
This is not a day for apportioning blame, but a day in which, despite the difficult situation in Europe, to have faith and to keep working on Europe â with patience, but also with the passion that the task demands.
Our group is determined that this Europe should be a success, and for it to be that, we need a European constitution.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, when your Presidency of the Council began, you said that what concerned you was the football in Tokyo and we should point out that the Milan team reached the penalty stage.
You did not even play in the second half.
We can see the results.
This is despite the serious and professional work of the Italian Presidency â and I would like to publicly thank Mr Frattini, Mr Antonione for their efforts.
My group profoundly regrets the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and the fact that it was not possible to approve a Magna Carta, which may cause us an existential crisis if we do not provide a serious political response.
We believe that we must recover the Community spirit, which is to take decisions together, combining our interests, acting in solidarity and not trying to block decisions.
I say this with particular feeling, because my country was always in the vanguard of European integration and now it is in the rearguard.
I must also say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have said â and I believe this must be recorded in the Minutes â that 95% of the Constitution is not subject to debate, but is part of our .
I believe this is an important fact.
Now, in order to resolve the other 5%, there is something that was demonstrated in Nice and which has now been ratified: that methods involving all-night negotiations, haggling, do not resolve the problem.
And therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would put a question to you: the Convention was not the outcome of Nice; we achieved it at Laeken.
The Convention has produced this text.
Are you in favour of returning to an open and democratic method â the Convention method â or do you think we can resolve the matter by staying up for another night like tonight?
I believe we have to be very clear in this approach, and it is also important, therefore, that the Irish Presidency takes up this baton.
I have been particularly struck by the fact that you have been especially critical of the current situation in the economic field and this is understandable.
What you have said would justify reconsidering the issue of economic governance.
You mentioned Gulliver and I am a great admirer of Jonathan Swift, but I do not believe this is the appropriate example.
We are not like Gulliver, but like Italo Calvinoâs [The Cloven Viscount], we have one half, the European Central Bank, but we do not have a figure in charge of the economy.
Are you prepared to propose an amendment to the Constitution and a reform of the Stability Pact aimed at giving us Europeans strength?
I believe this is an important issue to which we have to respond.
I must also say to you, on behalf of my group and of the European Parliament I believe that we are prepared to continue working to achieve the Constitution.
We have 95%.
The important thing now is to complete a Magna Carta, which is absolutely essential for our future and also for enlargement.
Â Â  Mr President, Liberals in this House expected rather more from the presidency of a country with a proud European tradition.
In six short months, the presidency has conspired to undermine the Stability Pact, has shown contempt for the European Union's policy towards Russia and offended Canada.
The President-in-Office has treated us to a 40-minute catalogue of the achievements of his term of office.
Yet it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and IGC have been a personal failure for the President of the European Council.
The 'piece of paper' in Mr Berlusconi's pocket turned out to be a -stained napkin with a few bad jokes scribbled on it.
The President came to the IGC poorly prepared; he ignored the warnings of this House that holding back compromise proposals would produce this kind of stalemate.
While the Americans were digging Saddam Hussein out of a hole in Iraq to global acclaim, our leaders were digging themselves into a hole in Brussels.
A successful summit needed two things: political will on the part of the major countries, and skilful diplomatic leadership.
It showed neither.
This IGC was not fated to fail it chose to.
Five countries walked away from an agreement which everybody needed but none of them wanted enough.
Yes, a delayed deal is better than a bad one.
But the problem with postponing a decision by kicking it into the long grass is that you might not find it again.
Especially with a crowded agenda ahead which includes negotiations on the next financial perspectives, talks on Turkish membership and elections in Spain, Britain and Italy.
So after a short post-mortem, the IGC must resume and must conclude its work under the Irish presidency.
The Irish have Mr Ahern, one of Europe's most seasoned negotiators, and Mr Cox, the President of our own House, whose joy at the Charlemagne Prize we share.
It may be possible to relaunch the European Union.
Our first Constitution deserves public debate and endorsement, and that requires a Treaty before the European elections in June 2004.
I would like to underline the extent of the concern felt by Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House and beyond and our feeling that the actions of the larger Member States are plunging the European Union into a crisis which could endanger the democratic nature of our Union.
The summit conclusions are also a disappointment to us.
There is nothing on Guantanamo Bay, despite the explicit demand of this House that our leaders should uphold the rights of the detainees.
On Russia, the conclusions scandalously make no reference to elections which the OSCE called 'a regression in the democratisation process'.
The decision to bring the People's Republic of China into the Galileo programme seems to have encouraged talk of the lifting of the European embargo on selling arms to the world's only significant remaining Communist dictatorship.
On all these issues, the Council behaved as if it is ashamed of our values or ignorant of them altogether.
At your press conference after the summit, President-in-Office, you said that but for the IGC, your presidency would be remembered as 'the most glorious of recent years'.
Yet agreement on the five issues mentioned by the President of the Commission represents a meagre return on a presidency in which such high hopes were invested.
If this was a glorious success, I would be fascinated to know your definition of a failure.
You set your presidency the target of a Constitution by Christmas.
By your own standards, you have failed.
Â Â  â Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, on 3 September last, in this very place, Mr Giscard d'Estaing presented us with the draft constitution for Europe.
I was extremely critical of the text at the time, since I and my group saw it as constitutionalising the liberal model by perpetuating the most contentious part of the Maastricht Treaty both in its direction and as regards the institutions.
The project is now frozen for several months.
Some might think that gives us some satisfaction, but for my part that is far from being the case.
First because the course of liberal Europe is not affected by this failure.
It will continue for one simple reason: it is unfortunately not the subject that divided the 25 governments.
Everyone, from Mr Berlusconi to the Polish Prime Minister, has been keen to underline that there was consensus on virtually every point of the draft constitution apart from the method of calculating the qualified majority in the Council.
All the problems so forcefully raised in the growing public debate on the draft constitution, in the recent European Social Forum for example, are therefore still on the table.
That is nothing to be pleased about.
Then we had the distressing spectacle of ambition for power and dreams of power, with no comparison being made of the options for the Unionâs policies, objectives and values, seemingly echoing that stupid watchword âNice or deathâ, a complete denial of the politics and spirit of responsibility.
This Europe long in tooth and short on ideas, alien to peopleâs expectations and insensitive to the frustrations welling up everywhere, is a princely gift to populists and demagogues of all kinds.
This failed prelude to an enlarged Europe is likely to have a devastating effect on all who have real ambition for Europe â an alternative ambition to the present treaties, but a strong ambition nevertheless.
Finally, this impasse is giving new life to the outdated old ideas of the hard core.
Only too glad of an opportunity to pull out, the richest countries are threatening to cut back the funds intended for the least developed.
By doing away with the notion of solidarity between Member States, such a development would be the death-knell of any community, allowing the dream of the most liberal to come true, the free trade area.
