This means that we have created a grassroots instrument that guarantees that employers and employees will, through a united effort, make a survey of areas that are unsatisfactory at their workplace and that they can eliminate them through the same united effort.
In this regard I might say that developments in EU legislation are moving very much in the direction of the Nordic model. These sorts of instruments have been in place for some time now in the Nordic countries, and not just there but also in countries such as Belgium and Italy.
This directive will also afford greater protection from discrimination against mothers and fathers at the workplace.
It is obviously very important that when parents, whether fathers or mothers, return to work from paternity, maternity or parental leave, they can actually be given a job equivalent to the one they did before and can also enjoy all the benefits they would have had while they were away from work.
From this you may have already concluded that fathers and men in general have now been included in the Community legislation on gender equality.
This is also absolutely vital as there is much debate going on in all our Member States about how men can be included in the promotion of equality.
We should also take into account the fact that men can also be victims.
An employer may also discriminate against a father returning to work from parental leave or insisting on his statutory right to work a shorter working day.
This directive now forbids all such discrimination.
It is also very important that under this directive all Member States must establish an authority that is in practice responsible for promoting these developments and which also monitors them.
I would like to say that this will be of particularly great importance for the future Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, where the position of women has become noticeably problematic with the structural changes that have been taking place.
In this way the European Union can also promote concrete improvements in gender equality in the future Member States.
Parliament should feel very pleased with the results of this conciliation process.
We have in practice achieved all our objectives and I might also say that the level of cooperation among the political groups has been quite excellent.
Mr President, more than a year has passed since we gave this proposal to amend the 1976 directive its first reading, a proposal which was referred to the European Parliament in July 2000; this means that it has taken us practically two years to reach an agreement with the Council and the Commission on amending a directive that Parliament has been discussing since as early as 1996, when we received the first proposal to amend the directive.
We had rejected that proposal on the basis of my report, which was debated on 8 March 1999, and had asked the Commission to table a more robust text.
For once, it is neither the Commission nor the Council that are responsible for this deplorable delay.
The rapporteur lost us a lot of time, firstly by tabling her report late and secondly by overloading it with proposals that had no sound legal foundation, some of which related to other directives.
At conciliation we were able to discard these counterproductive amendments that had been adopted at first and second reading against my group's wishes.
If people had listened to us then, women would already have been benefiting from the new directive for at least a year now, and it does represent a genuine improvement on the text that has been in force since 1976, a text which nevertheless has had the great merit of making progress in particular on equal treatment for men and women in the workplace.
I am pleased to note that, thanks to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the positive measures have been safeguarded: the right of women to return to the same job or an equivalent post after maternity leave is essential; the right of men to the same job guarantee after a period of paternity leave is recognised, if such leave exists in the Member State of which they are nationals, and this is also the case after adoption leave, if it exists in a Member State.
The definitions of sexual harassment, like those of direct and indirect discrimination, are useful and I hope that they will prove to be relatively robust, so as not to cause unnecessary litigation.
I should like to distance myself from Paragraph 9 of Mrs Hautala's report, because it states that the delegation regrets that the Council was unwilling to prohibit a general exclusion of representatives of one sex from a particular professional activity or professional training.
This general prohibition is enshrined in the existing directive, the article in question, Article 2 Paragraph 1, being maintained.
It would therefore serve no purpose to repeat it.
I am all the more pleased with the outcome of the conciliation because finally - as I have said - my group's responsible and reasonable position has prevailed, thanks also to the Council and the Commission, who have done a great deal to talk round some over-excited members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, who had not understood that the best is often the enemy of the good.
If Parliament wishes to be taken seriously as a co-legislator then it must not confuse a legal text with a resolution, in which anyone can indulge in wishful thinking and reveal all of their wildest dreams. Above all, we must not forget that a legal text has to have a sound legal base and be possible to implement.
Thank you.
Mr President, this evening, we are discussing conciliation, the outcome of the negotiations on a major proposal for a directive amending the 1976 directive, and we are satisfied, whatever Mrs Lulling says.
She never fails to reiterate her opinion, but if Parliament, Mrs Hautala and the entire Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities had followed Mrs Lulling's approach, we would not be here today expressing our satisfaction, for hers was without a doubt a minority proposal.
I would, however, like to thank Mrs Hautala because, despite the difficulties of the negotiations, we have succeeded in achieving an excellent result.
Why were the negotiations difficult? Because the difference between the Council and Parliament's positions was considerable.
Mrs Hautala's approach and the commendable cooperation of all - and I repeat - all the groups, and the willingness shown by Commissioner Diamantopoulou and the Spanish Presidency, whom I would like to thank, to find solutions, mean that the result we have achieved is significant. Why is it significant?
Because, three years on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we can, at last, say that things are starting to change.
The Treaty of Amsterdam was a leap forwards in terms of recognition of the principle of equal opportunities and we now, at last, have a directive which provides specific, accurate definitions of direct and indirect discrimination, a directive which, in addition to providing an important definition of harassment and sexual harassment, recognises without a shadow of doubt that sexual harassment is to be considered direct discrimination and is therefore a punishable offence, a directive which recognises the importance of maternity and paternity leave and adoption and therefore the need and the right of mothers and fathers returning from such leave to be provided with equal or equivalent work, a directive which recognises the need for and compels each Member State to lay down equal and proportionate sanctions, a directive which, moreover, recognises independent bodies and makes companies responsible for producing equal opportunities plans, thus making positive actions under Article 141 possible.
I see this result as significant, Mr President, particularly because the matter is being discussed by the Convention and, on the basis of this result, we will be able to call for a further step forward to be taken in the Convention too.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Hautala for the huge amount of work she has done on this report, and also the Commission for having made an active contribution to its success.
It is therefore not only out of politeness that I say this but in genuine recognition of the fact that there is someone who has in actual fact been able to make a difference in this area and has demonstrated in practice that an individual MEP too can set a good agenda.
I think that, with this report and the work that has been done, we have passed a milestone in the EU's journey to equality.
We have, first of all, arrived at a definition of what sexual harassment really is, and that is very useful.
There are a number of countries which really had not adopted a position on this issue before.
We have also obtained a ban on discrimination against women who are pregnant or who have recently given birth and, in certain cases, also against men on paternity leave, if there is national legislation on this subject.
Finally, we have obtained the option of making positive special arrangements in cases where these are required by one or other gender.
All in all, I think the result is splendid.
We now come to the series of commitments assumed by the Member States in connection with this directive, and I want specifically to highlight the equality monitoring bodies, as they are called.
At a recent meeting with the candidate countries, the latter were very much occupied by precisely that issue because they have a lack of data and because it is necessary for them to have means of putting pressure on their own governments with a view to acquiring this data.
I also believe, however, that we have to say that we shall be keeping an eye on this issue in our own countries, because it is something that the Member States can easily avoid tackling.
I have unfortunately experienced a little of this in my own country, but I will not labour that subject any more.
I nonetheless believe that it is up to all of us to keep an eye on this matter so that we are both of help to the candidate countries and assume responsibility ourselves in our own countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Heidi Hautala for the time that she has devoted to this directive and for her work, which shows that she has been equal to this task and has merited the trust placed in her by the members of her committee.
I also wanted to say how glad we are to be taking part in a codecision procedure on equal treatment and women's rights, which does not happen so very often.
I should like to say that this directive seems to me to mark progress on two extremely important fronts.
The first is that its scope has finally been extended.
All family-related issues, such as maternity leave, adoption and also adoption leave - and God knows how important these are for us - have been recognised.
The presence of the father and the need for the father not to be penalised if he takes leave are recognised.
This is what I would call an extension in favour of family life.
I am very happy that all of this now comes under this directive.
In the same way, all harassment-related matters now enter into the scope of application of this directive.
Here harassment is considered to be discrimination.
We tend to deal with the issue of violence against women from the point of view of moral standards.
Here we deal with it from the point of view of discrimination, so from the point of view of the fight for equality between men and women.
I particularly welcome this and I believe that the efforts we made to draw a distinction between the two definitions of harassment were extremely worthwhile.
I myself had recourse to this new standpoint last week in France, where although our law dates from 1992 it does not really include a definition.
This new definition will therefore be very useful in all of our Member States.
That is why I consider this to be so important.
In addition, there is also the whole dimension of obligation.
If all of these things that we are asking for are to become a reality, we need obligations and not just wishes and desires.
This would appear to me to be fundamental and, since I still have a few seconds left, I will take the liberty of sharing with you a discovery I made today.
If you cross the footbridge and go upstairs, you will find a door with a sign indicating the room set aside for this Parliament's cleaning staff: the sign shows a woman holding a brush.
I think that we still have a great deal more work to do, because I want there to be equal treatment in domestic services as well as within the large professions that we are trying to represent here.
We will have to break this debate and continue it at 9 p.m. because our agenda indicates that at 5.30 p.m. we move on to the Commission statement.
The next item is the Commission communication on the Green Paper on consumer protection and contamination of food by nitrofen.
Mr President, the Green Paper on consumer protection which was adopted by the Commission in October 2001 put forward a number of options and questions on the future of EU consumer protection policy.
It suggested in particular the idea of adopting a framework directive on fair commercial practices.
It also suggested developing a legal instrument for cooperation between enforcement authorities.
The public consultation launched by the Green Paper received a very wide response from business, consumers and national governments.
The response gives the Commission clear support for developing a proposal for a framework directive.
In particular, a very large majority of the Member States supported this option.
The Council has called on the Commission to follow up the Green Paper as a matter of priority.
However, there was a general feeling amongst those who supported the idea and those who, on balance, did not, that more information, clarification and consultation was needed on the content of a framework directive.
The basic structure of a framework directive outlined in the Green Paper was broadly accepted.
We have therefore decided that the best approach would be to embark on a further round of consultation on the substance of a framework directive before moving on to the stage of making proposals.
The follow-up communication adopted today by the Commission responds to this need for further consultation.
It summarises the results of the consultation, draws policy conclusions and sets out an action plan for further consultation.
For the sake of transparency and in order to structure the debate with the Member States, an outline of a possible framework directive on fair commercial practices is attached to the communication.
This is not intended to be a draft proposal; rather it is the first in a series of working documents designed to clear the ground and provide some much needed structure and form to what has been up to now a somewhat confused debate.
Let me try and set out what a framework directive would do.
It would set the standards that business will have to meet when dealing with consumers.
Consumers should have the information they need to take informed decisions.
They should be protected from rogue traders who seek to mislead and harass them through dishonest advertising and marketing.
The framework directive will contain a general clause prohibiting unfair commercial practices detrimental to consumers.
The general clause will be supplemented by specific rules covering the various categories of unfair commercial practices both before and after sale.
These categories range from misleading advertising and aggressive marketing methods to failure to provide after-sales customer assistance and effective complaint handling.
A non-exhaustive list of examples could be attached to the directive in order to illustrate the scope of the general clause and how the specific rules work in practice.
My intention is that we develop legislation that focuses on the fundamental issues.
Business should then be left free to apply to the principles of the framework directive in their area of competence through effective codes of conduct.
The Commission could also develop non-binding guidance to reduce the risk of divergent interpretations of the framework directive at national level.
It goes without saying that such guidance cannot change the democratically approved legislation.
The strong role of Parliament in the legislative process will in no way be undermined.
The follow-up communication also provides for the setting up of an expert group.
The main task of this group would be to identify the common ground between national systems and the barriers to the internal market for business and consumers.
It should also seek to identify the level of harmonisation needed to ensure a high level of consumer protection and completion of the internal market with the inclusion of a mutual recognition clause.
I also hope that the group will be able to find simplified solutions to consumer protection problems, although not at the cost of effective protection.
Codes of conduct and the use of guidance both have a role to play here.
I hope we can develop legislation that focuses on the fundamental issues.
It should set benchmarks for the desired outcomes for consumers.
Procedural and prescriptive rules should be avoided where possible to ensure legislation does not become obsolete.
In parallel to the work of the expert group, my services will make arrangements for consultation with stakeholders on the same issues.
We will organise meetings in Brussels for EU organisations.
I hope, therefore, that the follow-up communication will provide a sound basis for moving towards a proposal for a framework directive that can command widespread support and confidence.
Such a directive will be both a genuine boost for competition in the internal market and also demonstrate to EU citizens the practical and useful role the EU can play in their daily lives.
I hope that the proposed method of consultation will enable the Commission to fully understand the different nuances of the national rules on fair trading and build a consensus on a workable framework directive.
The task ahead should not be underestimated.
The encouraging response to the Green Paper, however, gives confidence that we can achieve it.
The consultation showed clear support for the ideas in the Green Paper on enforcement cooperation.
I believe that we now have a clear political mandate to proceed on the basis of a legislative proposal in this area.
In this context, I would like to stress my commitment to producing a proposal on enforcement cooperation in the near future, hopefully before the end of this year.
I regret that Parliament has not yet expressed an opinion on the Green Paper.
However, I should add that I do not see this as a particular problem.
The follow-up communication is itself on a further stage in the consultation process.
It provides a more detailed set of ideas.
I therefore look forward to the European Parliament's opinion on both the Green Paper and the follow-up communication.
I can assure you that the views of Parliament will play a very important part in the Commission's deliberations at the legislative stage.
I look forward to discussing this issue with you in greater detail in the months to come.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have a question on the prohibited substances.
It is the case that, in future, certain substances will be banned in the European Union, as they have been in the past.
How will the Commission guarantee in future that these substances will be tested for in the Member States?
How are products containing these substances to be prevented from getting onto the market, as products containing nitrofen are at present managing to do in Germany?
They have been banned for some considerable time, during which nitrofen has not once been tested for.
When it was discovered, it was done so fortuitously.
I am not sure whether I have listened to everything with due care, but I thought that the Commissioner was also going to issue a detailed report on the nitrofen problem in Germany.
I missed it.
Is it scheduled for later?
If so, with the President's permission, I should like to ask a question on that subject.
I too was of the view that the Commissioner was going to make one statement which included both subjects, but he has not given us his statement on nitrofen at this stage.
I think you should make that statement now, Commissioner, so that colleagues can address the two subjects.
Mr President, I am sorry if I misunderstood the procedure.
I understood I should make a statement in relation to the consumer protection issue, answer questions on that and then move on to this issue.
However, I am of course happy to do it this way.
I am pleased to bring Parliament up to date on the nitrofen contamination in Germany.
This is a very disturbing discovery.
Nitrofen is a herbicide and has been a banned substance in the European Union since 1988.
It is a probable carcinogen, with teratogenic effects.
Consumers are quite rightly worried that control measures failed to prevent this contamination.
The Commission was first made aware of the contamination on 24 May.
There were three immediate priorities.
First, to establish from the German authorities the source and extent of the contamination; second, to trace and recall contaminated products; third, to ensure that the control authorities in the Member States were kept fully informed of developments.
I am satisfied that very good progress has been made in addressing each of these priorities.
The origin of the contamination is now known.
It can be traced to the storage of organic grains in a warehouse that had been used in the past to store pesticides.
I am sure you will share my concern that such an elementary precaution as a thorough cleaning does not appear to have taken place before this very radical change of use was undertaken.
In addition, the contamination was discovered in industry tests in January but was not reported to the responsible authorities until May.
This delay in notification has resulted in the circulation and consumption of contaminated material before the German authorities were in a position to react.
Feedingstuffs from this warehouse were delivered to 90 producers of organic products through a firm that supplies to the organic sector.
The German authorities have taken the necessary measures to block supplies from these producers unless and until they have been checked for the absence of nitrofen.
This tracing exercise included some limited exports of poultrymeat to the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and Austria.
The authorities are also in the process of tracing smaller quantities of organic cereals supplied directly from the warehouse to an estimated 20 other producers.
Products from these companies are currently blocked.
The German authorities state that full tracing will be finalised by the end of this week.
This tracing exercise includes a quantity of organic wheat exported to France in January.
There is also evidence of storage of conventional non-organic cereals in this warehouse between 1995 and August 2001, although not necessarily in the contaminated section.
The authorities are still in the process of verifying this information.
Finally, a quantity of organic lupines was also exported to Denmark.
The Danish authorities have also been notified.
They have traced this product and blocked what remains on the market and the farms concerned.
The German authorities are satisfied that the origin of the contamination is confined to that particular warehouse.
They point out that both organic and conventional produce have been extensively tested and no nitrofen has been found.
The Commission notes the assurances that any remaining contamination is limited and can be contained.
We also note the considerable efforts to trace products and remove them from the market.
Member States have been kept fully informed of this entire process.
A further meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain today took note of the assurances from the German authorities and agreed that there is no need to take additional measures for the moment.
The overall situation obviously remains under close watch.
The standing committee will meet again on Friday to review developments.
In particular it will want to learn of the progress in tracing the estimated 6% of contaminated produce which remains to be fully traced.
While there is considerable concern in all Member States, especially with the still fresh memories of recent food safety crises, only Belgium has announced national restrictions.
This may be a legacy of the dioxin crisis which has understandably left deep scars in Belgium.
I expect, nonetheless, that the clarifications provided in the standing committee this week will prove sufficient to lift these restrictions.
We must be careful also to focus on the broader picture.
These recent events confirmed for me that our new approach to food safety is going in the right direction.
In particular, the necessity for food traceability from farm to fork and for rapid and transparent exchange of information has been confirmed.
Both are critical to the identification and swift recall of contaminated products.
As always, lessons need to be learned and the Commission is looking at the following issues in particular.
How did such contamination occur in the first place when nitrofen has been banned in the EU since 1988?
Can we be fully confident that warehouses formerly used to store dangerous substances are safe for food storage?
Could more be done to ensure that federal authorities are notified immediately of incidents of contamination, allowing them to notify the Commission and other Member States, not just in Germany but in other federal countries as well?
In particular, what should be done to address the fact that the contamination was known to the laboratories and industry for months before the authorities were informed?
Similarly, was the rapid alert system notified of these developments as intended?
These are issues I will now be taking up with the federal authorities in Germany.
A mission of the Food and Veterinary Office will take place shortly to assist in this process.
Previous FVO reports on both residue control measures and controls in the organic food sector in Germany will also be taken fully into account.
I can assure you that Parliament will be kept fully informed of all these developments.
I thank the Commissioner for his statement.
Only in the last two sentences did he mention the role of the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin.
Since the Bureau has been in existence for some six or seven years, I wonder why it did not find this out sooner.
As the Commissioner stated, the problem involving nitrofen has been around for some five or six years.
If the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin is indeed supposed to check the inspectors in the Member States, then it is a little late in tracking down this instance of food contamination.
Why is that?
Can the Commissioner give an explanation for this?
How often, for example, have inspections taken place and how often do inspections take place in other countries to check on this type of thing and especially on organic production.
As the Commissioner stated, the problems surrounding the contamination of turkey meat in Germany are very reminiscent of those surrounding the dioxin contamination of chickens in Belgium in 1999.
Then, however, the Commission levelled such heavy criticism at Belgium on account of its provision of information that due to a knee-jerk reaction in many countries inside and outside the EU, the borders closed for practically all Belgian agricultural products, with serious economic consequences.
The Commission immediately introduced an export ban on possibly contaminated products, coupled with a very strict monitoring system.
Commissioner, when I now gauge the Commission's reaction to what has happened in Germany, then there is a world of difference.
Germany notified too late, far too late, despite the fact that it already knew, which was not the case in Belgium.
We were slightly late, but not that much.
The Commission has been notified, but, unlike the affair in Belgium, no complaints have been lodged against Germany.
No action has been taken, etc.
Do not be surprised therefore that there is a feeling in Belgium that once again, the Commission's reaction is completely different because a large Member State is involved.
I would therefore like to know why that is, Commissioner, and I would appreciate your thoughts on how you handled this situation.
In answer to Mr Kindermann's question on how we can ensure that Member States carry out their work properly, first of all it is the primary role of the authorities in the Member States to carry out their functions and to comply with the legislation.
That is a responsibility that is imposed primarily on the Member States themselves.
In addition to that, there is the function of the FVO in ensuring that this work is done.
Their function is to inspect the inspectors.
In carrying out that task, they produce reports which are published on the Internet.
In answer to Mr Mulder, that is what happened in this instance.
The FVO carried out this work.
There were reports on residues in Germany in July 2001 and on controls in the organic sector.
These reports, which found serious weaknesses, are already available on the Internet.
They have been the subject of discussion in the past.
I reiterate to Mr Mulder what I said in answer to Mr Kindermann: the role of the FVO is to inspect the inspectors.
It cannot ensure that every single plant is carrying out its work properly and carefully.
That is a function for the inspectors employed by the Member States themselves.
The third question related to whether Belgium and Germany have been treated unequally.
Discrimination means treating two situations which are the same in a different manner, or treating two different situations in the same way.
In this instance we have two different situations.
They are not comparable in scale.
Large sections of the pig and poultry industry in Belgium were affected at that time.
In Germany an estimated 1% of the organic sector - itself a niche sector which amounts to only 2% of overall production - is concerned in this instance.
The German authorities made good progress in tracing and recalling potentially contaminated products.
Unfortunately the scale of the dioxin problem in Belgium made tracing much more difficult.
It is important to recall that, because we have been working together over the last two-and-a-half years, we have put in place safety measures to ensure traceability.
In this instance the legislation did work.
It was not in place to assist those who were in charge of the issues in 1999.
There was a significant delay in reporting the problems in Belgium, resulting in the risk of dissemination of the dioxin throughout Belgium and other Member States, in circumstances where the level of contamination, particularly of pork and poultry, was very significant - much more widespread than in the present instance.
The handling of the nitrofen contamination has met with general satisfaction in the Member States.
It has been discussed in the standing committee today and will be discussed again on Friday.
Only Belgium considered the EU response to the dioxin crisis unsatisfactory in terms of the EU-wide ban.
Third countries were also threatening measures against all EU exports, in the absence of proof that the problem was confined to Belgium.
Once again, there is a significant difference between the two situations.
My first important decision on assuming office was to lift restrictions on the export of Belgian beef arising from the dioxin crisis.
You will appreciate that this was not a comfortable decision for a new Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection with responsibility for food safety on his very first day in office.
Nonetheless I took it because I was advised to and the evidence that was put before me supported it.
I was satisfied that the easing of restrictions was justified.
I therefore take very seriously any suggestion that the Commission may have treated two Member States differently merely because one is large and one is small.
I am very sensitive to these issues, not least because of where I come from.
It would be entirely wrong for anyone to think that the Commission's decisions over the last week were based on anything other than the scientific facts and the advice given to me and the standing committee which led us to conclude that our decisions were the right ones.
I insist that my decision was based solely on objective analysis, completely divorced from any consideration of the size of the Member State involved.
That is my position.
Mr President, Commissioner, all credit to your consistent approach!
It is sometimes helpful in federal systems for their states to be forced to take consistent action in these matters.
I have three questions to put to you.
Firstly, do feedingstuffs not also have to be checked regularly, and not just the foodstuffs that, as it were, result from them?
Secondly, must this not apply particularly to imports from countries in which sprays containing nitrofen continue to be used or where large stocks of them are still available?
Thirdly, if you are - as you have hinted - resuming checks for nitrofen, are you working on the assumption that traces of nitrofen will be found in other countries and in the conventional farming sector as well?
Mr President, Commissioner, I do not normally praise the Commission but, on this occasion, I wish to do so both in view of the Green Paper, or the follow-up to the Green Paper to which you refer, and also in view of the fact that we are soon to have the opportunity to cooperate within the 'enforcement sector' in the matter of consumer protection.
I wish to put three questions:
Will any sector be excluded from a fair trade directive's being applied to it?
We now see that, in spite of our having obtained a financial services directive, there is still a lot to be done.
How will the European Parliament be associated with the group of experts?
What is to happen concerning the proposal for a regulation on sales promotion measures?
I also regret that Parliament has still not been able to come up with a response to the Green Paper, but that has quite a lot to do with shortcomings in the way in which Parliament is structured when it comes to dealing with consumer issues.
Mr President, I shall also focus my remarks on the Green Paper communication.
I would like particularly to invite Mr Byrne to confirm to the House that the provisions of last week's Communication by President Prodi on simplifying and improving the regulatory environment will be applied in full to the extension of his proposal.
I would also particularly like him to confirm that he will be undertaking a full regulatory impact assessment of this wide-ranging proposal and that he has not excluded the possibility of meeting the undoubted requirements he has set out for improving the quality of consumer protection by means other than a directive.
In conclusion could I also invite him to confirm to the House tonight what he said to the Legal Affairs Committee the other week, namely that the sales promotion regulation continues to have his full support and is entirely compatible with the suggested proposals.
I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the win by his home team in football today.
I want to follow in a similar vein to the previous speaker.
We welcome the proposals in the Green Paper.
However, Commissioner, you will agree that your ideas are progressing very fast in this area.
In the light of the proposals on better government that came out last week, which Mr Harbour mentioned, I want to ask you three specific questions.
What improvements do you intend to make in terms of consultation of all the actors involved - consumers, SMEs, and the government departments that will have to implement any particular laws that emerge from this?
How do you intend to improve the evaluation of the impact assessment in terms of cost?
Can you guarantee to make available all consultations on the web so that these will be available for consultation?
I would like to thank your staff for providing me with previous consultations.
However, it has to be said that they are all in different languages.
I cannot read all of them; and if there is to be transparency on these issues they need to be available publicly on the web and in languages that people can understand.
Commissioner, your explanation to Mrs Smet is not satisfactory to me.
The crisis has been going on since September.
The German Agriculture Minister has known since 21 May.
This is now almost three weeks ago.
We worked together on the regulation concerning the European Food Safety Authority.
This is the first test for this regulation.
And what does Article 53 of this regulation state?
That when a serious risk to the health of the public, animals or the environment is established, the Commission must, or can, take a number of measures without delay.
This includes, for example, the suspension of introducing products onto the market.
You have failed to do this, you have reassured us, while I have been given some information that tells me that somewhere, I do not know where, there is 100 tonnes of contaminated wheat.
You claim that there is only one source.
You have the information that there is only one source, while the contamination has been in progress since September, and while we all know that this warehouse in Vorpommern has been in use since October.
So you are not convincing me.
I really have the feeling here that a large Member State has been given preferential treatment compared to a small Member State like mine.
I do not want to enter into the discussion of large and small countries.
However, I have two specific questions.
Did I hear the Commissioner correctly when he said that we have actually known since June 2001 from inspectors that nitrofen had been found.
Why did rapid alert not work?
This is my first question.
My second question concerns the assertion of consumer protection.
In my view, this presupposes strong and independent consumer protection organisations.
Especially in consideration of the nitrofen scandal, this also presupposes additional measures, particularly with a view to new countries joining.
What will the Commissioner do about supporting strong and independent organisations in the candidate countries?
I would be interested to find out.
Mr President, Commissioner, in one minute nobody should confuse attitude with platitude.
I will be quick, firstly could you come back to this House when you know more about the timescale of the German contamination issue, particularly whether the rapid alert system worked effectively.
There are more similarities with the Belgian case than I think you imply today.
Secondly, would you accept with respect to consumer consultation that you need to be looking at the duty not to trade unfairly and the accumulation of case history in that field, as well as setting out the duty to trade fairly, which in your country and mine, and some others, is a fairly new concept.
Commissioner Byrne stated that the European Parliament had not yet expressed an opinion on the Green Paper on consumer protection, but that he did not see this as a particular problem and that, moreover, the Commission had enough of a political mandate - if I understood correctly - to determine the broad outlines of future consumer policy.
For my part, before asking my question, which will be quite straightforward, I should like to say that at this stage the European Parliament has not given any political mandate to the Commission to determine broad outlines of any kind.
My question is therefore as follows: to what extent does the Commission intend to take account of the European Parliament's opinion; is it still worth its even issuing an opinion when clearly the broad outlines have been defined and the major decisions made, whether it be on the choice of a framework directive as the preferred legal instrument or on legal principles, fair commercial practices, mutual recognition, or even to deregulate existing provisions?
Mr President, that remains the case.
I understand why Members from other countries are displeased.
Let me say as a German that I think what has happened in Germany is a scandal, and our farmers are the ones who are suffering from it.
Mrs KÃŒnast, our Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture, has done nothing except make announcements at the top of her voice.
Functioning channels of communication need to be created, and very soon.
This has not been achieved.
At the time of the Lannoye report, our group wanted mandatory reporting by the authorities to start at an earlier date.
We asked for 2003, and 2005 was what we got.
What I want to ask the Commissioner is this: what do you think about that in the aftermath of this scandal?
Should we not, after all, impose this obligation on the authorities earlier?
In answer to the first question by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the situation here is that there are residue monitoring plans in place at both EU and Member State level.
These plans include banned substances such as nitrofen.
The plans have proven their effectiveness in recent months.
The presence of chloramphenicol, for instance and, indeed, nitrofen were identified by this procedure.
They are both banned substances that were brought to light by the use of this procedure.
Finally, such testing extends to both imported and domestically produced products.
A number of Members raised that point.
Food and feedingstuffs must be safe, irrespective of their origin.
The residue plans from third countries, which are obligatory under EU legislation, are carefully checked to ensure that the necessary controls are in place.
The same issue arises with candidate countries.
We exercise the same degree of care to ensure compliance.
The second question relates to the Green Paper and whether any sectors are going to be excluded.
The financial sector will be excluded and the whole area of food safety legislation will not be covered because it has its own separate legal regime.
Parliament will be involved; not only will Parliament's opinion on the original paper be taken into account, but also we await the opinion on this follow-up paper.
So Parliament has an opportunity to present an opinion on both papers.
The reason we moved ahead was not, I can assure you, through any disrespect to Parliament, but because there was a considerable degree of pressure by the Council and others.
Also it was felt that the first paper was not as detailed as people wanted.
I felt that it was useful to make the follow-up paper more detailed to assist Parliament in reaching its conclusions and perhaps providing an even more valuable opinion for me to take into account when we come to draft the final framework directive.
Obviously Parliament will have a full role, as it normally does.
I was then asked whether I would take into account the better regulation communication by President Prodi last week.
I confirm that I will and I also confirm what I said in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market some weeks ago, that I was involved in the work on the sales promotion directive.
My services and I support that.
That piece of legislation is compatible with this communication and with our general plans on unfair trading practices.
Mrs McCarthy is concerned that we are moving very fast.
That is probably true.
However, it is intended to consult fully with stakeholders.
As I said, there will also be provision for stakeholders on all sides to have a role in the operation of the legislation when it becomes operational.
Mr Staes goes back to the point about Belgium and unequal treatment.
I can only repeat what I said earlier.
Neither I nor my services were motivated by any considerations of the size of the Member State.
To Mrs Oomen-Ruijten I can say that we in the European Union have only known about this since 24 May, although private laboratories in Germany have known since January. We are very unhappy that it took so long to notify the federal authorities.
As I said earlier, this point is being taken up with the federal authorities.
This is an issue of some concern and I know it is a concern in the countries with a federal structure, where sometimes there is perhaps not the same speed of communication between regions or LÃ€nder and the federal authorities.
But I must insist that at European Union level our interlocutor is the federal government and therefore the institutions of the European Union cannot be mollified by responses from Member States with a federal structure that really there is nothing they can do because the problem resides in their LÃ€nder or regions.
That is not a response that we at European Union level can accept.
As regards third countries, I can only repeat what I said earlier in response to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
They are treated in an equivalent manner to Member States.
Mr Whitehead then asked if I would come back again when I have more information.
I am always happy to come back to Parliament with up-to-date information on any issue, particularly an issue of such importance as this.
On the second question, he asks me about the accumulation of case-law and fair trading.
People used to a common law system are often anxious that what we are trying to do here is move closer to a codified system which they would not feel totally happy with.
I addressed this issue before when I was here and I said on that occasion that I am sensitive to this point, both because of where I come from and because of my professional background.
In our thinking on this and in the legislation put in place, we will seek to ensure that existing legal systems in the European Union are fully taken into account.
Mrs Patrie then asked me about the Green Paper.
She may have misunderstood what I said earlier, or I may not have expressed myself very well.
In bringing forward the paper at this time I did not intend any discourtesy to the House in not awaiting the opinion, but it was important for us to add further detail to the first proposal and give Parliament an opportunity to produce an even better opinion on our work in this area.
Finally, in response to Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I agree that there are problems in Germany and that there were delays.
One of the federal agencies in Germany knew about this for quite some time and failed to inform the federal authorities.
It was not just a question of the LÃ€nder knowing and failing to pass on information.
A federal agency had that information and failed to pass it on.
There is one other issue I have some small concern about, or maybe it is a serious concern.
Very often private laboratories have information on food safety issues.
Under confidentiality clauses, they fail to disclose this information to the relevant authorities.
We have resolved that to some extent with the food law that we passed here a couple of months ago, but unfortunately the requirement and the legal obligation for private laboratories to disclose relevant information to the public authorities will not become operational until 2005.
This is a problem.
It is something that has to be addressed by Member States, particularly those with a federal structure, to ensure that information available to private laboratories is made available to those who make public health decisions.
We are running 20 minutes late at the present time, Mr Staes, so I will not give the floor to anyone else.
The subject will not go away.
Sometimes Commissioners are very deft at making sure they do not fall into traps.
Sometimes they do fall into traps.
But I am sure that you, of all people, will find ways in which to maintain this subject on the agenda one way or another.
The debate is closed.
The next item is Question Time (B5-0252/2002). The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part I
Question No 3 by Paulo Casaca (H-0401/02):
Subject: Creation of European sugar-refining cartel with Community support
Article 81(1) of the Treaty prohibits cartels at European level, notably those having as their object the restriction or distortion of competition within the common market.
However, as the Court of Auditors' special report No 20/2000, Paragraph 91, points out, there is no true common market in the sugar sector, and competition between the various sugar-refining enterprises does not exist.
The suspicions raised by the Court of Auditors concerning the creation of an industry cartel with the endorsement of the European institutions are fully confirmed by the movements, or non-movements at international level, within the sugar and cane trade and by sugar prices on the European market.
The Commission's ban on the sending of sugar consignments to the EU by refineries which do not have agreements with the European cartel amounts to a substantial reinforcement of this cartel's power.
Can the Commission explain why its services responsible for competition have still not launched any kind of investigation - whether within the Commission or externally - into the European sugar cartel's long-standing and visible practices of dividing up the markets, price-fixing, and dumping on to territories where no controls apply?
Does the Commission not consider its own failure to act to be clearly in breach of the Treaty?
Mr President, contrary to the criticisms levelled at it by Mr Casaca, the Commission is confident that it has fully discharged its responsibilities in the sugar sector, which has been the subject of a number of proceedings regarding competition.
In this regard, the Commission would like to point out that, over almost 30 years, it has collected evidence for a number of cases relating to the sector and has imposed penalties for both cartels at European level and agreements at national level and abuses of dominant position.
All these decisions were subject to the control of the Court of Justice, which confirmed that they were fully justified.
In 2001, a fresh inquiry was opened following a claim, but the investigation did not yield proof of the alleged facts.
The sugar sector has, moreover, been the subject of specific inquiries in the context of the Regulation on the control of concentrations between undertakings.
On the other hand, as Mr Casaca is aware, over a year ago, the Commission presented an initial reform of the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector.
The objective of this reform was clearly to open the sector up further to competition.
However, the European Parliament and the Council rejected the Commission's proposals by a large majority.
Nevertheless, the Commission published a call for tenders for the performance of an external study on competition in the sugar sector and on the impact of the common organisation of the market in sugar.
The results of this study should be ready early in 2003.
Mr President, I am actually astonished to hear the Commission state that there is no cartel operating in the sugar sector.
Commissioner, we do not need studies, surveys or investigations.
I would simply ask you to pick up the telephone and claim to be the owner of a supermarket in your country, telephone another Member State, such as France, Germany or the United Kingdom, and say that you want to buy sugar.
Do this and see what answer you are given.
You will be told that there is no sugar, because the market is completely sewn up by a cartel, with the blessing of the Commission, which fiercely defends this cartel whenever it is under attack, as in the Autonomous Region of the Azores.
These are the facts.
None of your justifications appeared in the report by the Court of Auditors when it stated the same thing and in fact the Commission said only that this situation was due to the nature of the sector.
Mr President, allow me to recall the many occasions on which the Commission has intervened in the sugar sector.
Without claiming to be exhaustive, I should like to remind you that as early as the beginning of the 1970s the Commission adopted a decision penalising no less than sixteen companies for being in breach of Article 81 of the Treaty.
In 1988 the Commission penalised British Sugar for abuse of a dominant position; in 1997 the Commission also penalised Irish Sugar for abuse of a dominant position.
In 1998, the Commission penalised a price cartel on the British market in industrial sugar which had lasted for nearly four years.
In 2001, a complaint was submitted to the Commission stating that sugar producers in one Member State had collectively refused to sell.
Nevertheless, as I have just said, the investigation did not prove that there had been a coordinated refusal to sell.
All of the parties have been informed that proceedings have been closed and the complaint has been withdrawn.
Finally, I should also like to recall that the Commission pays particular attention to these problems when monitoring concentrations.
The Commission finds it regrettable that the European Parliament and the Council should - as I have just mentioned - have rejected the proposals it tabled more than a year ago by a large majority, proposals which specifically sought to introduce more competition in this market.
Question No 1 by Roy Perry (H-0387/02):
Subject: Extension of the 1993 Cable and Satellite Directive
To receive national TV channels by satellite outside their country of origin, it is necessary to obtain either an illegal decoder or a pirate card.
Does the Commission agree that the Cable and Satellite Directive 93/83/EEC
Mr President, the Commission is of the opinion that, within the internal market, citizens should be able to receive television services from other Member States.
It is therefore far from satisfactory that citizens should encounter difficulties in gaining access to programmes broadcast from other Member States via satellite.
Certain rules concerning copyright and rights related to copyright, applicable in particular to cross-border satellite broadcasting, are already laid down in Directive 93/83 in order to prevent certain difficulties.
Nonetheless, while preparing the reports on the application of that directive, the Commission has been informed of existing problems and has highlighted them in a document which should be submitted to Parliament before summer.
In that context, the Commission would inform the Member who has tabled this question that it is currently reviewing the various aspects of this issue.
Mr President, I was hoping to be able to congratulate Commissioner Bolkestein on a normally forthright reply, but I listened to that reply and I wonder what I have heard.
"The Commission is reviewing it."
I am asking the Commission, are they going to do anything about it?
We have a situation where we believe in the Single Market, where citizens move now in increasing numbers around the continent.
They would like to be able to watch French television in Germany; they would like to be able to watch British television if they retire to Spain.
The reality is that the Single Market is not working.
I would like to have just a glimmer of a more positive statement from the Commissioner that not only is he going to review this problem, but he is actually going to do something about it and make a positive proposal to the Parliament.
I agree with Mr Perry that the situation at present is highly unsatisfactory.
As far as the broadcasting of television programmes is concerned, the internal market does not exist.
The difficulty is that the possibilities for the Commission are restricted.
The sad fact remains that the directive I referred to earlier, which was adopted in 1993, does not give the Commission a sufficient legal basis for infringement proceedings which might have been available to the Commission if the legal situation had been different.
Therefore it is not open to the Commission to start the infringement proceedings that I am sure Mr Perry would consider desirable.
So all the Commission can do is carry out the study, which is nearing completion and will be submitted to Parliament as soon as it is ready - before the summer recess - so that Parliament can draw its own conclusions.
Mr Perry is completely right in expressing his serious dissatisfaction with the state of affairs.
The Commission lacks any legal basis for any infringement proceedings that Members of Parliament might want to undertake.
It is an unsatisfactory situation and the Commission is looking into the problem.
Its analysis will come before Parliament as soon as possible.
At the moment this is all I can say.
Obviously Mr Bolkestein is finding this a difficult one to square with his own principles of the Single Market, and I sympathise with him in that.
Clearly, Directive 93/83 is unsatisfactory.
Surely therefore the Commission can go back to the Treaty of Rome and the basis of the whole Community.
As I understand it, the Commission's role is to make sure that the Community operates as a community and in accordance with its founding treaties.
It should therefore work towards the Single Market by bringing forward a new directive which in fact implements the Single Market in television without frontiers.
Mr Purvis' reasoning is perfectly understandable and logical.
On the other hand, the Commission issued a document on better regulation last week.
The document, as Mr Purvis will know, prescribes a certain level of consultation, in particular as regards consultation with Parliament.
Consultation is best carried out if it is based on a paper that analyses the problem at hand, and that is precisely what the Commission is doing.
I do not want to contradict the wishes of Mr Purvis or any Member of Parliament for a more satisfactory legal basis.
Perhaps, indeed, it may be necessary to reach the same conclusion as Mr Purvis; but that conclusion should be based on a serious analysis, and my staff and I are engaged in that process.
I repeat that we hope to submit the analysis to Parliament before summer.
We are very grateful to Mr Perry for this question because Parliament has in numerous reports asked for a revision and for the Commission to do something about this.
We had a report on digital television where this same issue was raised.
I cannot say whose name this report bore, I am too humble for that.
So, there were a number of reports where we asked for that as well.
It is ironic that we have a directive called television without frontiers while the copyright and the rules on collection societies are preventing us from doing anything.
I would ask the Commissioner about this review and the study that he is going to undertake: are you also going to look at the differences in operation between cable and satellite that also exist in the directive and are also unsatisfactory?
In your report will you look at the role the collecting societies for the copyright owners are playing in this field which also prevents the functioning of the internal market?
May I remark that Mrs Thors is certainly not too humble to mention the title of any directive that she wishes to refer to.
As far as her question is concerned, may I assure her that the document which my services and I are now preparing will discuss all aspects which are germane to the problem, the problem being the lack of an internal market in the case of television.
Mrs Thors is quite right that whilst the directive is called tÃ©lÃ©vision sans frontiÃšres - television without frontiers - it does not provide this.
As I have already said to Mr Perry and Mr Purvis, it is a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs.
Question No 2 by John Joseph McCartin (H-0395/02):
Subject: Cattle growth hormones
In relation to the Commission's recent statement (IP/02/604) and press coverage on same ('new evidence of risk to humans from cattle growth hormones'), can the Commission state specifically what this new evidence shows and elaborate more fully on the type of health risk that could possibly arise, and does the Commission accept that, in the interests of transparency and credibility, the information they give to the public should be much more specific?
Would it also be true to state that the Commission has found no firm evidence of a specific risk to human health from the use of such hormones?
The EU Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health was asked to review its previous opinions of April 1999 and May 2000 in the light of any new information, including the results of the studies launched by the Commission.
In its opinion of 10 April 2002 the committee confirmed the risks posed by growth-promoting hormones to consumers that it had identified in its earlier opinions.
In particular the committee concluded in its 1999 opinion that for 17Ã-oestradiol there was a substantial body of evidence that it has to be considered as a complete carcinogen and that it exerts both tumour-initiating and tumour-promoting effects.
No safe threshold could be established for any of the six hormones evaluated, and prepubertal children are the group of greatest concern because of their extremely low levels of endogenous production of hormones.
It was also concluded in 1999 that the adverse effects included developmental, neurobiological, genotoxic and carcinogenic effects.
In saying that "no amendments to those opinions are justified", the scientists confirmed the validity of the previous opinions.
New evidence was reported on the disposition of esters of 17Ã-oestradiol and their accumulation in edible animal body fats.
This evidence needs to be considered in any exposure assessment as well as the consequences of the newly recognised, more complex metabolisms for synthetic hormones such as trenbolone, zeronol and melengestrol acetates.
The possible adverse effects on human health of these residual metabolites require further assessment.
Finally, recent evidence was noted regarding possible adverse environmental effects.
The Commission considers that its approach to consumer protection in this area is fully justified by scientific advice.
The Commission shares the honourable Member's views concerning the importance of transparency and credibility, which is why the committee's opinions are immediately published on the website of the Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection, together with other relevant information on this issue.
I tabled this question not out of concerns about health or trading issues but out of concern for the credibility of the European Commission.
I was in this Parliament when the ban was introduced originally and I voted for a minority report that was proposed by Professor Tom Raftery, an expert on all these matters.
He firmly believed that the motivation behind the proposal to ban these products was political.
As a German Member of Parliament told me: "Professor Raftery is right, but there is a wave of hysteria in Germany so I must vote against him".
I do not think that a wave of hysteria is sufficient grounds for legislation by the European Commission.
My understanding is that the Commission's position is not supported by the best scientific evidence from the United Nations, the United States, Canada, New Zealand or Australia.
These people are not noted for putting the health of their own citizens at risk, and they too base their policies on what they regard as sound scientific advice.
I want to ask the Commission if it agrees with me that in the present climate, when the European Commission is being put into a position of banning so many products and processes - even research itself in some instances - it is extremely important that what we do is seen to be soundly based and reliable.
To do anything else will undermine the long-term credibility of the European Commission.
I believe that we are doing that in this case.
I fully agree with the honourable Member's assessment of the situation in the sense that I believe that it is absolutely essential that the credibility of the Commission and of Parliament and of the institutions of the European Union be maintained in all respects, but particularly in this respect.
I fully agree with that.
However I have to say, at the risk of repeating myself, that the relevant scientific committee has looked at this now on three separate occasions.
They have furnished their opinions on those occasions, most recently within the last couple of months when they took into account the earlier opinions but also all the relevant up-to-date scientific opinion on this particular issue.
They have come to the conclusion that I have presented to you.
I have to say that when I am engaged in the exercise of risk management, I have to follow the advice of the risk assessors, I have to follow the advice of scientific evidence and scientific opinion.
If I fail to do that, or if any of us fails to do that, in my view we are completely lost.
We are then at sea without a compass.
That is why it is important for us to follow closely the advice that we are given.
And I have to reiterate this is the advice that we have been given and that is why we have followed it closely on this issue.
May I make one further point, while I am on my feet: We are at the moment bringing through legislation in relation to this issue which is in response to the opinion of the WTO some years ago where a particular infirmity was found with our position by the WTO.
That related to only one issue, and that was essentially a procedural issue.
That issue has now been addressed in the amending legislation that is before this House and no doubt it will be discussed by you, Mr McCartin, and indeed other Members when this piece of legislation comes before the House on second reading.
Commissioner, a moment ago, we failed to see eye to eye because I felt you were not answering my questions.
This time, however, I have to give you my unqualified support and say to Mr McCartin, who is usually such a congenial man who I work with very well, that the Commission does carry out very serious work in this area.
Following on from the dispute in the World Trade Organisation, the Commission has commissioned scientists to carry out sound work.
Seventeen studies have been submitted, and it is now beyond scientific doubt that the mutagen 17-beta-ostradiol is genotoxic and carcinogenic.
This is an argument in our dispute in the World Trade Organisation.
I would ask Mr McCartin not to cast any doubt, not even among farmers.
It is clear that the six hormones used in the United States are not as healthy as is claimed, and very much harm public health.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether you believe, based on the scientific information at your disposal, you now have sufficient arguments in order to finally settle the WTO dispute in favour of the European Union?
I thank Mr Staes for his support on that issue and I also thank him for his description of Mr McCartin as a friendly man, an opinion with which I would fully agree as a fellow countryman.
There is nothing much I can add to that, other than to say that the purpose of the legislation we are proceeding with at the moment is to bring us into conformity with the WTO ruling.
I do not wish to impose conditions on your questions, but I would remind you that this is Question Time and that you are entitled to argue, but this is not Statement Time.
Mr President, I just wanted to say that it should be announced that we have got on to Question No 2, as otherwise the Members in the House will not be aware that we have already moved on.
Question No 4 by Francisca Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco (H-0403/02):
Subject: Court case in Equatorial Guinea against leaders of the democratic opposition
On 23 May a court case opens in Equatorial Guinea, without the minimum legal guarantees befitting a constitutional state, against various leaders of the democratic opposition, including PlÃ¡cido MicÃ³, the leader of Convergencia para la Democracia Social (Social Democrat Alliance); one of the lawyers representing the accused is under house arrest.
This court case yet again demonstrates the lack of any will on the part of the rÃ©gime to meet the commitments given to the international community, including the EU, that it would begin the transition to democracy.
In view of Article 5 of the LomÃ© Convention and Article 9 of the Cotonu Agreement, has the Commission provided for any measures to penalise the continuing rejection of democracy by the regime in Equatorial Guinea?
The Commission and the Member States on the ground have closely monitored the recent trials in Equatorial Guinea and are deeply concerned at the procedural irregularities they observed.
The EU has called on the relevant Guinean authorities to take the necessary measures to have the sentences reviewed to ensure that the fundamental rights of the accused are respected.
As regards cooperation, following a period of suspension from 1992 to 1997 the Commission signed the national indicative programme for the eighth EDF in July 2000.
The only project approved to date is aimed at supporting democracy, human rights and good governance.
However, it has not yet begun.
The eighth EDF programme specifically provides that the release of other funds devoted to water and sanitation will be conditional upon a positive evaluation of the human rights situation in the country.
The Commission can therefore take measures without resorting to Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Mr President, many thanks for the answer given by the Commissioner, which stated that irregularities have indeed taken place.
I would say that what we have seen are more than irregularities: the trial was a farce and should be declared null and void.
As the Commissioner knows very well, thanks to the media and to the international observers, the witnesses arrived having been tortured the day before and the trial ended with the leaders of the democratic opposition being sentenced to twenty years in prison.
By acting in this way, the Government of Equatorial Guinea has proven that it fails to meet the minimum requirements of democracy and good governance.
The President of the European Council made a fine statement yesterday expressing his concern, but I do not think this will be enough. What is needed is for tangible measures to be taken; the President of that country cannot be allowed to continue travelling freely in Europe.
I would, therefore, like the Commissioner to tell me what tangible actions the Commission foresees taking apart from those he has already mentioned.
I note what the honourable Member has said in her supplementary question.
In particular I am aware that my colleague, Mr Nielson, who is the lead Commissioner on this matter, will fully take into account the issue she has raised.
Mr President, Commissioner, when Mr Obiang, the President of Equatorial Guinea, visited Brussels two years ago and met President Prodi, he gave him commitments to democratisation and to respect human rights, commitments which have been blatantly flouted, something made crystal clear by the trial - if it can be called a trial - that has just taken place.
Furthermore, it is also true that the European Union, only a few months ago, voted in the United Nations Human Rights Commission for a Resolution stating that the regime in Equatorial Guinea was taking steps towards democracy and towards respecting human rights.
I think that what has happened clearly shows that the commitments Mr Obiang gave to Mr Prodi have not been met.
And the issue is this: is Mr Prodi - as President of the Commission - going to speak to Mr Obiang - as President of Equatorial Guinea - to demand explanations as to the degree to which those commitments are being complied with in view of this trial - I repeat, if it can be called a trial - that has taken place?
I know that contact has been made with the government in question.
Views have been expressed and opinions imparted to them so that the government there is in no doubt as to the views of the European Union relating to this issue.
Before proceeding to the next question and because I share Mr RÃŒbig's concern, I must clearly state that the corresponding questions do not appear on the screen because the system has broken down.
Members who are now in their offices and who wish to follow this debate should take this into account and come down into the hemicycle.
Question No 5 by Jorge Salvador HernÃ¡ndez Mollar (H-0404/02):
Subject: Illegal immigration to the EU from Morocco
The Association Agreement with Morocco includes among its areas for priority action the need for dialogue to deal with illegal immigration and the conditions of return and the need to reduce migratory pressure.
The 'action plan for asylum and migration' for Morocco emphasises that Morocco's failure to require visas of emigrants crossing its territory facilitates the entry of illegal immigrants into the EU and makes returning them difficult since proofs cannot be supplied.
On 18 September 2000, the General Affairs Council mandated the Commission to negotiate a general EU-Morocco agreement on the return of immigrants.
Can the Commission state what initiatives for dialogue are under way under the Association Agreement?
Does it consider it possible to use financial cooperation with Morocco as a lever for ensuring compliance with Title VI of the Agreement?
Does it believe that pressure can be put in the immediate future on Morocco to make visas compulsory for third-country nationals, as a means of preventing irregular entry into the EU?
Can it provide information on the state of play as regards negotiation of the above-mentioned agreement on the return of immigrants?
Can the Commission take steps to ensure that the Member States and the European Parliament are kept informed, now and in the future and on a regular basis, on the progress of the negotiations?
Part II
As you can see: at the fifty-fifth minute of this Question Time we are on Question 5 and the honourable Member has asked five distinct questions in his question.
I shall respond to them all.
On question 1, in the framework of the agreement the parties have established a working group on migration and social affairs.
It has met twice so far and migration issues have been discussed in three categories: socio-economic development, support for legal migration and combating illegal migration.
A series of informal thematic meetings on specific issues in these categories is anticipated this year and next year.
In addition, a dialogue to prepare the MEDA-funded projects related to migration has been established.
On question 2, the Commission continually monitors the implementation of projects and programmes to ensure fulfilment of the said objectives.
The dialogue on migration is making good progress and there are no indications that cooperation will not sustain progress in future.
The Commission will of course take the satisfactory implementation of the association agreement into account when it decides on the allocation of future funds.
On question 3, the introduction of visas for third country nationals is a measure that the Moroccan authorities will need to consider.
We can discuss that in the dialogue under the association agreement.
If a visa system did help to curb the influx of illegal migrants through Morocco's southern and eastern borders the Commission could look favourably at supporting Moroccan initiatives for introducing such arrangements.
On question 4, in September 2000 the Council approved negotiating directives for a Community re-admission agreement with Morocco.
After several high-level meetings last year, the Moroccans eventually agreed to enter into an informal dialogue on re-admission.
The Commission has suggested formal negotiations being launched before the end of next month.
Finally, on question 5, whenever the Commission is authorised or mandated by the Council to negotiate a Community re-admission agreement with a third country it conducts negotiations in accordance with the relevant directives and in full compliance with the procedures set down in Article 300 of the Treaty.
That makes provision for Parliament to be comprehensively informed about, and consulted on, the final outcome of negotiations.
In addition, of course, the Commission is manifestly ready to inform the relevant parliamentary committees whenever it is invited to do so.
Commissioner, I am grateful for your answer but I want to say this: in the last five-year period, 4 000 Moroccan and sub-Saharan immigrants have died in the waters of the Straits of Gibraltar and off the coasts of the Canary Islands and, unfortunately hundreds of Moroccan minors crossing borders into the Spanish towns of Ceuta and Melilla are causing reception centres to overflow and have furthermore been committing serious attacks on the employees of those centres.
I feel, Commissioner, that Morocco must shoulder its responsibilities and these facts prove that it is not fulfilling its duties.
I therefore ask you again, Commissioner, do you not think, given the gravity of this situation, that the current financial framework of aid to Morocco should be made dependent on its fulfilling its obligations in the field of immigration and of the control of its borders with the European Union?
I am grateful to the honourable Member as he points out the consequences of efforts to reach the continent of Europe are often terribly tragic, involving large numbers of casualties and deaths.
The pressures on the system in Spain and other countries are self-evident.
There is, however, a dilemma in seeking to use a financial framework for the purposes of moving the Moroccan authorities more in the direction that the honourable Member would want.
I am sure he is conscious of that dilemma and aware that any risk or threat to financial support could weaken the system even further, and that would simply exacerbate the problem we are dealing with.
I can reassure him that the Commission is very actively engaged in trying to ensure that the best standards are set and maintained and will use all its endeavours to that end.
Mr President, with the association agreement that is currently being negotiated with Morocco, this is now the time when this issue is beginning to gather strength and when the agricultural concessions that will be granted are to be discussed.
European farmers are extremely concerned at the negotiating proposal that is being planned by the European Commission or which, at least, has been announced in the press.
The Commission appears to prefer to negotiate over the export of cereals, milk, meat and oilseed rather than to go for a 5% annual increase, but is echoing Morocco's calls to reach 217 000 tonnes of the tomato quota, which is something that really concerns European farmers, especially all fruit and vegetable growers.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether what has been written in the press is true or whether the Commission's idea is that this burden of proof should be divided equally among all European countries and that it should not always be the farming sector that foots the bill for the association agreement being negotiated with Morocco.
I have the feeling, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, that we are talking about illegal immigration.
I am not going to interfere, however.
The Commissioner is, of course, entitled to answer the question if he wishes.
As you point out, Mr President, the question raised by the honourable Member is not the question that has been tabled.
I can assure her, however, that there is no sphere in which the Commission will act irresponsibly.
We strive to ensure that there is effective burden-sharing, but I am mindful of the fact that we are counselled continually by those who are expert in this field that a more liberal attitude towards the purchase of goods from Third World countries would do more to stimulate world trade and conquer poverty, and thereby stem immigration, than possibly any other measure.
Mr President, the question actually referred to illegal immigration but, in this context, I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he sees that immigration is the other side of the coin of development and whether he understands that we are talking about many illegal immigrants who come from Morocco and from throughout northern Africa.
How can we accept the contradiction that the MEDA Programme has been shrinking in the current three-year period and that the reduction in the preliminary draft budget for 2003 is quite drastic - 470% less in real terms?
Does the Commissioner not see that this is crazy and that in order to combat this illegal immigration we have to undertake development programmes on the other side of the Mediterranean?
The honourable Member is right to indicate that the spur for migration - indeed including legal migration - is frequently poverty and the sense of hopelessness about the future that makes people desperate enough to uproot themselves and to seek to move to countries with which they have no familiarity either in terms of language or custom.
It is true to say that development policies must be partly geared to trying to combat poverty to provide people with a workable, reasonable alternative to moving themselves and their families to other parts of the world.
It is important, however, that when the Community allocates funds for trying to combat poverty and provide the basis for sustainable development, those funds are fully and effectively spent.
Upon examination, what the honourable Member will see is not any meanness or narrowness in the attitude taken to the MEDA programme.
On the contrary, the attitude towards financing the MEDA programme has much more to do with a desire to ensure efficient, value-for-money spending with proper, generous effects for the people who should be the recipients of such development support, rather than simply having figures on a budget which can look impressive but have less impressive consequences.
Question No 6 by Christopher Heaton-Harris (H-0431/02):
Subject: The Berlaymont Building
What are the latest developments in negotiations between the European Commission and the Belgian Government over the renovations to the Berlaymont Building?
What are the current projected costs?
When does the Commission expect, if ever, to reoccupy the building?
Will the Commission forward the cost-benefit analysis of the Berlaymont project to the European Parliament?
Does the Commission feel that European and Belgian taxpayers are receiving proper value for money?
Is the Commission satisfied with the quality and efficiency of the work being carried out on the Berlaymont Building?
Mr Heaton-Harris has put six distinct questions.
I will answer them all, but it will unfortunately take a few minutes.
The first question: firstly, in the memorandum of understanding signed by the Belgian Minister Mr Rik Dams and me on behalf of the Commission on 17 July 2001, it was anticipated that the negotiations on the Berlaymont should be concluded by the end of December 2001.
However, on 14 December, I was informed by the minister that Belgium would not be ready to discuss financial questions until February because he was expecting the outcome of relevant audits.
The audit reports eventually became available to him in March and intensive negotiations then started.
Since then, the positions of the Belgian Government and the Commission have become closer, but we have not yet reached final agreement on the price that the Commission would be willing to pay or on legal guarantees which are required by the Commission.
Negotiations are therefore continuing.
I will take questions 2 and 3 together.
The Belgian authorities have confirmed that the current estimated costs of the basic renovated building are EUR 605 million and the Government has confirmed its intention to make the building fit for reoccupation by 31 December 2003.
The history of this project means, however, that the Commission considers that certainty about the realistic hand-over date can only be established when a specific date has been fixed in a contract that will also make provision for financial penalties for late delivery.
Question 4: Before the Commission enters into a binding contract with the Belgian Government, we will naturally provide the budgetary authority with an analysis of the outcome of the negotiations held with the Belgian government.
As I have indicated on several occasions, the Commission's negotiating position is based on an independent analysis of the total cost as well as on those costs that are due to the numerous delays encountered in the renovation project.
Question 5: I can confirm that throughout all the discussions and activities related to the Berlaymont question, the Commission has been motivated by the absolute need to ensure value for money in the use of Community funds.
That will continue to be a major pre-condition for a satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations with Belgium.
Finally, question 6: The technical description of the building will be legally binding and there will be legal guarantees for the quality delivered.
By these means, we will ensure that the final product satisfies high standards of quality.
As regards efficiency, the Commission has made it very clear that we are deeply dissatisfied with the fact that the original deadline was not respected and, even more importantly, that it has changed on numerous occasions.
As I have said to Parliament and to the Belgian Government, I believe that many of the difficulties encountered in this project are due to serious management problems that originated with the management structure of Berlaymont 2000.
I have a couple of supplementary questions.
In principle is the Commission absolutely committed to reoccupying the Berlaymont building?
If not, when do you believe the final decision will be taken within the college of the Commission?
Is there any sort of timetable within the Commission for looking at these procedures?
How will the final cost of EUR 605 million be borne within the European budget?
I am grateful to the honourable Member because he provides me with an opportunity to further spell out the Commission's approach.
The EUR 605 million is what the negotiations are all about, so I am not yet in a position to be able to say to him whether that overall price is satisfactory to us, whether it meets the needs we have or what our eventual position following the conclusion of negotiations will be about that price.
As far as the final decision in the College is concerned, that too is dependent on the satisfactory outcome of negotiations; and I have specified the fundamental considerations there.
The price, if we are to reoccupy the Berlaymont, has to be satisfactory; the quality has to be acceptable; there have to be legal guarantees; and these are preconditions for our eventual reoccupation of the Berlaymont.
Until those conditions are satisfied, I cannot specify a date for a final decision in the College.
I hope that it will not be long delayed.
It is in nobody's interest for the existing uncertainty to be continued.
I have, then, virtually answered the first question as to whether we are absolutely committed to reoccupying the renovated building.
It is our preference to do so for a large number of reasons, not least the fact that possession of the building in something like 27 years would give us a very valuable piece of real estate in an extremely intensively developed part of Brussels.
We are also aware that the logistical convenience of the Commission would be served by being able to reoccupy that building, but we will not reoccupy under any conditions; and therefore it is crucial that if we are to consider, finally, reoccupation of the Berlaymont Building, we are confident that the requirements relating to price and value, which we have made very clear throughout, are satisfied.
I would like Mr Kinnock to elaborate on his last answer and just to confirm, in the light of the very extensive organisational reforms, and all that is implied in some of the changes of responsibility, out-sourcing, and the new technology, whether he is really satisfied that the Berlaymont is going to be the appropriate home for the new re-focused Commission.
Alongside that, I wonder if I might invite him, given that yesterday this Parliament finally received formally the package for the reform of the Staff Regulations, to say what his expectations are in terms of our scrutiny of this very important package given that it is of course tied in with a number of important considerations, such as the pay package, 'le mÃ©thode', and what he would like to see the Parliament do in terms of timing and other work on this important package.
I am grateful, as ever, to Mr Harbour for illuminating questions.
On the second point, I should like to take this opportunity of saying what I told the Bureau of Parliament earlier today, and I have said it to many parliamentarians: the package of proposed reforms of the Staff Regulations are now before Parliament and the Council.
Everyone's interests would be served - in particular Parliament's interests - if it were possible for Parliament to arrive at its opinion this year, simply because that would then facilitate consideration of any revisions that Parliament proposed or any opinions that it presented.
Consideration of those features could then take place properly in the early months of 2003.
If we receive Parliament's opinion late, then that, obviously, would put pressure on the time available for the proper consideration of Parliament's opinion.
On the first question, we believe that a properly equipped modern facility Berlaymont would, at the right price, be an appropriate home for the European Commission.
There is no doubt about that.
Certainly, with the additional pressures that are coming with an unprecedented enlargement, that emphasises the case.
However desirable and however appropriate the Berlaymont is - and we have made that clear throughout - the acceptability of the Berlaymont is conditional upon the satisfaction of standards of quality and the negotiation and conclusion on a reasonable price.
Until those conditions are satisfied, we cannot conclusively say that we would definitely go back into the Berlaymont, however desirable it may be in terms of location and facility.
Thank you very much for your cooperation, Commissioner.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
Mr President, it is a real procedural motion this time.
By this, I mean that some MEPs, myself included at times, take advantage of this possibility, but this is a real procedural motion.
I am a loyal customer of question time.
I therefore prepare my questions.
I knew that Mr Kinnock would be present, and I therefore asked Mr Kinnock a very specific question.
This is question No 18 about language use in the European institutions.
The services of Parliament have included this question in the third section, that is, the second question in the third section, although it was an explicit question for Mr Kinnock.
I do not understand this.
I will now only receive a written reply, while I might have wanted to ask Mr Kinnock additional questions.
Can you explain to me how the procedure worked in this case, and why a question addressed to Mr Kinnock still ends up in the third section?
I take very good note of your comments, but as you know, and as laid down in the Rules of Procedure, it is the President, together with his cabinet, who sets the order and the allocation of questions to the Commission, and the Commission decides which question each Commissioner shall answer.
Your question has been scheduled for the end of the day, in the third part, which is certain to be answered in writing.
These are the provisions laid down in the Rules of Procedure and we will not be entering into a debate on the matter.
This is how things stand.
As the author is not present, Questions No 7 lapses.
Question No 8 by Pat the Cope Gallagher (H-0383/02), which has been taken over by Mr Crowley:
Subject: Measures to boost the European tourism industry
Following the recent informal meeting of tourism ministers and the stakeholders' seminar organised by the Spanish Presidency, can the Commission indicate what concrete measures it will propose to boost the European tourist industry, given the particular importance of the industry and job-creation potential within regions which, because of their peripheral location, have few other generators of economic growth and prosperity?
In its Communication "Working together for the future of European Tourism", the Commission proposed an operational framework with the aim of strengthening European tourism.
This Communication and the Parliament resolution on European tourism, and the Council Resolution on the future of European tourism, provide the basis for concrete measures to be undertaken.
But first of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its high involvement in promoting tourism as is shown by this question from the honourable Member.
Recently, just in May, we had an opportunity to debate tourism, when the European Parliament adopted the report of Ms Torres Marques.
The resolution supports our proposals and encourages us to implement and follow them up carefully.
Let me now turn to some of the concrete measures which will be taken.
The main objective is to incorporate tourism in Community policies and measures favouring an integrated approach.
We need to improve cooperation between tourism stakeholders, notably social partners, including an annual European Tourism Forum.
We will organise this forum for the first time in December this year in Brussels.
We want to promote stakeholder access to Community instruments, involving also local authorities and the private sector.
We are mobilising existing survey, analysis, competence and support centres for the development of knowledge and observation regarding tourism.
This has been a major request by the European Parliament.
More specifically, we will look at Tourism Satellite Accounts to measure the economic impact of tourism, and on a European Agenda 21 for tourism to promote the sustainable development of tourism.
Finally, we need to strengthen the position and image of Europe as a diverse and attractive set of destinations.
This was a major discussion point at the informal meeting of the tourism ministers, to which the honourable Member refers in his question.
These measures benefit all types of regions in Europe, also those with a peripheral location.
A considerable share of Structural Funds made available to the Member States supports tourism, both directly and indirectly.
Less densely-populated, rural or peripheral regions can therefore make good use of the possibility offered in this context to create jobs and to generate economic growth.
For the mainstream programmes which represent over 90 % of the financial envelope available in the Structural Funds, the Commission has set clear guidelines which explicitly encourage the support of a balanced and sustainable development of tourism, in particular through three activities:
Firstly, the modernisation of tourism-related infrastructures and the improvement of their efficiency;
Secondly, upgrading skills and professional profiles in order to respond better to the expectations of tourists and the needs of the industry;
Thirdly, encouraging business-to-business partnerships, public-private cooperation and networking in order to improve the integration of the different services involved in the 'tourism chain?.
In the context of the diversification of activities in rural areas, there are also funds allocated in the framework of Rural Development Programmes by the European Agriculture Guarantee and Guidance Funds.
These measures try to improve the attractiveness of the villages and rural areas, protecting nature and historical and cultural heritage.
Tourism related measures are also financed with the Funds allocated to the Community Initiative LEADER+ improving the quality of life of the rural areas.
In conclusion, tourism development should be carefully planned so as to take into consideration the carrying capacity of the site with regard to environmental, social and economic impacts.
I should like to thank the Commissioner for his response to the question.
I have three follow-up points in relation to what you have said.
Firstly, with regard to sustainable tourism, obviously tourism is best dealt with where you have human populations.
Therefore maintaining people in rural areas and in peripheral areas of the European Union is a better way of encouraging more tourism to those areas.
On that particular point, would a proposal with regard to the worldwide marketing of the European Union as a tourist destination be considered - not necessarily funded or put in place, but just considered?
Secondly, can we utilise already existing airline hubs to ensure that peripheral areas can be serviced into those areas as well?
The European Commission has already given approval for marketing support to small regional airports because of their importance in creating tourism and economic development.
There is a necessity and an urgency with regard to ensuring that those people who make investments in the tourism product and the tourism area are given the necessary back-up marketing and structural supports from the European Union programmes, which are sometimes denied them because they have already made capital investments themselves.
In reply to the honourable Member, I would say this: first of all, we discussed in a ministerial meeting - and since that we have included in the Europe Action Plan 2005 - a possibility to create a European-wide portal which would provide easy access to all European destinations.
If this were to be done as a project between the Member States, of course according to their choice, these kinds of peripheral, lesser-known but exciting areas would be better marketed.
Secondly, I agree with you that in those areas where there is a rural population it is easier to guarantee sustainable development.
If the marketing is well done there are a lot of tourists who will chose these types of destinations.
But it is difficult for companies to reach rural populations.
Concentrated Internet marketing would be the cheapest way.
Finally, on the investment issue, I should know more of the details of the fund which the Member is talking about.
I am sure that we can come back to this issue later.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to ask the Commissioner what he will do to get the effects of Basle II to promote tourism enterprises?
The present situation is that tourism enterprises do not, as a rule, have equity capital, are financed in the long term, and rating is too expensive for them.
In the Budget guidelines, Parliament proposed the drawing up of an action plan, quite simply in order to avoid mass bankruptcies and a great increase in unemployment in this sector.
As far as Basle II is concerned, thanks to the great attention paid to this issue by Parliament - and Mr RÃŒbig in particular - the Commission is carefully following and participating in the preparations.
Before any decisions are made, we will have open consultation with all the stakeholders so that nobody will be taken by surprise.
The interests of European SMEs have indeed been communicated for inclusion in that preparatory work.
I fully agree with you that SMEs in general and tourism enterprises in particular, which often do not have much equity capital, are most vulnerable if borrowing or lending become too tight.
We need to pay particular attention to that.
The problem is that real banking activities are run in Member States by private financial institutions.
Our scope is therefore limited.
Question No 9 by Astrid Thors (H-0449/02):
Subject: Migration to an open API
How does the Commission intend to encourage and organise migration from existing APIs to a single open API in the following months?
How does the Commission intend to organise the dialogue on such migration?
Will the Commission restrict this dialogue only to industry and technical experts, or is it willing to open this dialogue also to consumer groups and members of the European Parliament?
The honourable Member's question concerning migration to an open API for application programs is about operational compatibility for interactive TV services.
There are three parts to the question.
First part: How does the Commission intend to promote and organise migration from existing APIs to a single API?
The provisions of Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) includes a legal requirement for the Member States to promote transparency when it comes to making APIs available for application programs.
The provisions do not include a requirement for any particular API technology or a single API.
The standard for multimedia home platforms (or MHPs) fulfils the requirements for operational compatibility and transparency in this area.
We are therefore encouraging industry to introduce this standard voluntarily.
The MHP standard will be included in the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in accordance with the directive.
The Member States are responsible for encouraging use of the standards included in the list.
We anticipate the list's being published this autumn.
According to the directive, the Member States must also carry out a review of operational compatibility and user options before July 2004.
The directive contains a procedure for making use of a standard compulsory.
That is one of the issues which will be addressed in the proposed review.
The second part of the question is as follows: How does the Commission intend to organise the dialogue in connection with such a migration?
The Information Society Directorate-General has initiated a dialogue with industry on operational compatibility for interactive TV services.
Operational compatibility has been set up as the most important objective, and standardisation is part of the solution.
There is a lack of agreement within industry as to what operational compatibility actually involves.
We have therefore taken measures to give some impetus to the dialogue.
First of all, we have asked the Digital Video Broadcasting (or DVB) Group to investigate the technical operational compatibility of interactive services.
Secondly, we have begun an investigation of the strategic aspects of operational compatibility so as to have access to an independent analysis later this year.
Consumer issues are among those covered by the analysis.
Finally, we have asked the standardisation body, CENELEC, to carry out a preliminary investigation of the standardisation of digital TV and interactive TV services.
Their brief will be to analyse the present technical position and come up with recommendations.
The third part of the question concerns whether the Commission will restrict the dialogue exclusively to industry and have it cover only technical aspects. In fact, it is also willing to open the dialogue to consumer groups and Members of the European Parliament.
I am very well disposed to participation by MEPs and consumer groups.
The dialogue must, however, have a stable technical basis, and that is what we are at present concentrating upon.
The political debate must be preceded by careful investigations of issues such as operational compatibility.
The decision makers must understand what alternatives there are and what the consequences of these would be.
It is a process which shows that the Commission is following up the commitment it made in the December plenary.
The Commissioner is right in saying that the decision makers should ideally understand what they are talking about.
That is something on which we completely agree.
I am also pleased that you indicated the timetable for publication of the standard.
If, however, we look at developments in Europe and at the almost daily contributions to Finnish newspapers too, there is a prevailing uncertainty - even in Finland, as one of the countries to have signed a memorandum of understanding - as to whether the same standard will be used by cable, satellite and terrestrial operators.
The question, therefore, is: Does the Commissioner think that 2004 is adequate as a deadline?
In fact, we are in something of a 'chicken and egg' situation where developments within digital TV are concerned.
May I ask the Commissioner if the issue of digital TV is in some way to be touched upon again before Seville?
I want to give two answers.
Where the Seville Summit is concerned, digital TV will be included in the Europe 2005 action plan.
I personally believe that digital television will play a major role in the information society in the longer term because the Internet must also be available via television if we really want the whole population to use it.
In December, we decided that industry should be given a year in which to adapt, once the directive had entered into force, and we must keep to that commitment.
I very much appreciate, however, that we perhaps must do more in the course of time to guarantee that everyone who participates in the process is aware that, if a solution does not come about on a voluntary basis, the Commission has a mandate to act.
Question No 10 by Gary Titley (H-0450/02):
Subject: Regulatory impact assessments of SMEs
The European Commission's Communication on the creation of an interinstitutional network to develop instruments of impact assessment is most welcome.
Indeed, attempts to achieve better regulation will only be successful when the European institutions cooperate.
Since the Parliament enjoys the power of codecision in many business-related domains and MEPs' votes therefore have a direct impact on the regulation, how is the Commission planning to take forward its proposals and what concrete plans has it to involve the European Parliament in its strategy?
The Better Regulation package that the Commission adopted last week sets out a number of fundamental principles that will be followed in future policy and legislative proposals.
In particular, it establishes that all the Commission's proposals presented in the Annual Policy Strategy and later in the Work Programme will undergo a proportionate integrated impact assessment and that all departments will follow uniform minimum standards on consultation.
Briefly, it aims at more transparent, efficient and cost-effective lawmaking.
Such tools should significantly contribute to improving the quality and coherence of policy design by the European institutions.
A strong and solid knowledge base for policy making is crucial if the European institutions are to improve the regulatory environment.
The challenge is to ensure a high level of protection for European citizens in sensitive areas such as the environment, health and consumer protection, while avoiding over-regulation, which damages growth and employment prospects.
However, to meet our common objective of simplifying the Union's legislative environment, in particular for European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), there is a need to increase interinstitutional cooperation, including cooperation on impact assessments by Parliament and the Council.
The Commission has been calling for this, proposing that a permanent interinstitutional mechanism be created to implement its Action Plan, in order to ensure the quality of legislation.
In addition, during his presentation of the Better Regulation package to the Conference of Presidents at Parliament on 5 June, President Prodi renewed the appeal for an interinstitutional agreement on some of the proposed actions.
Hopefully, progress will soon be achieved.
Encouraging discussions have already started between the three institutions.
In formally adopting new tools for impact analysis and consultation, the Commission also wants to promote a new culture of transparency, participation and challenge.
All parties concerned by its proposals will be invited to contribute with their views and expertise.
Parliament has a crucial role to play in this process of cultural change.
I welcome Commissioner Liikanen's statement and his communication, which is a major step forward.
Could the Commissioner tell me if, as part of the impact assessment that the Commission will be carrying out, there will be a rigorous cost/benefit analysis of the Commission's proposal, taking into account all factors?
Secondly, given that the Commission proposes to do this before making proposals which then go before the Council and Parliament, how does it envisage following the amendments being made by the Council and Parliament to ensure that there is an impact assessment of those amendments?
I recognise that what he has done is lay down the gauntlet to Parliament to get its act together on carrying out assessments of its own amendments.
Far too often Parliament passes amendments on important legislation with no consideration for its impact.
I hope the Commission will be able to work with Parliament and the Council in order to ensure an on-going process.
As far as this impact assessment on the business side is concerned, we are very advanced.
We had a two-year project to consolidate methodology on business impact assessments, we have organised a public hearing and consultation on that and I am happy to give all this information to the honourable Member.
So it is well advanced and I hope that by the end of the year we will be in the phase that all the new major proposals will go through this kind of profound assessment.
As to the role of the other institutions, in the spirit of open and transparent legislation it will be important that the Parliament and the Council also include the same logic.
That is not for the Commission to decide.
If the Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree on the principles, the Commission's impact assessment already must have analysed different parameters and that information will be available and helpful to assess the amendments.
If any further work needs to be done, I am sure the Commission is very willing to cooperate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the following assessment is of great and special importance for us, as bankruptcies have gone up over the past year by an average of 19% in the European Union, and in Germany by 32%.
As regards the impact assessment, Commissioner, will you now have it worked out in the planned Green Paper on entrepreneurship, what European legislation has contributed to it and what can be done so that there are fewer bankruptcies in future?
I agree that it is important to have fewer bankruptcies, but this paper on entrepreneurship is intended to be a more basic analysis of the entrepreneurship dilemma in Europe: why are entrepreneurs so respected and appreciated and yet so few people want to become entrepreneurs?
The second problem is that those who want to become entrepreneurs want to stay manager-owners but do not want to grow.
Why are so few prepared to take risks?
We will analyse that in the broader sense but without neglecting Mr RÃŒbig's point of view.
I would also like to compliment Mr Liikanen on the work that he has done on business impact assessment.
I would like to press him a bit further, first of all, on the timing about when he expects this consistent methodology to be working throughout the directorates of the entire Commission.
Secondly; does he feel that there is a need for some independent assessment?
Might there be a danger that the impact assessments being done by the directorates-general themselves would perhaps be a little too favourable towards the proposals?
Thirdly, would he agree with me that the logic followed through by my colleague Mr Titley, is that we really ought to be thinking in terms of having an independent regulatory assessment unit operating institutionally, which would provide a true external verification on impact assessment for all the European institutions?
On the first question, the commitment of the Commission is to start impact assessment gradually from the beginning of next year for all major proposals.
That is a commitment for the whole Commission.
I am sure the President will ensure that all the Directorates General will follow that.
I agree that an independent view on the assessment is a very valid one.
When discussions take place between institutions, that is a good question to raise in that context.
The Commission has no final view on that matter.
I am ready to pass this question to my colleagues.
I am sure that you will also discuss it in your context.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
Mr President, on a point of order, it was a big disappointment that President Prodi did not present his reform package on regulation to a Conference of Presidents open to all Members.
Could you transmit this back to President Cox to say that many of us felt that as it was such an important announcement we should all have been involved in that announcement.
I am sure the Commission would have benefited from that.
We take good note of your comments.
We thank Mr Liikanen.
Questions to Commissioner De Palacio
Question No 12 by Joachim Wuermeling (H-0364/02), which has been taken over by Mrs MÃŒller:
Subject: Dramatic increase in east-west traffic
Heavy goods traffic between the European Union and the candidate countries is increasing steadily owing to growth in trade.
In the last five years, for instance, the number of lorries passing through customs clearance at border crossings between the Czech Republic and Bavaria has risen by 50%.
What further increase in road freight traffic is the Commission expecting in the next few years, in particular after accession?
Are Member States' road-building plans sufficient to accommodate the additional volume of traffic?
What action is the Commission taking to prevent bottlenecks that are emerging?
Mr President, the White Paper on European transport policy lays down that, unless new and wide-ranging initiatives are adopted, by 2010 traffic from heavy goods vehicles will increase by between 40% and 50% in comparison to its 1998 levels.
Experience suggests that the growth of transport, especially in border regions, will speed up as a result of enlargement.
In the aim of dealing with the bottlenecks caused by this situation, the White Paper puts forward a policy designed to ensure a return to balance between the various forms of transport.
It is appropriate that a considerable part of this growth in transport should take place in infrastructures other than roads, such as the railways, inland waterways or maritime transport.
The broad aim of the Commission proposal revising the decision on the guidelines for the trans-European transport network is to reduce bottlenecks.
In this context, the Commission has proposed adding a set of links to the applicant countries.
In order to improve East-West corridors, it has also proposed two new priority projects, which are: the combined transport project, the high-speed Stuttgart-Vienna rail link and the project to improve the Danube between Vilshoffen and Straubin.
Furthermore, the Commission has proposed amending the Regulation laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks, increasing the upper limits for cofinancing, from the current 10% to 20%, of investment costs, in exceptional cases, including projects carried out at borders with candidate countries.
The Commission intends to carry out a broader review of all the trans-European networks in 2004, bearing in mind the new shape of the European Union, in other words, the shape arising from enlargement.
With regard to the transport of goods by rail we have already presented, not only the first rail package that was adopted a year and a half ago, but also the second rail package that is intended, precisely, to boost the rail transport of goods, producing a railway fit for the twenty-first century, which is dynamic, competitive with roads, geared towards the customer and which, consequently, provides a high-quality service.
I hope that the work in this Parliament and in the Council of Ministers will enable us soon to give the green light to these extremely important measures.
Lastly, in the field of logistics, thanks to the new Marco Polo project, designed to promote interoperability and to subsidise the development of alternatives to road transport, companies in the candidate countries will be able to obtain economic aid if they make their request for it in conjunction with a European Union company.
Thank you, Commissioner, for giving such comprehensive information.
Mr Wuermeling and I are generally concerned about this as, in the border regions from which we come, the increase in the volume of traffic is not merely between 40% and 50%, but in excess of that figure.
People living along the main roads in border areas have to cope with traffic jams, noise and gas emissions.
When they travel to work, they constantly do so trailing behind HGVs from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
As a supplementary question, I would like to ask, as you have mentioned that railways are to receive special support, whether, in the meantime, measures have been taken or supported to transfer freight from road to rail in border regions, and whether you have had discussions about this with the German railways.
That is my supplementary question.
Clearly, the increase in traffic will indeed be highly concentrated in border areas and for this very reason, we are promoting, through various projects, a return to rail goods transport in the fifteen current Member States of the European Union and also the maintenance of railways as a mode of transport in the candidate countries.
In other words, even with the pre-accession funds, we are trying to ensure that the candidate countries do not dump their transport onto the roads and that they maintain a percentage at least equivalent to the current figure in the rail sector.
I am aware of the problems, the trouble and the annoyance caused to communities living next to major road transport arteries and this is why we are looking at how we can improve the quality of this traffic.
We have spoken with Deutsche Bahn, of course, and, next year, the first railway package will enter into force, which will mean, first of all, that the European Union will have, for the first time, a European railway network, which does not currently exist, that we will be able to move beyond national railway networks and that we will integrate these national networks into a European network.
Through this European network, the various transport operators, Deutsche Bahn amongst others, will compete against one another, enjoying non-discriminatory access to it.
I believe that with these systems, and then with the introduction in the coming years of common or at least interoperable technical standards, we will be able to build a genuine European rail network that can really compete with road transport.
Madam President, I am very grateful for that reply.
I must start by apologising for my somewhat late arrival, but I am glad that I managed to get here.
As you will be aware, we are reforming our Rules of Procedure, a process in which I play a part as a shadow rapporteur, and people are getting very touchy about it all.
I would like to start by thanking the Commission for committing itself to plugging the gaps between the trans-European transport network in the European Union and the TINA network in the candidate countries.
That is very important.
It has submitted proposals for completing the trans-European networks and has also made financial commitments in this connection. This is, in my view, a very good thing.
In the regions we live in, individual infrastructure projects are now, of course, the subject of heated debate.
The reason why I am putting this supplementary question is that we still do not have a more or less reliable indication of by what percentage freight traffic, in particular, is expected to increase.
It would be very important for us to know that, as it would also be for the public, for whom new transport links bring disadvantages to be endured.
Ladies and gentlemen, we do not know the exact percentage.
We only have projections and forecasts and, as I said in my first speech, the forecast is of an increase of around 50% in road transport - between 40% and 50% - in the next ten years, in other words, by 2010.
This is the general forecast; it is clearly quite possible, however, that the rate will be greater in some areas.
The basis for this is the latest extensions to have been made: for example, the Iberian Peninsula - in its road link with France through the Pyrenees, or the integration of the Scandinavian countries, in their road links with the rest of the continent, or Austria.
There is no doubt that enlargement automatically produces a qualitative and quantitative increase in road links, but we cannot give you more specific figures, apart from the general forecasts of around 50% by the year 2010.
Question No 13 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0369/02):
Subject: New unlawful aid granted to Olympic Airways
In its letter set out in Official Journal C 98 of 23 April 2002, the Commission addressed to Greece an 'order to provide information on the implementation of Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) 659/1999
Mr President, on 6 March 2002 the Commission decided to initiate a normal review procedure, pursuant to Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, with regard to the possible illegal use of State aid authorised by the Commission in previous decisions in 1994 and 1998, as well as the legality of new aid that has just been granted to Olympic Airways.
The Greek Government was notified of the decision and sent its comments on more than one occasion.
The Commission's decision was also published in the Official Journal, so that interested third parties could send their comments to the Commission within the space of one month.
This deadline ended on 23 May 2002, the date on which the Commission received comments from the parties concerned.
The Commission will take a final decision once it has studied in great detail the comments sent by the Greek authorities and by interested third parties who have made a formal representation on the matter.
The Commission cannot comment on fundamental issues before issuing its final statement on the allegations made in its decision of 6 March 2002.
I thank the Commissioner.
But one thing puzzles me.
The question of the 1994 aid, which the Commission approved, is being reopened but, at the same time, the Commission has failed totally to react to comments made in the European Parliament by Members such as myself on the competition for the sale of Olympic Airways.
What I should like to ask the Commission is this: first, who are the third interested parties?
And secondly, is it the Commission's objective and is the Commission interested in the survival of Olympic Airways which, as we know, is vital to air travel in Greece?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's aim is to foster the development of the air sector in the European Union and to help airlines to consolidate, to be competitive, to provide a good service for passengers. The Commission also wishes to enable economic development to take place.
I am fully aware that Olympic Airways is an extremely important company for Greece's economic activity and that it also has a marked affect on the economic activity of the European Union as a whole.
Having said all of this, however, I must add that what we are talking about here - as I said before about 1994 and 1998 - is simply the way in which these decisions have been implemented, having been authorised at the time in line with the information that was available to us. We have, furthermore, requested confirmation and details from the Greek administration.
What I would most like to see, however, and I repeat, is for the Olympic affair to be resolved in a positive way, for all the initiatives and the work undertaken by the Greek authorities to privatise Olympic to reach a positive conclusion and simply not to see this type of information about further alleged aid from the Greek Government.
I cannot tell you how much happier I would be if Olympic had no problems and if we were not having to look into this matter now.
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 11 and 14 to 70 will be answered in writing
Mr President, we are all extremely satisfied to have reached the end of the procedure to reform the 1976 directive on equal treatment for men and women, a directive which has played an important part in the life of working women in Europe.
The new text, which we trust the European Parliament will adopt, reflects the outcome of systematic efforts by and successful cooperation between the three institutions of the European Union.
It also reflects changes in economic and social conditions in the Member States of the European Union and efforts to update our social model.
However, it also reflects the roles which women have to play today if we are to achieve our development targets and the obligations and responsibilities of the state and society towards working women.
The new directive will therefore be an important tool in achieving sexual equality in the workplace.
New concepts have been included in the area of discrimination, such as sexual harassment, as have company action plans and employer's responsibilities. Equality monitoring bodies are to be created and, more importantly, subsidised at the insistence of the European People's Party.
We believe this is an important directive and we must all work to ensure it is implemented, because our ultimate objective is the impact it will have on the life of working citizens.
So we need to ensure that it is transposed into law in the Member States as quickly as possible and, more importantly, that information is broadly available to citizens, especially women, social agencies, the judicial system and the administrative system.
We must not overlook the importance of this information and awareness raising, because we all know that we have progressive legislation and policies in our countries, but they are not applied, which is why we have the effect of discrimination against women in the workplace.
This directive must give laws and policies on equal treatment a chance to flourish and be applied.
Mr President, the conciliation procedure on the Equal Treatment Directive has produced a respectable result, for which heartfelt thanks are due to our rapporteur, Mrs Hautala.
I am convinced that this amended directive will prove to be a milestone in the improvement of women's career opportunities.
It was quite literally at the last minute that we managed to come to a compromise on the definition of the concept of sexual harassment in the workplace, one which prohibits any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature violating the dignity of the person affected.
For the first time direct and indirect discrimination come within the scope of an EU law, with binding effect in fifteen Member States and soon in ten more.
It also constitutes a breakthrough of massive dimensions that women may not suffer any disadvantage in employment in connection with pregnancy or motherhood, and that they are accorded the right to their former job or an equivalent post after maternity leave.
It has taken a tenacious struggle to give paternal leave to fathers and the protection of the directive to adoptive parents as well.
The Member States and the candidate countries now have until 2005 to see to it that businesses are required to set up independent units to draw up equal treatment plans, also to take preventive action and equip themselves with the resources they need to do this.
Real sanctions are to be imposed for non-compliance.
It is an open question whether the arrangement in Germany, with a voluntary joint commitment by the federal government and the employers' associations which goes in this direction, will meet the high standards of our EU directive.
If businesses do not noticeably redouble their efforts to promote women, it is inevitable that the way ahead will be via a referral to the European Court of Justice.
Mr President, Mrs Hautala really deserves the recognition she is receiving today.
In spite of stubborn and, in certain cases, fairly uninterested and uncommitted ministers, Mrs Hautala succeeded in crafting an excellent agreement.
The work on equality within the EU has taken a major step forwards.
Both women and men can now call upon the law in avoiding sexual harassment.
We know that it is women who all too commonly suffer harassment of this kind.
Now, we are obtaining a legal definition in EC law, and the employer is being given a clear responsibility.
Many European women have had their working days ruined by men who will not take no for an answer.
Between 40% and 50% of professionally employed women in the EU have at some point been exposed to sexual advances.
I am also particularly delighted that the right to parental leave is being strengthened, and for women as well as men.
I should nonetheless have preferred clearer wording concerning people's right to return to the jobs they had before taking parental leave.
Finally, I would once again thank the Commissioner responsible for her assiduous work.
I would also thank my fellow MEP, Mrs Hautala, for the characteristically Finnish refusal to give in that she has shown in the interests of European work on equality.
Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I thank Mrs Hautala for this serious piece of work.
Mrs Hautala has not just lived with it herself but has also involved quite a few political groups in the course of a very long period, and that has paid dividends.
I wish particularly to mention that both parents are now entitled to return to the same, or similar, jobs following parental leave.
That only applies, however, if this right is established in the Member States' legislation.
I really do hope that knowledge of this directive will quickly be disseminated among people and also be taken due note of by those Member States which still do not have this type of legislation.
It is also worth mentioning that the directive in actual fact gives concrete form to the political ambition always expressed in formal speeches: namely, that of being able to combine family and working life.
The directive entails practical action that can contribute to realising this ambition.
A lack of will and understanding is revealed when our political ambition collides with employers' absolute unwillingness to reflect upon their role when it comes to low birth rates in the European Union.
Finally, I would remind you, regarding Paragraph 9 of the report, that, in this area, the church and the army have proved to be two solidly reactionary elements in society.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, amendment of this directive had become urgently necessary in order to do justice to the Treaty of Amsterdam, which includes new provisions on equal opportunities for women and men, but many wide-ranging rulings by the European Court of Justice - for example in the Kalanke and Marschall cases - also provide grounds for adapting the directive.
Both in Parliament and with the Council, we have striven long and hard for a workable compromise, never losing sight of our objective, which is to safeguard equal treatment for men and women as regards their access to work.
The definition of sexual harassment was being honed right up to the end, although opinions can still differ as to whether it should form part of a legal text.
A compromise was reached on the setting up of one or more independent units to analyse and oversee the transposition and implementation of the directive.
Units of this sort, which can also form part of existing facilities, are worthy of support.
The directive also deals with the rights of adoptive parents in those Member States in which adoption leave is recognised.
The right to return to a former job or to an equivalent post at the end of maternity leave has also been incorporated.
The Member States will now be obliged by this directive to introduce a range of binding measures on equal treatment, but businesses should not, in my view, be left to implement these on their own.
To do it, they will also need support.
It is only when the family, the raising of children, and the care of the aged are the responsibility of men and women equally, and only when men avail themselves of educational leave for family commitments as a matter of course, that we will have moved nearer to the goal of equal opportunities, equal rights and equal duties.
Mr President, we have a definitive text, approved at the conciliation meeting of 17 April, which rounded off a long period of work.
We in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have sought to reach agreement on the most important points of this directive.
It has not been easy; we have all made concessions, but we have managed to produce a text that satisfies the majority and which the Council agreed on following many meetings, both formal and informal.
The directive addresses issues as important as the definition at Community level of sexual harassment; it bans discrimination against women on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity in the workplace, and also includes the issues of adoption and paternity, guaranteeing the employee's job or an equivalent job; positive measures have been included for sectors in which one gender is under-represented; preventive measures have been drawn up to prevent discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of gender - especially harassment and sexual harassment - ensuring that real sanctions will be imposed in the event of non-compliance with the directive; equal treatment in the workplace is to be planned and systematic, and reports are to be drawn up every four years to help us determine the real situation women have to cope with.
I believe that this is a good directive, which deals with the problems women face far too frequently, in the workplace and in professional life and will be a genuine tool to prevent discrimination.
The excellent work done by the Spanish Presidency deserves mention as well as its efforts to ensure that the Council and the Commission were able to reach agreement.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, who sends her apologies for not being with us this evening, I should like to congratulate all of you, and in particular Mrs Hautala, on reaching an agreement with the Council on this extremely important directive.
This agreement would not have been possible without Parliament and the Council's willingness to compromise.
The political agreement of 17 April 2002 considerably strengthens the text of the common position which was adopted in June 2001.
We can all be very proud of what we have achieved, because we have taken a significant step forward towards our shared objective of equality between men and women.
I think that we have successfully resolved all of the major issues and that we have, to a large extent, met the European Parliament's concerns.
The dossier was a complex one and provoked various amendments.
I believe that the final approved text is a compromise in the noble sense of the word, because we are giving the men and women of Europe a tangible result, a very robust directive.
We have made considerable progress in the fight against discrimination on the grounds of sex and we have ensured that a fundamental principle of the Treaty will be implemented effectively in the Member States for the foreseeable future.
A striking feature of the new directive is its clarity, which guarantees legal certainty and ensures consistency with similar legislation seeking to combat discrimination.
I particularly welcome the new provisions that have been introduced: the approval of a common European definition of sexual harassment, with a responsibility for employers; the prevention of harassment and sexual harassment and the establishment of company equality reports, and the extended mandate given by the directive to bodies responsible for implementing the principle of equality.
The institutions have shown their determination to reach the compromises necessary to conclude this dossier, and I hope that this will set a precedent for future collaboration between them.
Mrs Diamantopoulou would certainly have been better to look at, but you have certainly dealt with the subject matter just as well as she would have done.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the following debates:
A5-0211/2002 by Mr van Velzen on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the amended proposal for a Council decision (COM (2002) 43 - C5-0212/2002 - 2001/0122(SNC)) adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration: 'Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area' (2002-2006);
A5-0206/2002 by Mrs Zorba on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the amended proposal for a Council decision (COM (2002) 43 - C5-0213/2002 - 2001/0123(CNS)) on adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration: 'structuring the European Research Area? (2002-2006);
A5-0210/2002) by Mr PiÃ©trasanta on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the amended proposal for a Council decision (COM (2002) 43 - C5-0214/2002 - 2001/0124(CNS)) adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration to be carried out by means of direct actions by the Joint Research Centre (2002-2006);

A5-0208/2002) by Mr Schwaiger on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the amended proposal for a Council decision (COM (2002) 279 - C5-0334/2001 + COM (2002) 43 - C5-0216/2002 - 2001/0126(CNS)) adopting a specific programme 2002-2006 for research and training to be carried out by the Joint Research Centre by means of direct actions for the European Atomic Energy Community.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to express my thanks to the Commissioner and his cabinet, to the representatives of the European Commission, the Spanish Presidency, the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the consultants, the shadow rapporteurs and all those who have been involved in the preparations for this report.
In the final analysis, this is about the specific programmes for research, technological development and integration and reinforcement of the European Research Area.
Mr President, I think we can only say that thanks to fruitful cooperation in this House - this is also true of the Caudron report - the European Parliament can be satisfied with the results which will be voted on tomorrow.
As I have said before, we are building on the successful work of Mr Caudron.
Accordingly, we have adopted the structure and the appropriations of the Sixth Framework Programme as they are in the specific programmes, without making any changes.
In that way, we are actually making history.
For the first time, as far as I know, we are therefore voting twice in plenary about more or less the same amendments. Tomorrow, we will be voting again on the amendments which we had discussed before and adopted in the framework of the Caudron report and which we, in informal trilogue with the Council and Commission, have decided to transfer to the specific programmes.
This seems to me to be an historic event.
What are, in fact, the items of the specific programme that have been added since Mr Caudron's Sixth Framework Programme?
Needless to say, I will not enter into each and every detail, but simply allow me to mention a few points that are very close to my heart.
I will naturally begin with bio-science.
We were right, in my view, to focus mainly on cancer research, among other things.
We want European support for fundamental and experimental cancer research that is centred on issues related to a much more effective diagnosis at an earlier stage, for this is ultimately the basis for patient survival.
We naturally also want more support for preventive measures.
Last week, we held a discussion with a number of very prominent cancer specialists, and the word 'prevention' was very much on everyone's lips.
I believe that we can make an important contribution to this by means of the Sixth Framework Programme.
Furthermore, we also naturally want a much faster transfer of the results between experimental work and what ultimately benefits the patient, and we refer to this with an unusual word, namely 'translational research'.
This is what it is all about.
We also support new approaches in the case of cardio-vascular diseases and diabetes, however, with the specific aim to try to establish a link between research in the field of the human genome and the application of new technologies and new research methods.
In my view, we can make a lot of headway with this new approach of genetic engineering etc.
We are, however, also looking into other developments.
We are, for example, looking into how nanotechnology can be used in order to treat heart attacks more effectively and faster, and how we can use advanced innovative technologies in surgery relating to cardio-vascular diseases.
If we close our eyes and consider what we can offer our citizens in the next ten years in the form of new technologies, better research methods, etc, then you will appreciate the huge importance of this programme.
In the field of food safety, we also rightly focus in this programme on the fundamental role of food, diet and life style in people's health.
In my view, it is of enormous importance in Europe's information society to establish the link between mobile communication on the one hand and new technologies in the field of digital television, and the potential in the field of broad-band communication on the other.
In this total package, we, as European industry, can play a much better role in employment too.
In the final analysis, this is what matters.
I should also like to draw your attention to the INTAS project.
We are always talking about a much stronger partnership between Europe and Russia.
