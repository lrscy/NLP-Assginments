In my opinion this is absolutely disgraceful.
I was waiting for Question No 2 from 'Further questions'. I consulted you, Mr President, with a gesture, and, when you told me that Question No 2 would not be answered, naturally I left.
This kind of behaviour should not take place.
If Mrs de Palacio wishes to express her personal political opinion, she can do so at any time, with no need for recourse to this kind of manipulation, which I consider thoroughly deplorable.
Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n, I would not venture to hazard a comment, and still less state that anything is irregular and, furthermore, this is not one of my duties.
I assure you once again that not many questions were answered in this Chamber yesterday and that therefore, in principle, the Commission will answer all the MEPs in writing.
In any event, I suggest that you speak to Mrs de Palacio.
There is a third point of order, and I hope it will be the last.
Mr Galeote Quecedo, you have the floor.
This is indeed a reference to previous comments, because I had the opportunity and also the satisfaction, let it be said in passing, to comment on a response from the European Commission, which was given in full accordance with the Rules, and I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to withdraw the reference to manipulation.
There has been talk of first- and second-class citizens.
The citizens from Mr Ortuondo Larrea's region are not second-class citizens, of course, and yet are systematically threatened, forced to leave their homes and sometimes murdered.
I would like Mr Ortuondo Larrea also to concern himself with these people who, I repeat, are not second-class citizens.
Ladies and gentlemen, what I must remind you of and recommend is that we should bring this sitting back to the matter in hand, in other words, putting questions to the Council rather than starting a debate between Members.
I know you can claim that personal references have been made, but I would ask you not to take them personally so that we can begin the debate.
If you are going to ask me for the floor due to make a personal statement, since a personal reference has been made, I now give the floor to Mr Ortuondo Larrea, who is the Member referred to by Mr Galeote Quecedo.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea, could you please be as brief as possible.
Mr President, I would like to say that the words of the speaker who preceded me are inadmissible.
They are inadmissible, with reference to a complaint tabled correctly by me with regard to discriminatory treatment, without making any reference to the content of any question, for the discriminatory treatment received by the Members to be mixed up with a situation in the Basque country that, I am sad to say, is due precisely to the narrow-mindedness and lack of democracy we suffer in the Spanish State.
Ladies and gentlemen, you will understand that, despite my origins as Member for the Spanish electoral region, which is an honour, I must speak here solely in my capacity as President of the sitting, in Questions to the Council.
I would probably have liked to take part in this debate, but we do not have that right, least of all me.
And therefore, the President-in-Office of the Council - to whom I apologise for this delay - is going to answer the question tabled by Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n.
Question No 1 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0606/02):
Subject: Milk production in the Commission's proposed revision of the CAP
For a country like Galicia, which accounts for a large part of Spanish milk production, possesses an agricultural structure based on small family farms (and therefore ideal for sustainable rural development), and has in recent decades made an extraordinary effort to modernise the milk production sector, the CAP reform should encourage increased milk production, with the goal of covering the needs of the Peninsular market at the very least. While provision should be made for a transition period during which the intervention price is maintained.
Does the Council believe that an arrangement of this type is compatible with the options provided for in the proposed post-2008 CAP reform?
For countries in Galicia's position, could these arrangements be brought into force before 2008?
Mr President, on 12 July of this year, the Commission issued a communication on the Mid-term Review of the Common Agricultural Policy and a working document on the dairy sector.
Apart from these two documents, the Council has not tabled formal proposals for changing the current rules governing the various common organisations of the market or, therefore, those governing the common organisation of the market in dairy products.
As soon as the Commission, which of course has the right of initiative, has presented the Council with the proposals for which it believes there is a need, the Council will give the matter its full attention and will, in any case, take account of Parliament's statement before a decision is made.
The Council has taken note of the various reports accompanying the Commission's communication on the Mid-term Review and, as recently as this month, held a thorough debate on, for example, dairy products.
That debate took, as its starting point, a number of questions put to the Presidency and was aimed at clarifying the key issues.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to say that, were it not for the obstacles put in the way of the Spanish State and of Galicia, my country could achieve a level of milk production similar to that of Ireland or Denmark, whereas today it produces only 1.8 million tonnes.
In any event, it would be able to meet its own requirements and double its level of production.
Bearing this in mind and taking account of the farming structure in Galicia, which is based on family ownership, with a clear focus on milk production, I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council: would the Council accept specific measures - that could also be applied to another country - that would enable Galicia to increase its production whilst temporarily maintaining the intervention price system?
Mr President, it is the Commission that has the right of initiative.
That is why it is the Commission that must come up with a proposal.
Subsequently, the Council will deal with the matter and, as I said, also take account of Parliament's views before a decision is made.
The fact that Mr Nogueira has raised the matter today may therefore, in fact, have been very useful.
Question No 2 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0608/02):
Subject: Declaration by the EU Presidency concerning the island of Perejil
On 13 July 2002, the EU Presidency issued a declaration in which it voiced its concern over the situation created by Morocco on the island of Perejil, expressed its full solidarity with Spain and urged Morocco to immediately withdraw its forces.
The Presidency's action on behalf of a Member State is to be welcomed.
However, I assume the Presidency is unaware that some Spanish historians claim Spain has no right or title to this island, which was occupied by Spanish troops for defensive purposes until the early 1960s, when these forces were withdrawn as part of the winding-up of the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco following that country's independence in 1956.
Does the Presidency not believe that the Spanish Government has overstepped the mark in sending a substantial military force to occupy this tiny island, which Morocco considered to be an act of war, and that the best thing for the European Union to do would be to advocate that the International Court of Justice in the Hague should settle the issue of the sovereignty of Perejil?
Does it not feel that there is a contradiction in Spain claiming sovereignty over Gibraltar from the United Kingdom when it rejects Morocco's claims over this island and other possessions in Africa?
Mr President, this is a matter I remember very clearly, for it was first raised at the same time that Denmark took up the Presidency.
At the beginning of July, we all followed with great concern the developments surrounding this small island.
There was no doubt about the current status of the island, which had been agreed.
There was an understanding between Spain and Morocco to the effect that the island should remain uninhabited and without any sign of sovereignty on the part of either side.
When Morocco infringed this understanding and this status, the Danish Presidency issued a statement expressing its concern about the situation, as well as solidarity with Spain.
At the same time, a strongly worded request was made to Morocco to withdraw its forces.
The Council was delighted at the fact that the new Spanish Foreign Minister, Mrs Palacio, who had just come to the Council from Parliament, had met her Moroccan opposite number in Rabat immediately after the episode and that they had confirmed the desire to return to the earlier status quo.
The Danish Presidency is confident that this and subsequent meetings will help promote the close relations between Spain and Morocco.
On behalf of the Council, I should like to emphasise that, traditionally, the EU's relations with Morocco have been generally sound.
Great progress has been made in recent years, and the mutual cooperation has been extended in many areas, from trade to sensitive issues such as immigration - all on the basis of the association agreement that came into force two and a half years ago.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I do not think that Morocco will agree with what you have said about Perejil Island not belonging to anyone.
I would like to ask you this: does the Council consider that it is fair and democratic for the Spanish government to claim that the citizens of Ceuta and Melilla do not want to be Moroccan because they are Spanish, while, on the other hand, at the same time refusing to allow the citizens of Gibraltar to decide freely in a referendum whether they want to be British or Spanish?
Mr President, I could not dream of answering that question.
It has nothing to do with what I was asked about and is an issue that the Council absolutely cannot have an opinion about.
Mr President, the presidency of the Bureau has acted quite correctly in supporting a Member State with regard to the erroneous and unjust attitude of Morocco - a privileged partner of the European Union, as has just been made clear - in the light of action that is unacceptable from a legal and political standpoint.
It is scandalous that a Basque MEP such as Mr Ortuondo Larrea should be more concerned about goats on Perejil Island than about the situation of ETA victims, with regard to whom he has never shown concern or tabled a single question in this Chamber.
Nor has he done so with regard to the fight against terrorism.
His absence from the debate we have just held reveals his true colours, and discredits anyone who has the nerve to ask this question and to say what we in this Chamber have had to hear.
Does the Council not think that, for the reasons I have given, this question is meaningless?
Mr President, that is of course what I was suggesting in my first answer.
The President-in-Office of the Council may respond as he sees fit.
I would ask you not to try to tell the Council what its response should be or how it should respond.
The only question that can be accepted here is for Mr Ortuondo Larrea to respond, for the second time, to a personal reference, and I am being very careful with regard to this.
Naturally, I would ask Mr Ortuondo Larrea to speak as briefly as possible and, if possible, that nobody else answer him.
Mr President, some people are determined to use and manipulate victims of terrorism, and these are not my words.
The head of the main opposition party in the Spanish State said this recently.
I must tell the Member who has just spoken - mixing a question on Gibraltar, Morocco and Spain with terrorism, with the victims, etc. that if anyone is truly working in the Basque country to overcome the situation of political conflict we have been experiencing for over three centuries - a political conflict with the Spanish State and with the centralist government in Madrid - and is trying precisely to ensure that there are no more attacks, murders or violence in the Basque country, it is the Basque nationalists.
We, the democratic Basque nationalists, have provided enough proof of our good will, our rejection of violence, our fight against terrorism and our defence of freedoms.
Mr Ortuondo Larrea, you have exhausted the subject with this foray into personal statements.
Question No 3 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0610/02):
Subject: Dramatic decline in the income of cotton producers in Greece
Owing to particularly favourable weather conditions, cotton production in Greece was abundant in the 2001-2002 season.
Due to the implementation of the new arrangements and the unlimited 'penalties' provided for in Regulation 1051/2001/EC
Thank you, Mr President, for briefly stating what the question is about.
I often think it must be odd to be listening and not to know what question it is that is being answered.
Thank you, therefore, for that bit of educational guidance.
I should like to draw attention to the fact that last year's Council Regulation No 1051 came into force, according to Article 23 of that same regulation, on 1 June 2001.
The Council cannot alter a provision in a legal act without a proposal to that effect having been tabled by the Commission.
I should also like to remind the honourable Member that it is the Commission that is to use the procedure in Article 21 of the regulation I mentioned, and that is something the Commission has already done in adopting transitional measures.
Nor has the Council received any request from a Member State along the lines referred to by the honourable Member.
We have strayed from the point with the Basques and Spain.
This is an explosive issue because Greek cotton growers are in absolute despair about this regulation, coming as it does right in the middle of the growing season.
I have listened to the minister's reply, I have heard that not one government has called for transitional measures and I merely wish to ask the minister if the Council is prepared to approve national subsidies to save thousands of small and medium-sized cotton farms in Greece, if it intends to allow Greece to pay national aid to make up what is, for them, a totally inadequate, ruinous income.
I can safely say in reply that a proposal by the Commission is also, of course, required for a solution such as the one intimated here, and I do not believe that there is any Member State that has requested such a proposal.
More than that I am unable to say.
I should like to follow on from the question put by Mr Alavanos in connection with the 2001-2002 harvest, which is now a fait accompli.
The problem is that this situation does not only affect last year's harvest, it also affects subsequent harvests.
This year's cotton is being harvested as we speak.
For the second year running, producers are tearing their hair out because the Greek government has arbitrarily set production at 275 kilograms per decare, whereas output is much higher and no-one knows what will become of it.
In February 2001, this House voted almost unanimously for an increase in cotton production because the European Union has a 70% deficit.
Not only has the Greek government made no attempt to push this European Parliament resolution through, so as to protect Greek cotton growers and their produce; it has, as you have heard, been in an untimely hurry to apply the new regulation and has refused to make use of the European Parliament resolution.
Mr President, I call on you to stand up for us here and I call on the Council representative to take a stand on the Greek cotton farmers' request for an immediate overhaul of this disastrous regulation in order to protect farmers facing ruin and their product, which has the status of a national product in Greece.
Mr President, I am obliged to refer to what I have just said.
The rules of procedure are quite clear.
It is the Commission that, in particular cases, must put forward such proposals and, as I said, there is no Member State that has requested a proposal.
Under no circumstances am I able to say any more about this, but Members of the European Parliament are of course always justified in raising matters important to them.
I most definitely cannot blame them for doing so.
Question No 4 by Bart Staes (H-0612/02):
Subject: Binding nature of the European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports
In June 1998, the Council reached agreement on a European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports.
That code is not binding.
Inter alia, Member States are asked, when refusing authorisation, to indicate the country of destination, the merchandise involved and the end user.
Only recently, the FN-Herstal arms company, of which the Walloon Region is a shareholder, delivered 5 500 semi-automatics to an unknown end user.
What steps will the Council take in order to make the agreed Code of Conduct legally binding and to force firms such as FN-Herstal to publish the information required under the Code of Conduct, including in instances where delivery is authorised?
Decisions concerning the authorisation of export licences are taken individually by each particular Member State, with full account being taken of the Code of Conduct on arms exports and the criteria established in this Code.
The implementation of arms export policies and, therefore, of the Code too continues to be the responsibility of the Member States.
The Council has not been made aware of the situation referred to by the honourable Member in his question.
In any case, the Council is not informed as to the reasons why the Member States either authorise or refuse export licences, and it is not within the Council's area of competence in any way to set itself up as a judge of these Member States.
At the meeting on 25 January 1999, the Council discussed a proposal from the Presidency to the effect that the Code should be made legally binding, for example by means of a common position, but there was no agreement about this, and the issue of changing the Code into a legally binding act has not therefore been addressed since.
Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply.
In September, Belgium's Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Michel, made a statement to the press in Belgium in the wake of the Nepal crisis, in which he stated that he would ask his fellow foreign affairs ministers in the Council to have the code of conduct, which is indeed not binding at the moment, transposed into national legislation.
Can the President-in-Office of the Council tell me whether Mr Michel's proposal was tabled in the Council?
Could he also tell me whether he considers it likely that the Council will commit to transposing the code of conduct into national legislation in each country?
Mr President, if I had been asked in the question to provide the information that is being requested here, I might perhaps have been able to do so. The information was not, however, requested in the question, and I cannot therefore offer an answer.
Perhaps the honourable Member could, however, table a written question if it is important to have it answered. He might also perhaps telephone the Belgian Foreign Ministry, which I think would be obliging enough to give an answer.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together.
Question No 5 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0616/02):
Subject: International Criminal Court
Following the USA's refusal on 1 July to ratify the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC), it has signed a bilateral agreement with Romania concerning exemption for Americans from the ICC.
Given that Romania is applying for membership of the EU, and in view of the USA's clear intention to sign bilateral agreements of the same nature with other applicant countries, could the Council say whether it intends, in addition to expressing its displeasure, to take additional measures with regard both to the USA and the various pre-accession countries in order to prevent the institution of the International Criminal Court being undermined from the very outset?
Question No 6 by Carlos Carnero GonzÃ¡lez (H-0667/02):
Subject: Agreement with the United States on immunity vis-Ã -vis the International Criminal Court
In its decision of 30 September the General Affairs Council established that Member States might conclude agreements with the United States on the immunity, as regards the International Criminal Court, of its diplomatic and military staff working on Community territory, under certain conditions.
The questioner considers that this position undermines the CCI at the very moment when it is coming into being and will encourage third countries to do the same or worse. For this reason he rejects the Council's attitude.
Does the Council consider that the decision reflects the opinion of the majority of European citizens?
Has it taken into account the views of the non-governmental organisations and legal experts who have backed the creation of the CCI from the outset?
Does the Council know which Community Member States are to conclude immunity agreements with the United States and with what limits?
Does it not consider that this means that the EU is abandoning its original stance and losing credibility in the eyes of the international community?
Question No 7 by Sarah Ludford (H-0681/02):
Subject: International Criminal Court
The General Affairs Council of 30 September 2002 decided guidelines on the basis of which Member States can negotiate bilateral agreements with the United States to give American personnel some immunity from the International Criminal Court.
Given the fact that the Council believes that the ICC is a 'valuable instrument of the world community to combat impunity for the most serious international crimes',
How can the Presidency maintain its assertion that bilateral agreements with the US do not undermine the Rome Statute and the integrity of the ICC?
How do the GAC guidelines of 30 September accord with the legal advice given previously by the Commission and Council?
Why did the Council not do more to protect the government of Romania from bilateral pressure when approached by the US to conclude a bilateral agreement prior to the setting out of the EU guidelines and, as a candidate country, was Romania not sufficiently integrated into the EU position on the Court?
Mr President, I should like to answer the three questions together.
I would first of all, however, emphasise that the Council's conclusions concerning the International Criminal Court do not encourage the signing of bilateral agreements on immunity.
It is emphasised that account must be taken of existing agreements between the United States and the individual Member States.
In our view, many of the American reservations can be disposed of on the basis of the existing agreements.
It will be up to each individual Member State to assess whether its bilateral or multilateral treaty relations with the United States can be considered adequate to make allowances for the American requests.
If a Member State were to find it necessary to change existing agreements or to enter into a new agreement with the United States, this would be done on the basis of the EU's guiding principles.
If, in their bilateral contacts with the United States, the individual countries keep within this framework that has been set out, the Court will not be undermined.
We would also make it quite clear that, if states that are parties to the International Criminal Court were to enter into agreements such as those now proposed by the United States, this would be incompatible with their obligations in relation to the statutes of the Court.
In accordance with the EU's guiding principles, any solution should include suitable operational provisions that ensure that people who have committed crimes that come within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court do not enjoy immunity.
Legal proceedings must therefore be taken against them, and they must, if necessary, be punished.
Such provisions should be able to ensure that suitable investigations take place and that, if there is sufficient evidence, the national authorities take legal proceedings against people at the request of the Court.
This guiding principle ensures that people are held accountable if they have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.
Moreover, they will be brought to justice irrespective of whether they are Americans or Europeans.
The EU and the United States are agreed that individual responsibility shall apply in the case of the most serious crimes affecting the international community.
For many years, the United States has, in close cooperation with the EU, adopted a leading role when it comes to setting up international criminal courts with a view to bringing criminal prosecutions for such crimes.
Another guiding principle is to the effect that new agreements should only cover people who are not citizens of a state that is a party to the Court.
Moreover, the EU has carefully defined the category of people to whom this might apply.
It is stated, however, that certain persons do not come within the Court's jurisdiction because they have immunity under international law. Apart from such cases, any solution should, however, only cover those who, because they have been sent there by the sending state, are resident in the country that is being requested to hand someone over to the court.
This is in accordance with the Rome Statute's very narrow definition of persons who should be included under immunity agreements.
If the alternatives are looked at, the EU approach we have just described is the best way of defending the International Criminal Court.
Any other solution would have caused cracks to appear in the EU's strong support for the Criminal Court and would have weakened the Court.
A simple rejection of the American proposal would, however, have had very negative consequences for transatlantic relations, and it would have endangered the absolutely vital American commitment to worldwide peacekeeping operations.
If a common EU position had not been established, it would have caused irreparable damage to the Court.
In that connection, I should like to mention that the United States has already entered into bilateral agreements with 12 countries that are unable to take a stand on the EU's position.
If the EU Member States and others were to be encouraged to enter into bilateral negotiations with the United States without strong EU agreement and without clear criteria governing who is to be covered by the resulting bilateral agreements, the outcome would be a multiplicity of bilateral agreements, and that is something which would most certainly undermine the court.
With regard to what EU citizens, NGOs and legal experts think, I should like to emphasise that the Council did not discuss this subject in a vacuum and that it certainly did not reach the stated outcome in a vacuum.
The Council's conclusions are based upon extensive consultations between the Member States and upon valuable contributions from the Council's legal service and from the Commission.
The Council has also taken account of the points of view expressed by the NGOs affected.
Throughout the whole process, there have been contacts with third countries that are parties to the Court, and the Presidency has also had exploratory talks with the United States.
It goes without saying that the Council has also taken full account of the views expressed by the elected representatives in the EU, both in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament.
With regard to which Member States may possibly enter into immunity agreements with the United States, I am not, unfortunately, at the moment in a position to provide information, but I should like to answer questions about Romania's bilateral agreement with the United States, signed on 1 August 2002.
In that connection, I should like, on behalf of the Council, to draw attention to the common position, adopted on 11 June of last year and amended on 20 June of this year.
It was a position supported by the candidate countries.
The Council remained in close contact with the candidate countries during all of the preparatory work on the position, and the Council intends to maintain these contacts in order to keep the candidate countries fully informed about further developments.
The Council has noted that Romania has still not ratified the agreement in question and hopes that it will take account of the position established by the EU after the agreement had been entered into.
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply but, to be perfectly honest, there were points in it which I failed to understand.
Is the United States claiming a separate role in the world and do we acknowledge that role, yes or no?
This is the umpteenth time they have done so since the Kyoto agreements and on numerous other issues.
You said that you did this so as not to rattle trans-Atlantic relations.
To be honest, I do not understand that either.
Just as I fail to understand that the guilty parties will, you say, be tried before national courts. Not, Mr President-in-Office, by the courts in the United States.
No way.
The question is: will this apply to other countries at a later date?
To the Russians and who knows who else on peacekeeping missions?
How can you say that this does not undermine the Court?
In all events, when it comes to Romania, which was what I specifically asked about, the question is this: that you hope the agreement signed by Romania will not be ratified is of no interest to me.
What does interest me is, do you intend to say to Romania, within the hearing of other candidate countries, that their integration depends on their respecting the European Union's common position on the International Criminal Court?
I should like to emphasise that a solution has been found that does not undermine the International Criminal Court.
This solution will be of great help to, for example, the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe which have been in some doubt as to what they should do.
A solution has also been found that does not impair existing agreements.
I really do think that this is, all in all, quite a good result.
The EU cannot monitor the whole world.
We have ensured that the International Criminal Court is protected from being undermined, and I cannot say anything more about the matter.
Mr President, Mr Haarder, by way of an introduction to my question I shall say that I do not agree with the Council's decision.
I would like the Council to specify the following points: first of all, what is the legal status of the Council's decision?
How would you define it?
Secondly, depending on its legal status, does it form part of the Community acquis or not?
If it forms part of the Community acquis, the Member States and the candidate countries are obliged to observe it and, therefore, clearly cannot ratify bilateral agreements with the United States that run counter to any Council decision.
Lastly, how does the Council think it can control the decisions of the Member States such as, for example, those that could be taken by means of any real bilateral agreements with the United States through amendments to other existing agreements with the US?
Mr President, I was not of course asked about this in the written question.
I shall merely point out that we are concerned here with a common position.
Everyone, including all the candidate countries, is expected to uphold the common position.
I should be surprised - astonished, in fact - if they did not, so I think the honourable Member can be quite certain that they will do so.
Mr President, I hear what the minister says; I accept that the guidelines are better than nothing and I congratulate the Danish presidency on at least achieving them.
But the legal advice given to the EU institutions was that a contracting party to the Rome Statute that concludes bilateral agreements outside the tight scope of Article 98 acts against the object and purpose of the Statute.
Is it not true that the guidelines are really too weak to shut the door to impunity arrangements?
I heard the minister refer to a common position.
I would like to know whether the guidelines legally constitute a common position.
Whether they do or not, will the Council at least seek to strengthen these rather vague guidelines of 30 September which allow loopholes contravening the Statute?
That would give us a strengthened common position delivering additional safeguards.
These should include: oversight of national pledges by the ICC; guarantees that the US will investigate and prosecute its own nationals accused of committing ICC crimes; a requirement on the US to update federal laws to ensure that its courts exercise jurisdiction over all ICC crimes - which is not the case at the moment; agreement to confine the scope to military personnel or closely allied civilian personnel - and not, for instance, mercenaries; inclusion of a sunset clause and the submission of the agreements for scrutiny by the relevant national parliaments.
With reference to the very last point, I think it is very clearly apparent how restricted a category of people is covered.
With reference to the first question asked, I want to say that a common position is a common position.
There are no punitive measures for countries that might disregard a common position, but we are normally accustomed to complying with common positions in the EU, and I believe that the candidate countries too will be so.
Mr President, I have to say that the answer by the President-in-Office of the Council shows signs of there being considerable elasticity of interpretation but, as we say in Denmark, it requires a very firm character to sell elastic by the metre.
It can be stretched in all directions, and I do not think that the President-in-Office is tackling the fundamental issue of whether we have an American strategy that urges other countries to enter into bilateral agreements whereby such countries undertake not to hand over American citizens.
This is in line with the fact that the United States has persistently and continually refused to ratify the International Criminal Court Treaty.
It strikes me as self-evident that the Council has a credibility problem when, on the one hand, it states that it fully supports the setting up of the International Criminal Court and regards its establishment as a building block of international legal cooperation and, on the other hand, turns a blind eye to, and accepts, America's blackmailing of third countries.
The President-in-Office said that a solution had been found to the blackmailing of Romania.
The only practical questions I want to put are the following: what is the gist of this solution, and is it a solution that the Council finds acceptable?
If the answer to the latter question is yes, there is still a credibility problem.
Yes, in response to the last question I can say that a solution has been found that, in my view, will ensure there are no other candidate countries that enter into agreements corresponding to that entered into by Romania.
I should also like to add that, to my knowledge, Romania has still not ratified that agreement.
Regarding the first point, I would say in reply that, were the United States to exert the pressure referred to by Mr Krarup, it would be just as well that we have obtained the common position, which is easy to support and through which any such possible pressure can be withstood. In my view, it is one of the great virtues of the common position that it gives very clear support to countries in the event of their being subjected to pressure.
I am not aware of this happening, but the honourable Member says that it does. Were this in fact to happen, it would, as I say, be just as well that we have this position, to which the new Member States can also adhere.
As the author is not present, Questions No 8 lapses.
Question No 9 by Efstratios Korakas, which has been taken over by Mr Alyssandrakis (H-0623/02):
Subject: EU-USA agreement on deportations, secret police operations and communications surveillance
Statewatch claims that the EU and the USA are planning to conclude an agreement on combating terrorism and matters relating to public criminal law which will include joint police operations, surveillance of communications, the location and seizure of the proceeds of crime, simplification of deportation procedures for Europeans and non-Europeans, and restrictions on applications for asylum.
What is the Council's position, particularly in view of the claim that the Danish Presidency is drawing up a plan for communications surveillance and the fact that such repressive and persecutory measures are totally contrary to respect for human rights and inconsistent with previous statements that the EU will not conclude any agreement which provides for deportation to countries, such as the USA, where capital punishment is in force.
Mr President-in-Office, I understand from your reply that talks are in fact under way between the United States and the European Union.
As for your assurances about human rights, I would have no trouble accepting them if the way in which the European Union interprets human rights in practice did not differ considerably from what the man in the street understands by human rights; if, helped by terrorism, the European Union were not building up a repressive, autocratic mechanism to be used against anyone who stands up against its policies.
An article appeared in the English newspaper, the Guardian on 3 September, expressing concern about the fallout from these talks with the USA.
If the Guardian is worried, Mr President-in-Office, we are right to be ten times as worried.
I should like to ask you a specific question: what will be the national parliaments' and the European Parliament's input into these agreements and, on a more general note, what part will they play in ratifying these agreements?
The states will, of course, enter into such agreements in accordance with the national rules. Where the European institutions are concerned, this will take place in accordance with the European Union's rules.
Mr President, it is of course clear from the documentation produced by Statewatch that negotiations concerning these agreements were embarked upon as early as last autumn and that they have been conducted in the greatest secrecy.
The request by Tony Bunyan of Statewatch that the documents be made available for scrutiny has been met with partial rejection because the negotiations concerned were secret.
The fact is, of course, that, according to the Treaty, Parliament is not entitled to be consulted on these matters, and the question therefore arises as to why it has not been publicly stated that these developments are part of the anti-terrorist measures that are being worked on.
My first question is about why the Council is holding its cards so close to its chest when these are matters of very broad general interest that are at stake.
My second question is about how far these agreements extend.
Looking at Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, it is apparent from Article 24 that, when it is necessary to conclude an agreement with one or more States etc in implementation of these Titles, agreements may be entered into on behalf of the Council without Parliament's being consulted and without any public debate.
In the view of the President-in-Office of the Council, how far do these powers extend and why has Parliament not been informed?
I should have liked to have given Mr Krarup an answer, but I have not read what Statewatch says. Nor do I know if what it says is true.
Moreover, I am charged with answering questions that have been put in advance, and these questions have not been put in advance.
I am sorry, then, Mr Krarup, but perhaps it would be an idea to submit a written question or put the question next time.
As the author is not present, Question No 10 lapses.
Question No 11 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0626/02):
Subject: New opportunities as regards relations with Libya
How does the Council view the latest statements made by the Libyan head of state Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, the U-turn in his policy, and the tone of his televised address on the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of his accession to power?
What opportunities does this new situation open up for relations between the European Union and Libya?
The Council has not discussed Colonel Gadaffi's speeches.
As far as the Council is concerned, it is, however, still prepared to allow Libya to become a fully fledged participant in the Barcelona Process as soon as the country has accepted the Barcelona rules fully and without reservation.
Libya has still not given an answer where this issue is concerned.
Until it does, it will continue to be invited as an observer to the meetings of the Euro-Mediterranean Committee and to the meetings between the high-ranking officials with responsibility for political and security issues.
Libya participated in the ministerial conference in Valencia as the Presidency's guest.
There seem at present to be two main trends in Libya.
The first prepares the way for a rapprochement with the EU and clearly signals a break with the past, while the second reflects the fact that Libya's ambitions on the African continent are incompatible with participation in the Barcelona Process.
The relative weight of the two Libyan points of view naturally depends upon Colonel Gadaffi's ambitions.
In the EU's view, a strong role in Africa and participation in the Barcelona Process complement each other very well indeed.
The Euro-African partnership, whose next summit is planned to take place in the very near future, is testimony to this.
The Council also applauds the fact that certain political prisoners in Libya have been released and emphasises that, if Libya asks to do so, it will be able to participate in the Barcelona Process as soon as the outstanding issues have been resolved clearly and satisfactorily.
Such participation in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership would also mean that Libya, in common with the other partners, would enter into an association agreement and be covered by the MEDA regulation.
Mr President, I must confess that the President-in-Office of the Council was not very clear on this question.
I have listened carefully to his words, which at times seemed contradictory insofar as Libya would be invited to participate, but does not appear to be contemplating a change in the situation.
In any case, I would like to ask him the following supplementary question: is there a will to work towards a rapprochement?
Are there any plans to improve mutual understanding between the European Union and Libya?
If things go well, what agreements could be reached?
Would these be the same agreements as with other North African countries within the context of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership?
What would be the likely timetable for action?
Mr President, I really do think that my answer was fairly clear.
If Libya can give clear and satisfactory answers in connection with the outstanding issues, it will be able, upon request, to participate in the Barcelona Process, even if it has ambitions for a rapprochement with the African continent.
I said quite specifically that those things are not necessarily in conflict with each other.
There would appear, however, to be two conflicting trends in Libya.
That is not something I was just trotting out, but something that we have observed in Libya.
Question No 12 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0629/02):
Subject: Neighbouring country status for Ukraine
At the EU-Ukraine summit held in Copenhagen in July 2002, Ukraine was offered EU neighbouring country status.
This is a new concept which now needs to be given substance.
What does this status entail in practical terms?
Will conditions be the same for Ukraine as for Belarus, for example?
Will the same status apply to all countries that border the Union after enlargement?
Mr President, I am very happy to answer Mr SacrÃ©deus's question concerning Ukraine.
At the EU-Ukraine summit in Copenhagen this summer, Ukraine was informed about the Council's decision in April to highlight the opportunity of strengthening relations between the future enlarged EU and its new neighbours.
Both sides emphasised the importance of taking account of the fact that relations between the EU and the countries concerned vary in character and are at different levels of political and economic development.
The EU and Ukraine were agreed that the enlargement process creates new opportunities and challenges in various areas.
Both sides confirmed that Ukraine could best make use of these opportunities by stepping up its efforts to adjust its legislation, norms and standards to the EU's.
It was also agreed to step up the relevant partnership and cooperation bodies' discussions of the effects of enlargement on, for example, trade-related issues, visas, the movement of persons and the promotion of regional and cross-border cooperation.
The EU recognises Ukraine's European aspirations. It is important for Ukraine to become better at fulfilling its obligations if these aspirations are to have real content.
The EU will continue to support Ukraine in the reform process, including the strengthening of the judicial system, media freedom, human rights and civil society.
The Danish Presidency feels duty-bound to step up EU-Ukraine cooperation.
The working plan for implementing the EU's common strategy for Ukraine has been presented to the Council, which examined it on 22 July of this year.
The Presidency believes that it should be the EU's overall objective to make the dialogue and cooperation with Ukraine more focused and results-oriented.
The priorities in this working plan are as follows: first of all, the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and public institutions; secondly, support for the economic transition process, including Ukraine's integration into the European and world economies, and for regional cross-border cooperation with neighbouring countries; thirdly, cooperation on strengthening stability and security within and outside Europe; fourthly, the strengthening of cooperation in the environmental and energy fields and in the context of nuclear safety; fifthly, support for reinforced cooperation in connection with enlargement of the EU; and sixthly and finally, the development of cooperation on legal and internal affairs.
The development of an overall EU policy towards the EU's new neighbours, with full respect for the differences between the countries involved, will help in achieving the overall objectives.
On the basis of a common contribution from the High Representative, Mr Solana, and from Commissioner Patten, the Council discussed relations between the enlarged EU and its Eastern neighbours at the meeting on 30 September.
The Council reiterated its conviction that EU enlargement will offer a good opportunity to strengthen relations between the EU and its new neighbours with a view to creating stability and narrowing the gap in prosperity at the EU's new borders.
I should like sincerely to thank Mr Haarder and the Danish Presidency for that detailed and excellent reply.
It is my personal belief that it was of great strategic importance when, during the Swedish Presidency, Swedish Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson, on his last trip away on foreign policy business, actually visited Kiev and met with the Ukrainian government.
I view the line taken by the Danish Presidency as a continuation of that policy.
I should like to ask a couple of follow-up questions.
Firstly, is it conceivable that, in the relatively near future, Ukraine could be offered a special agreement, which could be an Eastern European variant of a special economic relationship, that is to say, a form of Eastern European EEA Agreement?
Secondly, I wonder how you feel that relations between the EU and Ukraine have been affected by the claims concerning military cooperation with Iraq on the part of Ukraine.
I should like to thank Mr SacrÃ©deus for the great interest he has shown in Ukraine.
It is important for us to remember Ukraine, which is a very important country in Europe.
I should like to compliment Parliament on the report on Ukraine which - if I remember correctly - was adopted approximately a year ago.
I am able to add that the Danish Presidency expects the Council, again this year, to request the Commission to submit proposals for the development of an overall EU policy towards the EU's new neighbours, and it can safely be said that Ukraine is a very important nation among these neighbours.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you specifically for mentioning the fact that you are also working on nuclear safety in the Ukraine.
I would be interested to know whether it is actually intended to use the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency as a basis for guaranteeing safety there.
Mr President, with the historical background of which we are all of course aware, there is no doubt at all that the subject of nuclear safety will be part of any discussion between the European Union and Ukraine.
Question No 13 by Bernd Posselt (H-0631/02):
Subject: The EU and Macedonia
What is the Danish Presidency's assessment of the present situation in Macedonia, and is it planning action to give a fresh boost to the Stabilisation and Association agreement, e.g. through additional financial assistance or by abolishing visa requirements?
The Presidency is delighted that the parliamentary elections on 15 September in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia passed off in such an orderly fashion.
At its meeting on 21 October, the Council expressed satisfaction with the agreement concerning the new government in Skopje.
The Council encouraged this new government to lose no time in putting full implementation of the framework agreement and stabilisation and association process at the top of the agenda and emphasised that it is looking forward to close and fruitful cooperation.
The EU will maintain its strong commitment to Macedonia and will actively support a government amenable to reforms.
The Council is also looking forward to the planned census being held in accordance with international standards.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement has not come into force because it has still not been ratified.
Until such time as it is, an interim agreement on trade aspects, which came into force just over a year ago, has been entered into.
As part of a multi-annual programme for the years 2002-2004, the European Community has appropriated EUR 130.5 million to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in order to support the country as it prepares to fulfil the obligations associated with the interim agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
The issue of the visa requirement for Macedonians was discussed at the most recent meeting of the Macedonia-EU Cooperation Council, held on 1 and 2 July of this year, and, on this occasion, the Commission reminded the authorities in Macedonia that they must make a number of practical arrangements before the EU will be able to consider cancelling the visa requirement.
The Member States and the Commission are following carefully the progress in fulfilling these criteria that is being made by the authorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for that very good, detailed reply and for your formidable knowledge of the situation, which of course explains why we hold you in such high regard.
I should just like to ask a brief supplementary question.
It is a delicate issue, I admit.
You also once spoke of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
We are seeing that the term Yugoslavia in expressions such as 'the former Yugoslavia' and 'the remains of Yugoslavia' has actually disappeared and is to be replaced by the term Serbia-Montenegro.
The word 'Yugoslavia' would then only continue to exist in the official name of Macedonia.
I should like to ask you whether it might not be possible, in the long term, to find a diplomatic solution to the name issue, because it certainly places a strain on this country, which, while it may not threaten its existence, does have profound psychological consequences.
Precisely because of the deep psychological significance of this issue, so rightly pointed out by Mr Posselt, I do not intend to express any opinion at all on it.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that in Macedonia's case it is particularly important to consider how the support that we provide can most effectively bring stability to this region.
Small and medium-sized enterprises obviously play a pivotal role here.
That is why I would be interested to know whether within this support programme that you mentioned, which will provide EUR 135 million for the period from 2000 to 2004, funds are also available to promote small and medium-sized enterprises.
I cannot say offhand that there are funds for the middle class.
Aid cannot, however, be given for economic development without this being of benefit to the middle class, and I am convinced that it will be of benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises.
As far as I know, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has no other kind of enterprises, so I do not think the honourable Member needs to worry.
Moreover, I should like once again to express my delight at the developments in Macedonia, especially the political developments, which I find reassuring in view of how black the outlook was just over a year ago.
Question No 14 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0634/02):
Subject: Abduction of Mr Ali Khanbiev, a doctor, in Chechnya
At around 3 to 4 a.m. on the morning of 4 September, masked men abducted Ali Khanbiev from his home in the village of Benoi (Chechnya), where he had continued to work as a doctor in the local hospital.
Mr Khanbiev, who was born in 1958, is the brother of Umar Khanbiev, Minister of Health in Aslan Maskhadov's government.
What information does the Council have concerning Mr Khanbiev's abduction?
Is the Council aware that it has all the signs of an abduction by Russian military and paramilitary forces and, consequently, there is every reason to fear for Mr Khanbiev's safety?
What initiatives has the Council taken, or does it intend to take, to urge the Russian authorities to make every effort to secure Mr Khanbiev's immediate release?
The Council has not received any information about this abduction, but I am able to tell you that the Council is still very concerned about the situation in Chechnya and that it can only condemn the many abductions that exacerbate the already very difficult humanitarian situation in the region.
The Council emphasises that it attaches exceptional importance to full compliance with human rights and also to the efforts to find a political solution and to improve the humanitarian situation.
I am well aware that Mr Dupuis would like me to say more than that and state that more will be done, but that is all I can say at the moment.
I should also like to thank Mr Dupuis for the commitment he has shown for many years - especially when it comes to the humanitarian situation in Chechnya - for as long, in fact, as he has been, as I was, a member of this Parliament.
Minister Haarder, I am finding this difficult to understand.
You say that the Council has not received any information on the abduction of Mr Khanbiev.
The only information that we have had in the last six weeks is that he has been abducted.
Has the Council not received this information or has it not been able to ask for it, or has it not wanted to ask for it?
That is the first thing that I would like to know.
The second thing is that you are working on preparations for the important meeting that is to take place in Copenhagen, namely the EU-Russia summit.
As part of preparations for this summit, the issue relating to disappearances, torture, and very often unfortunately, executions of civilians, like Mr Ali Khanbiev, who is a doctor and nothing more than a doctor, will this issue feature on the agenda?
In particular, will the Council ensure that we at least try to save an individual, that we try to save Mr Khanbiev, and by turning things around in Chechnya, and in doing so, send a clear signal to the Russian authorities?
The agenda for the EU-Russia Summit that is to take place in Copenhagen on 12 November has still not been prepared.
With regard to this abduction, I can only repeat that the Council has not received any information about it. As I said earlier, however, the Council is well aware that many abductions have taken place and it has, in common with Parliament, regretted the fact time and time again.
Unfortunately, the situation is such that what Mr Dupuis says is probably right, but the Council has not yet received any information about the incident.
Mr President, I should like to ask a question. We have often had occasion to discuss with Commissioner Nielson the possibility of his visiting Chechnya to assess the humanitarian situation there in more detail, and we also wish to send a parliamentary delegation to Chechnya.
At this EU-Russia Summit, could you not put on the agenda the fact that the European institutions wish to visit Chechnya to see the situation there for themselves?
Perhaps you could also discuss this with Commissioner Nielson - while Denmark has the Council Presidency you can of course also do that in his mother tongue.
But that apart, it is important that an official visit takes place.
I should like to thank Mr Posselt for his commitment and also for the proposal he has put forward.
Naturally, I cannot, here on behalf of the Council, say what the answer will be, but I want to say thank you for the proposal and am also able to add that the Council is, of course, deeply engaged with the issues mentioned here.
Question No 15 by Paulo Casaca (H-0638/02):
Subject: Human rights
According to the 8 July edition of the Financial Times the Iranian authorities in Teheran told Mrs Laurette Onkelinx, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, that they defended the practice of stoning women 'with the aim of safeguarding the inviolability of the family' and punishing adultery.
Can the Council say what impact the advocacy of this practice has had on relations between the European Union and Iran, particularly in view of the priority which the Council has repeatedly claimed it gives to human rights?
As a matter of principle, the Council never comments on press reports.
When comments are issued, it is the Presidency that issues them.
With regard to the visit in question, I should like to make it clear that, during her visit, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, Mrs Onkelinx, expressed her condemnation of stoning.
Moreover, she repeated the European Union's position on the matter in order to dispel any misunderstanding of what had been said during the discussion in question.
Human rights issues - and, specifically, the use of cruel forms of execution such as stoning - have always been high on the agenda of the comprehensive political dialogue that takes place at the half-yearly meetings between Iran and the EU.
At the most recent meeting in Teheran on 10 September 2002, a number of specific human rights issues were also discussed.
Furthermore, the EU makes regular overtures in connection with such matters.
We are at the moment aware of three cases in Iran in which people have been sentenced to death by stoning.
All three sentences have been appealed against, so the judgments are still not final.
There must be no doubt at all that the Council will follow these cases very carefully.
More generally, I can inform you that the EU has discussed an initiative aimed at establishing a formal human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the guidelines for dialogues with third countries approved by the Council in December of last year.
Not until this month did European and Iranian human rights experts meet for a series of exploratory talks in Teheran.
I should also like to add that human rights are one of the four essential areas in which the Council has stated that it wishes to see progress, now that the EU and Iran are in the process of developing close trade relations.
On 21 October, that is to say a couple of days ago, the Council emphasised that it considers it very important that a human rights dialogue should offer an opportunity to achieve practical improvements regarding respect for human rights.
It decided therefore to embark upon such a dialogue on the basis of the conditions, timetable, subjects, benchmark points - that is to say, objectives - and choice of interlocutors discussed in the course of the EU's fact-finding mission to Iran.
It was also decided that the first meeting within the framework of this dialogue should take place as early as this year in Teheran.
Finally, the Council has, on the basis of an initiative by the Presidency, very recently brought up a number of matters in quite a few different countries, including Iran.
On the basis of this initiative, the Council adopted, on 30 September, a declaration on the death penalty and, in particular, cruel forms of execution.
In its declaration, the Council again emphasises, clearly and unambiguously, that the EU repudiates the death penalty and, in particular, execution by stoning.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I offer you my sincere thanks for your direct answer.
I should like, however, to inform you that precisely on the eve of a mission to Iran by EU experts in October, a series of five public executions took place in Iran, which were reported in the world's press. I hope, incidentally, that the President-in-Office of the Council is not going to say that he was unaware of what was being said in the press.
Such actions clearly demonstrate the position of the Iranian authorities, which is not to budge one inch in their approach to human rights. The number of executions reported in Iran has trebled in the last three years and, given these circumstances, the question is this: is the European Union going to conclude a trade agreement with Iran in the wake of these systematic breaches of human rights or not?
This is what I wished to find out from you.
Mr President, I did not say that I - and the Council - do not read press reports and newspapers.
I said that the Council never comments on press reports.
That is something quite different.
My esteemed colleague is undoubtedly right that, in Iran, the death penalty is not just something that exists in theory but also something that is practised.
That is deeply tragic, but the Council has devised a strategy for nonetheless being able to embark upon human rights dialogues with countries that impose this penalty.
That is, in my view, perfectly in order, moreover.
It is of course a dialogue involving, on the one hand, vigorous condemnation and, on the other hand, simultaneous efforts of persuasion to bring about improvements.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think that Mr Casaca has touched upon something very specific.
He was not talking just about the death penalty; he was talking about death by stoning, which is utterly unacceptable.
Furthermore, our experience of association agreements with a number of third countries, particularly with countries that are quite closely linked to us such as Tunisia, shows that the clause on human rights has had no effect in terms of urging the national authorities to make progress towards democracy and the rule of law.
On the contrary, the authorities have used this association agreement to increase their power and to develop mafia groups that have various degrees of involvement in the country's economic sectors and also in the European Union itself.
Do you not think that, by proposing that Iran sign an association agreement, there is a danger that we will find ourselves in exactly the same situation as the one the European Union is now facing with Tunisia?
Mr President, a question such as that cannot be answered in general terms. If, however, something along the lines of an answer is desired, it can often be a good idea to ask the democratic forces in the country concerned.
As the author is not present, Question No 16 lapses.
Question No 17 by Konstantinos Alyssandrakis (H-0648/02):
Subject: Promotion of police-state mentality and informer culture in EUROPOL text
A report in the newspaper Rizospastis claims that a EUROPOL document entitled 'European Best Practice for Handling Informers' gives guidance and instructions for the 'recruitment and handling' of informers.
These instructions include methods of payment and amount, as well as certain forms of immunity to be granted - informers are not to be arrested 'when they commit offences within prescribed limits' and they are also allowed 'to take part in criminal activities' after 'authorisation from an authority established in accordance with the guidelines'.
Does the Council approve of this EUROPOL text, which is flagrantly contrary to respect for human rights and human dignity itself?
Will it take immediate measures to call a halt to this slide towards a police state mentality, authoritarianism and spying on the private lives of citizens, their political, trade union and social activities and their collective organisations?
Mr President, I am sorry, but I seem to be repeating myself here, for the Council does not comment on statements in the media, either. I can nonetheless confirm, however, that there is a Europol document concerning the subject we are now talking about.
This document describes best practice for handling informers with a view to helping the police authorities in the Member States.
The document is not binding, and it has been prepared on the basis of Article 3(2)(i) of the Europol Convention.
It is based partly upon the Executive Committee's decision of 29 April 1999 on general principles governing the payment of informers and upon the Decision of the Central Group of 22 March 1999 on general principles governing the payment of informers.
These decisions have therefore been integrated into the European Union's prior regulatory framework, cf. the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, and both have been published in the Official Journal of 22 September 2000.
Police use of informers, including questions of payment and immunity, naturally depends upon the state of the national law in the Member State concerned.
Mr President-in-Office, I am astonished by the clarity of your reply; it is something we are not used to from you.
At the same time, I shudder at the thought that we are surrounded by a network of informants and I wonder if the purpose of such clarity was perhaps to remind us of this and warn us that our slightest misdemeanours are under constant surveillance.
As Europol appears to be giving informants official status, I wonder whether a scale of pay has been set and whether there will be invitations to tender and then at least some of our young unemployed could apply for the job.
Mr President, Europol is a cooperation body that deals with some of the very worst crimes, against which democracies must protect themselves.
I do not therefore think it is fair to talk about an informer state.
That is an expression I should like to repudiate.
Europol was of course set up and has had its powers extended partly at the request of Parliament and of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
One reason for this is that Europol's task is not of course to cause people trouble but to protect them.
As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 18 to 37 will be replied to in writing
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0298/2002) by Mr Lisi, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to air passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights (COM(2001) 784 - C5-0700/2001 - 2001/0305(COD)).
Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to present this important proposal to Parliament. It forms part of our policy of giving transport a human face, in other words, looking after citizens' rights, passengers' rights, as we announced in our White Paper.
It is difficult for passengers to accept being denied boarding.
They have paid for their ticket, reserved their seat and arrived at the airport in time for check-in only to be told that there are no seats on the plane, because the airline has overbooked or simply that some other hitch has occurred.
This is incomprehensible to members of the public and causes major disruption and feelings of frustration and finally, of resentment.
Every year, within the Community, around 250 000 people - having paid for their ticket and completed all the formalities - are denied boarding.
Although it acknowledged that the airlines needed flexibility in order to manage capacity, the European Community adopted in 1991 - on the eve of the adoption of final legislation on liberalisation - a Regulation on denied boarding due to overbooking which guarantees the passengers affected financial compensation and assistance, but which is extremely limited.
The Commission has therefore proposed a new regulation in order considerably to reduce the number of people denied boarding and to improve protection for those concerned.
When airlines plan to deny boarding, they shall be obliged, first of all, to ask for volunteers to give up their seats in exchange for specified benefits; they may only deny boarding to passengers against their will if there are not enough volunteers.
In order for the Regulation to be effective, however, it must provide a powerful incentive for people to volunteer.
We have therefore proposed a significant increase in compensation, above the current levels, which have partly been absorbed by inflation and which these days do not dissuade airlines from denying boarding.
Naturally, when the airlines manage to find volunteers, they will not pay this compensation.
The Commission's position is flexible with regard to the exact amounts, provided that they are substantial enough to encourage the airlines to find volunteers.
Our proposal will also eliminate the restrictions of the current Regulation.
First of all, it will extend the rights of passengers who are denied boarding to all passengers whose flights are cancelled.
Ultimately, cancellation equates to universal denied boarding for an entire flight. Only cancellations for which the corresponding airline is responsible would be covered, however, because, obviously, in some circumstances, it would be unfair for the airline to bear sole responsibility.
Secondly, the proposed Regulation will establish fundamental rights for passengers who suffer delays, allowing them to organise their journey by other means, instead of waiting indefinitely at the airport.
In this case, however, they would not be entitled to compensation.
Lastly, our proposal will grant all of these rights to passengers flying on both scheduled and charter flights.
Passengers on package holidays will therefore benefit in the same way as those who only buy a plane ticket.
It would not be fair to treat passengers differently when they have to face similar difficulties.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the essential points of our proposal, which substantially increases protection for passengers in the event of problems with their flights and which aims to significantly improve the quality of service and therefore increase guarantees for citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this difficult time for the civil aviation sector, whose future we debated recently in this Chamber when we discussed the single European sky rules, the European Commission has proposed a new regulation on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding.
The liberalisation of the air transport sector has brought numerous benefits for passengers. Competition has arrived on many routes, causing a fall in prices and a great increase in the choice of routes and destinations.
In spite of this, however, consumers have valid reasons for dissatisfaction. Denied boarding and cancellation of flights provoke strong resentment, and the assistance provided during the excessive delays all too often leaves something to be desired.
We in this House fly so often that many of us have experienced such inconveniences, and it is therefore very easy for us to put ourselves in the shoes of the citizens in this case and understand that new, effective legislation is needed to protect their rights across the board.
Faced with the shortcomings of current legislation, the European Commission proposes to take a different approach, introducing, on the one hand, a call for volunteers, as per the effective US system, and, on the other, a dissuasive system which compels airlines to provide greater compensation to passengers for damages.
In addition, protection is considerably increased, as we will see in a moment.
We must not, however, lose sight of the overall context of this proposal.
We have had the opportunity to pursue an extremely constructive debate in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, exploring all aspects of the question.
As the Commissioner has just pointed out, overbooking, the principal cause of denied boarding, is a negligible consideration when seen against the backdrop of the annual flow of air passengers in the Community area.
We cannot risk penalising the entire spectrum of travellers with a potential blanket price increase in order to provide greater protection for a very small number of passengers.
We must be very careful and identify precisely the best solutions for achieving the objective without causing repercussions, bearing in mind, not least, the economic impact.
In this context, Commissioner, I am afraid I must complain of the lack of statistics provided by the Commission in support of the proposal.
We do need practical statistics and facts on which to base a decision, and the lack thereof has certainly made it quite difficult for me to draw up a report.
I will now outline the principal points on which we have worked to produce the final document.
The first is the definitions. In terms of methodology, I believe it is essential to define all the actors involved and terms used more precisely, to avoid any confusion which might affect either passengers or airlines.
To this end, a number of amendments have been adopted seeking to make the provisions of Article 2 more detailed.
The second point concerns tour operators. Passengers who have bought a package holiday are already more than adequately protected by Directive 90/314.
The Commission's proposal is therefore in danger of creating confusion over the reference text, to the detriment, principally, of the passengers, and it was therefore necessary to restrict the responsibility of tour operators in the context of this regulation to seats only, as we have done.
Lastly, the most controversial point: the provision of compensation to passengers in the event of denied boarding. The Commission's proposal has given rise to a great deal of debate and much concern.
Neither the criteria established for the definition of the new compensation amounts nor the impact assessment satisfy the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
As far as we are concerned, the important thing is to preserve a balance between protecting passengers and the vitality of a major economic sector such as the air transport sector.
We have therefore proposed a three-category division on the basis of distance and a reduction in compensation amounts.
Indeed, we must remember that we should be concentrating more on implementing the system of calls for volunteers than on compensation.
In addition, I believe it is entirely inappropriate to extend the provision of compensation to excessive delays, for a number of reasons. First of all, because it is not easy to identify the cause of the delay quickly enough, and, secondly, because this would create a chain reaction.
We therefore feel it is entirely appropriate to equate denied boarding with cancellation, but we feel it is inappropriate to treat excessive delays in the same way.
Rather, we must ensure that a proper, systematic system of assistance in the event of delays is in operation, particularly where people with disabilities or minors are concerned, as regards both the provision of information and logistics, and we have adopted a number of amendments to this end.
I would just like to say, by way of conclusion, a quick word about the amendments tabled. They show that the debate on compensation amounts between those who would like them to be higher and those who would like them to be lower is still ongoing.
Certainly, at the moment, the only reaction is a certain amount of dissatisfaction regarding our proposal on the part of both airlines and consumers, and this, Commissioner, allows me to hope that, precisely because no party is satisfied, the compromise we have reached is the most balanced and most intelligent solution.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Lisi on his report.
While he was drafting it, he attended the discussions on my opinion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and incorporated many of the points raised.
Our differences are really minor, but I will return to them.
As Mr Lisi said, Members pontificate here on many subjects about which they have an imperfect knowledge, but we all regard ourselves as experts on the problems of passenger travel.
They dominate our working lives.
So there was a warm welcome for Commissioner de Palacio's proposals to move ahead from the 1991 regulations, not just on denied boarding but on delayed and cancelled flights as well.
There is no dispute that what we call the hierarchy of remedies must apply, starting with compensation levels proportionate to the distance travelled.
I think most of the airlines have responded well to this debate, with the air service passenger commitment as a gesture of intent.
I would say to those maverick airlines that ignore all that - and we know where they fly to, if not always where they live - that they would be wise to heed the public mood.
No frills should not mean no concern.
In our opinion, we are offered an amendment to Article 7 which called for levels of compensation to be based on specific impact assessments, so that it could not be argued that they were frivolously levied.
I must say that the levels of compensation in Mr Lisi's report are well beyond what we wanted under Article 7.
We wanted mandatory compensation of between EUR 300 and EUR 1 500, subject to distance and review.
That has fallen to between EUR 200 and 600, but I accept that in itself is progress for the consumer.
I am still concerned that this does not necessarily apply under Amendment No 31, which refers back to Article 9 and not Article 8.
Perhaps the Commissioner can assure me that those amendments will actually apply.
Otherwise, Mr Lisi and his committee have advanced the consumer cause and have allowed us to move forward to a system of airline ranking.
If only this applied to all airlines, all flights and all problems.
Every day further horrors come to light.
On a British airline, a woman had to endure an 11-hour flight next to a 23-stone woman who sat on her, not next to her, throughout the flight.
She was left with serious injuries and initially offered GBP 15 compensation.
You might say that the airline began with one handicapped passenger and ended with two.
Our journeys should be reducing handicaps, not increasing them.
I welcome this report as a step in that direction.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Mr Lisi, for all his hard work on this report.
I would like to support the comments he has made.
As a general observation, and taking issue with the Commission position, I would like to continue by saying that this report came as an unwelcome surprise, not least because, last year, a report on air passenger rights was taken through committee by Mr Collins, with Parliament overwhelmingly supporting a voluntary approach.
In addition, there has been no industry consultation on this issue and no business impact assessment of value.
There is no data on the projected costs to carriers; no assessment of the impact on competitiveness - between both EU and other carriers; and no information on the direct and consequential impact of this legislation.
The voluntary air passenger service commitment agreement was signed in February in Strasbourg.
Virtually all the European airlines were party to it.
It included references to a number of points contained in this proposal on delays, cancellations and diversions, special needs passengers, reducing the number of involuntary denied boardings and so on.
So why did Mr Collins and our committee go to the trouble of taking his report through Parliament when the Commission clearly had a legislative proposal in its back pocket?
The voluntary agreement has not failed; it has not even had a chance to work.
Here we are again with the Commission knocking another nail into the coffin.
The proposal is flawed in several key areas: it fails to recognise fundamental differences between scheduled and charter operations; it ignores, for example, the package travel directive covering the rights of charter passengers.
In particular, it concerns proposals on cancellations and long delays, hence the inclusion of the tour operators, as supported by our committee.
The proposal also ignored the proportion of events due to failures within the monopoly providers such as ATC and airports, and the inability of airlines to obtain compensation from them.
Given that the ticket price has gone down in the last ten years, the increase in compensation levels proposed for denied boarding by the Commission is an incredible 400%.
Left at those levels, this regulation would cost the scheduled carriers somewhere in the region of EUR 1.35 billion.
The many regional and low-cost airlines would be more critically affected, as their margins are much smaller.
In addition, none of these rules will apply to third country airlines.
We in Europe will again suffer the consequences of an unlevel playing field - another example of the Commission taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
Finally, under the leadership of our rapporteur, we have achieved a more sensible and realistic conclusion.
I live in hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament and act accordingly.
The public quite rightly expects and deserves good customer service but this proposal is a step too far.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur.
In our view, the compromise that was struck in the committee constitutes a significant step towards greater consumer protection.
At long last we have legal security on additional issues and not just voluntary commitments from the airlines.
Moreover, the regulation is of course also being extended to cover severe delays and flight cancellations.
I was not infrequently the victim of cancellations by the former airline Sabena.
No doubt other Members have had similar experiences with other airlines.
Last but not least we are doubling the current levels of compensation, which will also be more subtly differentiated than hitherto and divided into three bands.
Clearly, the issue that we most need to discuss is the level of compensation.
The objective of the regulation cannot be to abolish the practice of overbooking, but it can be to ensure that this procedure is used in a more reasonable, customer-oriented way.
Of course, we could also eliminate overbooking, as the low-cost carriers have done, if, on the other hand, flights were non-exchangeable and a no-show meant that a flight was automatically forfeited. But this is neither consumer-friendly nor justifiable on environmental grounds.
Consumers need flexibility when they are planning their journeys and half-empty planes make no sense at all from an environmental point of view.
The economic argument is even more persuasive.
If overbooking were abolished, air prices would inevitably rise and we cannot expect either consumers to put up with this or indeed the airlines, which are up against international competition.
A further reason why we can support the compromise struck in the committee on compensation levels is because we think it is important for consumers to benefit from these improved and binding rules as quickly as possible and not have to wait for them for years because the legislation is, as is so often the case, still sitting in the Council.
In the interests of consumers, my group will be voting against part of Amendment No 29, because we think that compensation only for flights that are cancelled up to 48 hours before departure is unreasonable.
At least two weeks is required here and this should be negotiated afterwards with the Council and the Commission.
In addition, we think that the inclusion of package tours in the Commission proposal is unnecessary, because they are covered by the directive on package tourism.
The fact that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has advocated the introduction of a scheme to rank airlines by user-friendliness is a strong vote in favour of the consumer.
A ranking system of this kind, as is quite usual in the USA, can help to stimulate competition between the airlines on quality and on which provides the most consumer-friendly overall service.
I hope that this proposal is also upheld in the plenary.
Against the background of the current situation, this report represents a determined step towards greater consumer-friendliness.
Many a consumer dream may fly on, but they are hopelessly overbooked.
I am broadly in agreement with the rapporteur, certainly with regard to the Commission's original proposal.
It was high time to draw up better regulations, particularly with regard to overbooking.
In my opinion, however, the Commission proposal is seriously lacking when it comes to flight cancellations and delays.
In this context, the airline companies are being held responsible for a problem that is overwhelmingly caused by air traffic control and the aviation authorities.
My objections are based on the following reasons.
The Commission proposal is not based on a proper evaluation of the economic effect, and it has not considered the consequences of the measure for the sector and in particular for ticket prices.
Although it provides increased protection, the proposal will limit the consumer's free choice.
The definition of a superior power or force majeure, given by both the Commission and our own Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, does not contain enough certainty to be able to properly distinguish between delays and flight cancellations which fall outside the responsibility of the airline companies.
It can be argued that the airline companies ought to recover the damage from the appropriate party themselves, but that is not feasible in practice.
Where we are talking about regional or low-cost airlines, it would probably be preferable to let consumers themselves choose whether to pay a premium above the price of the ticket. They could probably then cover themselves against flight cancellations.
This option could easily be introduced by the sector itself.
I have a couple of remaining questions for the Commission.
Can the Commission confirm that it intends to carry out a thorough economic analysis of the consequences and the effects of its proposal, of the increasing costs for the airline companies and of the new flight tariffs in the different segments of the aviation market?
Can the Commission confirm that it intends to investigate the real reasons for flight cancellations and delays, so that we can have a better understanding of which causes are indeed the responsibility of the airline companies and which are not?
Has the Commission also considered other policy measures which might ensure better rights for passengers than the ones presently included in their proposal?
Travel insurance aimed specifically at flight delays and cancellations might be a possible solution.
We have had further debates and further discussions here in Parliament.
My amendments are a necessary supplementary measure intended to provide a decent balance between ticket price and compensation.
The first amendment relates to denied boarding and flight cancellations. I propose a supplementary measure to the sound compromise, i.e. that there should be a different arrangement for an additional category of tickets below EUR 200.
This applies to both denied boarding and cancellation.
The other amendment relates to incoming flights, to which Mrs Foster referred and does exactly what she wants.
This is exactly what my amendment is about, and I look forward to your support tomorrow.
Mr President, it is, of course, splendid that prices have dropped following liberalisation, but never before have passengers had to suffer cancellations, denied boarding, long delays, lost luggage etc. to this extent. Being squashed into an aircraft like sardines is also a fairly recent phenomenon.
I therefore think that you are right to say that measures need to be taken urgently.
I personally would like to see all these malpractices banned, but I realise that such drastic action is not practicable.
In any case, the compensation the companies have to pay must be high enough to act as a deterrent - particularly where the airlines can rely on a system of volunteers, which should not really be so appealing as to encourage overbooking.
I hope that you will take another look at our amendments, which aim at increasing the actual compensation sums and introducing a system of classification.
I can only remind you of the number of times we seasoned fliers have all arrived at our destination after a flight only to find our luggage is not there.
What company is still customer-friendly in such circumstances?
If this cannot be done in a separate amendment, I should like to ask Mr Lisi whether he might be able to include this classification in his report, although that will be every 5 years.
I hope that this type of compensation will eventually be introduced for train passengers as well, and indeed for all individuals who are the victims of high prices and poor service.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to confirm first of all that the majority of the PPE-DE group of course supports the Commission proposal, along with the essential proposals to improve it that have been made by Mr Lisi.
The proposal has a clear two-pronged approach.
It firstly calls on the airlines to use the volunteering principle, whereby the airline makes offers to individuals to identify those who do not urgently have to take the next flight, but could also take the one after that.
It is true that experience in America with the volunteering system has been positive.
If there are not enough volunteers, however, and everyone wants to go home or to their business appointment and passengers are denied boarding, then they must have some legal redress.
They have booked a flight, they have an OK on their ticket and they therefore have a right to board.
If the airline overbooks in its own economic interests, because it knows that there are a lot of no-shows, then it must pay if it cannot uphold the booking.
It is as simple as that.
Because if passengers have an OK on their ticket they have the certainty that they can travel, and if they cannot then the carrier has to pay.
Commissioner, you were, of course, a little harsh about the level of the payments.
My colleague, Mrs Foster, with whom I do not always agree, said something that is very true.
Air prices have fallen in recent years and that is why the argument that we should set compensation very high, so as to take account of recent cost increases, is clearly flawed, because air prices have fallen.
Most of us in any case are familiar with the ingenious system of special tariffs, which mean that you can easily fly at more reasonable prices than those prescribed.
With this in mind, please understand that we have reduced the compensation to a level that we deem to be economically fair.
Our view is that if excessive compensation is paid to passengers who are not taken on board, the carriers will pass on these costs to all passengers, and then general price levels will rise, which will affect more people than those denied boarding.
I say to Members of the Liberal Group - we usually see eye to eye, but today, exceptionally, we do not - that we have to set a flat rate of compensation for two reasons: firstly, the prejudice suffered by anyone who is denied boarding is always the same, whether they have paid EUR 150, EUR 500 or more for their ticket.
They have been given a guarantee that they will fly and they are left behind.
It is completely irrelevant how much the ticket cost.
Their confidence has been damaged, and more besides.
That is why I believe that the low-cost carriers, which actually do not have any problems with overbooking because they do not accept more passengers than have booked, should also compensate passengers for any injury caused if they cancel a flight for economic reasons, and they obviously do this from time to time.
We need uniform tariffs so as to make the job of the poor airport staff easier.
You see, if a passenger is denied boarding or a flight is cancelled, we want the compensation to be paid at the gate.
You really cannot expect the poor flight attendant to calculate thousands of prices and people to wait until she has calculated the individual compensation entitlements.
I therefore believe that our proposal is quite sensible.
With your permission, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who is unfortunately unable to speak this evening and who has asked me to make some points for her, I should like to refer once again to the split vote that we are proposing on Article 3(2).
This states that the regulation does not apply to passengers travelling at a reduced fare which is not available directly or indirectly to the public.
We fear that this wording is very vague.
We should state quite clearly that a passenger travelling at a reduced fare also has a right to full compensation.
I believe that it is very important that the provision is interpreted in this way.
Commissioner, I should like to ask you one more question.
As you know, Mr Lisi has made a very good proposal on Article 13, namely that the Member States have to ensure that if a carrier pays compensation and is not in actual fact responsible for the delay or cancellation it may have recourse to those responsible, whether it be air traffic control or other bodies, including state-owned systems.
With a view to ensuring fair burden-sharing, can you assure us that, if we make the airlines responsible for paying compensation in the first place, they will also be able to have recourse to any state-owned organisations that have caused the delay or cancellation?
You would assist us greatly if you were to support this portion of our amendments.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of air transport has brought countless advantages for passengers.
Nevertheless, lower prices and greater demand have not put an end to consumer complaints, as we all know.
As some Members have already said, we are seeing cancelled or delayed flights, passengers being denied boarding, problems with baggage and so on.
This is unacceptable!
In order better to protect consumers, the liberalisation of air transport requires better market management and rationalisation.
The harmonisation of current legislation is becoming crucial in light of the new state of affairs.
It also makes perfect sense to involve operators in this sector, forcing them to adopt rules for the protection of citizens, enabling authorities to intervene in the event that the guarantees for protection that have been announced should prove to be insufficient.
I also believe the intervention of the authorities is extremely important.
The operators' involvement of passengers by appealing for volunteers, involving them directly in the negotiation and acceptance of alternative arrangements, is a good approach that will make the management of reservations more flexible and will contribute to passenger protection, improving the efficiency of the operation.
I would reiterate here the issue of the competent authority: the proposal for a regulation reveals the importance of Article 14, which deals with the obligation on the part of the authority in this field to inform passengers of their rights.
Basically, this reincorporates an amendment adopted by Parliament in its response to the Commission's 1998 proposal.
Passengers must be informed clearly and transparently about how to contact the competent national body - of which they are often, even usually, unaware - responsible for dealing with complaints about the regulation.
I would also emphasise the importance of Article 17, concerning implementation, which obliges Member States to designate the body responsible for the implementation of the regulation, to provide them with information and to force them to comply with measures ensuring that passengers' rights are respected.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, because I have seen and experienced the intensity with which he prepared his report.
It is a difficult report, given that, as we can see, it raises several points which run counter to the Commissioner's proposal, whereas this committee has generally shared the Commissioner's criteria.
And in this case, we can see that there are certain discrepancies between the Commission proposal and what is now being suggested by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner, because, regardless of the discrepancies that have been highlighted in the debate today, it was clear from the Commission debate that great courage was required to address a number of requirements from European citizens and users concerning the airlines.
And although we do not currently agree, and we do not share the proposals made by the Commission, it has forced us to discuss the subject and try to align our positions.
I would also like to say that no sector can or should try to survive on subsidies or by abusing its users. There is no future in that.
We are facing - as the sector is aware - the need to restructure the sector.
We need to tell the sector that it has one last chance, that we do not agree with the Commission proposals, that we should improve and strengthen previous proposals, make previous proposals stricter, but that the sector must move with the times; it must change, modernise and be able to respond.
Otherwise, the citizens, who are our voters, are going to require us to be capable of defending their rights.
At the same time, we must also try - and this is the message of the Parliamentary committee - to reach out to the sector during the difficult process of restructuring and modernisation.
This is a difficult, complicated economic sector, and we are reaching out to it.
I understand the difficulties involved and congratulate both the rapporteur and the Vice-President on having the courage to address this matter.
Mr President, I should like begin by congratulating Mrs de Palacio on having proposed a text of this nature.
I believe it was necessary and timely in light of two phenomena: on the one hand, the democratisation of air traffic that we must anticipate in all its forms and with all the consequences it entails and, on the other, the increase in denied boarding, which occurs sometimes and quite often - increasingly often, in fact - for reasons that are not openly declared and which are often commercial.
It was, therefore, absolutely crucial to continue to make progress in affirming and protecting passengers' rights, whilst avoiding falling into the trap of seeing the matter as all black or all white, and in particular the trap of excessively condemning the airlines.
In this regard, I wish to congratulate our rapporteur and the entire Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I would say that following this reading in the Committee on Transport, we are finally achieving quite a healthy balance.
A balance first of all between passengers' rights and a flexible service.
Overbooking in particular is a bad thing when it is a systematic commercial practice, but it is also an argument for flexibility between those who cancel at the last moment, because customers are sometimes also responsible for overbooking, and those who could take their place.
Balance has also been reached between airlines' liability for compensation and the basic economic requirements of air transport, so that the payment of compensation does not have an undue knock-on effect on prices at a time when the economic situation is difficult or does not lead to an increase in prices for passengers.
Lastly, balance has been reached between the cost of denied boarding and the precautionary principle in the field of safety.
What had to be avoided at all costs was for sanctions or compensation to be so high that they cause airlines not to take major technical incidents quite so seriously, in other words, using safety to offset the costs of denied boarding.
As a result of these various balances that have been achieved, the Committee on Transport has backed Mr Lisi and has today provided us with a useful text.
My hope is that the Commission will take account of the comments and the recommendations of the European Parliament.
I must also, however, express one regret: perhaps we have not been firm enough on waiting lists, which are often unclear and on which we should have forced airlines to allocate passengers seats in the order in which they booked.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all of us here in this room spend far more time than we would like on planes and at airports.
These issues affect us all too often, either because we ourselves are affected by delays or cancellations, overbooking and the like or because we experience at second hand what happens to other passengers and that is not always pleasant.
Often it is even very unpleasant.
In this situation, the European legislator has to act in the interests of consumers, but also in the interests of the air transport sector as a whole.
Much has already been said about the rules that we are examining here at first reading and on which we will vote tomorrow, about how best to tackle the problem of denied boarding, and about reasonable rules in the case of delays.
Naturally, all these rules and regulations bring the industry little joy, particularly in the current difficult economic climate.
But this is of course not only about the airlines; it is also and above all about the passengers.
They in any case are repeatedly and increasingly frequently finding themselves to be the weaker party, and we need to protect and support them with European law.
There is one other player that we should consider here; I refer to the airport operators.
They have been experiencing many problems recently because of increased concerns about terrorism and security.
They have resolved a number of them, but in some cases their activities have become extremely expensive.
There is another problem that remains unresolved: how passengers are treated.
Nowadays flying is a massive business; there is no doubt about it.
This should not mean, however, that passengers are treated like herds of animals.
Perhaps we could also address these aspects of flying in the foreseeable future and regulate them accordingly.
Passengers will thank us for it.
I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their speeches, which have shown differences on certain points, but which in any event support the idea of improving the quality of service in air transport.
As several of you have pointed out, we are all significant users of this type of transport and therefore victims of low quality service.
I would like in particular to thank Mr Lisi for the effort he has made to find common ground between all the various positions.
Certain amendments are intended to exclude passengers of combined journeys from the scope of the Regulation.
We believe that it is also necessary to protect this type of passenger.
It is true that the specific Regulation provides for this protection, but not in an automatic way, but following a series of very complex procedures, including in some cases hearings before the courts.
What we need to do is provide a simple, immediate and automatic solution for users of combined transport; we cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 13 and 15.
With regard to the sums of compensation, I said at the beginning that we are prepared to be flexible in relation to our initial position and, in this regard, the Commission cannot accept amendments such as No 23 and part of No 24 and No 31, which eliminates compensation in cases of slight delay.
For the same reason, we cannot accept Amendment No 44 or Amendment No 45.
However, we can accept Amendment No 40 - which Mrs Maes mentioned a moment ago - because it makes our position more flexible and means that we offer quantities which may be more balanced.
Furthermore, it should be made very clear who is responsible for compensating passengers and offering them assistance in airports.
We have chosen a simple solution: the responsibility falls to the company that has made the contract with the passenger, whether that be an airline or a tour operator.
The Transport Committee has recommended joint responsibility between the company and the carrier, but this could create uncertainty for passengers.
Therefore, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 16, 17, 18, 19 nor part of Nos 28, 29, 30 and part of No 31.
Amendments Nos 4 and 21 could restrict the flexibility that airlines need to negotiate with possible volunteers and Amendment No 7 and part of Nos 14, 17, 20 and part of No 22 could hinder the practical application of the rules.
A significant proportion of Amendments Nos 25 and 33 would unnecessarily restrict the rights of passengers and we therefore reject them.
With regard to Amendment No 43, which would exclude third-country flights, we cannot accept it since it would disadvantage Community operators.
Finally, Amendments Nos 5, 35 and 37 propose measures which are outside the scope of the Regulation we are discussing.
Although we identify with the objectives they pursue and we are preparing proposals in relation to them, we regret that we cannot accept them and I would point out that, as Mr Vairinhos said a moment ago, information to users is absolutely essential if these rights are to be effective; hence the campaigns we have carried out to date with the support of the airports and the tour operators, but also - and I must make this very clear - with the support of the airlines, which cooperated significantly in relation to the objective of improving the quality of service.
I would like once again to thank Mr Lisi and the honourable Members and hope that we can achieve a good result which will be of benefit to the consumers.
Thank you very much, Madam Vice-President.
You have received many congratulations today; I imagine that the honourable Members will continue to congratulate you despite the fact that you have not accepted all the amendments tabled, and let us hope that there will be agreement and success in the House.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
I must tell you that there are many reports today and the debates should be concluded today.
I would therefore ask you to adhere as closely as possible to the scheduled timing.
The next item is the report (A5-0316/2002) by Mr Khanbhai, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on sustainable agricultural policy, agrarian reform and rural development for self-reliance in developing countries (2001/2274(INI)).
. Mr President, Mr Khanbhai sends his sincere apologies for not being here to present his report.
Unforeseen circumstances have forced him to return to the UK this evening.
I would like to stress that this is his report, and I thank him for his work and his willingness to cooperate with other parties.
It is perhaps appropriate that Mr Khanbhai drew up this report, because he was born in Tanzania, where his family have lived for 170 years.
He and I have travelled extensively in rural Africa and we share many views on the eradication of poverty in developing countries.
It is therefore a pleasure to stand in for him today.
It is unacceptable that even today, more than one billion people are living on less than a dollar a day in rural areas of developing countries.
They have no access to water, sanitation, electricity, health services or education.
The poor are hungry, have no jobs, and fear disease.
More than 40 years of international aid have not eliminated poverty.
Many of these poor countries have huge debts, and their people are worse off than they were 25 years ago when LomÃ© assistance started.
The EU is the largest donor in the world.
Why have we not identified the country-specific problems, so that we can focus our aid on attacking the causes of poverty?
I have been travelling in the ACP countries for over 20 years.
The major cause of poverty is the lack of investment in rural areas.
We need to invest in helping the rural population to have a stake in their local economies.
These people need infrastructure, technical skills for farming and animal husbandry, and vocational training to establish small businesses in the agro-processing, engineering, IT and service sectors.
They need the kind of support provided by micro-finance schemes such as the Gramine Bank in Bangladesh, and I strongly support Mr Khanbhai in this matter.
A 'bottom-up' approach is the only way to regenerate rural areas.
Asian countries like China, India and Bangladesh were food-deficient and net importers 20 years ago.
Subsidies to farmers, selecting appropriate seed, irrigation, micro-finance for small farmers, establishing food cooperatives and other rural investments transformed the agricultures of these countries.
Today, they grow enough food for their huge populations and have surplus for exports.
There must be a lesson here.
The EU and the US offer substantial subsidies to their farmers.
Without such subsidies, there would be no economic prosperity in countries like Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and France, which have all benefited from European subsidies.
Without investment in Europe's rural infrastructure, the EU would not function as it does today.
Sadly, international aid for rural areas in sub-Saharan countries has dropped from EUR 14 billion in 1988 to EUR 8 billion in 1998. This has resulted in a sharp decline in food production.
It has been aggravated by natural disasters, both drought and floods.
A decade of famine and malnutrition has precipitated disease, fear, social tension and civil war in many poor countries.
The EU needs to encourage land reform, the efficient and fair utilisation of water resources and the transfer of technology for the rural populations of poor countries.
We need to teach them to grow their own food, create their own employment and sustain their own economies.
The poor do not wish to beg for life; they value their self-respect and dignity in the same way as we do.
They do not want our fish.
They need to learn how to fish and feed themselves.
I agree with Mr Khanbhai that this is the spirit within which the EU should reassess its policy on aid.
Agriculture, agrarian reform and rural economic development should be top priority areas for EU assistance.
This will help production, employment and the sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries, enabling the poor to be self-reliant and break their dependence on our aid.
I hope that the House will accept this report.
Mr Khanbhai has agreed to over 75 per cent of the amendments that have been tabled.
Mr President, the Commission would first like to thank Mr Khanbhai - and Mr Corrie as his stand-in - for their work in bringing an issue as important as sustainable rural development to this debate.
Poverty and food insecurity in developing countries will not be eradicated without substantial investment in rural areas.
The Commission fully shares the main thrust of the report on the importance of rural and agricultural development for poor people in developing countries.
Beyond rural development, the report also addresses issues related to EU trade and agricultural policy.
It underlines the importance of improving trade opportunities for the rural poor, which we fully share.
In this respect, the World Summit on Sustainable Development reconfirmed the commitments made in the WTO Ministerial Declaration in Doha - the so-called Doha Development Agenda.
These include taking into account the specificity of developing countries in the trade negotiations and putting in place flanking measures such as capacity building and trade-related technical assistance.
The Commission has recently sent to the Council and Parliament a communication that will provide the policy framework for this type of assistance.
The Commission wants to highlight the positive trade agenda promoted by the European Union and adopted in Johannesburg to complement the WTO process.
It is also worth recalling that the Union is committed to providing to least-developed countries, through the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, full duty-free and quota-free access to the European market.
We hope to see similar initiatives adopted by other developed countries.
As regards agriculture, the Commission supports the emphasis on the multifunctionality of agriculture, a concept of particular relevance for developing countries.
However, I would like to draw your attention to the reference made in the report to the dumping of European agricultural production.
The Community provides an export refund, which reduces the difference between the higher Community price and the world price.
Technically that cannot be called dumping.
Ceilings on export subsidies, in quantity and value, are regulated by the WTO, and these ceilings have been reduced between 1995 and 2000.
The Community has constantly reduced its use of export refunds, beyond WTO obligations.
These positive efforts should be recognised.
But rural development is the main focus of the report.
For many donors, including the European Commission, rural poverty is a multidimensional issue.
To address it, it is necessary to combine interventions at different levels.
At national level, we need to improve incomes, reduce inequality in access to productive assets and services, combat the degradation of natural resources and reduce vulnerability to risk.
At an international level, we need to improve the coherence between developed countries' domestic policies - in particular trade and agriculture - and their development objectives.
In developing countries, addressing such a complex set of issues requires coherent and balanced national strategies tailored to local needs, resources and institutional settings.
Although there is no 'one size fits all' solution, the Commission, in its recent communication, 'Fighting Rural Poverty', has identified some key principles to be applied in all rural development interventions.
They include the importance of promoting gender equality, maximising the impact on poverty, supporting national strategies and the participation of stakeholders, as well as mainstreaming environmental protection.
Support for pro-poor land reforms, capacity-building, improved access to financial services, agricultural research, infrastructure and services are all areas whose importance is underlined in the Commission strategy and in which the Community's development programme is heavily involved.
Similarly, the Commission also broadly shares other, more specific recommendations, such as the importance of supporting the development of arts and crafts, rural training centres and domestication of wildlife.
However, the level of priority of such interventions depends on local circumstances and on their relevance for poverty reduction.
Support for such activities will therefore have to be addressed on a case?by-case basis and in line with the priorities defined in national strategies.
Rural development is also primarily about decentralisation and local governance.
Resources will only reach the rural poor if they can be managed effectively and planned in a participatory way, with the active involvement of local communities.
The most disadvantaged sections of societies - particularly women - must be effectively represented and participate in these processes.
Reinforcing and democratising local institutions is a key challenge for governments and donors alike.
The report rightly emphasises the importance of good governance for the sustainability of all development efforts.
Once again I thank the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai, and Mr Corrie.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Khanbhai very much for drafting his report and also for making it possible for us to cooperate so effectively with all colleagues.
Agriculture and rural development are of central importance in the EU and developing countries alike.
That is why I support and welcome the fact that 'food security and sustainable rural development strategies' is one of the six priorities listed for EU development policy.
The multifunctional agricultural model and its underlying philosophy is, I believe, also the only right way forward for developing countries.
We should continue to support the approach of making sustainable management one of the non-trade concerns.
Let me remind you that the EU is by far the world's largest importer of agricultural products from poor countries.
The Commissioner has already pointed out that the EU has substantially increased market access for the poorest countries in recent years.
I hope that other industrialised countries will also follow the EU's example.
The agripolitical measures in the developing countries should not focus exclusively on exports, but must above all guarantee the food security of the domestic population.
The war on poverty must continue to be the overriding aim of development policy.
An important precondition for this is to improve the infrastructure for supplying energy, for transport, for water supply and distribution and for health and education.
Above all, however, improved governmental and administrative systems as well as democracy and the rule of law are necessary, as has already been said, to enable robust policy-making.
Appropriate land reform and access to water and productive resources can enable the rural population to increase their standard of living and help to boost economic development.
To support the process of building appropriate capacities in the developing countries, the European Community should provide more technical help for farmers and also pass on technical know-how, for example on renewable energies and in many other areas.
A further essential aspect is, in my view, policy in rural areas, so as to stop migration to the slums, and it is also important that there be proper recognition of the work carried out by women.
Mr President, agriculture, support for rural development and the protection of rural communities are at the heart of Mr Khanbhai's report and he addresses many of the fundamental inequities which feature so prominently in the lives of the rural poor.
Clearly, as other speakers have said, the European Union and its Member States have a very important role to play.
I think we need to show much more understanding of the real reasons for the so-called urban drift from rural areas and of the effect of the systems and structures which conspire to destroy the livelihoods of millions who live by the land.
The European Union is, of course, part of the solution.
As the biggest trading block, we have an important role to play.
I have to say that it is sheer hypocrisy to continue to protect our own agricultural competitive position with higher resources, while at the same time forcing developing countries to liberalise.
Rapid opening of their markets threatens food security and sustainable livelihoods in developing countries.
The parallel negotiations which will be going on at the WTO and between the ACP and the European Union must be used as an opportunity to show that the European Union clearly understands that trade and market access and tariff levels are directly and inextricably linked to our understanding of how we meet those critical millennium development goals.
The paradox is that, in a time of global plenty, farmers in developing countries are abandoning the land and agriculture.
They simply cannot compete with heavily subsidised food flooding into their markets and dumped on their markets.
The report describes the effect of the dumping of milk on Jamaica and the dumping of beef on West Africa.
In Uganda, for instance, the coffee growers are suffering enormously.
One hundred and fifty Ugandan shillings are what a grower gets for a kilo of the coffee he grows.
If you go down to the Sheraton in Kampala, you pay one thousand Ugandan shillings for one single cup of coffee.
With growers receiving such a poor reward for their efforts, it is not surprising that Oxfam describes this as a situation that affects health and education and the whole rural community.
So small farmers from Haiti to Mexico and Mozambique to Tanzania are simply selling up and selling out.
They are unable to compete with the rich agricultural barons.
That is the reality we are facing, one which Mr Khanbhai deals with very well indeed.
He also gives us a very timely reminder in his report that 75% of the 1.2 billion living on less than one dollar a day are in rural areas.
That certainly is a call to action.
Mr President, the existence and the development of an agricultural industry are key issues for the countries of the South.
They often have great potential in this area.
Ambitious agricultural reforms are or ought to be dedicated to this.
The main issue, however, concerns these countries' self-sufficiency in food.
This is why, from the outset, I wish to support my group's call for the right to food sovereignty, in other words, people's right to define their own policy, to be recognised in a specific United Nations convention.
Developing countries are often restricted to exporting a few unprocessed products.
All the evidence suggests, however, that specialising in exports of raw materials is relatively unprofitable and weakens economies by making them subject to the whims of world markets.
Furthermore, the destruction of traditional food-producing farming caused by single-crop farming for export does not benefit anyone apart from huge multinationals.
Over and above this, as the report quite rightly states, unbridled global free trade has devastating effects on the agriculture of the South.
The opening up of agricultural markets forces farmers to produce at prices set by the international market.
These are so low that they allow neither the farmers of the North nor those of the South to produce in a way that respects the environment and at the same time to earn enough money to support their families.
Given these circumstances, as one NGO working in Burkina Faso has expressed it, how can we persuade people that international trade is the key to development in the countries of the South?
The countries of the North have always protected their agriculture.
Why should a system that has worked well and which is still working well for the North no longer be good for the South?
Should the opening up of the markets, therefore, benefit the peasant farmers or the multinationals that are buying up the banana plantations of Cameroon or CÃŽte-d'Ivoire, for example?
Enabling developing countries to safeguard their basic right to food security and to the survival of their farming methods therefore requires clear principles to be brought to international negotiations, starting with the recognition, by the WTO, of the need for preferential and differentiated treatment for developing countries, which must be interpreted with this aim in mind.
As far as we are concerned, the European Union cannot continue, on the one hand, to call for the development of the countries of the South and, on the other, to uphold an agricultural policy which ruins much of their efforts in this sector.
There is now, therefore, an undeniable need to speed up the elimination of export subsidies granted by the Union, and we must also condemn the major increase in subsidies for agriculture determined by the US agricultural guidance law, with subsidies of around USD 180 billion over ten years.
Next, the EU ought to play a much more active role in ensuring that fair prices are set on the world market and thereby prevent the deterioration of trade terms.
The burden of debt also contributes to an increase in export crops in order to obtain the currency needed to pay back this debt.
Its cancellation, therefore, remains more topical than ever.
Lastly, and on this note I shall conclude, with regard to aid, investment must be made as a matter of urgency in human resources and infrastructures, especially in transport.
It is also crucial to preserve water and biodiversity as public commodities.
Mr President, I support this report wholeheartedly, but I wonder, Commissioner, if we do not manage to do what you so rightly say, and if we do not manage to do what this report says, whether we will be part of the problem or part of the solution?
Our wealth means that we ought to be part of the solution.
When I read in the report that investment in rural economies has almost halved over the last ten years, then we should not be surprised that the income of the rural population has also dropped.
When I toured Africa I was ashamed; throughout the rural areas of any country, people living in remote rural areas have nothing, they scarcely have a chance of survival.
For this reason, I want to ask that we set priorities.
That from now on we should declare that we will stop selling products from our markets that will cause problems for local producers.
We should set honest prices.
I agree with what has been said about the price of coffee.
I would like to propose that we now start by abolishing unnecessary subsidies on exports; that we set up a phased plan in which we demonstrate that we want to help rural economies, rural culture, the men and women - as you correctly stressed - who live there, to produce their own food by their own efforts, with our specific help, using environmentally-friendly methods and new forms of energy without being dragged into a system of agricultural production which has proved disadvantageous for our own countries.
Mr President, we have a long way to go before successfully bridging the gap between Third World poverty and living standards in the developed world.
The proposed enlargement of the European Union reminds us of the inequalities between existing Member States and the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
While I am not suggesting that our efforts should be concentrated on assisting these countries in preference to Third World countries, the more we consolidate the economies, particularly the agricultural economies of the proposed new Member States, the more successful we will be in achieving our goal for Third World development.
It does no harm to remind ourselves - and I do not say that for any selfish reason - that the EU's commitment to sustainability of family farming, both in existing Member States and for new entrants, is facing considerable difficulties.
While the Commission proposals for a further reform of the CAP are likely to be more compatible with Third World development needs, I fear that our aspirations to protect Community farmers, particularly those on the margins, are not going to be easy to achieve.
The fact that 1.2 billion people living in the rural areas of developing countries live in poverty is a shocking indictment of the developed world, but equally the long-term development and sustainability of Third World economies depend on our efforts and - hopefully - success in helping them to develop and add value to their natural resources, with corresponding measures to assist with market access for their products.
It should not, however, go unnoticed that the EU is the world's largest food importer, with 53% coming from developing countries thanks to the CAP compatible trade concessions.
I agree with Parliament's Committee on Agriculture's viewpoint that uncontrolled free world trade has had devastating effects on the development of food crops in developing countries and their entitlement to protect producers by tariff barriers.
As regards agricultural and rural development, the EU and developing countries have the same objective of developing a multifunctional form of agriculture with increasing emphasis on rural development and the sustainability of rural communities.
It is wrong to place all the blame for the problems of developing countries on the common agricultural policy, particularly for the reasons I have stated.
I support the continuing access of products from developing countries to Community markets but believe the transition must be gradual and carefully planned in tandem with CAP reform.
I abhor the term 'dumping' in so far as it refers to food produced in excess of market requirements.
It makes no sense to overproduce a food product for which there are no consumers and even less sense to offload that product in a manner which disrupts the agricultural economy of developing countries.
Farmers and processors must be discouraged from seeking over-access to the markets of developing countries as a substitute for poor marketing and product diversification within the Community or other developed economies.
Mr President, I heartily agree with the aims of the Khanbhai report, which deals with the issue of how to reconcile European agricultural methods with the development of agriculture in the developing world.
I should like to make three observations about this well-balanced and explicit report.
First of all, a proper anti-dumping policy is necessary in order to bring about more reasonable world market prices.
Dumping product surpluses onto world markets at extremely low prices in many cases makes world market prices drop to very low levels.
This makes it almost impossible for farmers in poor countries to participate independently in world trade at market prices.
The European Union is, however, still guilty of dumping in return for export subsidies.
These subsidies account for 8% of the agricultural budget, which runs to EUR 40 billion.
The rapporteur ought to have highlighted the abolition of export subsidies more clearly.
Secondly, the situation for poor countries can be improved by giving them greater access to the European market for products that are essential to them.
Access to the European market is hindered by tariff barriers and, more particularly, by non-tariff barriers such as health and environmental requirements.
Increased access is especially crucial for countries that are only active in one product category, such as bananas, sugar or cotton.
The rapporteur recognises the need to diversify exports and indeed makes practical suggestions.
Finally, the trading position of poor countries is helped most by targeted development cooperation.
The report correctly refers to the need for facilitating support.
Structural aid for basic infrastructure comes primarily from the Member States.
The report should therefore leave the setting of priorities with regard to spending this money to the donors and recipient countries themselves.
Overall, the report contributes towards achieving a productive relationship between the agricultural sectors of Europe and the developing countries.
Mr President, Commissioner, this report contains some very important statements, particularly where it recognises that mechanisms to protect EU farmers through the common agricultural policy are competing with the interests of farmers in developing countries, where it calls - as Members have done repeatedly - for the progressive elimination of trade and tariff barriers and increased access to markets for producers from developing countries and regrets the EU subsidised produce dumped on developing country markets.
The report contradicts itself on this matter, predicting devastating effects of free trade which I am sure will not come to pass in the agricultural sector, but the central concern, which, I repeat, has been mentioned several times in this evening's debate too, is - and, at European level, must be - the barriers which the European Union continues to erect to access of goods, including agricultural produce, from developing countries.
We must bear in mind that farm subsidies in wealthy countries amount to USD 350 billion per year, which is seven times more than the USD 50 billion which the same countries appropriate each year to external aid.
In this connection, we could recall what Oxfam pointed out too, namely that, in actual fact, thanks, purely, to trade barriers, the aid we give to a continent such as Africa, for instance, is less than the value of the trade opportunities we provide for these countries.
There are two things I would like to say to the European Commission. I believe that we need to reflect on the characteristics of an agricultural policy which would be sustainable for the developing countries and, therefore, on the fact that the Community agricultural policy is unsustainable.
I believe we must start to take the line that the CAP has to be abolished, albeit gradually, for there are no longer any economic, social, national, European or international grounds for preserving the CAP system.
The reform proposal put forward by the Commission is inadequate in this sense, for it preserves the amount of aid completely intact.
The report helps us to understand the devastating impact of this on the developing countries.
The Commissioner mentioned the Everything but Arms initiative, and rightly so, but I would like to remind her and the House as a whole that the Everything but Arms initiative itself provides for the deferral of the definitive abolition of tariffs on three major products - bananas, rice and sugar - to 2009.
I feel that this does us no credit at all.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Khanbhai for his excellent report.
Despite the moderate tone of the report, he makes some criticism of the European Union and the CAP, which I feel is, in some cases, unfair.
Firstly, the report does not acknowledge the fact that the EU is today the largest market in the world for agri-food products from the poorest countries.
We need only remember that the EU is the world's largest importer of agricultural products and that imports from developing countries stand at more than EUR 27 billion per year, in other words, more than all imports from these countries bought by the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Canada and Australia put together.
Secondly, the EU and its Member States are by far the largest supporters of these countries, providing, for example, around USD 28 billion of development aid, compared to the USD 11 billion provided by Japan or the USD 9 billion from the United States.
Thirdly, we should remember that, in negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, it is the European Union that has pushed hardest for positive discrimination in favour of developing countries and that it is the EU that is responsible for the most important initiative for the world's 50 poorest countries: the 'Everything but arms' initiative, which proposes allowing the main products of these countries onto the Community market free of any tariff and without these countries having to accept any reciprocal measures in this area.
Lastly, I should like to point out that, fundamentally, farming in the EU complements farming in developing countries, since these are major importers of products from temperate zones, whereas the European Union is a major importer of tropical products.
The conflict is often seen more from the point of view of the interests of certain companies operating in these countries than from the point of view of the interests of local communities.
Mr President, in this year 2002 during which the international community has met successively in Monterrey, Rome and Johannesburg, setting as a priority the challenge of leading two-thirds of humanity out of the situation of hunger, poverty and under-development that affects them, it seemed that the European Parliament was obliged to consider and adopt a position on how the European Union can support agricultural and rural development policies that contribute to the development of the countries of the South.
The numerous amendments, which the rapporteur has shown flexibility in accepting, mean that we are faced with an acceptable and balanced motion for a resolution.
But there are principles that we should take more account of when assessing the different policies of the European Union and also, of course, Community agricultural policies.
In fact, for many years the Socialists, when judging any Community policy, have used the yardstick of what that policy offered in terms of social cohesion.
To this end a particular policy was considered by us to be positive insofar as it offered added value in terms of the cohesion of our societies and negative insofar as it increased inequalities between the Europeans.
Well, in the global world we are becoming involved in it is clear that solidarity cannot be an exclusively internal, or intra-European, value.
And therefore, every Community policy deserves our support insofar as they contribute not only to social cohesion within our borders but also to reducing inequalities at world level.
For us, the common agricultural policy was something to be welcomed, since it supported our farmers, so that they would not be left behind in a process of prosperity which was benefiting other sectors of society.
But, later on, when it comes to evaluating the Community's agricultural policies, it will not be sufficient to measure whether they contribute to maintaining or improving the situation of our farmers and breeders.
Furthermore, we should consider whether subsidies to our producers also contribute to improving the situation in the Third World, or whether they actually devastate it, increasing the chasm separating it from our developed world.
In this case, those policies will not be acceptable and, however difficult the exercise will be, others will have to be found which are good, fair and provide a balance for the North, while being good and fair for the South, and providing a balance in terms of relations between the South and the North.
From this viewpoint we will vote in favour of the Resolution proposed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation as a conclusion to the report presented by Mr Khanbhai.
Mr President, the problem of food security and famine faced by 20% of the world's population is, without doubt, a blot on the copybook of modern civilisation and proves that capitalism is unable to resolve even basic problems.
The salient features of this report are a hypocritical interest in the people and farmers of developing countries, wishful thinking and contradictions and its ultimate purpose is to offer those responsible for the problem an alibi so that they can continue with the very policy which is exacerbating the problem.
The objective of the proposed draft is to resolve the food security problem and it sets an interim date of 2015 for halving the number of people forced to live on a dollar a day.
This objective is cancelled out by CAP reforms, which cut Community agricultural output in order to bring it into line with the international market, as defined by the WTO rather than mankind's food requirements.
Why?
Because, according to the prevailing view in the European Union, food is not a commodity that meets various needs, it is a commodity that guarantees huge profits for the food industry and multinationals.
With its endless reforms of the CAP, the European Union is becoming more and more product-deficient, ruining farmers and, at the same time, forcing developing countries, with extortionate agreements and price mechanisms, to sell their agricultural produce at knock-down prices, tightening the noose around the neck of their people and protecting the multinationals' profits.
The solution is not to abolish subsidies in developed countries, ruining their farmers and bringing them into line with farmers in developing countries, but to maintain a parity in international trading relations between developed and developing countries in practice, so as to improve their standard of living, reduce their foreign debt and increase their overall domestic output.
The wishful thinking and contradictions in the report reach the height of hypocrisy in the proposal to fund genetically modified crops for developing countries, to be supplied by various multinationals and never mind the consequences.
We know from experience that famine is a political and social problem, not a technical problem.
We have the productive potential and wherewithal to feed the entire world and still take care of the environment and public health, but not under the current social system, by which I mean the prevailing capitalist system.
This report keeps to the standard formula and offers no positive suggestions to mitigate the global food problem.
On the contrary, the measures it proposes will exacerbate the problem, which will be compounded by serious risks to the environment and public health and the dependency of developing countries on multinationals in the developed world.
Mr President, of the world's six billion inhabitants, more than 800 million today suffer from malnutrition and of this figure, three-quarters live in rural areas; poor peasant farmers who are poorly equipped and have no market on which to sell their goods and who therefore restrict their production to their own consumption needs.
It is crucial to understand that the majority of those going hungry are not city-dwellers who can buy food but rural producers of food crops.
It is, therefore, the fall in the price of farm produce that is leaving the third world hungry.
Only access to the markets at reasonable prices can provide these poor peasant farmers with a sufficient income to modernise their production, buy tools and gain access to chemicals, to irrigation, and to better seeds.
The countries that have been most successful in staving off famine, particularly India and China, are those that, as a result of policies supporting agricultural prices, subsidies for chemicals and for transport and irrigation infrastructures, have enabled their farmers to access their own internal market and thereby increase their buying power, their productivity and their production.
On the other hand, the countries in which famine has spread are those in which the fall in agricultural prices has thrown peasant farmers into poverty, destabilising marketing networks, and has forced many of those living in rural areas, oppressed by poverty, towards ill-equipped suburbs or into emigrating.
It is therefore crucial that we halt the fall in agricultural prices.
Access to a profitable local market is the primary right of any agricultural producer, the primary condition for growth in agricultural production and a prerequisite for eliminating hunger from the world.
We must give up on the crazy Utopian idea of making the planet one immense borderless market.
It makes no sense at all to attempt to pit a peasant farmer in Chad against a farmer in Minnesota or an Andean shepherd against a large New Zealand landowner .
Countries which act as propagandists for this single world market, not least those that are members of the Cairns group, are not countries suffering from famine, but countries which, as a result of particularly low production costs, huge areas of farmland, low wages and top-rate agricultural investment are capable of ruining the farming of those countries that do not share these advantages.
As for the policies maintained by the European Union, there are three conclusions to be drawn.
First, the agricultural development projects that we fund in the developing countries must all contain a section for assistance for the marketing of food produce.
Second, we must help developing countries, or groups of countries with similar production costs, to protect their domestic markets against dumping prices set by the world market, by means of instruments without which their producers would face ruin.
Third, we must bring all our influence to bear on international trade negotiations to ensure that the right to agricultural exception, i.e., a nation's right to protect the farmers that provide its food, is recognised.
This was the aim, Mr President, of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture.
These have been adopted by the Committee on Development and I ask you to give them your support.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank my colleague, Mr Khanbhai, very much for his own-initiative report.
As a member of Parliament's ACP delegation, I have been concerned with this issue for years.
Sustainable agricultural policy, land reform and rural development are important political challenges with a view to the developing countries being entirely independent.
Why, with our considerable financial aid, have we not been able to make a more decisive contribution to improving the situation in the poorest countries?
I constantly ask myself what Europe is doing wrong.
What are the rich countries doing wrong, but also what do the poor countries gain by stepping up their own efforts?
I think that we will have to get much tougher on these issues because we can see - and have examples to prove it - that the world population is not prepared to put up with this injustice any longer.
As European politicians working on agriculture, we know only too well that the European Community's common agricultural policy regularly comes in for harsh criticism for the impact that it has on agriculture in the poorest countries and this has again been the case this evening in a number of contributions to the debate.
It is true, however, that the critics often think that the answer is too easy, because it is wrong to think that a greater opening up of trade will inevitably lead to better development of the food sector in the developing countries.
Many have said it: the EU is already the largest importer of food in the world and against this background the agricultural problems in the vast majority of developing countries will not be resolved solely by more intensive trade and agricultural deregulation.
It is actually wrong - and here too I am addressing Mrs Kinnock - to call for total liberalisation and an abandonment of national quotas in developing countries.
This would lead to merciless distortions of competition, which small farmers would have absolutely no chance of withstanding.
In conclusion, allow me to mention three facts: we need production for domestic consumption and for export on the basis of a reformed system of land tenure; we need better employment; we need sustainable management and we should consider new ways forward.
Mr President, we could go on all night discussing rural development, agricultural subsidies, gender equality, land reform, increased ODA as part of rural development and so on, but I am sure you would not want us to, even though those serious issues deserve our full attention.
The debate will continue, and we have only touched upon these most sensitive and important issues.
Agricultural reform, as outlined in the review, goes in the right direction, but that will certainly not be enough in the long run.
I was happy to see that the fight against poverty was at the forefront of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.
That will help our forthcoming discussions.
This report provides valuable input in the implementation stage and in the follow-up to the summit, as does the communication on rural development presented by my colleague, Mr Nielson.
I thank you for this very important and interesting debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (Rule 120)
Subsidies to large agricultural holdings in Europe are restricting agricultural production levels from small holdings in Europe and also those from developing countries which are not capable of contending with such competition.
The CAP must be revised in this area by including all the measures that are likely to enable these countries to develop a competitive agricultural industry with respect to production costs, and also product quality.
We will therefore ensure respect for the environment so that its degradation does not lead to the degradation of farmland, particularly compared to intensive farming, the intensive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, the pollution of agricultural produce by GMOs.
We will therefore be able to safeguard a healthy and organic production.
Particular attention will be paid to these issues, especially by means of collaboration with the common research centre.
The preservation and rational use of water resources are also of the greatest importance for these countries.
The Short and Medium-Term Priority Action Programme (SMAP) and MEDA programme and all the other programmes to enhance cooperation between the European Union and third countries could also be developed in this area.
The next item is the Commission statement on the twelfth Conference of the parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has a particular responsibility to guarantee a sustainable trade in endangered species, because we are one of the largest markets for these species and their products.
In addition, we must help the developing countries to develop effective strategies for the conservation of wild species.
As you know, in September the Commission proposed guidelines for the Community with a view to the Conference in Santiago.
Our proposal was based on respect for the scientific criteria that determine which appendix to CITES different species are listed in.
These criteria also include the precautionary principle.
I am delighted to note that the Commission's viewpoint differs only slightly from the views expressed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The Commission agrees with the recommendations concerning cetaceans, freshwater and sea turtles and seahorses.
I am also pleased that the Committee has decided to introduce a recommendation on the ratification of the Gabarone Amendment, which enables the Community to become a contracting party to CITES.
The Commission supports the inclusion of commercial fish species in the appendices provided that they meet the relevant criteria and that their management is not adequately regulated elsewhere at international level.
In the light of this, I concur with your support for the inclusion of basking shark and whale shark in Appendix II to CITES.
The Commission's opinion on the proposal to include species of Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish in Appendix II is based on the same principle.
I realise that there are important biological reasons for this proposal.
At the same time, I am also aware that the exploitation of these species is currently regulated by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), to which the Community is a party.
Even though it only covers a limited number of members, the catch documentation scheme introduced by CCAMLR contains provisions very similar to those of CITES.
In my opinion, CITES listing should be supported if it has the potential to promote the implementation of this plan and encourage other countries to do the same.
The Commission considers, however, that the proposal in its current wording will not bring about the achievement of this goal.
I hope that agreement can be reached at the Conference on amendments to render the proposal more effective.
I can also confirm that the Commission opposes the resumption of the commercial trade in ivory until it has been clearly demonstrated that this trade will not lead to greater protection of poachers or have a negative impact on the status of elephant populations.
It has not been possible to draw conclusions on this matter from the evidence available up to now.
It is therefore appropriate to choose a course of action based on the precautionary principle.
We must, however, make a distinction between commercial trade in ivory and the question as to the most appropriate CITES list for the elephants to be entered in.
It is undeniable that there is a large number of African elephants in several southern African countries, where the populations are currently covered by Appendix II.
These populations are managed well and their numbers are increasing.
Therefore, the proposal by Kenya and India to include all the African elephant populations in Appendix I is not justified on the basis of the relevant scientific criteria laid down in CITES.
Rather than re-igniting the conflict, the Community should, to my way of thinking, try to find solutions which promote the preservation of the elephants over their whole distribution area, and which enjoy the support of all the states in this distribution area.
Finally, I wish to inform the European Parliament that, in addition to the points you raise in your resolution, a large number of further proposals has been presented to the organisers of the Conference, which would have positive consequences for the conservation of species and which have the support of the Commission.
These include a proposal to include a species of true mahogany in the list in Appendix II and proposals on the improvement of CITES' working methods.
Mr President, the protection of biodiversity is one of our most important, but also one of our most difficult, tasks.
Time and time again we find ourselves in a situation in which it seems that now is not the time to opt for biodiversity.
Time and time again there are good reasons to abandon, for the time being, strict and specific measures for the protection of endangered species.
This is the case now.
I am talking specifically about African elephants.
I believe that there are good reasons for not imposing a total ban on the ivory trade.
Firstly, in accordance with scientific advice, the African elephant simply does not fulfil the criteria; the elephant population is growing and is healthy.
Secondly, I am not convinced that a total ban would mean that poaching would cease.
A ban might lead to a fuelling of illegal trade and push up the price. That will not help any elephant.
Thirdly, the idea of the destruction of ivory meets with considerable resistance. Destruction goes against every notion of sustained use.
Why should we have to destroy a natural, valued and valuable material such as ivory?
Finally, I am convinced that protection does not work without commitment from the local authorities and local population.
We can try and prescribe laws for others from our ivory towers here in Strasbourg.
We can preach morals from our ivory pulpit, but we have to realise that it does not work like that.
Five countries in southern Africa have presented alternative plans.
They have gained experience and have also had some success.
