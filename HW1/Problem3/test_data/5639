I am very pleased with the ambitious objectives of the Florenz report to significantly reduce smoking among this age group.
After all, young people are susceptible to peer pressure and, in addition, the harmful effects on health are greater in this group.
It is my hope, therefore, that the Member States - who think, of course, that they themselves can do everything best and that we must on no account become too involved - will respond to this House's appeal to commit themselves to halving the harmful effects of smoking among young people by 2025, so that they actually take action by agreeing with each other to do so.
With regard to passive smoking and the general smoking ban, a sound liberal principle is that one's personal freedom ends where another's begins - and what clearer illustration of this principle can there be than unwilling passive smoking?
Passive smoking inflicts great harm on public health and entails costs for the European economy.
Each year more than 79 000 adults die in the EU Member States as a result of passive smoking, and there is proof that passive smoking in the workplace accounted for 7 000 deaths in the European Union in 2002, whilst exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke at home was responsible for a further 72 000 deaths.
Of course, ample experience of this kind of smoking ban has been gained already in countries such as Ireland, Scotland and Italy, and this experience is actually all positive.
The comments from these countries - including from people who had been very sceptical about this kind of measure - are ultimately positive.
Thus, it is tempting to issue a smoking ban at European level, too.
Recently, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, this House decided against imposing a European smoking ban at this time, instead opting to leave such measures to Member States.
I think this is the right decision, as such a controversial decision should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen for the time being - that is, at Member State or regional level.
Therefore, the call on the part of those Member States who already have a smoking ban for the voluntary signing of a European charter in order to bring greater clarity for consumers strikes me as the most that can be achieved at present.
What is extremely good - and in this respect I commend the Commissioner on his Green Paper - is the promotion of this discussion that has indisputably taken place.
The issue is on the agenda in all Member States.
Mr President, I should like to make some concluding remarks about the Directive on tobacco products.
The Florenz report also looks towards the revision of this Directive.
I support everything the report says about picture warnings on cigarette packets.
It is tragic that so few Member States have made use of these, and personally I would be in favour of legislating in this regard.
Moreover, it should be possible to use these warnings in other ways, too, for example on the kind of information leaflets on how to stop smoking that they have in Canada; the experience with this has been positive, and it also strikes me as an excellent idea.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to wish you a happy birthday, Mr Florenz, albeit belatedly.
We know that smoking kills.
Every year, it causes the deaths of 650 000 people, and a further 79 000 adults die as a result of passive smoking.
We are delighted with the energy and commitment that the Commission has shown on this and are pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear, firm proposals.
We also have the majority of citizens behind us.
Almost 70% of them do not smoke, most smokers want to quit and Eurobarometer has clearly shown that 86% of those surveyed want a ban on smoking in the workplace, while 84% are for a ban on smoking indoors and 77% want no smoking at all in restaurants.
We are therefore very concerned about the amendments introduced by the rapporteur, because Amendment 3 would signify a definite dilution of this strong report by our committee.
It basically means a ban with exceptions, and we all know what happens with exceptions - they quickly become the rule.
Take Germany, for example, where we have seen that progress has been made thanks to stipulations made by Brussels and the debate at European level.
It would be fatal for the EU to cease championing this cause of behalf of consumers in the area of health protection and if we failed to see it through.
Therefore, I hope that we reject Amendment 3 tomorrow and that we stand up for robust European health protection so that we can finally achieve a smoke-free zone throughout Europe.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Thank you.
650 000 people die each year from smoking and 80 000 people die each year from passive smoking in the EU alone.
These gloomy statistics show us clearly that we must do everything we can to combat smoking.
Karl-Heinz Florenz has put forward a number of good proposals for action, such as tightening up existing legislation, deterrent notices on cigarette packaging, measures to prevent young people from starting smoking, measures to help smokers who want to be free from their dependence and, in general, measures to support the Member States in combating smoking.
That is a good thing.
However, I am opposed to transferring more power to the EU in the field of public health, particularly when the Member States are already doing a good job.
The smoking ban in pubs is a good example.
At least ten EU countries now have some form of smoking ban in restaurants and pubs.
It started with Ireland in 2004 and quickly spread to Sweden, Italy, Finland, Malta, Belgium and so forth.
Many more are on the way.
Should we now stop this process of setting good examples and wait for EU central legislation?
No, I don't think so, but let the good examples continue to be disseminated.
I note that in his report Mr Florenz writes that he wants to call on all the Member States to introduce an unrestricted smoking ban.
That is good, as I interpret it as meaning that we do not need to take a roundabout route via the European Commission and still run the risk that it will be thrown out by lobbyists from the tobacco industry.
In conclusion, is there not a danger, after all, of giving with one hand and taking away with the other?
We are urging people to stop smoking while at the same time the EU continues to subsidise tobacco cultivation to the tune of more than EUR 1 billion every year.
EUR 1 000 million every year.
These subsidies obviously must be abolished. As soon as possible!
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to repeat things - four minutes of speaking time are too precious - except to say that, like most speakers, I welcome the broad lines of this motion for a resolution.
Information programmes and preventive measures to reduce the number of young smokers in the coming years are only to be welcomed.
This goes for deaths caused by tobacco, and in other areas it also goes for road deaths and deaths caused by alcohol.
Up to this point I join the consensus.
At the same time, however, we must remain reasonable.
Just as we do not stop traffic because of the fatal accidents or toxic exhaust emissions, or banish wine and beer to purgatory because of the cirrhosis of the liver suffered by some politicians, on tobacco, too, we must let common sense prevail, and avoid hypocrisy at all costs.
I am thinking of the green health apostles in my country, for example, who inveigh against tobacco, but who legalised soft drugs a few years ago.
These are a few marginal notes to this resolution, ladies and gentlemen.
In principle, it must continue to apply that no supranational regulation is needed in this area.
Europe should respect the principle of subsidiarity once and for all if it wants reconciliation with its citizens.
To give an example, years ago, a European directive laid down that tobacco, too, had to be labelled - which is all well and good, but then bureaucracy suddenly reared its head.
The label has to cover 30% of the packet; 35% if it is bilingual.
The text must be in black lettering, with a black border of minimum 3 mm and maximum 4 mm thickness, the font must be Helvetica, and so on and so forth.
Europe wants to dictate everything, and no one understands where the subsequent irritation of the general public comes from.
Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, there is the hypocrisy of the subsidies for tobacco farmers, which even as recently as last year amounted to EUR 900 million a year.
This has now been reduced to EUR 300 million, but is still many times greater than the sum channelled into information to induce young people to stop smoking.
There is also a parallel with our nation-states: in Brussels a pack of cigarettes now costs EUR 4.30, of which EUR 3.30 goes as excise duty to the Belgian State, which spends a few million on anti-tobacco information programmes.
Billions of euros a year in excise duties could serve to finance the health costs of combating lung cancer.
Forgive my cynicism.
What are we going to do, though?
Abolish the subsidies and disadvantage our European farmers by importing tobacco products from abroad?
These questions, too, must be answered if one is to lapse into grandiloquent lyricism; otherwise, one pulls the wool over citizens' eyes.
Unfortunately, I can find no answer to these questions.
Finally, let us also avoid overdoing it, ladies and gentlemen, as the didactic language used sometimes makes me feel rather queasy.
In fact, it all makes me shudder.
A smoke-free Europe. What fine words.
What puritanism. Sinners are to be punished.
Let us guard against excessive stigmatisation of the 30% of the population who smoke.
Let us refrain from becoming anti-tobacco ayatollahs, as a Socialist Minister in France once implored me.
Let us refrain from lapsing into American conditions.
In California there are some who want to ban smoking in people's own homes, too, from 2009.
Just imagine!
How are they going to do that?
With commandos and informers?
Compulsory tobacco detectors in every home?
Is this the example we wish to follow?
Are we going to follow in their footsteps?
Are we going to ban the reading of Simenon on grounds that Inspector Maigret with his pipe is a bad example to young people?
Let us remain reasonable.
In many European countries - for example Italy, France, the Scandinavian countries and also my own country - smoking was banished from the shop floor and from restaurants long ago; and a good thing, too.
They did not need Europe for this.
Long live freedom, I say.
Let us give those restaurant managers who want one a small room for customers who occasionally like to enjoy a good cigar after their coffee or pousse-cafÃ©.
Who knows, though - perhaps coffee will also be banned and banished in tomorrow's Europe, as caffeine, too, is addictive.
Perhaps it would be best if the Commission put people on bread and water.
(FI) Mr President, in addition to smokers who are at risk from the dangers of smoking there are the millions of Europeans on the sidelines.
The creation of a Europe free from tobacco smoke and the prevention of passive smoking are two of the crucial tasks of the Union's environmental and public health policy.
Member States have also committed themselves to this goal through international law, as, with the exception of Italy and the Czech Republic, all the Member States of the Union have recognised the protection of citizens from tobacco smoke in the WHO Framework Convention as a fundamental right.
This right must be effectively protected.
Of the choices presented by the Commission, adherence to the status quo is not a viable option.
Voluntary arrangements have not succeeded in protecting people from tobacco smoke.
I too would like to thank the rapporteur for advocating binding legal remedies as the most effective way of combating this problem.
We have to protect two groups in particular: children and young people, and employees.
We cannot, however, adopt just any rules.
We have to stay within the limits of rationality, as befits the powers we have under the EU.
Supporting a sales ban on tobacco products to under-18-year-olds applied within the entire EU area is quite a different matter from restricting smoking in private vehicles in the presence of minors.
In such a case I would appeal rather to the parents' conscience and discretion. Do not force your child to breathe in deadly air.
Legislators should be careful about aiming at compliance with laws which it is virtually impossible to monitor.
There is also a need to highlight the importance of preventive work and various campaigns.
To protect workers, though, it is absolutely essential that a comprehensive smoking ban be brought in in all Member States.
I also wish to raise the matter of the manufacturer's responsibility.
The Tobacco Products Directive should be amended to include the manufacturer's liability when healthcare costs are being financed as a result of tobacco consumption.
Smoking is not just something that concerns smokers, because the hundreds of billions of euros in costs which are incurred by society as a result of tobacco consumption have to be paid by the majority who do not smoke.
Making people feel guilty helps no one and is, moreover, a poor policy, but the facts have to be stated.
Smoking costs too much; it costs lives.
Mr President, as has already been mentioned, every year 65 000 people die in Europe from smoking-related illnesses.
The number of victims of passive smoking is also tragically high - about 80 000 European citizens die every year owing to other people's bad habit.
That is why a total ban on smoking in the workplace and other public places should be welcomed.
Our long fight against smoking has not been unsuccessful.
Ten or twenty years ago, it was natural for people to smoke almost everywhere: during meetings and even on buses in some countries.
Now it is almost an aggression to light a cigarette at social events.
The success of the anti-smoking campaign shows us that multinational companies, such as the tobacco companies, are not unbeatable.
If we have clear goals for the environment and health and we can mobilise society, NGOs and politicians - not forgetting good lawyers - then we can reach our goals, step by step.
This report is taking the right steps in the right direction.
We should of course mention that it is smoking we are fighting, not smokers.
Mr President, this motion for a resolution is balanced, precise and comprehensive, and the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, deserves our honest congratulations on his work.
My only criticism of this resolution is that it has come too late.
The supporting scientific evidence and the undisputed need for the policy options contained in this document have been clear for all to see for many years.
It is sadly certain that the delay in making significant progress towards achieving a Europe free from tobacco smoke will have brought about the deaths from a preventable cause of hundreds of thousands of EU citizens.
Who is to be blamed for this massive sacrifice of human life?
I will mention only two of the main guilty parties so as to shame them, even though not in a sufficiently drastic fashion.
Firstly, the tobacco industry. It has spent millions of euros on campaigns of lies and misinformation.
It has manipulated the media, politicians and even scientists in order to buy more time, and this it has done purely and simply for financial gain, knowing full well that thousands of lives were at stake.
Secondly, the governments and some political parties of many EU Member States. They have bowed to the power and influence of the tobacco barons and have continued to hold back on taking effective measures to protect their citizens against the plague of smoking.
Even straightforward measures, such as increasing tobacco taxation and making free treatment of tobacco addicts widely available, have been suppressed.
I support an overwhelming vote for this resolution and I urge you not to forget the despicable behaviour of those who knowingly caused the tragic loss from tobacco-related diseases of so many lives.
(SV) Karl-Heinz, congratulations on your 60th birthday.
I am pleased to see that you are just as full of life as the young Karl-Heinz.
The best present that the PPE-DE Group could give Karl-Heinz would be to let him withdraw the weaknesses in his own report that he has presented.
I think it is important to mention additives in the report.
We have been asking for legislation for a long time.
Harmful additives must go, and it is a disgrace that the information is so poor.
We therefore now expect a rapid proposal from the Commission to get rid of these terrible additives that make cigarettes even worse.
We all have a natural right to avoid smoke in our workplaces, just as children have a natural right to avoid smoke in their playgrounds.
Parliament is perfectly right to call on the Member States to address this problem.
If you take children to our own stairwell outside the restaurant here, they smell of smoke for half an hour afterwards.
I also want to mention one aspect that has come out of the debate.
Any credible tobacco policy must include the phasing out of all subsidies, and we must ensure that our companies do not undermine the work through heavy marketing in developing countries.
Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, as the statistics show, approximately 30% of the population continues to reach for a cigarette on a daily basis.
I agree unconditionally that non-smokers should be protected from the harmful consequences of inhaling nicotine smoke.
I cannot, however, agree with the Jacobinical methods proposed in the resolution.
We cannot create a repressive policy for smokers that involves the restriction of their civil liberties.
I believe we should place the emphasis on broad public education and regulate the sales price by raising taxes, as scientific studies have shown this to be an effective weapon in the fight against tobacco addiction.
The point proposing a ban on smoking at work is incontrovertible.
I do think, though, that it should be expanded by adding a rider guaranteeing that each entity must provide smokers with a place nearby where they may smoke without harming others.
In the current climate this space must not be merely an artificial and pointless manifestation of health promotion; it must be an effective action.
In the time available to me I would like to touch on another problem, which has its origins in the anti-nicotine policy pursued by a number of governments, namely the rise in smuggling of counterfeit tobacco products, their main attraction being that they are cheaper than the original product.
This is currently one of the most lucrative sources of income for smugglers.
Please bear in mind that these products are sold in our shops, to our citizens.
Those who have taken up selling this product will not hesitate to sell to someone under age.
When drawing up an anti-nicotine policy, therefore, we must examine the problem from a number of angles to ensure that the legal reality we establish provides effective help in solving the problems linked to the use of nicotine products.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations to our rapporteur.
My primary concern is the protection of workers.
I join with all Members who want the Member States to respond quickly, and that is what we are doing with this resolution.
Results to date show that it has worked in some Member States but not in my own.
When it comes to the protection of workers, the question is, 'what steps can the European Commission take to prevent the creation of first- and second-class citizens?'
How have the Member States reacted to this discussion so far?
Are they for pushing ahead with worker protection at European level and for taking actions and measures such as a ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars?
Most of us approach this topic based on our situation and we often forget that we should be thinking about the workers who have to work under these conditions.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only with regard to protecting non-smokers, but also in other matters, I believe we should not take the EU's powers to extremes.
What are we really talking about here?
Surely the point is to initiate discussion about a potentially smoke-free Europe, not to wage a crusade against people who consume a product that is legal in Europe.
However, some of the contributions to this discussion, and many of the amendments, sound more like a religious war than the debate that I feel would be appropriate.
In the same way, the report stated that this policy should create an environment in which smoking was no longer seen as normal.
I do not believe that it is the task of politicians to teach people how to behave or to dictate to people what they should think.
We should keep things in perspective when it comes to the question of what the EU should regulate and what it should not.
Regulations structuring the tax systems of individual Member States are not part of our competence, nor are wide-ranging bans on smoking.
Put simply, the Member States have not given us that authority.
Even though there is a trend towards non-smoking in Europe, to exploit this trend to adopt excessive rules and to ride the wave of public approval is bad form, in my opinion.
We are talking here almost exclusively of bans.
Bans usually only increase the attraction of whatever has been forbidden, especially for young people, the group that we are particularly concerned about.
Instead, we should focus our energy and money on educating people about the harmful consequences of tobacco consumption, targeting each group as individually as possible.
That is the only way to get people to make wise decisions in the long term.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics on the consequences of smoking speak for themselves.
Mr Florenz is right not to tire of pointing out that 650 000 deaths due to active smoking and 80 000 deaths due to passive smoking cost our health system EUR 50 million every year.
There should be no need for us Parliamentarians to discuss effective protection for non-smokers.
Therefore, the discussion is not about 'whether', but 'how' it can be effected.
There are several different models of effective protection for non-smokers in Europe.
Some countries, such as Sweden and Ireland, have imposed a strict ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and in public buildings; others have provided for narrow exemptions.
We should respect these different models.
In principle, therefore, I think that protection of non-smokers is a matter for the Member States.
The rapporteur proposes that Europe should intervene in the event that Member States fail to provide effective protection of non-smokers in the workplace.
However, where these rules are infringed, I favour the EU keeping to the framework of EU powers regarding occupational safety and health.
I also advocate recognition of the existing rules in the Member States.
Functioning, existing national rules in the area of protection of non-smokers must be able to be retained.
Member States that are well along the way should be rewarded; we need to recognise the effort they have made.
We should take national differences and regional distinctiveness into account on a case by case basis, and accept them.
However, this must still ensure sufficient special protection for children and young people, and for non-smokers.
We do not want to water down the protection of non-smokers.
This will achieve a high level of health protection while adhering to the principle of subsidiarity and respecting the interests and regional differences of Member States.
Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Florenz's report.
I strongly support smoking bans in public places to protect public health and to avert the dangers of passive smoking.
I was delighted when Scotland led the UK in introducing a smoking ban in March 2006, and I am pleased that bans are now in place in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
As a Scottish ban has now been in place for some time, we have evidence on what kind of health impact it has had.
Recent figures from Scotland show that, since the smoking ban was introduced, there has been a 20% reduction in heart attack admissions to hospital.
We also continue to raise awareness of the health risks associated with smoking.
For this reason, on 14 November 2007, I am launching a written declaration in the European Parliament calling for more research and resources for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
COPD is a common and costly lung disease whose advanced stage is chronic respiratory failure.
It is an under-recognised, under-diagnosed and under-treated disease, neglected by health care providers and the public.
The rise of COPD makes it all the more important that the EU adopts comprehensive smoke-free policies and Mr Florenz's report.
Thank you very much.
I would like to begin by saying that I am essentially sceptical about the idea of the EU banning smoking in public places throughout the Union.
Even those who are in favour of this kind of smoking ban must see the problem of us doing it at EU level.
After all, decisions like this are controversial.
If the citizens find out that they come from Brussels, that someone who is not directly concerned is introducing these decisions, I think that opposition will increase.
However, there are things that we can do here in the EU to reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoke throughout Europe.
For example, we can abolish the EU's incomprehensible ban on Swedish snuff.
I am coming back with the obstinacy of a fool to take the opportunity to highlight the Swedish experience.
We have the lowest proportion of smokers anywhere in Europe, we have the lowest proportion of all tobacco-related illnesses anywhere in Europe, but do you know what?
Despite this we have roughly the same tobacco consumption as the rest of Europe, but we use snuff rather than cigarettes.
The fact is that if the rest of Europe replaced cigarettes with snuff to the same extent that we have done in Sweden, 200 000 Europeans would be spared lung cancer every year.
I therefore think that it is immoral to keep our eyes closed.
Unfortunately the Commission's reasoning seems to be precisely the opposite.
Today the Commission ordered the Ãland Islands to pay fines of almost SEK 20 million for failing to enforce sufficiently effective bans on snuff there.
This is even though snuff on the Ãland Islands is a traditional product, which there too has replaced cigarettes and saved lives.
Moreover, the Commission does this and has the nerve to claim that it means well and refers to concern for the health of the Ãlanders.
But I have talked with the latter, and they politely reject this.
It is therefore on the Commission's conscience if smoking increases on the Ãland Islands.
However, I know that there are still Members here who are sceptical and do not really believe that it can be that simple, that the statistics are not really as clear-cut as I say.
I would ask you to meet me halfway, at least on one point, and to vote in favour of Jules Maaten's proposal to evaluate the health effects of snuff.
Let us have the facts on the table as a scientific basis for further debate.
I am convinced that it will be the first step towards lifting the EU's indefensible ban on snuff.
Thank you, Mr President.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate. It was good to hear different views.
I must say that I am very happy that the majority supports smoking bans and all the other measures that promote smoking prevention.
First of all, we must not forget that the main target is to protect young people.
Do not forget that that new ideas come up all the time.
The new fashion now is to promote smoking among young girls as a weight-control measure.
All means are being employed to promote smoking, so we have to be imaginative and comprehensive in our response.
I understand that some Members are reluctant for the Commission or the Community to take measures.
They say that we should wait for Member States to play their part.
As I have said, we are now in the process of examining and studying what the next step should be at European level.
However, I must say that, even though the trend is very encouraging - over the last few years there has been a tremendous increase in countries introducing very comprehensive restrictions - the longer we wait to take measures, the more people die.
We must not forget that. It is a very important factor.
There is the issue of subsidiarity, but subsidiarity does not mean doing.
Nor does Article 152 mean that we should just sit back and watch people die.
It means that we should complement, support, encourage and even legislate when it is necessary.
We do have the legal basis - we have the opinion on that.
So it is a matter of a policy decision, not a legal decision.
That is something we will be working on.
As I have said from the beginning, what is important for us is how we can best achieve results, not the legal instruments we employ to do so.
Do not forget that the new Treaty, agreed just two or three days ago, specifically mentions the European Union's involvement in the tobacco issue.
That should be borne in mind as well.
The Commission's Green Paper refers mostly to a smoke-free environment, and the debate mainly focused on that area.
However, that is just one measure.
We have to take a series of measures to achieve our goal.
We need a smoking ban, which I will come back to in a minute; advertising bans, which we already have; warnings and pictorial warnings, which we have covered; and also educational campaigns.
It is true that this is a lifestyle choice, and that people will eventually make their choice.
However, we have to help them take their decision based on the true facts and, in a way, counterbalance the aggressive marketing techniques of the tobacco industry, which is spending billions of euros.
We have to be able to advise and explain the problems to people, and also give them incentives not to smoke or to give up smoking.
That is a very important area.
Concerning smoking ban exceptions, these are better than having no ban at all.
I accept that.
However, the fact is that this will not make things as effective as with a comprehensive smoking ban, with this being not only for the protection of passive smokers, as I have already said, but also an incentive for smokers to quit and a disincentive for non-smokers not to begin smoking.
We should not undermine that.
It is not strange that the majority of smokers also support the introduction of smoking bans, because they want to smoke when they decide to and not to have to breathe everybody else's smoke.
This is not a theoretical discussion.
I know there were concerns a few years ago and, because this is a new debate, concerns are still being expressed.
However, we now have some experience and we know that it works, and we know that it does not lead to smoking somewhere else.
There is now a reduction in the number of smokers and smoking-related problems and, at the same time, we have seen that it has not affected certain sectors of the economy where there was a worry.
So we can draw on those experiences and explain to Member States - and even Members of this Parliament - who are reluctant what the benefits are and how effective they can be.
Concerning the issue of ingredients and additives, we are working on this.
We are taking very seriously into account Parliament's position. Mr Florenz has been nagging me on this for the past few years.
We are proceeding with that, but it needs a lot of work because the directive, as originally adopted, was not functional.
So now we are trying to streamline the provision of information, and we will proceed with the assessment of the risks involved.
Concerning illegal and illicit trade, we are working within the context of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and are currently working a protocol to control that trade.
The European Union is very active in this respect, and will remain so.
I again want to emphasise that we are not acting against smokers, and agree with those who have made that point.
On the contrary, all these measures will benefit smokers as well.
I know the issue of 'snus' is a sensitive one for one Member State.
However, I have to say, first of all, that the case of Holland is totally different because that Member State did not ask for a derogation, as Sweden did.
However, at the same time - and I would be happy to have a more thorough discussion on this - snus is not a safe alternative.
It is just as dangerous, as it causes different forms of cancer and different forms of illnesses.
Very soon, at the beginning of next year, we will have all the evidence.
I am actually quoting Swedish experts.
So it is not a question of the rest of the European Union, which is not using it, showing prejudice.
I am quoting Swedish experts who have shown me a huge pile of evidence in this respect.
Snus might not cause lung cancer, because it is not inhaled, but it has effects and causes problems.
At the same time, there is no evidence that it can be effective as a tobacco-control or smoking-control measure.
I would therefore be very reluctant in this area, and really doubt there is any scientific evidence allowing this.
However, I have to say that I can see a tremendous effort on the part of the tobacco industry, because it now feels threatened by smoke-free policies, to promote snus.
We should be cautious in this respect, because it could cause other problems and it could be expanded and promoted in an aggressive commercial way.
I would be very reluctant to change the status quo as it stands today in the European Union, and we have the judgment of the European Court of Justice to support us in this respect.
In conclusion, I should like to thank all the Members again for this very interesting debate.
I take note of those who support and those who are against the Commission's policies.
It is very important for us to hear all your views.
I shall be having a more thorough discussion with you in the near future - next year - with a specific proposal from the Commission based on the discussion today.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) Smoking is a major public health problem that claims several hundred thousand victims every year, including non-smokers.
As this is a problem on a global scale, it calls for multifaceted action, commitment on the part of Member States, and effective legislation that is even tougher than hitherto.
Protection of European citizens' health demands this.
Clearly, the road to achieving the primary objective, a smoke-free Europe, will be a long one, requiring tremendous effort and commitment.
For this reason, we have to take things one step at a time.
Several Member States have set an example that we should follow, taking sound and effective action to avert the dangers of passive smoking.
One of the next steps should be to introduce a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including the catering sector, all public buildings and all public transport within two years throughout the whole of the European Union.
To combat smoking successfully, we need a sound basis, a comprehensive Community strategy based on relevant studies and the best empirical knowledge, aimed at controlling smoking and encouraging people to quit.
Planning effective legislative measures, prevention and education all have a key role to play in such a strategy.
in writing. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, every year cigarette smoking leads over 650 000 Europeans to a premature death.
None of them decides to take up smoking in the desire to kill themselves.
Smokers are addicts, slaves of persistent, decades-long propaganda.
Only tough PR can explain the fact that whilst 86% of Europeans believe that the workplace should be smoke-free, only 61% think that the same should be true for bars and restaurants.
Ladies and gentlemen, waiters and bar staff also have a right to life and to health protection!
Each year 80 000 people die from passive smoking. Regardless of their own wishes they have breathed in a mixture of 250 carcinogens and toxins.
Waiters in establishments where smoking is allowed are 50% more likely to contract lung cancer than staff working in smoke-free establishments.
None of this is news.
Yet 30% of European Union citizens are smokers.
The free market economy has not stopped an unhealthy habit which causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and costs taxpayers billions.
It is clear that lawmakers must act.
I agree with the report that only a 100% smoke-free environment is an environment which can meet today's health requirements.
In addition to a ban, however, we also need measures which help smokers free themselves from their addiction.
We need only look at the sums spent by the tobacco industry on advertising to understand the enormity of the challenge we face.
Half-measures are no longer adequate.
It is time to act in earnest.
Protocol amending TRIPS (debate)
The next item is the recommendation by Gianluca Susta, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement (08934/2006 - C6-0359/2006 -
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretariat of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament for the support it has given me.
I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, as well as Mr Van Hecke, who preceded me in covering this dossier, for the excellent work carried out and for managing to maintain the unity of our institution right through to the end.
In my opinion, this has been Parliament's greatest strength in the campaign to promote access to medicines in the developing and less-developed countries where they are most needed.
The right to health and access to health at affordable prices are fundamental rights and should be guaranteed for all citizens.
Unfortunately we know only too well that this is not always the case: all too often the prices imposed by the pharmaceutical industry are too high, with the result that countries where they are most needed find themselves in difficulty.
For this reason, as I have already said on several occasions, both in the Committee on International Trade and in plenary, Parliament could not blindly accept the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement as if it were a universal panacea, and then consider the matter resolved.
Parliament wanted more to be done, at least within the European Union, because the European Union can and must do more.
Even in the light of the regrettable events of this summer, such as the exchange of letters with Thailand, even if partially resolved, the European Parliament, which has always been a great advocate of using all the flexibilities offered by the TRIPS Agreement, could not give the go-ahead for the ratification of the protocol without obtaining real and effective guarantees from the Commission and the Council.
I think it is fair to stress that during these months of close collaboration with the Commission and the Council, we have undoubtedly achieved an important goal for the European Union, by putting an essentially technical dossier at the top of the European political agenda.
I believe that the end result can be qualified as a success, not only for this reason, but above all because we have succeeded in making progress in extremely sensitive areas, such as encouraging the use of the flexibilities provided for under the TRIPS Agreement so that we can promote access to essential medicines at affordable prices within the framework of national public health programmes.
I particularly support the explicit reference contained in the Council Statement - presented on Monday - to Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement.
For my group, this represents a guarantee and an assurance that Member States will be able to use this instrument without coming under pressure and that there will be easier access to medicines in countries where they are most needed.
Secondly: I am also delighted at the results obtained in terms of TRIPS-plus, namely the more stringent provisions as regards those provided for under the TRIPS Agreement.
Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed that there should be no negotiations in future bilateral or regional agreements with developing countries on provisions that might have negative consequences for health and access to medicines.
Despite this, while recognising the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, I would like to ask whether the text of the statement can be further improved, particularly in the section referring to poor developing countries.
This expression could create confusion, since it is now customary to refer only to developing countries and to the category of less-developed countries.
To insert a new category would complicate the situation.
Above all, it is important to stress that all developing countries, hence even countries such as Brazil, India, etc., must be able to use the current system without running the risk of pejorative provisions being introduced in future.
Last but not least, it is vital to underline the efforts made to date in terms of the transfer of research and technological development to southern countries.
The ALDE Group is ready to give its assent because it believes that a 'no' would send out a negative signal to the countries most in need, and would be irresponsible on the part of the European Union given that the reopening of the WTO negotiations is unrealistic.
However, this does not change the fact that we continue to have reservations about the efficiency of the mechanism studied and approved by the WTO.
For this reason, and I am almost at the end now, I would like to confirm that the EU will not stop here.
Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the guarantees that have been given over the past few months will be honoured in practice.
Therefore we ask Commissioner Mandelson, who in his letter confirmed that he did not intend to negotiate TRIPS-plus provisions, to remove from the draft Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean countries the request for adherence to and acceptance of the obligations of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Patent Law Treaty and the intellectual property provisions of Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, which unequivocally resemble TRIPS-plus provisions.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased that we have been able to find a solution agreeable to all on the important issue of access to medicines for poor, developing countries.
Our debate during the last months has been fruitful and I would like to thank Parliament for the intensity and the quality of our exchanges.
The Commission has always been receptive to the concerns expressed by Parliament and, indeed, shares most of them.
That is why the Commission was at the forefront of the debate on TRIPS and access to medicines in the WTO.
I have seen in this debate an opportunity for the Commission to clarify its position on a number of issues.
We all agree that the amendment of the TRIPS agreement is one part of the solution among many others to the problem of access to medicines.
Obviously, other measures are needed, in particular to improve health care systems and the infrastructures, notably in poor, developing countries.
Some Members fear that the mechanism will not work. This is certainly too early to assert.
In our regulation implementing the waiver, and together with Parliament, we agreed to evaluate it three years after its entry into force, and we will do it.
We also support the work of the intergovernmental working group with the WHO to explore other measures to further improve access to medicines.
The Commission has been able to reaffirm its attachment to the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement on public health and its support for the flexibilities contained therein.
Similarly, this debate allows me to dispel any misunderstanding about what the Commission is doing in the economic partnership agreements with ACP countries.
Let me confirm that, in those agreements and in other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries, the Commission is not asking and will not ask for provisions which could affect access to medicines or undermine the TRIPS flexibilities contained in the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health.
Thanks to this frank and direct debate Parliament is now in a position to give its assent to the Commission proposal.
The European Community will then join the other WTO members which have already accepted the TRIPS agreement.
This acceptance will enable the EC to continue to play a leading role in the WTO on the issue of access to medicines.
To conclude, I would like to insist that access to medicines remains a priority for the Commission and I am willing to continue to work in a constructive spirit with Parliament on this matter in the future.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that the Council is not represented in our debate this evening because for once it is our main contact.
The atmosphere here is euphoric, everyone is in agreement and tomorrow we are going to vote - by a crushing majority, I think - for the ratification of this amendment to the TRIPS agreement, which is supposed to provide and should provide better access to medicines for countries that are not sufficiently developed and do not have a pharmaceutical industry that allows them this access.
What happened during the long debate we have had on this, is that Parliament was a little more doubtful than the Commission about the efficacy of this system.
I believe - and I would like to thank the Council here for having listened to Parliament more than the Commission, for once - that this is what led to the statement distributed on Monday morning, thanks to which we have accepted that an agreement between us enables us to make this small step forward.
It is an improvement, but it is an improvement the inadequacy of which we are aware of and regarding the effectiveness of which we have a few doubts.
These few doubts need to be removed by the stringency with which the Member States and the Council apply the recommendations.
I am delighted, however, by what has just been said by Mr Mandelson, who has himself announced a group of experts to find other measures, and an evaluation of these measures, and I think we will be discussing these matters again once we have seen whether the effectiveness meets our expectations.
In any case, I am pleased about the positive conclusion to this necessary stage, even if it does not go far enough.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, as rapporteur of the European People's Party I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sousa, and my other fellow Members for the productive cooperation we have enjoyed, for it enabled us to overcome certain differences between political groups and to maintain a united position on this important issue.
The European Parliament has not been limited to areas of responsibility as laid down by the Treaty; it has not been restricted merely to giving its assent.
In the July resolution a political victory was achieved expressing a united will transcending party politics.
Making commitments by the Commission and the Council was sought and achieved.
They coincide to a great extent with the views of the European Parliament.
It could be said to have been a rehearsal for institutional cooperation in light of the new role the European Parliament will play once the Reform Treaty has been adopted.
The acceptance by the Union of the amendment is thus backed up by real commitments, which ensure the process works successfully.
The commitments also go much further: they lay down guidelines for an integrated approach to the issue of the public health of developing countries.
The acceptance by the Union of the amendment to the TRIPS Agreement sends a positive and hopeful message to developing countries.
We hope that it will also involve the active cooperation of other members of the WTO.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during our last debate in July on access to medicines, I concluded my comments by calling on the Council and the Commission to make clear and formal commitments that would guarantee Europe's active involvement in finding new solutions and its desire to be a front runner in the fight for access to affordable medicines for everyone.
We could not be content with a debate in which no precise commitments were made, and I note today that, after several months of exchanges between the three institutions, certain proposals we had made and that we really wanted are becoming a reality.
First allow me to applaud the parliamentary work done, and done with a constant concern for accountability and openness.
The three successive postponements of the vote in Parliament were motivated by a commitment to global public health.
This showed us that the word 'solidarity' still had meaning in European policies.
I would therefore like to thank first of all our rapporteur Mr Susta for his powers of persuasion and capacity for resistance, and all the shadow rapporteurs from the political groups, who throughout these months of collaboration, effort and Common conviction, have risen above party politics to show the quality of work that Parliament can produce.
I therefore hope that the Council and the Commission will be able to demonstrate that the commitments made over the last few months during our various exchanges and in the written statement we have received will be respected.
These commitments are: that the Member States are free to use all the clauses allowing them to produce generic medicines and export them to developing countries, and not only to poor developing countries; that these developing countries can use all the flexibilities in the Doha Declaration to provide their populations with the essential medicines they need; that the European Union will not negotiate public health-related provisions in negotiations on trade agreements - and I also note the statements by the Commissioner; and finally that the EU will finance projects to develop research and manufacturing capabilities in these countries.
These are positive steps forward, and we want to make capital of them now, but I would like nevertheless to say that not all the issues raised by Parliament, or its legitimate concerns, have necessarily met with the desired responses from the other institutions.
Our fight for access to medicines for everyone in the world goes on.
That is why we will remain extremely vigilant regarding the application of the commitments made by the Council and the Commission today, and at the same time we will continue to demand that all our concerns receive a rapid, adequate response in the coming months.
I recall that the first of the commitments made to Parliament was to complete the evaluation of the mechanism that we are to adopt tomorrow.
Doubts persist over this, and they need to be addressed.
Should that not be the case, in line with the commitments made to the developing countries concerned, the EU should draw the appropriate conclusions to come up with a truly viable, sustainable solution.
I am therefore pleased about the commitments made by the Council and the Commission, and I will therefore call upon my group to vote in favour of ratification tomorrow, even though the long weeks of work we have just experienced lead me to think that, far from reaching an end, the collective agreement we have made is only just beginning.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) The WTO decision of 30 August 2003, which provided for a temporary derogation from the TRIPS Agreement, has now been transformed into a permanent derogation by a new decision of 6 December 2005.
In his report, Mr Susta makes a number of very pertinent remarks on the practicability of compulsory licensing.
I recognise very many elements from my 2005 report transforming the temporary derogation into a European regulation.
I fully support the recommendations of the Council and the Commission, which Mr Susta links with the avis conforme.
The mechanism created is indeed only a limited solution to the problem of inadequate access to medicines in poor countries.
The EU must help developing countries find a long-term solution in terms of obtaining the most essential medicines at affordable price, and must stimulate investment in local production facilities.
The transfer of technology, research and technical assistance are of course essential in this respect.
In this regard, I would refer to recent reports stating that the market share of generic medicines is falling once again, and giving the cause as the cheap production by pharmaceutical companies themselves of medicines whose patent protection has expired.
This must present opportunities for poor countries, where, in line with the WTO decision, compulsory licensing can offer a solution in respect of medicines still protected by patents.
If we do not want to give vain hope to the millions of people still unable to benefit from the most essential medicines, more - much more - will be needed than a mechanism whose practicability is and remains highly dubious.
Mr President, as it happens, 14 years ago I was involved in the issue of intellectual rights in the Polish Parliament, as chairman of a special subcommittee.
Today I have the honour of doing the same in our European Parliament.
Like those who have spoken before me, I would like to emphasise the significant progress that we have made over the last few months, and I would like to stress that, as we see it, the European Parliament has done a lot to put right what was proposed by the European Commission.
I am thoroughly convinced that the compromise we are proposing will help to improve access to pharmaceutical products in Third World countries, as they are what mainly concern us.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, if I have understood correctly the Council will read the statement before the vote, otherwise there will be no binding commitment.
I would then ask you to omit the word poor developing countries.
It is completely irrelevant and meaningless in previous agreements.
There are developing countries and there are the least developed countries, and Parliament wants both these groups of countries to be able to benefit from these mechanisms.
It is clear that we are speaking the same language here.
It is something I was wondering about in your speech, Mr Mandelson: you said that ACP countries had nothing to worry about, but then you also said poor developing countries, ACP countries.
I hope that we are not restricting the discussion to them, and that your letter to Thailand does not set the limits for this, but that we are perfectly clear that developing countries which are not among the poorest also really need to be able to protect public health in order to be able to develop effectively, and that we must give them all the help and support we can.
I hope that we agree on this.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has been called upon to express an opinion on whether the amendment to the WTO agreements on intellectual property - the 'TRIPS Agreements' - can be made permanent, as this would represent a swift solution to the problem of access to medicines by developing countries.
Considering that up to now, this amendment has offered no proof of its real effectiveness, it is important for the European Parliament to seize the opportunity offered by the ratification of the TRIPS amendment to secure greater guarantees that EU policy on access to medicines will be comprehensive, coherent and effective.
The TRIPS Agreement, as the Council has recognised, represents only part of the solution to the problem of access to medicines and public health; it is important therefore that the Council, as emphasised several times by Parliament, should declare its support for all those countries who intend to take advantage of the flexibilities offered by the TRIPS Agreements, to be able to provide essential medicines at affordable prices.
The European Union must do more to stem the health crisis in the world's poorest countries, particularly by ensuring that these countries can meet their own needs, without burdening them with bilateral or regional agreements, the 'TRIPS-plus' Agreements, on provisions relating to pharmaceutical products that risk having a negative impact on access to public health and medicines.
We also believe that it is the task of the Commission and the Council to support WTO initiatives to make TRIPS rules less complex, and specifically to maximise product availability.
(PL) Mr President, halfway through it has transpired that among the millennium goals, we have done worst in combating TB, HIV and malaria.
World Health Organisation statistics show that in 2005 more than one and a half million people died of TB, which had a high mortality rate in Europe before World War II.
Each day 27 000 people die because of a lack of access to basic medicines.
Health is an inseparable condition for wellbeing and economic development, and I believe it is our moral duty to help less well developed countries in this respect.
One positive step is to provide support for the protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement in order to allow access to medicines.
It is not a complete solution, but we cannot not take the risk if we are to protect the lives of millions of people.
There is a risk.
To begin with, obtaining a licence for the production of generics for export to countries in need is hedged round by numerous conditions that might put people off such an undertaking.
Secondly, production of medicines of this type may create circumstances for abuse on the part of both the beneficiaries and the exporters themselves, and on top of that the infrastructure in poor countries is so weak that it is just not possible to undertake production there.
For this reason some kind of extra, multi-level aid instruments are needed.
It seems to me that the most important thing is financial aid intended for setting up local production centres, technology transfer, and investment in development and innovation.
We are obliged to show social solidarity with these countries, but we are the ones who have to work out a way that will do most to increase the effectiveness of the aid provided while at the same time protecting our own market.
Finally, Commissioner, I want to say that the Commission - and you, yourself, as head of a specific committee - have plenty of scope for new ideas to think about.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing tonight and will be voting on tomorrow will be a small but important building block in the cooperation between the institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
In this procedure, Parliament's only options are to agree with the proposal or reject it.
The way that Mr Susta, the rapporteur, and all the shadow rapporteurs - and here I would like to thank particularly Kader Arif from my group - have handled it increased considerably the predefined scope for Parliament to take action.
However, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for expressly pointing out that this accord, this Protocol, which we will vote on tomorrow and which Member States will then be able to ratify, is only a building block - an important one, but only a building block - and that there are many more steps to be taken to give developing countries with no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector a real opportunity, which they need, to provide their citizens with essential medicines.
This step will help us in our cooperation and it will especially help us when Parliament gains further rights of consent in the many other policy areas, in the area of trade, for example.
I extend sincere thanks to the Council and the Commission and all the Members who made it possible actually to achieve the flexibility that we now have.
(PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the ethical importance of this issue, the discussion that we are engaged in is of great political relevance.
The dichotomy between protecting intellectual property and promoting the health and well-being of the populations of less-developed countries arises out of a conflict of interests that can be resolved only by a comparison of values.
Simply put, this opposition is clear.
On the one hand we have a certain debatable model of protecting intellectual property based on the argument of the incentive for innovation and the consequent expansion of scientific knowledge, while on the other are millions of poor human beings, living in countries with scarce resources who cannot be condemned to suffer and die for economic reasons at a time when we have the knowledge that can save their lives.
This comparison makes it clear on which side the fundamental values lie.
In this light, at various times and in various places certain steps have already been taken to make the intellectual property protection system more flexible so as to promote access to medicines for all.
However, it turns out that progress so far is not sufficient.
The mechanism now being considered is merely a means of easing such a distressing problem.
We need to go further.
Parliament has pointed in this direction, making a decisive contribution to encourage the EU to adopt a position in line with its underlying values.
The solution now found reveals this concern and I would therefore like to commend the Presidency of the Council for its efforts to achieve, through statements and commitments, a position that shows Europe at its best: a political community always set on irrecusable humanist values.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Qualifications framework for lifelong learning (debate)
The next item is the report by Mario Mantovani, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning - C6-0294/2006 -
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Mantovani and I would like to express the Commission's thanks to him and to the responsible committees for their proactive engagement and supportive stance throughout the negotiations on the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for lifelong learning.
This recommendation goes to the heart of what the EU is about: mobility, cooperation between countries, promoting prosperity and helping individual citizens.
We propose the EQF because you, the European Parliament, and the Member States asked us to find ways of promoting mobility and lifelong learning, without which we cannot achieve the Lisbon goals.
The EQF has been developed within the Education and Training 2010 work programme, the education dimension of the Lisbon Agenda.
The EQF seeks to overcome the barriers that remain to European workers and learners when they wish to change jobs or move to another country for work or for study.
Too often, Europeans have difficulty in using their qualifications in another European country.
Even in their own country they find their educational pathways blocked by poor integration of the different parts of their national education system.
The EQF will relate the countries' different national qualification systems to each other, acting as a translation device.
It will thus make other countries' qualifications more readable and so enable individuals to move to another country if they wish to work or study.
At the national level it will - indeed it is already doing this - stimulate the development of national qualifications frameworks.
Qualifications frameworks promote lifelong learning by, for example, making it easier for people to move between different types of education and training institutions, for example from vocational training to higher education.
I should acknowledge that the EQF is a technical, even complex instrument.
It will be used mainly by experts and educational authorities, but it is for the benefit of the citizen.
What we are debating today is the product of a collective endeavour between the Commission, countries, social partners, education and training associations and other stakeholders.
The EQF has very much been built on a consensus and we have sought to carry stakeholders with us throughout the process.
The EQF recommends that countries relate their qualification systems to the EQF by 2010 and ensure that individual national qualifications carry a reference to the appropriate EQF level by 2012.
These dates were proposed by the Council and Parliament.
We have also been happy to agree to the insertion of a new recommendation on quality assurance proposed by Parliament, which we feel reinforces the importance of these principles.
We also agree to Parliament's proposal to include a reference to credit systems which recognises the rapid development and application of these components of qualifications frameworks.
We believe that Parliament and the Council have indeed improved the text.
The approach adopted in the negotiations by the Parliament, Council and Commission reflects the consensus behind the EQF across Europe.
There is now a momentum behind the EQF; the great majority of countries recognise its potential for mobility and as a lifelong learning instrument.
A large majority are now developing a national qualifications framework related to the EQF, so this proposal is already having a major impact on Europe's education and training systems.
I hope you can agree to support this proposal at first reading so that it can formally be adopted by the Council in the coming weeks.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that tonight marks the beginning of a major project which Europe, the Member States and the regions and cities of the European Union have been waiting for for a long time, a goal that various stakeholders in the fields of education, employment, trade and the economy have been working towards for years, and something that society as a whole wants.
Tomorrow, with the approval of the European Qualifications Framework, we will lay the foundations for a better tomorrow, giving future generations a common point of reference for their cultural, educational and vocational engagement, training and of course employment.
In keeping with the Lisbon Strategy, the European Qualifications Framework represents a direct channel for improving links between schools, universities and the workplace, and between formal, informal and non-formal lifelong learning, ensuring transparency in the recognition of qualifications and certificates, both at national and sectoral level, and always within the European framework.
Finally, it will strengthen cooperation between Member States in the sensitive area of comparing different systems.
This is the recurring theme which, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, has led us to assume the proper responsibility, with a choice that I am certain will promote growth, development and competitiveness in a Europe obliged to recognise social cohesion as one of its objectives.
It is a longstanding project, arising from the Bologna process as the system of accumulation and transfer of credits as an equivalent, before surfacing again at the Barcelona Summit system for vocational training.
It was improved at Bergen in 2004, and again in the 2005 Council, which reiterated the need to adopt the current framework.
An historic journey that clearly illustrates the ambition of European decision-makers to create a new instrument, considered by many as revolutionary, but necessary for the European integration process which we have been persuing for so many years.
I am convinced, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that this framework will not only encourage cross-border mobility, but will act as the driving force for the EU's internal mobility - if we think of students, workers, researchers and volunteers in general, and all those who need to move freely through Europe without causing panic or undue concern.
You must remember the story of the Polish plumber, which terrified France: it was one of the main reasons why the French voted against the European Constitution in the referendum.
Well, the text we now have before us is the result of many months' work, of close collaboration with the Council representatives under the Portuguese Presidency, which immediately saw the importance of this ambitious project.
The Commission, in the person of Commissioner FigeÄŸ, has kept a close eye on this process throughout, and it is thanks to this spirit of partnership that we were able to improve the text, inserting key concepts close to the heart of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
For this, I am extremely grateful to my colleagues, to the shadow rapporteurs - I see Mrs Castex, Mr Kusstatscher, the liberals - as well as Mr Mann and Mr Kasoulides, and all those who contributed to this.
Thanks to their generous involvement and commitment, we were able to include the following concepts: social integration; the requirements of the labour market; personal development along different training paths; non-discrimination with the inclusion of disadvantaged persons; equal opportunities; respect for the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of coordination points within the Member States.
We also made sure that the recommendation was non-binding, even though it remains legislative in nature.
Obviously this was not down to any weakness, but came more from a sense of responsibility and realism in order to encourage and promote the application of this instrument in those countries that need more time.
In short, there is no doubt that it can be improved, but in this life everything can be improved.
However, I am convinced that we have before us a text with a soul and a conscience.
It is my belief that the job of the European Parliament is to legislate in the real interests of citizens.
Well, this is what we have done here.
The approval of the text at first reading is evidence of this, partly thanks to Mr GaÄŸa on the Committee on Culture and Education, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which all made a positive contribution.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, because he has really tackled a subject that goes much further than we might imagine.
Really, in a globalised world, Europe and the various EU countries will be defined by the qualifications of their human resources.
If we had to summarise in one pillar what it is that is going to enable Europe, and all the countries that make up Europe, to be competitive in this global world, it is the qualifications of the human resources, the citizens of Europe.
With this in mind, it is absolutely essential that lifelong education and training should be adapted to the demands of the labour market and constantly respond to them.
If this is not the case, it will be impossible to compete.
We will also come up against the following paradox: people are getting older, but these older people are getting younger and potentially more active, yet they have insufficient resources to continue being productive and giving to society and finding fulfilment in the world of employment.
With this in mind, the first aspect is that lifelong training, based essentially on a technological dimension, which is what gives added value, should be a fundamental concern.
There is, however, a second aspect, which concerns the future of Europe, and this is integrating these human resources into a competitive internal market, for which qualifications are needed that are recognised by all Member States, which will enable citizens from different countries to compete with each other based on training that is recognised by all.
Therefore, because it is necessary for individual development in such a competitive world and because it is necessary for the development of the internal market, this is a subject that has much greater importance than it is perhaps being given by being debated so late in the day.
Thank you, Mrs del Castillo, the evening debates are always the most interesting though.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (SK) Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, for his work on the report on the European Qualifications Framework.
We have been debating this subject in the European Parliament since spring 2006.
As we know, a strong mandate for the European Qualifications Framework is an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy.
It will serve as a translation device between different qualifications systems and their levels, and its implementation will result in greater transparency, comparability and portability of citizens' qualifications in individual Member States.
In addition, the European Qualifications Framework will help international sectoral organisations to improve the links between their sectoral qualifications systems and national qualifications systems, thus helping to increase the mobility of workers and learners.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, I express my support for the non-binding nature of the European Qualifications Framework in the Member States and for the creation of national qualifications systems in accordance with national legislation and practice.
However, the European Qualifications Framework will become an effective instrument for recognition and comparability of qualifications at a European scale only if it is consistently implemented as a part of the lifelong learning systems in the EU Member States.
Since the EQF is directly linked to the way in which citizens assert themselves on the labour market and affects the quality of vocational education and training, it can also be considered a relevant tool for boosting competitiveness.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the European Qualifications Framework is the starting signal for the emancipation of vocational training at EU level, as it will enable vocational qualifications to be recognised throughout Europe, just as academic qualifications are.
This takes time and requires a willingness to cooperate, coordinate and change mindsets.
People who defend only what they know, and shy away from new experiences, should not be surprised to find that they lack mobility.
We need greater clarity.
National training qualifications must be comparable, although this does not mean that they have to be standardised.
I already called for this last year, in the EQF own-initiative report that I prepared for Parliament.
A great deal has happened since then.
Fears that Member States would lose powers have been allayed including in my country.
Lifelong learning and the EQF were major milestones of the German Council Presidency, which was acknowledged as successful.
Now it is full steam ahead with creating a national qualifications framework, which is not exactly easy, given Germany's federal structure and the autonomy of each Land.
I would like to thank Mario Mantovani on behalf of the PPE-DE Group for his tenacity in dealing with the Commission and the Council and for keeping everyone in the Groups who followed the EQF informed.
I do hope that the report will be adopted in the first reading tomorrow.
From now on, there is a need for much discussion between trainers, teachers and training institutions, as we go into the details.
I experienced this just yesterday in a meeting with vocational college teachers in Hesse.
When ranking qualifications, for example, the German Master Craftsman or Tradesman Certificate belongs in at least the third or fourth of the eight levels.
Others are not familiar with this qualification at all.
The strength of the German dual system is not apparent to people unless they have experienced it for themselves.
In our European teaching and learning workshop, which is based on the principle of subsidiarity, the employment and vocational policy dimensions will be considerably strengthened in education and training.
Together we must and will achieve an ambitious goal: to incorporate a quality standard, the EQF, in certificates and diplomas by 2010.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, first I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent consultation on this recommendation on the European Qualifications Framework.
I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for listening and being available to everyone.
In the EQF we have a tool that serves the mobility of European citizens, whether as part of training pathways or as part of professional mobility.
Free movement of persons, which is written into our Treaties, is still hindered by citizens' difficulties in having the qualifications obtained in their country of origin recognised throughout the EU.
These qualifications, which are awarded by each Member States, according to its own procedures and systems, come under the sovereignty of each Member State and the EQF respects this.
However, qualifications increasingly need to be used outside the country in which they were awarded, something we wish to encourage out of respect for the value that the diploma or other qualification gives to its holder.
We therefore need a tool for comparing and especially for converting qualifications from one Member State to another.
This is a particularly necessary and sensitive issue for professional qualifications.
That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was keen to incorporate professional qualifications into the EQF.
This has been done and we are glad.
Employees and companies are increasingly mobile in the European job market.
However, employees and employers therefore need guarantees, in all Member States, concerning those things that measure the competence and value of a worker, namely their professional qualifications, regardless of how they were acquired.
Commissioner, I would, however, like to underline one other point.
At the moment the EQF is a nice but empty shell.
For it to exist properly, the diplomas, qualifications and certifications created in each Member State need to be calibrated and registered against references in the European Qualifications Framework.
This will constitute a large amount of work for all the Member States, and will require a lot of energy and specialist expertise.
The European Commission's support will be essential, as will that of the European agencies - I am thinking in particular of Cedefop.
The participation of the social partners will also be essential, at all levels.
They must be involved, as the recommendation states, by the Member States and the sectoral dialogue committees at Community level.
Finally, for the EQF to be complete and effective, it will also be necessary for the economic partners, the professional branches, to understand and appropriate it for themselves.
This is not only because they award the qualifications that should be included in the EQF, but because companies need benchmarks for classifying their jobs and for recruiting.
The EQF rapidly needs to become their common reference framework and I dream of an appropriate deadline by which the EQF will be the reference framework everywhere, even in collective agreements.
First of all, I must commend Mr Mantovani on preparing this very significant document.
The principal aim of this document is to find a way of determining and comparing different qualifications within the labour market and education system.
Without doubt, the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) will have a beneficial impact on the efficiency and flexibility of the EU labour market.
More importantly, the EQF would help to reduce discrimination against both immigrants and EU citizens in the workplace.
Unfortunately, both Lithuanians and citizens of other EU countries have difficulty in using their qualifications in other Member States.
Very often their qualifications are not recognised by employers or institutions.
People feel discriminated against, because they do not have equal opportunities to compete in the labour market.
They often have to accept jobs which pay less and for which they are overqualified.
At a meeting with Lithuanian nationals living and working in London, I was made aware of quite a few complaints regarding discrimination in the workplace and difficulties in obtaining the work for which these people are qualified.
It makes them feel like 'second-class' citizens, yet their qualifications and skills are often much higher than those of the citizens of those countries doing the same kind of work.
They cannot get the job they want or an adequate salary, simply because their qualifications are not recognised.
To sum up, this document is of great importance to most people.
Regretfully, neither the Commission, nor we Members of Parliament, have been able to solve this problem in 22 years.
In 1985 the Council decided to introduce a system to match different countries' professional qualifications.
It has not yet yielded any results.
Unfortunately, once again, we are in no hurry and are proposing not to introduce it until 2012.
Moreover, it is being left to the Member States' discretion.
It is a shame that we are so inefficient.
We should learn from our experience.
Mr President, establishing the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning is something that is of significance to the Europe of today and of the future.
Whether a person will be fulfilled in their personal life and in society depends, after all, on that person's preparation for life and for work.
Historical and contemporary determinants have given rise to a need to devote particular attention to people aged 50 and over and to young people from families experiencing economic difficulties, especially in the new Member States.
Not all of them can, or should, go abroad in search of work.
Conditions need to be created for people to develop in their own environment, in the place where they live.
National qualification frameworks should mean an instrument serving to classify qualifications in line with criteria laid down for specific, attainable levels of study.
The European Union should support the efforts of Member States both legally and economically.
The Union should offer citizens not only the potential for free movement, but also recognition of their occupational qualifications.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, thank you very much to Mario Mantovani, who followed the footsteps of his neighbour on the bench in this question.
We have before us the result, which will require educational authorities in the Member States to use this shared framework as a translation device and a reference point.
There is plenty of room for more pressure to be applied for greater transparency, better comparability and thus equality and recognition of different qualifications within the EU.
I particularly welcome the fact that vocational training is specifically mentioned alongside general education, and given equal status, and that not only formal diplomas will be measured against the standard but also informal skills that people gain in the workplace or at home.
Tricks are often used to make access to the labour market more difficult.
Not infrequently, educational authorities, vocational boards and professional associations attempt to resist competition from outside by being reluctant to recognise tertiary and vocational education qualifications gained elsewhere, for reasons of form.
In 2010 that will be a thing of the past.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, 'encouraging lifelong learning' sounds fine, does it not, with the EU working openly for the good of people and for employment?
Only this morning, Mr Barroso said that he did not like opt-outs, but was in favour of compromises to respect diversity.
Those are fine words, but here we are with yet another attempt to bulldoze wonderful diversity into a common, harmonised, featureless landscape.
Now it is the turn of education, broadly speaking.
However, education is not within EU competence!
It is only covered by proposals under Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty.
So this is also an attempt to smuggle in a competence by the back door.
If the EU wishes to assume competence over education, let it do so honestly, go through the usual channels and employ the transparency we hear so much about.
Following the model of the Bergen Framework, setting up the EUROPASS diploma and certificate supplements with the European credit transfer system will require a harmonised EQF level.
By issuing qualifications at sectoral and regional level, as well as at national level, this EU proposal will ensure an almost complete grip on qualifications.
By issuing grades and awarding qualifications it will ensure that the EU bypasses universities and national governments.
The UK Government is in favour of harmonising qualifications.
It is preparing for this by placing control of the universities under the Privy Council, ready to hand universities over to the EU.
What universities think of this seems to be immaterial.
HMG's true position is revealed by its only objection to this scheme. It does not want the EU logo on the qualification documents.
That is because they do not want people to know that education has been handed over to the EU.
Please tell me, why is it that my Government has taken that stance?
Why is it in favour of an EU project but wants to keep it from the people?
Are other national governments taking the same line?
I would not be surprised if they were, because they, too, may wish to keep it from their people that their universities are being used in this way.
You may gather that I do not like this project, but it is not for reasons of national pride in Britain's universities and colleges.
No. It is because, as a teacher, I value education and recognise that European countries have universities of which they are justly proud - great centres of learning whose alumni have contributed down the centuries to the arts, literature and science, enriching the lives of people everywhere.
I recognise also that this impetus to civilisation came about because those seats of learning evolved separately and independently, with each developing its own particular flavour and identity.
It is strange, is it not, in an age in which personal identity is being jealously guarded and identity theft is regarded as the crime it is, that some people thoughtlessly seek to destroy the unique identity of the institutions which made them what they are, denying others the education they acquired there?
(EL) Mr President, we should not have been able to debate the proposal to recommend a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) today had not our fellow Member, Mr Mantovani, made good use of the experience of former MEPs working on the subject or collaborated so well with the Commission and the Council.
Today we can thus deal with setting up the eight qualification levels covering general education, adult education, vocational education and training, and the three levels of tertiary education qualifications.
In answer to my fellow Member who spoke previously, we stress that Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty are the right legal basis for the proposed recommendation simply because they allow for lifelong learning.
Under no circumstances do we accept that education should be an EU area of responsibility: it remains the preserve of national responsibility.
Comparing qualifications within the EQF, however, ignores teaching methods and types of educational establishment.
As a result, such a comparison refers only to knowledge, the capacity to understand, and the practical application of knowledge and skills.
Greece and many other states are particularly keen on the optional nature of the EQF.
The view has officially been expressed that promoting qualifications league tables has nothing to do with shaping the national educational system or recognising certification for studies.
Besides, for non-formal and informal education, because of its diversity and the special circumstances under which it is acquired, automatic certification is not possible, but a mere reference.
We must also bear in mind that the same person can have several qualifications at various levels.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning is a decisive document to enable the national and sectoral reference frameworks of qualifications to be compared at European level.
The certification of qualifications obtained is essential to enable progress achieved outside formal education, especially in working life, to be integrated with advances achieved in the formal systems.
It thus contributes to greater democratisation throughout the EU as regards the management of personal professional careers.
This directive, as moreover one of the amendments proposed and approved in Parliament emphasises, promotes the validation of these qualifications in accordance with the Council conclusions on common European principles for the identification and validation of non-formal and informal learning.
Mr President, this will enable us to advance towards a single European legal framework that aims to be coherent without diminishing the guarantees that in some cases exist already.
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive that we are discussing will be a decisive tool for greater flexibility on the labour markets, offering a better defence of workers' interests and a better chance of providing quality services.
At this point I can only welcome the Portuguese Presidency's efforts in the field of education to move surely and relatively quickly towards approval by Parliament at first reading.
It is clear that in these circumstances we should also highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur Mr Mantovani and the shadow rapporteurs, notably Mrs Castex.
In order to be more effective, to derive more benefits from professional and academic mobility in the European area we need to work even more effectively in implementing the European Qualifications Framework and in linking it to the European credit system, and this report promotes a significant advance in that direction.
Thus, the proposal for a directive promotes equality of opportunity in the knowledge society we live in, with the aim of better integrating the labour markets of the various Member States, taking account of the rich diversity of the various national systems.
It therefore deserves a positive response from us.
(PL) Mr President, transparency and comparability of qualifications acquired in differing circumstances, systems and countries make it easier to evaluate the level of knowledge both of employees and of employers, thus increasing mobility in the labour market.
This concerns both regulated professions - doctors, nurses and other medical professions, where qualifications are mutually recognised by EU countries - and other professions.
The introduction of the Qualifications Frameworks will give rise to greater social cohesion.
Different treatment should be accorded, however, to artistic educational institutions and professions, where talent and gifts should not be constrained by disciplines, or averaged out, and where the teacher is not objectivised, but continues to be master.

I congratulate the rapporteur.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think this has been an extremely good debate which marks the launch of a very important project, which I think is timely, necessary and, as others have pointed out, is a platform for this and future generations.
It is essential for the working of the single market, it is essential for Europe's social development, it is essential for the ability of Europe's citizens to cope with fast changing economic and labour market change.
It is a passport to personal advancement as well as society's integration.
It has been a very constructive and harmonious debate - apart, I suppose, from the intervention of one compatriot who allowed his mixture of gross exaggeration and overstatement, tinged with a fair amount of ideological prejudice, totally to misrepresent what is being envisaged and proposed.
This is a recommendation, and is exactly that - it is voluntary.
The EQF will not award qualifications: that remains up to countries, universities and other institutions, which remain autonomous.
There will be an EQF reference level on qualifications, for example on level 4, but national level will also be on qualification.
So I am glad to be able to welcome this consensus - notwithstanding one individual - in this Parliament and Council behind the EQF legislative proposal, that this is reflected at the national level, where we see a serious momentum in building national qualifications frameworks.
The debate is closed.
At the end of this debate, I would first of all like to thank the interpreters, who chose to stay even though they were not required to.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) The European reference framework will reduce the complexity of a system with 27 bilateral relations for the recognition of qualifications obtained from academic and professional education.
The Bologna Process of creating, by 2010, a European Education Area is thus supplemented by an instrument of recognition of all qualifications that may be obtained in the Union's Member States.
Although 9 out of 10 European Union citizens believe lifelong education is an important instrument for career development, the lack of financial resources leads to big deficiencies in the training required for the current economy.
A recent eurobarometer shows that only 58% of the respondents are able to use a computer, and only one half of them declare that they are Internet users.
Moreover, over 60% of the citizens cannot use a foreign language in their work.
National budgets designated to lifelong education vary from 40% of the total amount used for education in Northern countries to under 10% in the new Member States.
Thus, initiatives such as Grundtvig or Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs should be extended and doubled by funds that would supplement the insufficient national finances.
Moreover, the European reference framework should be supplemented by programmes that would establish veritable European qualifications, recognized over the entire European Union territory.
in writing. - (BG) It is necessary to point out that the informal educational sector is underdeveloped, rather unknown and often isolated from the formal one.
The European Qualifications Framework is a key instrument in overcoming this discrepancy and also a tool to re-assess and re-organise the vocational orientation and information system.
The development of the EQF will facilitate the mobility of manpower within the 31 participating countries and promote the involvement of sectoral and industrial organisations from the new EU Member States in the absorption of resources from the European Social Fund allocated for the acquisition of new qualifications or upgrading of the existing ones.
The more recent EU Member States like Bulgaria find it important to have the opportunity to exchange good practices and to implement Community pilot programmes.
The development and implementation of the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) intended to facilitate the accumulation, transfer and recognition of educational results, regardless of where and how they have been scored, is of great importance with a view to the transition periods applied to Bulgaria and Romania.
The credit system will foster the free movement and the expansion of the access to the labour market for most of the human resources in the Community, while ensuring reliable basis for comparisons.
I believe that the EQF will give further impetus to the development of this process.
in writing. - (HU) Recognition of citizens' knowledge, skills and competence is indispensable for the European Union's competitiveness and for social cohesion, as well as for individual citizens' mobility.
Participation in lifelong learning and access to lifelong learning for all, including the disadvantaged, must be fostered and improved at both national and Community level.
Young people, adults, immigrants and manual labourers throughout Europe who have informally acquired skills that have never been recognised must be encouraged to participate in lifelong learning programmes, thus avoiding social and labour-market exclusion of these groups.
To do all this, an important role can be played by a common reference framework that serves as a translation device between different qualification systems and their levels, whether for general and higher education or for vocational education and training.
This will increase the transparency, comparability and mobility of citizens' qualifications in different Member States.
The task of the reference framework is to integrate and coordinate national qualifications systems, to ensure non-discrimination, to increase access and progression of qualifications in relation to civil society and the labour market.
In the interests of ending the segregation that exists in education, I support the initiation of measures to provide information and engage in social dialogue.
I also think it is important to recognise informal learning acquired by workers, in order to enable them to change jobs more easily.
The European Union must become a knowledge-based society well prepared to meet the challenges of globalisation.
In such a society, citizens of each Member State must adjust to meet the needs of a competitiveness-driven labour market.
For this reason, learning will be a fundamental prerequisite for all age groups.
in writing. - The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for lifelong learning is a good example of the European Union doing what it should be doing in terms of promoting mobility across national borders.
Over the years most of us will have made representations on behalf of nationals of our own Member States who find that when they take advantage of the freedom of movement available to them within the EU and actually move to another country they are discriminated against because their qualifications are not properly recognised in their new country of residence.
The EQF, by acting as a translation tool for national authorities, will undoubtedly help our constituents to overcome this senseless discrimination.
It should also work to the advantage of any Member State to which a person moves, as it will ensure that an accurate assessment may be made of that individual's qualifications.

EU-Turkey relations (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on EU-Turkey relations.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency would firstly like to thank the European Parliament, and in particular Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for the motion for a resolution on EU-Turkey relations.
The Presidency acknowledges and welcomes Parliament's active engagement with the enlargement process as a constructive contribution to the general debate on enlargement and Turkey's accession process in particular.
There is no doubt that every debate offers a useful opportunity for creating awareness of Turkey's accession process, engaging the citizens of Member States and Turkey in this process and supporting the Turkish Government in its accession path.
I can assure you that we pay particular attention to the views of the European Parliament.
In a few days the Commission will present its regular progress report on Turkey's accession process.
The Council will examine and assess this report very carefully.
In the meantime, I would like to briefly mention a few points in this phase of Turkey's accession negotiations.
We are of the opinion that the recent elections in Turkey demonstrated the wish of the Turkish people for democracy, stability - both political and economic - and progress.
We also welcome how the elections were conducted, the high voter turnout and the improved representativeness of the new Turkish Parliament.
The Presidency shares the views and concerns of this House regarding Turkey's reform process.
We believe that the new Government enjoys increased legitimacy and a clear mandate that should enable decisive steps to be made in advancing and broadening the reform process in Turkey.
It is imperative that the new Government gives fresh impetus to the reforms - and their implementation - by focusing on key areas.
In this regard, the implementation of the Accession Partnership - in particular as regards its short-term priorities - is of great importance.
I would remind you that the Accession Partnership must be reviewed in the coming months.
In this context, I would also like to stress the need for broad consultation and national consensus on Turkey's new Constitution.
We share your views on the importance of reforms in the crucial area of fundamental freedoms and human rights.
Further tangible progress is essential, in particular as regards freedom of expression, religious freedom, cultural rights and women's rights, and also further strengthening of the fight against torture and ill-treatment.
Most of these issues are covered in the Accession Partnership as short-term priorities that Turkey needs to meet.
In particular, in the area of freedom of expression, we regret the lack of progress despite wide public debate on the issue and we are concerned about the increasing nationalism leading to self-censorship.
We continue to firmly believe that Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, as well as other vaguely formulated articles, need to be abolished or substantially amended in order to guarantee freedom of expression.
Progress in this area is of paramount importance for the general advancement of the accession negotiations.
As for religious freedom, tangible progress is urgently needed, in particular following the tragic incidents earlier this year.
The adoption of legislation which will comprehensively address all problems faced by non-Muslim communities - such as legal status, property registration and training of the clergy - in order to guarantee religious pluralism in line with European standards is long awaited.
The Law on Foundations could be a positive first step in this regard and will be carefully assessed once adopted and implemented.
The recent Supreme Court ruling on the Ecumenical Patriarchate is also an issue of concern.
We share your views on civil-military relations.
Recent developments - in particular before and during the election campaign - demonstrate the need for further steps in this area so that the Armed Forces cannot exercise political influence.
Civilian democratic control over the military in line with practice in EU Member States is still to be ensured.
Regarding the south-east, we strongly condemned the recent terrorist attack in the province of Sirnak.
We have also condemned other acts of terror perpetrated in Turkey and will continue to do so.
Terrorist activities can never be justified.
We recall our solidarity with the people of Turkey in this regard.
On the other hand, terrorism should not make us forget about the urgent need to promptly develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that will guarantee the economic, social and cultural development of the south-east.
This is a complex area that we are closely monitoring as part of the ongoing reform process.
Apart from compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey's progress in preparing for accession will be measured against the requirements clearly set out in the Negotiating Framework.
In this respect, as agreed by the Council in December last year, progress made on the issues covered by the Declaration of 21 September 2005, in particular full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement, will be monitored and reviewed.
Regrettably, no progress has yet been made on this issue.
I would also underline that recognition by all Member States is a necessary component of the accession process and that it is therefore vital that the European Union normalises relations between Turkey and all the Member States as soon as possible.
The work required to ensure compliance with the Union's standards and membership obligations is difficult and demands continuous efforts and determination.
We attach particular importance to Turkey's accession process and I can assure you that the Portuguese Presidency will also do its utmost in order to allow these negotiations to advance.
Commitments made need to be met.
Sustaining the reform process and meeting existing obligations will move Turkey's accession process forward to the benefit, first and foremost, of all Turkish citizens.
Nevertheless, progress in the accession process depends fundamentally and primarily on Turkey's performance.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first congratulate Ms Oomen-Ruijten on her solid report and for proposing a draft that is both rigorous and fair.
Turkey went through an extremely difficult period earlier this year with a severe constitutional crisis and high political tensions.
Despite such challenges, it conducted parliamentary and presidential elections in full respect of democratic principles and with a very high level of citizen participation.
The result was that democracy had the last word.
The new Turkish Parliament is largely representative of Turkish political diversity and, as Mr Lobo Antunes said, the new Government can now work with the support of a stable majority and a broad popular mandate.
Thus the way ahead has been cleared in this regard.
Now the time has come to regenerate a new momentum in the reform process.
Therefore the Commission shares the basic approach followed by the draft resolution, which is to identify challenges and to encourage Turkey to meet these policy challenges.
This means to support the commitment of the new Turkish Government to strengthen the reform efforts and to encourage it to translate this commitment rapidly into action.
This concerns both the reform process and the Ankara Protocol.
The Commission welcomes the fact that the Government has put the constitutional reforms at the top of its agenda, with a view to reinforcing democracy and expanding fundamental freedoms.
However, this should not result in any postponement of reforms that are urgently needed today, such as the revision of the infamous Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code and other articles related to freedom of expression or the adoption of the Law on Foundations to ensure freedom of religion.
Further efforts are also needed to ensure democratic supremacy of civil-military relations, to protect the rights of women, children and trade unions, to improve the judiciary system and to enhance the fight against corruption.
Let me say some words on the recent events and the current situation, on which we coordinate very closely with the Presidency and Mr Solana and we have taken due note of Parliament's views.
Turkey faces continual cross-border terrorist attacks from the PKK, which is on the EU list of terrorist organisations.
The European Union condemns all terrorist attacks and understands Turkey's need to protect its citizens.
The EU and Turkey are both committed to the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.
We continue to urge Turkey and Iraq to tackle this problem through cooperation between the relevant authorities and by respecting international law.
The recent bilateral agreement between Turkey and Iraq on the fight against terrorism provides a basis for this.
The Turkish authorities are understandably trying to engage the United States as well as the Iraqi and Iraqi-Kurdish authorities in their efforts, with some signs of progress recently.
The resolution passed in Parliament last week should be seen as part of that overall political strategy.
The European perspective for Turkey has proved to be a key incentive for reforms in the country.
In line with our core principle of conditionality in enlargement policy, the implementation of the reforms on the ground determines progress in the accession negotiations.
However, if we are to use this principle effectively to have serious political leverage to encourage reforms, the European Union itself must stick to its own commitments.
We have to keep our word - pacta sunt servanda.
All Member States continue to support accession negotiations with Turkey, and it is vital for the Union's credibility that the process continues in accordance with the Negotiating Framework of 3 October 2005 and the Council decision of 11 December 2006.
These were unanimous decisions of all 27 Member States.
We should therefore open further chapters once they are technically ready.
At least two chapters - consumer and health protection and trans-European networks - could be opened in the coming weeks.
We also encourage Turkey to work to meet the opening benchmarks already defined for 13 chapters.
Last but not least, please rest assured that your contribution will be duly taken into account in our forthcoming progress report concerning Turkey, which the Commission will adopt on 6 November.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, thank you, both to the Council and to the Commission, for the kind words that have been expressed.
The debate today and the resolution that we are about to adopt are indeed directed in the first instance at the Commission, because we intend to have some input into the progress report.
However, they are also directed at the Council, which will meet again in December in response to the progress report.
What are we doing in the resolution?
What are we doing in the text?
We describe the progress made and the agreements we have reached.
We also describe what has come of the commitment that Turkey entered into.
The resolution is, therefore, a compilation of what has been achieved, but it also contains all manner of things that have not been achieved.
Mr President, what it also includes is what we expect from the Turkish Government, because there is an opportunity now to give a new impetus to the reform process.
The third point I wish to make: we have tried to deepen and broaden the debate with Turkey.
That means, therefore, that I am asking for attention to be given to social cohesion, logistics, transport and energy.
Freedom of speech and religious freedom are rightly given a prominent place in our text.
The constitution, the new constitution should not be any excuse to not pull out all the stops immediately to ensure that all necessary reforms, especially those connected with Article 301, are realised.
Another point that I would like to make is about the relationship with neighbouring countries.
Good relations with neighbours are an absolute necessity.
When I look at Turkey and Armenia, that means that the borders must be opened.
There must be an end to all economic blockades.
Moreover - my final point - if a people does not acknowledge its past, it has no future.
I am therefore also asking the Commission to support Turkey and Armenia on this issue.
Mr President, I cannot say anything more about the PKK because the procedures in this House do not allow me enough time.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on this very good report and thank her very much for the excellent cooperation.
There are a number of messages contained in this report, and when I visited Turkey with Martin Schulz, these were the messages I was able to convey to the Turkish authorities.
Firstly, the reforms must not only be continued but stepped up.
The Commissioner has already mentioned Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code and other reforms to guarantee full and genuine freedom of expression and plurality of opinion in Turkey.
The same naturally applies to freedom of religion and many other issues which will be covered by other colleagues later in the debate.
The reform process has to be moved up a gear.
Secondly, the Kurdish issue: I would like to make my position here very clear.
For many years now, indeed for decades, I have been trying to play my part to help resolve the Kurdish issue, but now the time has come when it is possible to have a political and parliamentary solution to the Kurdish issue and abandon violence.
That is why I cannot understand why the PKK is continuing with terrorism.
I can understand it because the PKK does not want a peaceful solution, and there may well be some people in the military who do not want a peaceful solution either.
Nonetheless, we should send out a clear signal that we do want a peaceful solution, and so does Iraq.
We had a meeting with President Talabani's representative in Ankara and he also made it very clear that what they want is not continued PKK terrorism but a political solution.
I would hope that representatives of the Kurdish regional government will heed the message that the continuation of PKK terrorism damages not only Turkey but also Iraq.
That is why I myself, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, can only endorse this appeal: Turkey and Iraq must come together to work on the basis of peaceful cooperation, which must include the Kurdish regional government, to put an end to terrorism.
At the same time, Turkey must make offers to the Kurdish population of Turkey so that they feel comfortable there and can consider Turkey as their home as well.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur Ria Oomen-Ruijten, but also Jos Lagendijk and Hannes Swoboda, for the very good cooperation during the drafting of this resolution.
I believe we have produced a good text with a surprisingly high level of consensus, and I think that is a very good thing.
For my Group, I would like to highlight and underline the key points once again.
First of all, this resolution is a positive and constructive signal to Turkey.
We welcome the fact that the summer's constitutional crisis has been overcome, and we welcome the fact that the new Government has a strong and clear mandate for further reforms.
However, we urge the Government unequivocally to use this mandate to genuinely drive forward the reforms.
What is important in this context - as the resolution says - is that these reforms are extremely important for Turkey itself, for the Turkish people, for Turkish society and for the Turkish economy.
Turkey must continue to improve steadily and of its own accord and I am glad to see that there is increasing consensus in Turkey on this issue, as expressed in the April programme.
It is good that this is still the case.
What is important for us is that the Copenhagen criteria will continue to be the key benchmark for the negotiations, just as the European Union's own absorption capacity continues to be an important and indispensable criterion.
Reforms are urgently needed in the following areas in particular, some of which have already been mentioned.
The Penal Code: Article 301 has already been mentioned, that is quite clear.
To my mind, we should be starting to include Article 252 in the debate as well.
This concerns insulting the memory of Mustafa Kemal AtatÃŒrk and is problematical because this is also a restriction of freedom of speech.
A second important point is improving the situation of women.
The number of honour killings continues to be a matter of grave concern.
The constitutional reform must continue.
Fundamental human rights and personal freedoms must be protected.
Let me add that, from our perspective, electoral law is also a problem.
A 10% hurdle is unheard of elsewhere in the OSCE.
Let me conclude by saying that we have to show some understanding for the difficult situation in Turkey, particularly in view of the dramatic events in the south-east on Turkey's border with Iraq.
We unequivocally condemn the terrorist activities of the PKK in recent weeks and I would like to pass on my Group's condolences to the families of the soldiers who have been killed.
We urge the Turkish Government to react cautiously to this situation.
There has been no sign, to date, that this has not been the case.
Nonetheless, the measures adopted to mitigate the threat to Turkish territory must comply with the following conditions.
They must be appropriate, proportionate and limited over time.
The European Union understands the difficult situation in Turkey.
It is important for Turkey to retain this understanding.
A peaceful solution is, of course, our highest objective.
Today's resolution is a genuinely constructive signal for positive dialogue with Turkey.
Turkey will continue to be a very important partner for the European Union and must now press ahead resolutely with reform in its own interests.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one year on from the last resolution adopted by this House on EU-Turkey relations, it is sad to see that certain fundamental issues remain tragically topical.
Turkey does not recognise Cyprus, to all intents and purposes a Member State of the European Union; freedom of the press is still curtailed, since Article 301 of the Penal Code has not yet been amended and Turkey persists in not acknowledging the genocide of the Armenian population in 1915.
The recent appalling terrorist attack by the PKK, the ensuing robust response from the Turkish army and the threat to intervene in the northern part of Iraq unless the PKK ends its terrorist activities once and for all: these factors compound the dangerous and delicate geopolitical position in which Turkey finds itself.
Some progress has of course been made.
I am thinking in particular of the increased representation of women in the newly elected Turkish Parliament, in economic circles and in the academic world, but we need to ask ourselves now more than ever whether the Europe of tomorrow wishes to be a large political entity or to have a strong cultural identity, because these uncertainties play into the hands of Turkey which does not wish to stop being itself.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is unfortunately overshadowed by the terrorist attacks in Turkey.
I would much rather have spoken about the desirability of picking up the thread of the reforms again; unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that, despite many fine words, in practice up to now far too little has come of this.
However, I think that the main question now is: what do we think Turkey should do?
Let us drop the hypocrisy from this debate, ladies and gentlemen.
Every one of us knows, or should know, that there are no easy answers to this devilish dilemma.
On the one hand we realise, we know, that any country where fifty people have been killed in the last month has to do something in response, while at the same time many of us realise - including, I think, many in the Turkish Government - that large-scale military operations are no solution.
They do not root out the PKK, they cause immense diplomatic and political damage and - most importantly - they make a solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey much more difficult.
Let us therefore hope that all the attempts now being made to find a diplomatic and political solution will be successful.
The problem, ultimately, does not lie in the Iraqi mountains, the problem lies in Turkey, but the solution to the problem - the Kurdish problem - is not Turks against Kurds.
In my view, the issue is one of those in Turkey, Turks and Kurds who know that the only solution to the problem is a political one - the AKP and the DTP - versus the radicals, on the Turkish side and on the Kurdish side, who are not interested in a political solution at all and who think that military violence can help: on the Turkish side the army and a section of the opposition and on the Kurdish side the PKK.
Let us be very clear: the present attacks by the PKK are, of course, directed at the Turkish state, but they are also an attack on the Kurdish DTP party in the Turkish Parliament, which is seeking a political solution to the problem.
That is why it is so important that this Parliament does indeed strongly condemn the PKK and its terrorist attacks, while at the same time expressing support for all those on the Kurdish side and on the Turkish side who are trying to find a peaceful political solution to this problem.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, with the prospect of Turkey's accession to the EU firmly in mind, the Commission, and hence the Union as a whole, is called upon to complete, in the next few days, the assessment of Turkey's progress, or lack of it, in the various sectors it is required to harmonise with the European acquis.
We have declared that, provided it complies with all the Copenhagen criteria and the obligations it has accepted according to the Negotiating Framework and additional protocol, Turkey should be able to join the EU.
We do not think that any compromise solutions will bring the results that either Turkey or the Union is hoping for.
We should like to point out that Turkey has made some progress, but we repeat that if its accession is to proceed smoothly, it must do as previous accession countries have done: comply with its Convention obligations to the EU as a whole.
Turkey must therefore fulfil its obligations towards Cyprus; it must open its sea and air ports to ships and aircraft from the Republic of Cyprus and lift the veto on participation by Cyprus in international organisations and multilateral treaties.
As a Left-wing group, and especially as AKEL (the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus), we are confident that the prospect of Turkey's accession to the EU will ensure compliance with its obligations, especially as regards ending the occupation of Cyprus by Turkish troops.
We also believe that by encouraging Turkey on its course towards Europe, assuming that Turkey simultaneously fulfils its obligations to the EU, we can exert pressure on it.
Thus Turkey must fulfil the following obligations: to defend and respect the human rights of all who live there, including Kurds and other minorities; to recognise the genocide of the Armenians, and to open its border with Armenia, with all the socio-economic consequences that this will entail.
If Turkey hopes to continue and complete its accession course, then it is patently obvious that the measures and policies it adopts will have to lead to full compliance with the European acquis and absolute respect for international law, which ultimately governs the workings of the EU.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (EL) Mr President, what we have heard is astonishing, and it comes from none other than the competent Commissioner, who was all too ready to brand as terrorists those claiming to be fighting for freedom.
I wonder if we are not over-willing to describe Turkey as being attacked on all sides.
This is a country that keeps troops in an EU Member State, and is not the first and only country to adjust to EU requirements.
I shall end by turning to a much more technical matter.
Shortly before the adventure on its eastern borders, the price of oil in Turkey was USD 76 a barrel in Europe; now, owing to its arms, to which it always has recourse when solving its own problems, oil has risen to more than USD 90 a barrel.
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, during the discussion of this resolution in committee, it seemed as if Parliament as a whole was half asleep.
Vague criticisms are formulated as a pure formality but, apart from that, it seems as if we have to accept the accession of Turkey as a fait accompli.
Yet Turkey has made hardly any progress since the beginning of the negotiations.
I refer, for example, to a recent report by Amnesty International about the human rights situation and the treatment of minorities.
Turkey's position on Cyprus is hardly mentioned any more.
What is more, there is a serious risk that Turkey is about to launch a large-scale military attack on Iraq.
Then we would be faced with a situation where a candidate country is not only occupying part of the territory of an existing Member State with its military, but on top of that is going to wage a kind of local war in another neighbouring country, Iraq on this occasion.
Mr President, the majority of the population in Europe is against the possible accession of Turkey. This is because Turkey is not a European country and so it does not belong in the European Union.
Instead of compromising the credibility of Europe even more, we would do better to pursue a favoured partnership with Turkey, in all openness and unequivocally, instead of full EU membership.
Mr President, I detect, particularly from the Commission, a tendency to present non-European Turkey in the best possible light.
Not surprising, maybe, considering the millions of pre-accession aid which we are pouring in, but there are uncomfortable realities to be faced.
Honour crimes, gross human rights abuses, lack of protection for non-Muslim minorities, absence of religious freedom and anti-Christian attacks and propaganda are my biggest concern.
This year, fatal attacks on Christians have continued, such as the slaying of three men in Malatya in April.
Genuine freedom of religion is often the touchstone of a country's abiding commitment to human rights.
In Turkey's case, it has much to do, including the legal status of religious groups and property rights, but fundamentally the right to worship freely and the right to convert must be respected.
(DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for drawing up this report which will be submitted to the Commission and should be taken into account as Parliament's contribution to the forthcoming progress report.
Turkey has overcome domestic problems, the Government has a clear mandate, the referendum on Sunday on constitutional amendments concerning the election of the President produced the right outcome, and there is now no reason to delay the reforms any longer.
I would therefore like to begin with an appeal to the Turkish Government: if it is serious about joining the EU, then it has to increase the intensity of the reforms.
Relatively little happened here last year, as we all know.
Secondly, the reforms are intended to benefit the Turkish people first and foremost.
They are not an end in themselves or any sleight of hand on Europe's part; they are intended to address the deficits which should not be present in a democracy, notably in relation to freedom of opinion, freedom of religion, women's rights, minority rights, electoral law, etc. Turkey must tackle these issues and dismantle these deficits of its own accord.
I would like to mention another subject as well, namely the Armenian question.
As a German, I think that we can expect a clear acknowledgement of its historical responsibility from Turkey.
Its refusal to speak out on this issue and remove the blockades of Armenia is a topic which must continue to be addressed in the discussions.
At present - as Mr Swoboda has just said - there is a concern that military conflict in the Kurdish region will spill over into Iraq.
Here, we clearly prefer a diplomatic solution, a negotiated solution, instead of a military solution.
I fully endorse the position of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on this issue.
Ultimately, Turkey itself must determine whether and how it wishes to continue down the road to Europe.
From our perspective, full accession to the EU is not the only option; the negotiations have purposely remained open-ended and it is ultimately up to Turkey whether it wishes to pursue this route proactively.
It is not only about whether Europe itself has the capacity to grant accession to Turkey.
(NL) Mr President, I would also like to express my compliments to the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
My immediate response to Mr Langen's remark is that in my Group we are definitely talking about negotiations with a view to membership of the European Union!
The resolution we are debating today is an encouragement to the Turkish Government to keep going down that route whatever it does.
Prime Minister ErdoÄan was given a strong mandate to do that by the Turkish electorate.
That does indeed put him in a position to spur on the reforms.
We expect rapid results now and we therefore expect that the Commission will soon come up with a progress report to that effect.
Urgent issues should not be overlooked, of course.
I think that it would be a hugely important symbolic step, which would have a huge ripple effect, if the Turkish Government were to do something about Article 301, if they were to repeal it or reformulate it.
That would create the necessary openness in Turkey for debate, including debate on issues from the past, and that brings me to the Armenian question.
We believe that it is very important that there be an internal debate on this in Turkey, but it is mainly up to Turkey itself to organise that and not so much for Parliament or the US House of Representatives to try to force the issue.
It is mainly an internal matter; we can help, but there is not really much point in us continually pushing for this from outside.
The new constitution has been announced.
That also creates opportunities, we believe, to finally seek a political solution to the Kurdish question.
I share the view of those who say that we should do everything we can to prevent a military escalation in northern Iraq, but we can only do that if we first distance ourselves from the terrorist attacks of the PKK and demand the PKK to stop.
Secondly, we must also support Turkey in its dialogue with Iraq and the Iraqi authorities, and also in its dialogue with the regional authorities in Kurdish Iraq to cooperate in practice to stop these attacks.
We welcome new diplomatic initiatives, but we believe that it is mainly practical cooperation in the region itself that will drive down and end the violence.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council presidency said 'it depends on Turkey' and many colleagues have repeated this idea, including Mr Langen who said 'it is up to them to decide'.
Well, I do not believe that is so.
In my opinion Europe must assume its own responsibilities.
This is not just a problem about Turkey and its compliance with the formal accession criteria.
The truth is that in recent months Europe, Europe's governments - beginning with, but not only, the French Presidency - have been sending out a message that Turkey will not join the European Union.
The Oomen-Ruijten report starts from this assumption and the text is probably the best that could be drafted in this House, but we need to have the courage to alter the overall context: the current political and military crisis on the border between Turkey and Iraq is partly the responsibility of the European Union, given that politically we have slammed the door in Turkey's face even though the relevant negotiations are continuing.
What is needed is a major leap forward, whereby the European Union, the governments, explicitly call for a political report on the individual right of citizens living on Turkish soil to democracy and the rule of law, with a view to joining Europe.
This may help Turkey move towards Europe and not towards the Middle East.
(NL) Mr President, in a recent interview in the Dutch press, Commissioner Rehn stated unequivocally which reforms in Turkey are the most urgent for the EU, and I quote: 'they are in the area of freedom of speech and religion, core principles of democracy'.
I am grateful to the Commissioner for this clear statement of position.
It also led me to bring to his attention a document from the Alliance of Protestant Churches in Turkey.
The document is dated 1 September 2007 and describes the serious distress and concerns of Turkish Protestants about the absence of freedom of religion.
Commissioner, I trust that you will speak firmly to your Turkish interlocutors about the vulnerable position in Turkish society of the Turkish Protestants, or all Turkish Christians.
Treating the symptoms, Mr President, is really not enough.
The media and politicians are creating a very intolerant, dangerous climate for non-Muslim minorities in Turkey.
Here too the situation calls for swift action from Brussels toward Ankara.
I will hand a second document on this to the Commissioner and eagerly await a swift response from him in writing.
(DE) Mr President, a few days ago I was in the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus and I gained a first-hand impression of the systematic destruction of around 500 Greek Orthodox churches and the destruction of European cultural heritage which can never be made good.
In my view, this conflicts with the spirit of Europe just as clearly as the continuing lack of tolerance towards Christians and other minorities, or indeed the offence of 'insulting Turkish identity' which is used to suppress freedom of opinion and freedom of the press, to say nothing of the continuing human rights violations, the failure to address the issue of the genocide against the Armenians, and ongoing Islamicisation.
It is quite unacceptable that an accession candidate should still be occupying parts of an EU Member State, namely Northern Cyprus, to say nothing of planning a military attack on another country, as is currently the case against Iraq.
Brussels never tires of emphasising that compliance with fundamental rights, especially freedom of religion and freedom of expression, has the highest priority for accession to the EU.
In the case of Turkey's membership aspirations, these are clearly nothing but empty words.
(EL) Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her report.
And now, a timely issue: what will happen, Mr President, if Turkey, a candidate country, ignores the admonishments of the EU and invades northern Iraq?
What are Turkey's intentions?
Are they, perhaps, to bring about another Cyprus situation, or to occupy territory in Kurdish-speaking Iraq, further complicating the efforts of many, including European countries, to stabilise Iraq?
How can Member States or candidate countries be allowed to act as destabilising factors in an area in which European soldiers are losing their lives in an attempt to achieve stability?
May I remind you that Turkish troops are occupying 40% of Cyprus.
This has not prevented the country from starting accession talks.
May I remind you that Turkey is still not complying with the EU's request to extend the Ankara Protocol.
I wonder what the European Commission's report, which is expected on 6 November, will have to say about this.
If the message is one of tolerance, then why not be tolerant on so many other issues of principle and values that are at the heart of the EU?
In the final analysis, the key question is: are we talking about spreading EU values or diminishing their sphere of influence?
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the constructive message we are preparing to send to the Council and the Commission, but also to the Turkish Government and Parliament.
I regret, however, that our Parliament did not express itself more clearly on an issue that is undoubtedly sensitive but no less important: I am talking about the Armenian genocide.
Since 1987 this Parliament has applied the word 'genocide' to the massacre between 1915 and 1917 of 1.2 million Armenians, i.e. two-thirds of the Armenian population living at that time under the Ottoman Empire.
The US Senate and House of Representatives have just said the same and it is unfortunate that this Parliament is lagging behind the Americans on this issue.
As highlighted recently in a press release by the International Federation for Human Rights, many Turkish citizens are charged with insulting Turkish identity on the basis of Article 301 of the Penal Code.
In order to tackle this period in history publically, I believe that this article has to be abolished as soon as possible.
We are not benefiting our Turkish friends in any way by making them forget their history.
This duty to remember is also a duty to the descendants of the people who survived the genocide and to the international community itself.
I thus call on Parliament to support the amendments that call for recognition of the Armenian genocide and those that underline the need for complete respect for religious freedoms and minority rights.
Mr President, Turkey is an important country for political, economic, military and cultural reasons, and it is therefore important to the EU.
Realising this, the EU has decided to commence accession negotiations.
The path towards accession has not been very smooth, but it has helped initiate a much-needed democratic reform programme in Turkey.
Such reforms are welcomed both by the EU and by the citizens of Turkey.
Those reforms must continue, and for that reason, at least, our support for Turkish accession must be firm.
Nobody is ignoring the fact that problems exist.
My country, Cyprus, is at the centre of one such problem, but I, like most people in this Chamber, realise that problems are not solved by conflict, but by peaceful negotiation.
A more European Turkey is much better for discussing and solving problems with, and hence I fully support Turkey's accession to the EU.
Consequently, I endorse the compromise reached through the wise handling afforded by Ms Oomen-Ruijten, with the honest and fruitful cooperation of all those interested colleagues, who may have differing opinions on certain specific issues, but who all agree on the principle that the EU can achieve more by cooperating constructively with the Turkish people than by destructively antagonising them.
Turkey is undergoing a difficult period right now, and the use by the EU of more carrot and less stick is presently the appropriate way to proceed.
Let our overwhelming support for this report be proof to the Turkish people that we do want them in the EU, and let it be a help for greater and faster reforms in Turkey and for enhanced facilitation of solving the far too longstanding Cyprus problem.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of us have invoked geopolitical reasons for opposing Turkey's accession to Europe.
Now the facts on the ground are proving us right, given that Ankara has burst in like an elephant on the delicate balance of Iraq, where our troops are risking their lives every day and fighting for the population's freedom.
I believe we need to think about this because, fellow Members, your dear democratic Turkey, that human rights paradise on earth, is knocking at Europe's door at the very moment when a dreadful, unpredictable, tragic scenario of war is opening up on the Iraqi front.
When you return to Brussels, do what I intend to do: go and visit the Armenian restaurant.
Do not your non-EU friends include the Armenians?
Yet their premises have been wrecked by hooligans, by Turkish criminals, who have burned down a restaurant in the capital of Europe just because it is Armenian.
Such is the democratic nature of Turkish nationalists!
Therefore, why should we welcome them, when they still do not acknowledge the Armenian genocide?
I invite you to vote in favour of my amendment.
Mr President, the resolution emphasises that Turkey must fully comply with the Copenhagen criteria as a basis for accession to the EU.
The report also urges the Turkish Government to bring its approach to freedom of religion in line with those principles as defined by the European Court of Justice.
Since Kemal AtatÃŒrk, Turkey has maintained a secular state against the growing power of fundamentalist and literalist Islam.
I wonder whether the Turks realise that entering the EU will fundamentally undermine their ability to resist militant Islam.
If Turkey joins the EU, their Islamists will use the human rights legislation as a shield from behind which to advance their jihad in Turkey and Europe.
The British people are coming to realise that if Turkey joins the EU, another 70 million people will have the right to come to Britain.
Turkish accession will be a disaster for the Turks and a disaster for Britain.
(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate on the Florenz motion for a resolution, it was rightly observed yesterday that a large majority of the population support strict measures to ban smoking at the workplace and in bars and restaurants.
I had hoped that this resolution would also take account of the view of an overwhelming majority of the population, that is that Turkey cannot join the European Union.
However, I am obviously cherishing too many illusions.
When it comes to crucial matters, such as the Constitution or the accession of Turkey to the European Union, the opinion of the people suddenly does not count any more.
Turkey, a friendly nation, is not a European country.
Full stop, amen, finished.
That should be the end of the discussion.
However, not only does Parliament not accept its responsibility, more than once it has been blind to specific recent developments that clearly demonstrate that Turkey does not belong in the European Union, and that the decision to start accession negotiations was a mistake.
Why does this resolution not mention the resistance of the AKP to a constitutional provision that would make conversion to another religion no longer punishable under the law?
Why are people so vague about the Armenian question and about Cyprus?
This is another example of European Realpolitik, which you can count us out of.
