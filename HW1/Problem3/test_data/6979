The year 2006 saw the highest death toll since 1994 when 103 died, in particular in Rwanda, Algeria and the former Yugoslavia.
Censorship and media bans are, of course, widespread and persistent.
In this joint motion for a resolution we are calling on all EU bodies - Member State diplomats, the High Representative for CFSP and the Commission - to strengthen and coordinate their efforts to secure Mr Johnston's release.
We are also calling on the Palestinian Authority to increase its efforts and it, no doubt, will give the matter all the greater priority if it is pressed by the Palestinian people.
I thank all those in Gaza - journalists and citizens of all kinds - for their vocal demands for Alan Johnston's release.
They know that they need a journalist of integrity and commitment to give them a window on the world.
Free democracies cannot flourish without press freedom.
As we insist on Alan Johnston's safe return, we salute the courage of all journalists who put their safety on the line in order to bring the truth to the world and to allow us all to enjoy democracy.
Madam President, honourable Members, allow me, at this point, to make a brief comment on behalf of the Council and express how very depressing this topic is for all of us.
The BBC correspondent, Alan Johnston, was abducted in Gaza on 12 March.
A large amount of anxiety was prevalent at last Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers surrounding Mr Johnston, who has already been missing for six weeks.
We call for his immediate and unconditional release.
Mr Johnston is an internationally respected journalist with many friends in Gaza.
It has always been a matter of concern for him that the world should see with its own eyes how things stand there.
His abduction is a criminal act which I can only condemn in the strongest possible terms.
At this point, I would also like to extend my sympathy to his family, which is fighting on his behalf, and which has already been living in fear and uneasy uncertainty for more than one and a half months now.
(Applause)
Madam President, it has been more than six weeks since Alan Johnston was kidnapped, and the Commission has expressed its solidarity with his family, friends and colleagues at this very difficult time.
Margot WallstrÃ¶m, as Vice-President of the Commission, has made a public statement on the kidnapping of Mr Johnston on behalf of the whole College, expressing its deep concern over his plight and calling for his immediate release.
This week, the kidnapping was condemned by the Council, which has called for Mr Johnston's unconditional release.
Furthermore, yesterday, my colleague Louis Michel also raised the issue of the abduction of the BBC journalist during a meeting with the Palestinian Deputy Prime Minister, Mr al-Ahmad.
He asked him to use all his influence and contacts and to do everything in his power to locate Mr Johnston.
The Deputy Prime Minister assured Mr Michel that he would do all he could to secure a rapid release.
Commissioner Michel also repeated those requests in his meetings with other Palestinian interlocutors during his trip to the region.
Intensive coordinated diplomatic efforts are under way for an immediate release of Mr Johnston.
Our staff in Jerusalem are following developments closely and inform us that the Palestinian authorities, in cooperation with the security forces, are discussing all possible options with the UK Government, with a view to a successful outcome.
This remains a high priority for President Abbas, and we note the public statements that have also been made by Prime Minister Haniyeh, as well as by Mr Barghouti, on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, and by Palestinians around the world, condemning this kidnapping.
Clearly, the kidnapping of a prominent journalist like Alan Johnston, who has done so much to bring the situation of Palestinians to the world's attention, is particularly distressing.
Those responsible for this abduction are doing a disservice to the cause of the Palestinian people and to the peace process in the Middle East.
(Applause)
Thank you for those statements.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.

Human rights situation in the Philippines
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the Philippines.
author. - (DE) Madam President, by means of this resolution today, we are giving expression to our significant anxiety regarding the increasing number of political assassinations which have been committed over recent years in the Philippines.
The human rights organisation, Karapatan, has recorded 839 cases of summary executions since 2001.
All the victims were individuals who had given their support to matters of concern facing the Filipino people: farmers fighting for their land, workers and trade union leaders who are standing up for fair wages and better working conditions, and committed members of the clergy.
Arbitrary executions, omnipresent political repression, growing militarisation and the fact that perpetrators from paramilitary and military units are exempt from punishment and protected have, unfortunately, become a government trademark.
For a long time, foreign countries have looked away.
As far as the International Court of Justice in The Hague is concerned, ignorance and a misjudgment of the situation are just as responsible for the fact that foreign countries have turned a blind eye for a long time as the approval given by the USA which the government in Manila could, and can continue, to rely on.
We condemn the rough and systematic violations of citizens' rights, the abductions, the disappearances and political assassinations.
We firmly call on the State authorities in the Philippines to carry out the necessary inquiries and to bring those responsible to justice.
We call on the State authorities to ratify the UN Convention on abduction by force and to enact the implementing provisions.
All these steps are required as the first step in de-escalation so that, in a few weeks, halfway democratic elections can be guaranteed.
author. - Madam President, the human rights situation in the Philippines is bad and it is getting worse.
Reports of extrajudicial killings, illegal detentions, torture, threats and harassment of politicians, trade unionists, students, religious and human rights workers are received with increasing frequency by international human rights organisations.
The Government of the Philippines appears unable, and at many times unwilling, to proceed with the necessary determination, both in investigating these human rights violations and in prosecuting the perpetrators vigorously and effectively.
In this motion for a resolution we wish to express our grave concern to the Philippines Government at the sorry and worrisome state of affairs in their country.
At the same time, we want to send a strong signal that the EU will not stand idle and watch the human rights situation continuing to deteriorate in the Philippines.
We will take the necessary measures if matters do not follow a remedial course as soon as possible.
author. - (DE) Madam President, in his report dated 22 March to the UN Human Rights Council, the UN's special rapporteur, Mr Philip Alston, explained in unequivocal terms what these summary executions in the Philippines are all about.
As has been formulated in the joint resolution, victims of these summary executions include members of opposition parties, the clergy, trade union leaders, farmers, journalists, lawyers, human rights activists and so on, as well as witnesses of other summary murders who were accused by government representatives of being a front for illegally armed groups.
The Arroyo Government bears a high degree of responsibility for over 800 political assassinations since he came to power in 2001.
Within the framework of so-called counterinsurgency, the Filipino army and police also resort to ways of committing political assassinations.
In a chapter of the report entitled Orders of Battle, in the light of documents held by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, it is clearly shown that summary executions are an army and police strategy.
This report, on which basis the Armed Forces of the Philippines act, and which is also frequently implemented by the Filipino National Police, makes provision for a military fight against political opponents.
Now, the Conservative group obviously wishes to strike any reference 'to the role played by the armed forces in these murders' from the joint resolution.
This is nothing short of scandalous.
This would not only amount to a slap in the face for the United Nations and its special rapporteur, but also a slap in the face for the victims and their friends and family.
In the UN special rapporteur's report, the following must also be emphasised: 'Newspapers carry almost daily reports of senior military officials urging that such groups be neutralised and calling upon the populace to recognise that to support their candidates in the upcoming elections would be to support the enemy.'
That leaves nothing to be desired in terms of clarity and I ask that the passage mentioned not be deleted from the resolution so that this House sends out a clear signal.
author. - (ES) Madam President, on the eve of important elections - the local and legislative elections in the Philippines - it is appropriate and timely that we should be discussing some of that country's main problems, in particular the worrying escalation of extrajudicial crimes and assassinations - now more than 800 since President Arroyo took power in the archipelago in 2001 - the huge majority of which have so far gone unpunished.
The current situation shows a clear pattern of political assassinations in the Philippines, and we must therefore call upon the government in Manila to take the appropriate measures with a view to putting an end to the threats and harassment against members of the opposition, journalists, farm workers calling for their rights to be respected within the context of the agrarian reform under way, human rights activists and even witnesses in trials of their victimisers.
Various human rights organisations - such as Food First Information and Action Network (FIAN) - have for a long time been warning, for example, of the non-implementation of national agrarian reform programmes, which means that many landowners are refusing to hand land over to the farmers.
The climate of violence linked to this situation has now led to the assassination of at least 38 campesino leaders.
We should welcome the fact that the President has committed herself to the principle of 'zero tolerance' in the face of human rights violations, but their scale demands much more ambitious actions, particularly in view of the fact that various national and international reports directly implicate parts of the army and the police in those violations.
Notable amongst these reports are the statements by the UN Human Rights Council's Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, Philip Alston, and by the Melo Commission.
The situation is particularly alarming in the Bontoc peninsula, where hundreds of farmers are facing many cases of harassment and physical violence perpetrated by private armed groups.
Finally, I believe that it is important to take note of the work carried out by the negotiation panel of the peace process as well as the government's announcement that complete self-determination for the people of Mindanao would be guaranteed.
Furthermore, I must once again express the reservations of many of us about the inclusion of certain groups - such as the Ejercito del Nuevo Pueblo - on the European Union's list of terrorist groups, since that does not contribute to future peace negotiations but rather hinders them.
As requested by various international organisations and institutions defending and promoting human rights, we hope that this urgent resolution will help to persuade the Philippines Government to take a much firmer position in the fight against political murders and to guarantee the safety of the people under threat, in particular farmers and political and human rights activists.
author. - (DE) Madam President, in two weeks, elections will be held in the Philippines.
The risk is rising that internal political conflicts will escalate.
Since 2006, as has been mentioned by my fellow Members, journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, farmers and priests have been murdered.
What is unclear is who the perpetrators are.
It is clear, however, that the murders always follow the same pattern.
The authorities are incapable of conducting investigations with sufficient thoroughness.
The judicial system is overloaded, under funded and inefficient.
The number of convictions is so low that one can almost already talk about a climate of impunity.
President Arroyo and his government are aware of the seriousness of the situation.
A special police task force and the independent Melo Commission were set up.
Their recommendations resulted in the State President ordering the strengthening of the investigation and prosecution processes, the establishment of special courts and, finally, the creation of witness protection programmes as well.
In February, the UN's special rapporteur, Mr Philip Alston, was able to question those responsible and affected extensively.
I side with his demand that accusations regarding the involvement of elements of the military or individuals in the army should be examined.
The European Union should offer both technical support and support in terms of personnel to enable these murders to be cleared up and the justice system to be improved in a sustainable manner.
author. - (PL) Madam President, the situation in the Philippines is a cause for great concern.
In two weeks, elections will be held there. This will, in part, involve the election of new senators.
Unfortunately, the situation in the Philippines is once again such that, while in other countries elections celebrate democracy to some extent and are refreshing even if they create tensions, the Philippine press are only writing about how many people will die and how violent the forthcoming elections will be.
This has been happening for over half a year, and is something that I have been following closely.
It is a bad omen for that country.
I visited the Philippines this year and tried to become acquainted with the situation.
I would like to say that in the Philippines the voice of the European Union is listened to very carefully and it is a good thing that our Parliament is very critical of any violence which may accompany the political process.
We should clearly ask the government of the Philippines to intensify efforts to ensure that political killings cease to be a constant part of the election campaign in that country.
Unfortunately, it is a very extreme example of the political landscape in that beautiful country, which deserves to live in democracy, as we do.
I am pleased that there are so many Members in the European Parliament who share this view and support our joint declaration.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Gloria Arroyo's succession to the Philippines Presidency after former President Estrada's impeachment trial on corruption charges, and her eventual election in May 2004, have brought some improvements to the country, particularly in terms of security.
The Government of the Philippines has degraded the military effectiveness of Islamist terrorists in the south-east, and negotiated a peace accord with one group and an ongoing ceasefire with another.
However, for some time, sadly there has been a series of murky extrajudicial killings, allegedly carried out by the security forces.
The government rightly recognised this as a very serious matter and ordered appropriate investigations.
This resulted in a series of recommendations this February from Justice Melo's independent commission, set up specifically to address this issue, followed by a six-point government-endorsed plan to stop further human rights abuses and end the existing climate of impunity.
I warmly welcome this approach, and in particular the setting-up of a dedicated police task force, Usig, to bring those in authority who have ordered human rights violations to eventual justice.
Madam President, the Philippines have ratified the key, international human rights covenants and conventions.
The government of the Philippines respects its citizens' human rights in principle.
A further positive note is the abolition of the death penalty in June 2006.
The EU has worked towards this time and again.
Nevertheless, there is cause for alarm.
In 2006, the killings and abductions of journalists, left-wing political activists, civil rights activists and Church representatives increased significantly throughout the entire country.
The opposition has provided reports of executions without court proceedings and holds the government and its security apparatus responsible.
At the very least, the government is accused of failing to resolve crimes with the necessary vigour.
For its part, the government rejects these accusations and suspects, at least in part, purges within the militant left-wing camp.
The most prominent recent victim was Bishop Alberto Ramento, who was extremely critical of the government.
His murder was already described as having been cleared up the very day it had been committed.
It was alleged to have been a robbery with murder committed by a youth.
Grave doubts were expressed by Mr Ramento's cohorts and criticism made of the inadequate and unprofessional preservation of evidence.
Shortly before starting out on his European trip in the summer of 2006, President Arroyo appointed a Commission chaired by the former Supreme Court judge, JosÃ© Melo, to investigate the murders of politically active government critics.
The Melo Commission report was published in February 2007 in the face of massive public pressure.
This report confirmed the accusation surrounding a lack of readiness to produce clarifying evidence and apportioned primary responsibility to the armed forces.
An investigation by UN special rapporteur Alston has reached the same conclusion.
The EU has repeatedly addressed the Philippines on this problem in an unequivocal manner through its embassies in the country and political meetings within the framework of the human rights dialogue.
On the strength of this, and under public pressure from active Filipino civil society, the government gave a public presentation of the measures taken hitherto, acknowledged its shortcomings and asked the EU for support in establishing special courts and special public prosecutors' offices, in consolidating witness protection, strengthening the technical and forensic capabilities of the security forces and in consolidating consciousness on the part of the security forces in observing human rights.
At the invitation of the Filipino Government, an EU mission is currently in the country examining the conditions for this request.
Furthermore, the national Human Rights Commission and civil society should be strengthened with a view to observing the situation.
In addition to the killings and abductions of critics of the regime and government, serious accusations are being levelled in the Philippines concerning torture, the disappearance of individuals, unlawful detention, human trafficking and the abuse of women and children.
Above all in the military conflict with various Communist and separatist rebel groups, and in the fight against terrorism, human rights violations are regularly committed by the police and the military and acts of violence also committed by members of extremist groups.
Madam President, the European Commission follows developments in the Philippines very closely.
In recent high-level contacts - including the meeting between President Barroso and President Arroyo last September, and between Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Foreign Minister Romulo in March - we have encouraged the Filipino authorities to advance their economic and social reforms, but expressed grave concern about the sharp increase in extrajudicial killings.
We also made clear our support for the peace process in Mindanao.
Our primary concern is that the extrajudicial killings should stop and that the crimes which have been committed should be properly investigated and the perpetrators duly prosecuted, building on the conclusions of the reports of Senior Judge Melo and Professor Alston.
The Commission, together with Member States, is therefore responding positively to a request from the Filipino Government to provide technical support for investigations.
Because the areas in which support has been requested are quite diverse, we are preparing a needs-assessment mission with Member State and Commission participation, which will visit the Philippines in May for direct discussions with the authorities and other interested groups, including civil society.
The Commission is funding the majority of the costs of the mission and has played a lead role in its preparation.
The findings of this mission should provide a basis on which the EU can mobilise effective support for the investigations.
Naturally, we will seek to work in close coordination with the UN rapporteur for extrajudicial killings, Professor Alston.
I am very glad that Parliament has signalled its support.
We must continue to encourage the authorities to make sure that the investigations are adequately carried out and that the perpetrators are brought to justice in a timely manner.
The Commission considers that progress is being made in the Mindanao peace process.
A formal peace agreement may not be too far away.
At present, we are giving substantial indirect support through assistance for rural development and health and improvement of livelihoods.
We have signalled that we are willing to give important direct assistance when the parties are closer to signature of a formal peace agreement.
As regards the other insurgency involving the NPA, we should continue to encourage the Filipino authorities to re-open peace talks and allow those who are willing to abandon the gun for politics to do so, while ensuring that the new security legislation is implemented in full respect for human rights.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken shortly.
Madam President, before we proceed to the votes I would like very briefly to raise a point of order.
On behalf of my group, I recognise and welcome the fact that for the first time in the urgency debates we have enjoyed the involvement and contribution of the Council.
(Applause)
I hope that this positive precedent will continue.
It is extremely welcome and I know that the German delegation in particular has worked hard to ensure that it would happen.
I thank the Council for being here, and I hope it will continue.
Thank you, and thanks too to Mr Nooke.

Explanations of vote
On behalf of my group, Mr Pafilis spoke on the subject of Zimbabwe this afternoon.
I am aware that what he and his Greek party mainly want is to highlight the long-term conflict between the former British colonial empire and the former movement for independence, led by Mugabe, the country's current President.
This is underlined as a conflict between absolute evil and absolute good.
Like my colleague Mr Pafilis, I am in favour of the Mugabe of the 70s and against colonialism, but he and I have very different opinions about the present, as I have made clear in previous urgency debates.
I am in favour of land reform, in other words for the land of large farmers to be carved up in favour of small farmers.
The way in which this is being done in Zimbabwe, however, has led to violence, intimidation and people fearing for their own lives, not least black farmers and workers on the land.
Subsequently, towns, too, were on the receiving end of this sort of violence.
Mugabe is no longer serving his people against colonial exploiters, but is plunging them into chaos, oppression and poverty.
Since a regime such as this one is founded on violence and intimidation, and does not deserve to carry on, I will be voting in favour of the resolution on Zimbabwe.

(DE) Mr President, it was actually planned that today's sitting should include a debate on the roaming report, since this House, in the trilogue on 2 May, presented the Council with a package of compromises, and I might add that it did so with the agreement of all groups here and of all the countries represented in the trilogue.
It is unfortunate that the Council has not, to date, indicated its agreement to it, and it is for that reason that we are unable to have the debate today or to vote on the report tomorrow.
A UachtarÃ¡in, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhÃ©anamh le Rialtas na hÃireann, le Rialtas na Breataine, agus leis an Rialtas nua i mBÃ©al Feirste.
Mr President, yesterday saw the installation of a new government and the re-establishment of the devolved assembly in Northern Ireland, representing what would have previously been called the extreme opinion of unionism and the extreme opinion of nationalism, brought together to form a new government for Northern Ireland.
As we have heard from the Nobel laureates, this is a great opportunity for us not only to congratulate those people who have been involved and to encourage them in finding a new way forward in solving conflict and resolving the difficulties that occur between different communities, but also to congratulate the European Union for its ongoing commitment and help to the people of Northern Ireland over the last 20 years.
The reasons such greatness took place yesterday was that the people there were standing on the shoulders of giants - not just the shoulders of John Hume and Lord Trimble, who are here today, but also the shoulders of Jacques Delors, who first came up with the plan and the idea of a peace programme for Northern Ireland, and of Helmut Kohl and others.
We should reflect on this today in making sure that we continue our commitment.
As chairman of the UEN Group and a representative of a government party, I extend my thanks to all my colleagues here and to all my colleagues from Ireland who worked together towards this common cause and common goal.
We should also reflect on and remember the loss of life, the harm, the impairment and injury to so many, but, rather than allow those losses to continue to fester and to poison our dialogue, let us understand: that was one of one time, this is of another.
Our task and our role now is to ensure that our grandchildren have better prospects for the future in Northern Ireland.
Let us also remember the words of the old poet who said: 'Even though my bones may break and even though my body may bleed, within my heart still beats the hope of mankind to find and fulfil all its needs'.
(Applause)
Thank you for that statement, Mr Crowley.
I would like to inform you that I have sent a letter to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to congratulate them.
We look forward to a good future for Northern Ireland, Ireland, Great Britain and the European Union.

Agenda
With the agreement of all the groups, a corrigendum to the order of business adopted for today and tomorrow at the sitting on Monday 23 April has been circulated, and I have received a number of motions for its amendment, which are as follows.
Wednesday:
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has moved that the report by Mr Brok on the 2005 annual report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy be deferred to the May part-session in Strasbourg.
Our colleague, Mr Brok, has undergone an operation.
He thought that he would be here this week, but that will not be the case.
Nevertheless, I can assure you that he is in good health - as we know, he takes care of his health - and he will be with us for the part-session in Strasbourg.
That is why I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to postpone the debate on this report.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has moved that the report by Mrs Lulling on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages be deferred to the May part-session in Strasbourg.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, let me, on behalf of our group, wish Mr Brok all the best and a good recovery.
Moving on to the Lulling report, I spoke with Mrs Lulling today.
There are a number of problems - let me be frank about it, particularly in Bulgaria - in connection with the changes that the Lulling report would bring in its wake, and, since we would like to have more talks with Mrs Lulling and also with representatives of the other groups on whether we might not find some consensus on this thorny issue, we move that the debate be deferred to the next part-session in Strasbourg.
This is not a matter of party politics, as all political groupings in Bulgaria are affected by this.
We would be ill-advised to send out a negative signal now if there is a chance of us after all finding a solution through consensus one or two weeks down the line.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, there is no objective reason why we should not debate my report today in order to put it to the vote tomorrow.
This report was adopted within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs after several months of discussion, since the Commission proposal was referred to us on 28 September 2006, as is written down.
We debated the proposal at least five times within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Everyone was able to voice his or her opinion.
The amendments were tabled within the timescales set.
They have been translated.
Things being what they are, I obviously understand why the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is proposing this postponement: the Socialists are in favour of increasing the minimum rates of excise duty, while in Bulgaria, they are against doing so.
The Socialists are therefore afraid of adopting a position before the European elections.
That is why this request for postponement is a blatant lie: in reality, it is based on a political, not objective, reason.
I therefore call on my fellow Members to vote against.
(SV) Mr President, we should not show the contempt for democracy entailed in postponing the debate on this report until after the Bulgarian election.
It is a hugely important democratic principle that the people, in this case the Bulgarians, should have as much information as possible when they go to the polls.
The whole purpose of the proposed postponement is the opposite of that, namely that we should debate this issue only after the Bulgarians have voted.
I am resolutely opposed to this move, and all good democrats should oppose it for the same reason.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(The agenda was thus determined.)

Statement by the President (Estonia)
I have been asked to make a brief statement on Estonia, and have been informed that the Group chairmen wish to do likewise once I have finished.
That does indeed seem to be so.
The Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 gave Europe the foundation on which it would be possible to build partnership in peace and freedom between nations that had formerly been at enmity with one another and, when our continent, formerly divided, had grown together, the European Union became the guarantor of peace, freedom and prosperity throughout Europe.
We take pride in being able, today, to celebrate Schuman Day together with 27 Member States of the European Union, but 9 May is, for other reasons, a controversial date, as we have seen most recently in the dispute concerning the Soviet soldiers' memorial in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and it is for that reason that we call to mind our resolution of 12 May 2005, in which this House remarked upon the fact that there were some nations for whom the end of the Second World War meant the dawn of another tyranny, that of the Soviet Union.
We remind ourselves that controversies on matters of history must never be an occasion for violence, and we firmly condemn affray and looting.
The current President of the Republic of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who was formerly a Member of this House, said the right thing in response to the events outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow, and this was what he had to say about them: 'In Europe, it is not customary to demand the resignation of the democratically elected government of a neighbouring country; in Europe, it is unthinkable that the Convention of Vienna on the protection of diplomatic missions be disregarded'.
We call to mind our resolution of 8 June 2005 on the protection of minorities and against discrimination against them, in which we declared, inter alia, that national minorities enrich Europe.
The European Union is founded upon values, the protection of which is our common task.
Putting a Member State of the European Union under pressure constitutes a challenge to all of us, and Estonia can count on our solidarity.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to thank you for your support and solidarity.
I should also like to express my gratitude to all colleagues for their extraordinary demonstration of support and solidarity with Estonia, because what is happening between an EU Member State, Estonia, and the Russian Federation is not a bilateral case but a case for the EU as a whole - it is a test case of whether the EU is a real political Union rooted in solidarity and unity.
Today, the clarity, timing and unity of the EU reaction are being tested.
What we expect is a strong EU commitment to unconditional solidarity.
First of all, we need to be free of wishful thinking.
The way the Russian Federation is treating an EU Member State is clearly not an aberration.
President Putin presented a programme of a new, much more assertive Russian foreign policy in his Munich speech.
This approach could be termed neo-imperialist or revanchist.
The aim is to regain, at least partially, its past influence over its former Baltic colonies, and then over the former Warsaw Pact part of Europe, relying on the current energy boom that has boosted Russian influence, as well as misusing parts of the Russian population living outside Russia.
I would like to make it very clear that President Putin calls these Russians his compatriots. I would like to dispute that strongly.
Russians living in Estonia are my compatriots, and I am proud of them because 99 % of them remained loyal not to President Putin but to the Estonian state.
(Applause)
Therefore, the question is not only about solidarity; the key word is the 'sovereignty' of the new Member States of the European family.
We can succeed in achieving it only when we speak with one voice and demonstrate unity in action.
When a Member State that decides to be clearer about its own past, and does so in an open and dignified way, suddenly becomes an object of concentrated pressure from its huge neighbour; when its embassy in Moscow is practically held hostage for a whole week; when riots to destabilise law and order are organised with clear inspiration and assistance from a foreign state; when there are calls by Russian officials for a democratically elected government to step down; when an economic blockade is being implemented; when websites of the Estonian state institutions are still being blocked by massive cyber attacks - an innovative form of propaganda war; then one has to be really worried about the sovereignty of the state in question.
In conclusion, there is still another form of sovereignty we must defend: our right to decide on and assess our past.
You quoted the resolution of the European Parliament two years ago concerning the many European countries that fell victim to the renewed tyranny inflicted by Stalin's Soviet Union.
There is still a dividing line in Europe, between all the western democracies, which have never recognised the illegal annexation and occupation of the Baltic States to the Soviet Union in 1940 as a result of the Hitler-Stalin pact, and the Russian Federation, which still denies this pact and also tries to deny the right of its former victims to assess their past.
Therefore, we need your solidarity, and I am very thankful to all of you for demonstrating it.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Kelam.
As a citizen and an honourable personality from Estonia, I gave you twice as much speaking time as you had been allocated, but this should not be an example for others.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I hope I am honourable, even though I am not from Estonia.
I asked the leader of our Estonian delegation, Mr Tarand, to speak.
Since he will be speaking later on, he asked me to make it clear that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament as a whole is giving its full backing to Estonia, to our Members from Estonia and to the people of Estonia, and that we reject all outside intervention and every intervention on the part of Russia.
We affirm not only the principle that embassies and diplomatic premises should be treated with respect, but also that the sovereignty of a country and its people should be respected.
If I may add a personal remark, I was born a few months after the end of the war in what was then the Soviet-occupied zone in Eastern Austria.
I remember my parents, relatives and friends relating how they were glad that Russian soldiers had come to free us from the Nazi regime, and also know from personal experience that these same people feared the possibility of the Soviet troops staying on as occupiers.
It was our good fortune in Austria - a good fortune bestowed on us by history - that our country was liberated.
Many others, such as the people only 20 kilometres to the east of my home, experienced occupation rather than liberation.
That is why we believe that Russia should at last come to acknowledge that, while many Russian soldiers came as liberators, they did bring with them a regime under which the same liberators remained as an occupying power and that many peoples - not only in the Soviet Union but also in many neighbouring countries - suffered oppression.
If this were to come to be accepted, it would make dialogue so much easier.
I hope that all citizens on either side of the former border with the Eastern bloc accept that this dual truth was once the case.
Our group was very sad to lose Mr Ilves as a member, but we are, today, very glad that such a level-headed man as he is President of Estonia.
Here are two short quotations from him.
He drew attention to the website of a young Russian woman, who had written on it, 'We are Russians, but our homeland is Estonia', to which he added, 'Thank you, Maria'.
The last sentence in his speech, which really is most remarkable, goes like this:
'It is customary in Europe that differences that occur now and then between states are solved by diplomats and politicians, not on the streets or by computer attacks.
Those are the ways of other countries, or, I would add, other times, somewhere else, not in Europe.'
(DE) What we in Europe need is dialogue and conversation rather than attacks on embassies or demonstrations in front of them, because it is this dialogue itself that is of the essence of Europe.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to reply, in the hope that, since I am speaking on behalf of my group, I shall not be given significantly less time than the previous speaker.
Today we are discussing relations between Estonia and Russia and, in talking about these, we must definitely discuss the events that took place at the end of April in Estonia.
Nor can we ignore the cause of these events - the Bronze Soldier.
This statue was erected by the Soviet authorities in honour of the liberators of Tallinn.
The liberation of Tallinn actually consisted of the bombing of Tallinn on 9 March 1944, when 40% of Tallinn's residential areas was destroyed and hundreds of people died.
This was referred to as liberation, but Estonians were deported to Siberia, with one wave of deportations following another and no family left untouched by the repression.
My father was deported to Siberia in 1941 and only returned home 21 years later.
After Stalin's death my great-grandmother, who had also been deported to Siberia, set out alone and on foot for her home country of Estonia.
When my family came home from work one day, they found her sitting on the steps of our house, but unfortunately my great-grandmother was already dead.
I can still remember that time.
As a monument erected to a liberator, the Bronze Soldier was a symbol of very painful experiences for many Estonians.
Nevertheless, it stood in the central square of our capital city for another 15 years, that is to say for the 15 years after Estonia regained its independence.
What was it that happened on 26 April?
What happened that night?
The monument crisis actually began about a year ago, when a gathering of extremists waving Soviet flags transformed this monument from one that honoured the dead into a symbol of the victory of the Soviet occupation, and as such it became a continual source of tension.
Up to that time, veterans had gathered there every year, and despite the fact that alcohol was sometimes consumed on the grave and that those present even at times danced on the grave, the police never intervened.
On the night of 26 April, however, riots broke out in the downtown area, and these later spread to some border cities where, however, they were less severe.
The rioters destroyed everything that stood in their path including cars and bus pavilions, but mainly windows.
Bands of youths broke into shops and stole everything.
Off-licences, in particular, were targeted, but also some other shops.
For example, Armani and Hugo Boss shops, as well as jewellery stores, were looted.
Since we live in a media age, all of this was recorded and also broadcast live on television.
Today there is a great deal of video material documenting the events.
The police only intervened when the gangs of youths became too aggressive.
Truncheons and water cannons were used; firearms were not.
That night, the Bronze Soldier was transported from TÃµnismÃ€e to the military graveyard, where it was yesterday made accessible to the public again.
After that, the attacks from Russia began - the propaganda offensives mentioned by the previous speakers, culminating in the Russian Duma's demand for a change of government in Estonia.
I will stop now.
Please accept my apologies, Mr President.
(The speech was interrupted)
Finally, I would like to thank all who have supported, and who continue to support, Estonia.
This is a great honour for us and a great help to us.
Thank you, Mr President, and please accept my apologies.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in firstly giving our solidarity and support to the Estonian Government and to the Estonian people, and secondly, in denouncing the bully-boy tactics of the Russian Government in its attempt to create uncertainty and instability, not only within Estonia but in all the Baltic States.
In many ways what we are witnessing is a new form of totalitarianism or authoritarianism by the use of mobs in Moscow to attack an Embassy, by the use the power or strength of energy to try and make people kneel before the influence of the Russian Government, and, most importantly of all, by a continuing desire to keep imposing symbols of domination and of subjugation in areas that have gained their independence from totalitarian regimes.
Our task and role today is to listen to our Estonian colleagues and to hear their cries and their pleas for assistance and solidarity.
Most importantly of all, however, because we value Russia as a partner for future developments, we should call on Russia to take the proper steps to ensure that the rights of all European Union Member States are respected equally - whether large or small, whether a neighbouring country or not, whether a former dominion or not.
Finally, our most ardent call should go out to the citizens of Estonia, to show them that now that they are part of the European Union, they will not be abandoned as they were abandoned previously.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have had this sort of argument about European history many times before; the last time we did so, it was in a debate on what to make of the Sudeten problem in the Czech Republic, when we said - and I repeat - that what was needed was a European interpretation of the war and that the national interpretations of it had to be put to one side.
In this instance, the European interpretation is a simple matter; it is that the Red Army played its part in freeing Europe from National Socialist Fascism.
That is what it did, and this playing of its part demanded great sacrifices.
Let us leave to one side the argument about what responsibility Stalin bore for Hitler's rise to power, for that is another debate.
After that, though, the Red Army became an army of occupation, an army that made freedom impossible.
That, too, is part of European history.
Removing hideous bronze statues, far from presenting a problem for the cultural landscape of a city, tends to help make the place more beautiful, but, in this debate, we have to make it abundantly clear - and I hope that we will hear this said in the debate on Russia - that the fact of the matter is that what the Russian leadership - Putin - is trying to do here, with all its and his might, is to foment division.
We must all affirm our solidarity with the governments of Latvia and Estonia.
At the same time, though, whatever our solidarity, we have to acknowledge that the Baltic states do have a problem with the rights of the Russian minority.
What history teaches us all is that social conflict arises when a minority - and that is what 30% of the population amounts to - wants to belong but feels deprived of their rights.
I know that all majorities always deny that: the Turks have always told us that there is no Kurdish problem in Turkey, yet a Kurdish problem is just what there is in Turkey, and there is a problem with the Russian minority and their rights.
This is not to say that the Russian minority is good, but that, as a minority, they have to have rights, and that it is difficult to build consensus in society if those rights are not recognised.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite true that 62 years ago today, the representatives of Nazi Germany signed the instrument of unconditional surrender, thus bringing to an end one of the darkest chapters in European history.
The peoples of what was then the Soviet Union played a decisive part in bringing this victory about, and they also had to pay an enormous price; all these things we ought to properly appreciate and, of course, reflect upon them, and it is for that reason that I thoroughly endorse what has been said about the events in Tallinn by the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, in these words, which I found very moving:

'Whilst the Centre unequivocally condemns crimes committed against Estonians of all faiths and nationalities under Soviet rule, it must never be forgotten that it was the Red Army which effectively stopped the mass murder conducted by the Nazis and their local collaborators on Estonian soil until the final day of its occupation by Nazi Germany.
Thus the removal of the monument from the centre of Tallinn by the government reflects a regrettable lack of sensitivity to the depth of Nazi criminality and is an insult to its victims.'
(DE) My group finds it extremely regrettable that disagreements in Tallinn on matters of domestic and foreign policy should have reached this crisis point, and we urge all the parties involved to exercise moderation and enter into dialogue.
That a peaceful demonstration in the Estonian capital should degenerate into a riot and that the police should act in such a way that one person is killed and many others injured is very disturbing, and that it should happen at all testifies to the lack of dialogue between the Estonian majority and the Russian minority.
What I want to highlight, then, is that we in this House also share in responsibility for this, for having expressed too little opposition to the discrimination against the Russian minority in the Baltic states.
The disproportionate responses from Russia are no less disturbing.
My group strongly endorses the demand made of Russia that it discharge its international obligations in accordance with the relevant conventions and protect not only the premises but also the staff of the Estonian embassy and allow unhindered access to it.
We also call on the German Presidency of the Council to help de-escalate the situation and bring Estonia and Russia together in dialogue.
With the EU/Russia summit in the offing, this is a time for building bridges rather than barriers.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, the first and most important thing to state is that Estonia is an independent nation, not a Russian satellite state.
This means that we cannot begin to talk in muted tones about the need to understand Russia and its history.
Rather, we must understand that Russia is mounting a blockade against Estonia and demanding that another country's government resign etc.
Emphatically, these are not matters for which we should be showing understanding.
The Russian Government, the Russian-speaking minority in Estonia and everyone else do, of course, have the right to criticise activities such as the removal of a bronze statue.
However, Estonia is not a Russian satellite state within Russia's sphere of interest, but a free and independent nation.
The instances offered by Mr Cohn-Bendit when he begins to talk in this House about quite different issues, notably the situation of the minority populations in the three Baltic republics, are unhelpful.
Obviously, that is another, albeit worthwhile, discussion.
What, however, we are talking about now is Russia's being entitled - or, rather, not being entitled at all - to do what it has in fact done.
The fact - in itself extraordinary - of the Red Army's having defeated Hitler is irrelevant.
That victory is something that we can celebrate.
Subsequently, the Red Army settled down to the long-term bullying of Estonia.
In 1939, Finland lay north of the Gulf of Finland and Estonia south of it.
The two countries had approximately the same standard of living and were in many respects quite similar.
When the Russian occupation came to an end, Finland was one of the world's richest and most successful countries, while Estonia - which is now very successfully working its way up - was in the doldrums.
These costs must not be forgotten.
We are not now required to understand Russia.
What we have to remember now is that it is the independent nation of Estonia that we are talking about, not a Russian satellite state.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, history has yet to be written with the sole aim of getting close to the truth.
Until now, it has been written in an ideological way.
Consequently, it constantly omits this essential fact, namely that the wicked alliance between Molotov and Ribbentrop, between Stalin and Hitler, that is, between communism and national socialism, resulted in the violent invasion of Estonia, where the presence of the Red Army took the form of arrests, deportations, arbitrary executions and decades of denial of all civil rights.
Today, everyone is in favour of the Baltic countries having their freedom, but when, in October 1987, in the French parliament, Mr Le Pen and the members of the group that he was chairing wanted to exclude the Baltic countries - the annexation of which we felt was illegal because it was achieved by violent means - from the scope of the treaties concluded with Russia, all the other political parties were against.
In reality, ladies and gentlemen, the Estonians and the Russians were victims of communism.
Admittedly, given the enormous sacrifices subsequently made by the Russian army, the humiliation felt by the Russian minority and, above all, by the former soldiers, is understandable.
The great French poet, Baudelaire, once said: the dead, the poor dead, have great sorrows.
Let us leave Estonia free to find its own methods of being able to honour those whose sacrifice ultimately has no other legitimate meaning than that of having defended their respective nations - the independence, sovereignty and identity of each of those nations.
The debate is closed.
EU strategy for reform in the Arab world (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Rocard on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on EU strategy for reform in the Arab world.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to commend the willpower of the Minister and of the Commissioner: I know what it is like to attend debates without being able to leave the room, and I hope they will not be too bored.
I come now, with this debate, to a topic that is rather a new one for us.
The title of the report is not appropriate.
It is not so much about the European Union's relationship with reforms in the Arab world as about a relational process of the European Union with the Arab world for the purpose of facilitating reforms.
For the sake of speed, I shall set out my comments as a number of points.
The first point, as you all know, is that all is not well in the various Arab states.
We all receive vast amounts of information and hear complaints about failure to observe human rights, about often dictatorial governments, about huge, scandalous financial inequalities in the various countries and about the lack of economic take-off, even in places where there is oil.
There is indeed a malaise in the Arab world.
A Lebanese Arabic writer even spoke about an Arab malaise.
Behind this malaise, there is a long history of humiliation: colonialism, independence, lack of control of resources, of oil in particular, intellectual decline and, as a result, a corresponding rise in religious fundamentalism.
My second point is that it is in this context that belonging to the Arab world is perceived in most of these countries as an awareness of identity, a search for collective empowerment.
That developed in the second half of the 20th century and particularly towards the end.
Now, it is the League of Arab States which, internationally, is taking a stand on behalf of the different States and is being respected.
It is the League's resolutions that have brought about some progress in what is called the Middle East peace process, which is still not a peace process but from which it is hoped some results will emerge through the Arab League Summit.
There is also, thanks to the media, something of a growth in Arab public opinion that is much more homogeneous than the diplomatic positions of the various States.
It is also at the pan-Arab level that many intellectuals, especially Egyptians, but also Lebanese, even Algerians, pitch their message, rather than within their national context.
Finally, it has to be said that the Arab League has never had to deal with religious problems.
They are referred to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, which is a different world.
Arab identity is a secular concept, which can make our relationship easier.
My third point is: how do we, the European Union, deal with this Arab identity?
By ignoring it.
We have a strong, dense relationship with Iraq, and talk about it a great deal.
We deal with the Israel-Palestine conflict, making very little reference to the preceding one.
We speak about Algeria.
We have strong bilateral relationships with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt, too.
In short, we have relationships with all these countries that are of the public, state, bilateral kind, but we ignore the fact of their Arab identity.
The question that this own-initiative report puts to the Commission and to the Council is this: is there not good reason to move away from that and to do a bit more, in the light of the observations I was making in my second point?
There is now an intellectual life, a political life and a diplomatic life in the Arab world at the level of its community.
Is it not in the European Union's interest to establish relations at this level also?
The numerous standstills that we find in the Arab world, which are of course economic, financial, political, institutional and religious, are also to a large extent intellectual and cultural.
It is through intellectual and cultural relations that other relations will develop, and the purpose of this report is to suggest that we take note of that.
Firstly by recognising that Arab identity is compatible with democracy and with modernity, even if the facts do not demonstrate it.
There is, intellectually and politically, and in the speeches of the League, a real possibility.
It is, moreover, the Arab League which, by slightly forcing the hand of many of its Member States, has produced an Arab Charter on Human Rights.
We all know that it is not a great advance, that it is well behind our own European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
Nonetheless, it is real progress compared with the situation we had a short time ago.
And then, in the face of the great contemporary problem of the fight against terrorism, I think that we all wish to reach a relationship of complicity and alliance with the Arab nations against extremists and killers, rather than to condemn them all and to make this fight impossible.
It is in this context that the report suggests that we, the European Union, should strengthen our relations with everything that has a collective character in this matter: of course, the League of Arab States, but also, why not, the Gulf Cooperation Council and even the Arab Maghreb Union, if it were to be revived.
Through these bodies, it is possible to develop a network of cultural and intellectual relations and to organise discussion seminars, which will bolster our support for the reforms.
This report, Mr President, is somewhat subtle.
We are extending the hand of friendship to countries about which there is seemingly much to criticise.
Our amendments debate will be between the extremism of the condemnations and the moderation of the hand of friendship which, while indeed recognising that there are strong criticisms to be made, would prefer to keep quiet about them as long as this hand of friendship can contribute to a process of reform that we all need.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Rocard, ladies and gentlemen, the present debate on the position of the Arab world in international politics is timely.
As we see it, one of the issues here is how to further improve cooperation between the West and the Arab states, so that both sides can benefit from it.
I should like to extend the warmest of thanks to Mr Rocard, with whose report the European Parliament, too, underlines the importance of EU-Arab cooperation.
Greater dynamism has been apparent in the Arab League's regional involvement for some years now - the Beirut Peace Initiative of March 2002 being just one example.
Recent weeks, in particular, have seen a massive interest on the part of the Arab world in reaching out beyond the borders of the region for closer coordination and cooperation - including on its own initiative.
On the one hand, this development strikes me as resulting from a return, to a certain extent, by the Arab world to the Arab League as an instrument of cooperation that has been neglected over time.
On the other hand, I see it as representing a response to the quest on the part of non-Arab states and organisations for a reliable regional partner in an unstable region.
The ongoing involvement of the Arab League in Lebanon, which started immediately after last summer's war, is very important; and so we encourage the Arab League to continue its present endeavours.
Nevertheless, I believe that the clearest illustration of the new quality of international involvement by the Arab League, under the powerful leadership of Saudi Arabia, was the confirmation of the Arab Peace Initiative at the Riyadh Summit in late March.
This Initiative shows the prospects of a return to normal for relations between Israel and the Arab States.
The continued debate within the Arab League substantiates the view that the Arab world has the will to make genuine progress.
The EU, too, has increased its involvement in the Middle East in recent years and months; the Quartet remaining its key actor.
Recently, both sides - the Arab world and Europe - have stepped up discussions on their ideas for intensifying political cooperation.
In this regard, I should just like to mention the meeting of the EU Troika with an Arab League delegation in Sharm el-Sheikh, and also to point out that Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in his capacity as President of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, has invited a ministerial delegation of the Arab League to a meeting with all the EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Brussels on 14 May.
This alone does not reduce the internal political, social and cultural challenges facing the Arab world, of course; but I should like to emphasise clearly that Europe offers Arab countries and societies cooperation in all fields.
It is my hope that this cooperation can contribute to greater understanding and tolerance between Europe and the Arab world.
These two values: understanding and tolerance - characteristics that the Council President Angela Merkel described as constituting Europe's soul in Strasbourg at the start of the German Presidency - are the vital ingredients for successful dialogue.
For this reason, I welcome Mr Rocard's inclusion of cultural aspects, too, in his report.
These play a major role in determining the EU's scope for supporting reform processes in the Arab world.
Ignorance, stereotypes and hostility on both sides hinder a productive partnership with prospects.
Dialogue and understanding of the culture of its relevant opposite number are a precondition for the EU's taking the right approach to promoting reform processes.
Last year, in the context of the 'caricature conflict', there was much talk of the need for more 'dialogue between cultures'.
We must use this term with caution, however, as the idea of a dialogue between cultures could accidentally promote cultural relativism.
The idea that standards and values are in principle attributable to an individual's culture runs counter to our understanding of universal human rights.
I fully agree with the report in this respect, emphasising as it does the importance of intercultural dialogue whilst coming out clearly in favour of the universality of human rights.
We must avoid falling into the 'culturism trap' in all respects, not only with regard to human rights.
Human beings have diverse identities.
We are not only Muslim or Christian or atheist, but also member of a profession, student, father, member of an association and much more.
The problem with Islamic fundamentalism, as with any other kind of fundamentalism, is that one element of personal identity - the religious - is placed above all others, and the complexity of the world is ultimately reduced to the idea of an opposition between 'Islam' and 'the West'.
Our policies must avoid everything that promotes this reduction.
We must emphasise what unites us rather than what divides us.
We must select joint EU-Arab forums, particularly the Anna Lindh Foundation, for our discussions and projects.
Political Islamism is an expression of the modernisation crisis of Arab societies, as Mr Rocard's report also points out.
Tackling this is primarily a task for Arab societies themselves. There, too, there are secular and liberal forces.
What is often missing, however, is dialogue within these societies on the issue of how the relationship between state, religion and society should be shaped in political terms.
Dialogue within society will make clear that the religious neutrality of the state and the enforcement of human rights are not a reform agenda being forced on the Arab world by 'the West', but rather are in the interests of Arab societies themselves.
We can support this process of dialogue within society by providing forums for dialogue.
This is an important task, for example, of the various political foundations found in countries such as Germany.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the report by the honourable Member Mr Rocard, which basically discusses what relevance developments in the Arab world have to us and what we can do to exert our influence over these developments.
At a time when we are rediscovering our common cultural and historic heritage, the European Parliament's willingness to resume a key role in the promotion of closer relations with our Arab neighbours is important.
The European Parliament resolution on reforms in the Arab world underlines very clearly that we peoples and countries surrounding the Mediterranean are dependent on each other.
We are mutually dependent in political terms as partners endeavouring to pacify the Middle East and working to promote pluralism and democracy; dependent in cultural terms with regard to the promotion of the urgently needed in-depth dialogue between cultures and religions; dependent in environmental terms because, with a shared Mediterranean coast over 46 000 kilometres long, problems such as climate change, marine pollution and the challenges of improving the environment are the same for all; dependent in terms of energy policy because of the supplies of oil and natural gas originating from or channelled via the Mediterranean area; and dependent particularly in demographic terms, as dialogue with North African countries is needed on the solution to issues surrounding both legal and illegal migration.

As a response to our dependence on each other, we launched the Barcelona process together, which is now complemented by the European Neighbourhood Policy.
In addition, the Cooperation Agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council, the agreement with Yemen and the Cotonou Agreement with sub-Saharan Arab states have further developed relations.
Progress has been made recently thanks to the Barcelona process and to the neighbourhood policy.
To give two examples, association agreements have been concluded with nearly every country in the region and Neighbourhood Action Plans launched.
A Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area is gradually taking shape, which is intended to function as an interface between an increasingly globalised world and the open, integrated regionalism practised by Europe.
The year 2007 could certainly signalise our relations with a region undergoing radical change; a region with great expectations of a far-reaching partnership with the EU.
Our work with our partners is based on the conviction that changes only last if they come from within a society, and the gradual introduction of political and economic reforms within the framework of neighbourhood policy smoothes the way for a further rapprochement between Europe and Mediterranean countries.
At the heart of our relations with our Arab partners is our desire to promote security, growth and stability in the region.
In addition, we firmly believe that these relations have a far broader purpose, namely the joint creation of an area of cooperation and stability, and the advocacy of our common objectives and values.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the relations between Europe and the Arab world are the key to building peace in the Mediterranean area and in the Middle East.
We must all become involved in the dialogue between cultures and religions over the next few years, in the firm belief that friendly relations are based on sincerity, loyalty and an attempt to understand others, without, however, renouncing one's own identity.
In confirming the crucial importance of providing the European Union with a strategy for reform in the Arab world, the Rocard report defines some inalienable principles that will have to characterise future relations.
The European Parliament's task will be to encourage any decisions that will enhance democracy, respect for human rights and the role of women, the creation of a free trade area, freedom of information, financial aid and respect for religious freedom.
The Rocard report - and I can announce that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote for it - defines a fundamental principle, which is that of reciprocity: just as everyone in Europe has the right to practise his or her religion, people should have the same right in every Arab country.
On this aspect the Rocard report calls precisely on Arabs living in the European Union to give their accounts.
On this, as on other issues, however, we are still a long way from achieving the objectives that the European Union has set itself.
By upholding these principles and helping the Arab countries in their reforms, yet respecting their autonomy, we will help to prevent fundamentalism from gathering further support.
The threat of fanaticism does not concern, in fact, only Europe, but the entire Arab world.
Terrorism is the child of fundamentalism, which is why it is vital for Europe and the Arab States to work together to beat this scourge of the 20th century.
Recent attacks demonstrate that al-Qa'ida's priority right now is to strike out at the moderate Arab States, which are trying to establish a dialogue and are facilitating the reforms.
Europe cannot remain silent; it cannot stand by.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my colleague and friend Mr Rocard will forgive me if I start by addressing a very important topic, one on which Mrs De Keyser has been working very intensively in recent months and years: that of the Palestinian territories.
I do not believe that we can make progress without a change in EU policy on the Palestinian issue or with regard to many of Mr Rocard's justified demands.
Today, my group decided unanimously to call on the Commission and the Council to make fundamental changes to their policy on the Palestinian territories.
EU policy - championed by the Council and the Commission - is untenable, cynical and unacceptable to the Arab population.
Some governments may consider it acceptable, but the population of the Arab countries cannot approve of our current policy towards the Palestinian Government.
We called for free elections; and free, fair elections took place - to which Mrs De Keyser is the chief witness - but then we said we could not accept the result.
This is most undemocratic.
We then said that the Palestinians should at least form a unity government; and a unity government has been formed.
We also told them to make a clear commitment to the peace process and the 1967 borders.
The present Palestinian Government has declared its commitment to those borders.
Israel has not, but we do not seem to consider this a problem.
Many of our officials still refuse to receive the Palestinian Foreign Minister, for example, as the Council President did recently.
It is unacceptable for the Council President, Angela Merkel, to say that she will receive the Israeli Foreign Minister but that it is beneath her to welcome the Palestinian Foreign Minister, who has nothing to do with Hamas.
Therefore, in view of the specific situation in the Palestinian territories, we demand a drastic change in the position of the Council and the Commission.
Perhaps individual members of the Council and the Commission disagree with it, but as institutions their policy is wrong and cynical.
Do the ladies and gentlemen know the situation in the Palestinian territories?
Do they know that our policy is resulting in the territories descending into chaos, that Mafia groups are taking power there?
Do they know that a continuation of this policy is the best way of contributing to Israel's insecurity?
We must arrive at a different position, therefore - particularly in connection with this report, but also in connection with Israel's security, which is closely linked to the security of the Arab countries and of Europe.
We should do so by attempting genuine cooperation with the Palestinian Government - a government chosen by the elections demanded by us - if that government is at least as prepared as Israel to support the peace process.
I wanted to say this at the start of the debate on what is a very good report, but risks being unrealisable unless we change our policy on the Palestinian territories and towards the Palestinian Government.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Rocard, whose report, as he himself has said, is intended to offer support for the purposes of opening a dialogue and a debate.
However, I believe that, in making such a statement, we must first make it clear - since this is something that concerns us and our policies within the European Union - that this is a dialogue and a debate that we intend to open not with the States, but with the people, with individuals.
This is all the more true when we talk about a primarily cultural - and therefore also political and institutional - effort, since in this case the talks must take place first with individuals, rather than with the Arab League or with individual States, not least because I believe that two of the major problems in the Arab world - nationalism and fundamentalism - now concern our European cities, too, which, from a demographic point of view, are also increasingly becoming cities of the Arab world.
That is why these problems must be addressed by our European Union itself.
This state of affairs also affects our institutional systems and the way in which religion is perceived within the European Union.
There is no doubt that Islamic fundamentalism exists.
We have taken the liberty, in this regard, of tabling two amendments on the issue of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation and of the clear distinction between political authorities and religious authorities.
I do not believe that this is provocation.
I only have time to point out, for example, that, when, together with other fellow Members, we went to Jerusalem for Gay Pride, we observed that, during the sometimes violent demonstrations aimed at preventing the demonstration from taking place, Orthodox Jewish fundamentalists, Islamic fundamentalists and Catholic fundamentalists were united.
This is therefore an issue that concerns us, too, and that is the meaning behind the amendments, which I hope will be adopted.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the good intentions expressed in this report pave the way for what I fear may be some wrong moves.
For example, the concessions and, indeed, the looking ahead to the prospect of pan-Arabism, may lead to what the previous speaker rightly pointed out as a danger: Arab nationalism.
I, for my part, would not look on it so approvingly and so calmly.
I am not thrilled with the fact that, behind this offer of dialogue, we can glimpse the plans of what an influential Arab intellectual fearfully described as the 'Eurabia project', an expression that was later adopted very effectively by the Italian writer, Oriana Fallaci.
Above all, however, what concerns me in the report is the way in which the doubts about the Arab Charter on Human Rights are expressed, where it is stated that some of the provisions contained in the Charter are worded in such as way as to allow different interpretations to be made.
Yet, there is little to interpret differently in the text!
The Islamic Charter on human rights is very clear: it states that human rights for Muslims are subject to the Sharia. This is stated in the preamble and in all of the subsequent articles, and stated extremely clearly.
For the Arab States that have signed this Charter - the 1948 Charter on Human Rights, to which we are referring - it is valid only insofar as it conforms to the dictates of Allah.
Instead, unlike what is stated in the report, it needs to be made clear not only to the people but also to the Arab regimes with which we are holding talks - even though it is not clear how enthusiastic they are about tackling and supporting the Barcelona process, which is spoken about in very optimistic terms, given that they then do not take part in the meetings - that religious precepts are one thing, that laws are another thing and that the principle of freedom of conscience is another thing still.
The Charter on Human Rights is based, in fact, on the philosophical principle of the separation of laws from spiritual and religious precepts.
This is a concept that must be reaffirmed very clearly, otherwise Europe will continue to pretend that it cannot see very serious dangers, including, for example, the television programmes broadcast by Hamas, in which Mickey Mouse teaches Arab children about the fight against terrorism, the fight against Israel and the sacrifice made by suicide bombers.
That is what the peoples of the Arab world see.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I, too, must beg forgiveness of Mr Rocard by focusing on one issue - Palestine.
I also believe that, until the EU changes its current position and recognises the National Unity Government in Palestine, we are precisely undermining the opportunities for good relations with the Arab world, we are exacerbating poverty and suffering in the Occupied Territories, we are in danger of destroying the Palestinian Authority itself and we are certainly already destroying the hopes of the Palestinian people.
We are also being entirely inconsistent and hypocritical, because the Palestinians I have met have rightly challenged me: Does the EU not say that democracy is better than violence?
Well, yes, we do.
Did the EU election observers not pronounce the Palestinian elections free and fair?
Well, yes, they did.
In spite of that, when asked to do so, did the legitimately elected Hamas Government not transform itself into a genuine government of national unity?
Yes, it did.
Has that government not agreed to the three demands of the quartet to renounce violence, to respect previous agreements and to recognise the State of Israel?
Yes, it has.
They ask me and I, in turn, ask the Council here tonight, what else is the EU waiting for?
I have just come back from a parliamentary delegation visit to Palestine where we met Prime Minister Haniyeh and many of his ministers, and the message from all of them was the same: they have met the demands of the Quartet, they accept a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders and they are ready and eager for peace negotiations.
They cannot understand why the EU does not respond and why we insist, for example, on channelling aid via the Temporary International Mechanism, which, while it helps some of the poorest, is unable to prevent the growing humanitarian and political crisis: it undermines the apparatus and the authority of the Palestinian State and, crucially, it strips the EU of the leverage we could - and should - have with the Israeli authorities to pressure them into releasing the Palestinian tax revenues which they are still illegally withholding.
We met Mustafa Barghouti, the Minister of Information, and he left us in doubt when he said, 'If the EU wants the Palestinian Authority to collapse, then it should say so'.
Let us be very clear: that is where our policies are leading.
I am sure that neither we nor the Council wants the Palestinian Authority to collapse, and so I ask the Council once again: what else is it waiting for?
Mr President, if I were a Palestinian citizen looking enthusiastically towards the European Union to get me out of the impasse I was in, I would agree with Mr Swoboda and with Mrs Caroline Lucas and I would be very concerned about certain aspects of the Rocard report.
The first problem with the report is that it upgrades the strategy of the European Council and the European Commission in the Middle East, which calls on all of us to only talk to half the members of the government of Palestine and ignore the fact that this government is the product of democratic elections, that it is a government of national unity and is supported by 96% of the Palestinian people.
We have all seen the outcome of this catastrophic policy.
There is a legitimate government on Palestinian soil which the European Council and the European Commission has quarantined, thereby destroying every opportunity which this government is giving us to engage in legitimate talks.
If the Union misses this crucial crossroads, the road forward will be very difficult.
In another paragraph, the report notes that any deepening of Euro-Arab relations depends on the energy and talent which Europe brings to bear in reconciling its historic duties and responsibilities towards the State of Israel and the Jewish people; but where are its historic duties and responsibilities towards the Palestinians going?
We have to stop burying our heads in the sand.
There is a legal, elected government on Palestinian soil which we must not isolate and with which the European Union must engage immediately in direct dialogue.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, the Rocard report contains many positive points.
In these times of political correctness, to talk about an Arab evil openly, for example, shows a certain degree of courage.
The report is right to single out a number of painful areas.
There is a need for more democracy, more free market economy, respect for human rights, and equal treatment for women, while non-Muslims must be able to practise their religion freely.
The concept of reciprocity is very much applicable here, and it is useful to make a special mention of this in the report.
The European Union can, and indeed must, play a part in promoting these principles within the Arab world.
Whether this will bear fruit is a different matter, but we should at least try.
The report stipulates - and I quote - that the westernisation of the Arab societies is not the only way of bringing about the necessary reforms.
I can go along with that, but I should like to stress that the Arabisation or Islamisation of Europe should not be an option either.
One consequence of the riots resulting from the Danish cartoons is that we have had to conclude that a number of essential freedoms, such as the right to the free expression of opinion, have also come under pressure in Europe.
The European Union's reaction to this was rather - not to say very - feeble.
I should therefore like to say in all tranquillity and serenity that our freedoms and the right to remain ourselves in Europe and in all European Member States should remain intact.
(ES) Mr President, it is not an easy task to produce a report on reforms in the Arab world, since that covers a fairly heterogeneous group of countries.
There is, however, agreement on the need for reforms in the Arab countries, a notion that is taken up in the very title of the report.
The Arab leaders also acknowledged this at the Tunis Summit in 2004.
Furthermore, the recent Riyadh Summit insisted on modernisation too, though I notice that its text places less emphasis on the idea of reforms.
The Arab countries are facing a series of challenges which they need to tackle by means of substantial improvements in the political, economic and social fields.
That means reforms leading to democratisation and greater respect for human rights, which are not the exclusive property of the West, but are universal.
In many cases, democratisation will involve the challenge of incorporating moderate Islamic options into political life, options that are opposed to the use of violence.
Economic and social reforms are also needed.
From an economic point of view, there is excessive State presence, scant participation in international trade and little diversification of economies.
Generally speaking, in the majority of these countries there is a low level of economic development and low rates of growth, which are incapable of generating employment for a rapidly growing population.
High unemployment and lack of prospects cause social discontent, which feeds radical political forces.
The stability and prosperity of the Arab countries is very important for the European Union.
We need to have good relations with them that benefit us mutually; we must consider the importance of their oil and gas to the European Union, which imports much of its energy resources from outside.
Furthermore, several Member States have Arab countries as neighbours, and many Arab citizens live in our cities.
In addition, over recent years, an extremely serious Jihadist threat has emerged, which is attacking our countries and also the Muslim States themselves.
In short, there are many fields in which we must cooperate.
We must also encourage them and help them to implement political, economic and social reforms.
Maintaining the status quo - as the report itself points out - is not a guarantee of stability in the long run, quite the opposite.
(FR) Mr President, some people have said, on reading this report, that it is strange.
It is strange because it does not mention, or scarcely mentions, regional and international policy in this part of the world, the conflicts ravaging the Middle East, terrorism, radical Islamism or illegal immigration.
Nor does it mention the colonial past of certain great powers or the persistent influence they wish to continue to exert.
What, then, is the point of this well-meaning report, which, by the way, is a real antidote to the cartoons of Mohammed?
First of all, it is not a well-meaning report, but a bold statement and a tremendous message of confidence in the democratic potential of the Arab world, in the diversity of its non-governmental actors, in the strength of its civil society and in its culture.
Furthermore, it states clearly the role that Europe must play: to support and promote local endogenous democratic processes and to remind them of the importance of human rights, but without ever imposing itself as a hegemonic power.
This message may seem commonplace.
It is, however, vital for a real alliance of civilisations since it finally makes the Arab world a partner in peace, a partner in development and in culture.
Many reports emanating from this European Parliament describe the threats coming to us from the East.
Mr Rocard has chosen to point out the reasons for hope, and I thank him for it.
It is, however, a subject on which Mr Rocard has been incomplete.
The report rightly mentions Europe's responsibility towards Israel and its security.
We accept this responsibility and we will continue to accept it, but it is inseparable from our responsibility with regard to Palestine, which is today going through an unprecedented crisis.
We shall never be able to sacrifice one to the other.
The Balfour Declaration, in 1917, already stated that 'the establishment of a home for Jewish people in Palestine would not prejudice the rights of non-Jewish communities in Palestine'.
Where have we got to a century after this declaration?
That is why I support and strongly take up the demand not only of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, but also of all those who have spoken this evening and said to us: the sanctions against Palestine must be lifted, we have to negotiate with its national unity government, which accepts the Arab peace initiative, which is also a tremendous guarantee for the security of Israel with regard to the Arab world.
This is a leap forward; this is a rising hope.
And it is rising for all those who, on both sides of the 1967 frontier, still believe in international justice and want to encourage hope.
Therefore, in the name of these values, in the name of those just men on both sides of the frontier, what are we, in Europe, going to do?
Wait?
I say to you, ladies and gentlemen, and I say to the Council and to the Commission: let us wait no longer!
Tomorrow it will be too late, and the crushing responsibility for that will be ours.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not speak about Palestine because I fully share the opinion of Mr Swoboda, Mr Triantaphyllides, Mrs Lucas and Mrs De Keyser; I will therefore spare you my comments about Palestine on this occasion.
Instead, I should like to thank Mr Rocard for having drafted a report containing many important elements - 'hope', as Mrs De Keyser was saying.
These elements include the statement that many Arab intellectuals have carried out a lucid analysis of the ills of the Arab world.
I believe that what the Rocard report is lacking, however, is a lucid analysis of the ills of European society, with regard not only to the need for reforms in the democratic Arab world but also to our policies.
In the amendments tabled by Mr Rocard himself, there are a few corrections that I fully support, even though I believe that we cannot talk about reforms in the Arab world without taking into consideration the tragedies caused not by European policies but, for example, by the war in Iraq and by the absence of a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
I therefore believe that we must begin also with a criticism of how devastating and obstructive our policies in Iraq have been, for example in terms of hindering a reform process that is crucial not only in the Arab world but also to us, when it comes to changing our policy.
(MT) Thank you, Mr President.
The subject of reform in the Arab world is an extremely complex one.
One need only read Mr Rockar's report in order to understand this complexity.
The rapporteur in fact asks whether there is in fact an Arab community as such and points out that there is a reason why we talk of the Arab world but not of the Arab nation or the Arab union.
This clearly means that, before we begin discussing the Arab world and offering solutions, we must understand it better.
That is why it is essential not to be patronising when we talk of reforms in the Arab world and not to dictate solutions as though we were better informed than everyone else.
There is no doubt that reforms are needed so as to enable the Arab countries to benefit more from the process of modernisation and globalisation.
Our task is to offer the experience we have had in our Union and to lend our support in a spirit of partnership between two equal parties.
We must not create a context in which we tell others what to do.
The Barcelona Process was meant to be one of partnership but, as we all know, we ended up in a situation in which the European Union dictated what should happen, and when and how.
We also need to make better use of our interlocutors in the Arab world, such as the Arab League which, despite its own problems, has gained enough credibility to give a voice to the Arab world.
Malta took the initiative of proposing a structured dialogue between the European Union and the Arab League; a dialogue aimed at tackling the subject of the reforms that must be carried out on both sides of the Mediterranean.
This is a good initiative, and one that has gone down well with the Arab League, and I hope that both the Council of Ministers and the Commissioner can support it.
Thank you.
(CS) I should like to congratulate Mr Rocard on his outstanding report which, in my view, is much-needed, both for the Arab world and for Europe.
I believe the need for this report can be seen from the way that in recent years, not only in the USA but also in Europe, there has been a certain blinkered tendency to view the Arab and Islamic world simply in terms of the fight against terrorism.
Whilst European-Arab relations must take account of the fight against terrorism, they must also take account of issues such as economic and social development, employment, the proper management of public affairs, the strengthening of civil society, the concept of human rights, and intercultural and inter-faith exchange and dialogue.
European-Arab relations should be based on genuine dialogue on a level playing field without feelings of superiority or inferiority being generated.
Dialogue and partnership with the EU could in my view be targeted more at cooperation with the Arab world as a whole.
In other words, in addition to bilateral relations, we should also focus on specific organisations, some of which have already been mentioned, such as the League of Arab States, the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab Maghreb Union.
Lastly, because we are here in the European Parliament, I should also like to emphasise the role played by the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EMPA) as a democratic body bringing together members of parliament from both sides of the Mediterranean.
The EMPA should in my opinion play a much greater role, including attempting to resolve the Arab-Israel conflict.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Rocard for this report, which conveys much objectivity on the European Union's exclusively bilateral relations with the Arab world.
It calls, however, in particular for a new dialogue, which must include the problems of development and of good governance.
It is to this subject that I should like to return.
In its development policy, the European Union has broken up the Arab world into two parts: the Mediterranean zone and the Caucasus, called the neighbourhood zone, and the Middle East subject to the development policy.
This artificial distinction does not allow a more balanced comprehensive approach, which would make fundamental reforms possible.
As far as the matter of governance is concerned, Mr Rocard emphasises the partnership approach and the role of civil society.
This is an innovative view that must take into account - and this is why I am speaking of it - the role of the local authorities.
In fact, a very dense network of cooperation from town to town has developed in the Arab world, with the organisation of Arab towns which, moreover, belong to a wider organisation, the world organisation of towns, which includes Palestinian towns and Israeli towns that work together.
There are cooperation projects for peace, for cultural and religious exchanges, for human rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination.
These transnational actions are the expression of a link between Europe and the Arab world on an infra-state scale, that of emerging civil societies.
They also offer a wider framework for analysis than that of the fight against terrorism imposed following 11 September.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate my esteemed colleague, Michel Rocard, on his report.
As it underlines, the only valid response in our desire for reform in the Arab world is one which is inclusive and based on common values - something which is too often lost in talk of the war on terror.
As several Socialist colleagues have said, we need to make real progress in finding a peaceful and long-term solution to the problems of conflict, not least between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.
But let me highlight the absolute need to limit the impact of any direct or indirect support by the EU or our Member States for authoritarianism in the region.
There needs to be a re-evaluation of the relationship between European security services and their counterparts, making sure that these agencies continue to cooperate in addressing common threats, including terrorism, but that any action is unambiguously consistent with international human rights law, including the provisions on torture.
There need to be tighter controls governing arms or military transfers to the region to ensure these are not used in internal repression or external aggression.
In all of the EU's external assistance programmes there needs to be further re-evaluation of the provision of assistance to countries in the region in order to promote development and economic justice and to support the reformers themselves in the reform process.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Mr Verheugen, in only two minutes, I shall not be able to reply to everybody.
I should like first to stress the importance that has led four of our speakers not to deal with the subject directly but to remind us that, before this topic, the unresolved tragedy of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the non-recognition of the new Palestinian Government and the different obstacles that we put in the way, hinder good relations between Europe and the Arab world.
They are right.
That was not my point.
I wish to support this point of view very forcefully.
I have often supported it on other occasions.
I would draw your attention to the fact that therein lies the key.
I should also like to commend the great understanding of the report's approach, which has been as evident in Mr Gloser's speech as in that of the Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, and I do not think that his successor will say otherwise: there exists a convergence of thinking between a parliamentary approach, which I represent here, and the perception of the Council of Ministers, as well as that of the Commission.
For me, that is absolutely essential.
To our colleagues on the different benches, I shall simply say that the contribution made by Mr Busuttil's, who supports the idea of partnership, seems important to me.
I would say that Mr Cappato is right to emphasise that we wish, through all these efforts, to engage with civil societies, to engage, ultimately, with individuals, of course, but we cannot engage with individuals alone, we have to do so through institutions, the media, etc., and that is indeed the approach of this report.
Mr Tajani focused on reciprocity.
I too am concerned about reciprocity.
I should like to point out that the intelligence of our approach will depend on our ability to adjust reciprocity according to the inequalitiy of the levels of economic and cultural development.
The point is to support a process that must bring Arab countries closer to the values of our democracies, without pretending and without accusing them of not sharing these values from the beginning of the process.
That is what brings me, as Mr Cappato well knows, to defer certain amendments, not because I disagree with some of the criticisms, but rather because I disagree that it is opportune to bring them up now, at a time when we are engaging in a process of holding out a hand to help people who are way behind us when it comes to respect for human rights.
A support process does not presuppose that the problem has been resolved in advance.
We will not increase our demands.
I would even be tempted, in this spirit, to encourage voting against an amendment tabled by my own group.
We have discussed it fully.
My group is inflexible on some intangible principles for which I have been fighting for 50 years.
In this matter we must progress more moderately.
I propose that we use subtlety in our diplomatic relations.
In politics, subtlety is rare, but I am suggesting it all the same.
(Laughter)
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to discuss a few points.
What alternative is there but dialogue with our neighbours?
In recent years, the EU has laid down a wide palette of measures - not unilaterally, but in cooperation with many Arab countries.
The key ones have already been mentioned: the Barcelona process, for example, and also the further development of neighbourhood policy that is currently taking place.
Nevertheless, we note different developments in individual countries.
Who would have thought, for example, that the King of Morocco would have launched a truth commission seeking to reappraise what crimes were committed in the past?
Of course, this committee of inquiry does not come close to meeting the criteria the EU Member States lay down for such committees.
Who would have thought, also, that certain distant countries would extend the right to vote?
A great deal has happened, but it is apparent that, on certain points, we could have achieved more.
The people in Arab countries would also have hoped for a greater share in economic development than has been the case.
There is no alternative to dialogue, however.
Mr Rocard spoke of the need for us to develop a strategy: this can only work in cooperation with Arab countries.
It is possible that the strategy towards a certain country will differ from that towards a Gulf State.
It is also important, however, to note that the Arab League has regained strength.
The League often looks to the EU, the association of European states, but it has no such uniting function; instead its members often have a very national outlook and prefer to regulate their own matters.
Nevertheless, there has now been a realisation that, when it comes to conflict resolution, in particular, an association is better, and accordingly is a better means of asserting a country's own interests.
I should also like to discuss the various comments that have been made in the debate with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
I am of course aware that the unresolved conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories often interferes with many of the talks, the forums for dialogue.
However, I should also like to say quite deliberately that many problems in Arab countries could also have been solved without a prior resolution of this conflict.
However - including in view of comments by Mr Swoboda and others - we should bear in mind the chronicle of developments in this whole debate.
We have never said that the elections in the Palestinian territories were unfair.
On the contrary, we noted that they were conducted more fairly than those in many other countries.
Another important aspect, however, is that the newly elected government failed to declare its intention to comply with the commitments entered into by the previous government - at least not initially, Mr Swoboda; only gradually - and now only as a result of the initiative of Saudi Arabia.
Many Arab states have succeeded in forming a national unity government.
I would say quite clearly - because this is occasionally obscured, and so that you do not reproach me at the end of the process - that, at the time of the blockade, the EU provided considerable financial support to the Palestinians: a fact that the Commissioner responsible for external relations, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, has always made clear.
The sums paid out were often greater than in the period before the 'blockade'.
We must now concern ourselves, together with the Arab League and, of course, the two actors Israel and Palestine, with making progress in reviving the peace process - an achievement to which the EU and the Quartet contributed - and with meeting the demands we have heard today.
Mr President, I simply wish to thank Parliament and, of course, its rapporteur, Mr Rocard, for the work done on a subject that is important for all of us.
I will give an account to Mr Verheugen, who has presented the Commission's position, of the quality of the debates in which I have been able to take part in his stead.
I think, in fact, that Parliament prides itself on developing thinking about important issues.
I pay tribute, of course, to the German Presidency and hope that this report will make it possible to work out this peace strategy that we all need so much.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I think that Mr Rocard's report is fairly commendable: it emphasises the fact that the Union's role is to encourage and engage with the attempts at reform in the Arab countries.
This role requires active inter-cultural dialogue.
We have to give our attention to what the dialogue should be based on.
The report says 'inter-cultural dialogue can only be revived through the affirmation of a common and universal basis of human values which transcends dogmas and Community allegiances'.
This should not be understood as a purely secularist basis, which might indeed increase cultural tensions.
A liberalised society exhibits a mix of two ways of thinking: ethical pluralism and cultural relativism, which could be called secularist relativism.
Whereas relativism is based on the assumption that there is no religious truth, the pluralistic approach is just that we can reach consensus on this through reasonable means.
Relativism therefore means that value and belief systems have not been left out of political decisions entirely.
Pluralism, on the other hand, aims for dialogue on values and means that different value and belief systems need to be understood when decisions are being taken, for the simple reason that they are an important part of people's lives.
It has to be realised that dialogue along these lines makes not just understanding and interaction, but also criticism, possible.
Relativism in fact leads to an increase in tension because it evades the difficult issues and passes over them.
Pluralism can help ease tension as it is fundamentally to do with taking account of human values and their differences.
Religion is not necessarily what causes tension, which is to say a problem.
It can also be part of the solution.
in writing. I will be supporting this report on EU strategy towards the Arab world.
While there is fault on both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict, I welcome the fact that the EU has a much more balanced position with regard to this conflict than the Bush Administration in the US.
What we can potentially do has been recently demonstrated in the not entirely different context of the Aceh conflict in Indonesia - the world's fourth largest country and largest Muslim state.
Here EU efforts brokered a peace settlement and a peace process that ended a 30-year-long civil war at the cost of less than a few hours' spending in Iraq.
This example should serve as a paradigm for the EU's future actions within our emerging Common Foreign and Security Policy.
One-minute speeches (Rule 144)
The next item is one-minute speeches.
Mr President, the mounting crisis in relations between Estonia and Russia affects us all.
What we have is a clear case of undue pressure by a large country against a small one.
This is the kind of behaviour from which the European Union protects small states.
Russia has persistently accused Estonia of nurturing something that it calls 'fascism', without producing a shred of evidence.
The campaign brings the very idea of anti-fascism into disrepute, above all because Russia itself is behaving like a fascist state.
The campaign dishonours the memory of those who really did fight fascism and especially those who gave their lives in that struggle, millions of Russians included.
Anti-fascism means democracy and equality of respect for all.
Russia, by contradicting this, is reviving fascism and thereby turning into a threat to Europe as a whole.
Madam President, I would like to raise a serious matter of EU funding being misused, in my view, for the destruction of archaeological heritage in Ireland.
I appeal to Commissioner Dimas to intervene directly with Minister Roche in Ireland to ensure that these subsidies, which are being provided to build the N3 motorway in County Meath, are not facilitating the destruction of a recently discovered Neolithic site - a 'woodhenge'.
This is an extremely important site, quite close to the historic Tara Hill.
The Director of the National Museum in Ireland has called for a complete archaeological excavation, but, given that Minister Roche has been deaf to all expert advice so far, there is a real risk that this unique Neolithic site will be lost.
In view of the European investment in this motorway project, it is essential that the Commission step in to ensure that a significant part of not only Irish heritage, but by definition also part of European heritage, is properly excavated, and that if necessary the N3 motorway be reconfigured to achieve that objective.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are about to witness a dishonourable - I repeat: dishonourable - episode in the European Union, the responsibility for which rests primarily with the Council and with the inertia of the Commission, which are in breach of compulsory mandates that we have given them.
In December 1994 we were defeated by a mere eight votes when the universal moratorium on the death penalty was about to be established.
Since then, for 13 years, the overwhelming majority of the UN has been ready to vote for this great principle of civilisation.
Since then the European Union has prevented them from voting.
Parliament has said during this part-session that the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) that will take place on Monday 14 May is probably preparing, once again, to betray the mandate entrusted to it and to postpone for yet another year this certain victory.
Madam President, I would ask you to urge the President of Parliament to deal promptly with the issue.
(PL) Madam President, Poland's fruit growers have suffered yet another setback.
Poor protection of the internal market against excessive imports and dumping has been compounded by frost which has destroyed some 90% of this year's harvest.
The losses, estimated at some 1.5 billion EUR, are beyond the means of the Polish Government and insurance companies.
Low returns on fruit farming, particularly soft fruits, and especially since Poland's accession to the EU, has meant a reluctance to insure harvests, both by insurance companies and by the farmers themselves, who simply cannot afford it.
This situation requires immediate assistance from the European Union, both emergency aid and long-term aid for the coming years.
If not, Poland's farmers will be condemned to bankruptcy, and the EU to importing its fruit from third countries.
Madam President, the European Commission has wisely dropped plans to enforce complete metrication in the UK.
It realises that nothing would be more likely to ferment rebellion against the European Union amongst the general population than for them to lose the pound, the pint and the mile.
This is a victory for Britain, but it is only a skirmish that has been won.
The European Union has made a tactical withdrawal in order to fight more strategic battles later.
The struggle for British independence is still being waged and the final victory, when Britain leaves the European Union, is still some way off.
The next big confrontation will be over the revised European Constitution.
At this point I would like to add my voice to those calling for a posthumous royal pardon to be granted to the metric martyr, Steve Thoburn, who was convicted in the year 2000 for the heinous criminal offence of selling bananas in pounds and ounces.
(DE) Madam President, I should like to inform the public and those responsible of an outrageous case of obstructing the work of an independent Member of the European Parliament.
In Austria, the top candidate of the Liberal Forum at the last student elections, Martin Ehrenhauser, received a letter on 20 April 2007 stating: 'We are offering you a job as a contract agent from 15 May 2007 working for the political group of Non-attached Members in the European Parliament.'
Mr Ehrenhauser travelled here.
Suddenly the letter is no longer valid.
The reason: a political instruction from the very top, from the new Secretary General, Harald RÃžmer.
This is unacceptable.
It was a bolt from the blue and in this case it affects me.
You will be aware that every Member has the right to work with at least one member of parliamentary staff in his group in his mother tongue.
I am the only one who is denied this privilege, because there is a desire to make the work of an unpleasant critic more difficult.
At the same time, it is precisely the large groups here that allocate themselves legions of staff who are loyal to their party.
Altogether Parliament employs thousands of staff.
I call on the Bureau and those responsible to investigate this case.
This kind of thing is detrimental to Parliament and it is also detrimental to our understanding of democracy.
(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in these post-modern times, marriage is becoming less and less popular, especially among young people, yet it remains the foundation of the family.
It is thus in the interest of the Member States and of the EU as a whole to support marriage.
Following our accession to the EU, I frequently hear complaints about the long-term complications people face when they marry citizens of other Member States.
It is hard for EU citizens to understand that there is no agreement between EU Member States on the mutual recognition of official documents.
Men and women wanting to get married have to spend time and effort going around numerous offices to complete bureaucratic formalities in order to make the wedding possible.
For me too as an MEP it is hard to understand why the offices of one Member State refuse to recognise marriage certificates or confirmations of citizenship as stated in normal documents.
Young people find the process of obtaining current documents and having them super-legalised especially arduous.
I am under no illusions about our ability to harmonise codes.
Nevertheless our citizens certainly deserve some simple measures aimed at simplifying those laws.
(LT) Russia is behaving disgracefully in Estonia and is not even trying to hide its behaviour.
The Russians have commenced an economic blockade against a European Union Member State.
In the past, Russia has behaved more subtly in Latvia or Lithuania, or in other countries, which is perhaps why the European Union has been nonchalant about most of Russia's actions.
After the events in Estonia I urge you to reconsider the European Union's relations with Russia.
Strategic partnership should be replaced by principled, honourable and pragmatic cooperation.
In my opinion, it is essential to postpone the 18 May meeting in Samara.
We need to lay out the European Union's opinion to Russia on what conditions are essential for such meetings to be able to take place again in the future.
Javier Solana must go to Moscow and clearly state the European Union's position.
Europe has enough arguments.
My fear is that some European Union leaders will want to have yet another photo opportunity with the antidemocratic Putin, rather than defend the European Union's democratic values.
Madam President, I start by saying to you - and I hope you will convey this to the President - how much I enjoyed the initiative he took in inviting Nobel Prize winners here this afternoon and particularly hearing from distinguished scientists speaking to us in this Chamber.
We have many issues to deal with, colleagues, involving science and technology and we do not have enough dialogue with the science and technology community.
Through this speech tonight, I would like to draw to the attention of all my colleagues the fact that the Parliament's own Science and Technology Assessment Unit, of which I am privileged to be Vice-President, with my colleague Mr Busquin as President, is holding a major event in the June Strasbourg week, called the STOA Experience.
There will be exhibitions of recent work and many distinguished scientists will meet and talk to Members about the projects we have under way.
I hope many colleagues will take a real opportunity to step up dialogue between ourselves in this Parliament and the leaders in the science and technology community within the European Union.
Thank you for drawing that to our attention, Mr Harbour.
Madam President, I would like to emphasise a point which is not universally known in the European Union.
This is the fact that - with the exception of Denmark - cars are most expensive in my country, the smallest country in the EU.
This is mainly due to the fact that there is an extraordinary tax called registration tax, which is sometimes higher than the value of the car itself.
This means that, in a country where wages are on a par at most with middle-income Europe, the price of vehicles, whether new or second hand, is exorbitant.
This creates undue stress for middle- and lower-income families when it comes to changing their cars.
It also affects the whole idea of world climate change.
Although Malta is small, car owners find it terribly difficult to change their cars to more efficient energy-saving cars and those which produce less exhaust.
Madam President, as an Irish Member I am delighted to have one minute to add my voice to the many voices who celebrate and applaud what happened yesterday in Belfast.
Indeed it is fitting that earlier today we congratulated Betty Williams, Mairead Corrigan, David Trimble and John Hume, all Nobel Prize winners, for their contribution to peace-building and peacemaking in Northern Ireland.
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan worked within their communities and that is where real peace building is achieved, between people, between families, between neighbours and between communities.
But we also need political leadership to drive the process forward and today we honoured two of those politicians, David Trimble and John Hume.
There were many other politicians at different levels who took risks for peace and they too deserve our applause.
As we celebrate 50 years of the EU, it is most appropriate to recognise that the EU has also played an important role in the peace process in Northern Ireland, giving us moral and economic support.
For that support I believe I can say on my own behalf and on behalf of Irish people, thank you to the EU for believing in us and supporting us on the road to peace.
. - (HU) Over the past six years, factories on Austrian territory have been continuously polluting the waters of the RÃ¡ba River.
The RÃ¡ba crosses the Hungarian border already filled with polluted, foamy water.
The Hungarian Minister of Environmental Protection, who stepped down yesterday, gave the Austrian factories until 1 May to stop the pollution, but no progress has so far been made.
On 1 April, together with my colleague I personally delivered to the Austrian authorities the petition of the Hungarian delegation of the People's Party, calling upon the provincial and federal government to take the necessary steps.
To date we have received no answer to our petition.
The Austro-Hungarian Water Commission, which years ago granted the factories an operating licence, is currently holding its annual meeting.
This commission is made up of delegates by the governments of the two States, and the revocation of water rights licences likewise falls within their competence.
We must do everything possible to stop this harmful, cross-border environmental pollution; therefore I call upon the Austro-Hungarian Water Commission, and thus indirectly on the governments of the two Member States in question - in which I request the assistance of Parliament - to revoke, effective immediately, the water rights licences of those factories which are polluting the river.
Madam President, as we celebrate 50 years of European values and fundamental principles, democracy in a candidate Member State is struggling to survive.
The elected Government of Turkey is openly threatened by the country's biggest enemy, its army generals.
The Turkish army, instead of protecting democracy, is set on a course to destroy it.
Irrespective of our personal stance on Turkey's accession to the EU, it is to our benefit and to the benefit of the Turkish people that Turkey continues its reform process.
It is our duty to support the political powers of Turkey, represented today by Mr Erdogan's Government, in their fight against the anachronistic armed forces, represented by Chief of Staff General Buyukanit.
I call upon the President of this House to make a statement as soon as possible to express our strong support for the Government of Turkey and our dismay at the interference of the army in the politics of the country.
The European Parliament's message to the Turkish army generals should be loud and clear: 'Keep to your barracks and stop your war on democracy'.
(SK) I have been following the situation concerning political prisoners in Cuba for quite some time.
It was with pleasure that I received the news that several opposition groups had recently come up with a joint declaration in which they committed themselves to a united approach in the struggle for a peaceful transition to democracy on the island.
The signatories of the declaration include such well-known dissidents such as Oswaldo PayÃ¡ from the Christian Democratic Movement for Liberation, Elizardo Sanchez from the Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission, and Martha Beatriz Roque and RenÃ© GÃ³mez Manzano from the Assembly for the Promotion of Civil Society.
The document was also signed by the members of the organisation set up by the wives of political prisoners, known as the Ladies in White.
A unified peaceful opposition is essential to pursuing the changes that are needed by the people.
One must not overlook the fact that, despite some political and philosophical differences, these groups share the same goals, including respect for human rights, reconciliation, the release of political prisoners, non-violence and cooperation.
(SK) The purpose of my presentation is to warn European consumers who wear Chinese textile products.
Regrettably, many of those products are coloured using azocolourants that do not meet the standards set in Directive 2002/61/EC on azocolourants.
When people wear such textile products, the azocolourants penetrate the body like silent killers and cause cancer.
Just as recently as May 2006 the laboratories of an authorised entity operating in the town of Svit, Slovakia, tested a sample of 90 textile products for children randomly collected on the Slovak market, most of them imported from China, and found that every fifteenth product was hazardous.
One can reasonably assume that large batches of essentially identical textile goods are to be found on the markets of other EU Member States.
As these are extremely dangerous products, I urge the Commission to take effective measures to shorten as much as possible the time between sample collection and the publishing of an alert in the RAPEX system.
The 3.5 months or more that it now takes is long enough for the hazardous product to be sold out and disappear from the market.
I find these facts disconcerting, and I strongly believe that we must not remain inactive.
(PL) Madam President, there is a saying that you can tell who your real friends are in a crisis.
At the moment, Poland's soft fruit farmers are facing such a crisis because of the frosts that have hit Poland in recent weeks.
Soon these farms and their families will sink into poverty.
Poland's farmers are hoping for some support from the EU, and that someone will reach out with a helping hand.
This is what should in fact happen, as that is what solidarity means, that is what being together and helping one another in difficulty means.
Lech WaÅÄsa, who is present in this House today, could tell you much more about this.
Help from the European Union will create a good climate and increase our citizens' regard for the EU.
Here in this House, in the EU institutions, we need to develop instruments at EU level to help those countries, regions and industries that have been afflicted by natural disasters.
That concludes the item.
Nominal quantities for pre-packed products (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on nominal quantities for pre-packed products, repealing Council Directives 75/106/EEC and 80/232/EEC, and amending Council Directive 76/211/EEC (13484/1/2006 - C6-0039/2007 - (Rapporteur: Jacques Toubon).
rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection recommends that you adopt the Council common position, modified by some amendments: an amendment comprising a safeguard clause at the end of the transitional periods, a provision encouraging the extension of unit pricing, a system for guaranteeing that British bread can continue to be marketed in its current sizes and, finally, a declaration by the Commission that can explain and guarantee exactly the phasing out of stocks of bottles that are off-specification.
However, the heart of this directive is, on the one hand, freedom in sizing and, on the other, mandatory sizes, for five years, for milk, pasta, butter and coffee and, for six years, for white sugar.
That is what is proposed to you.
How have we reached this point?
At first reading, on the basis of its own study, the European Parliament retained mandatory sizes for a number of products, in permanent derogation in relation to the general liberalisation of sizes that was proposed by the Commission.
The latter, in a position of principle, set out a revised proposal that was totally opposed to Parliament's text.
It was then that I was able to resume talks with the Commission and the Finnish Presidency of the Council.
The latter succeeded in achieving the adoption of a common position that took up some of the derogations requested by the European Parliament, but only for a limited period, a transitional period.
I proposed accepting the main points of this position, provided that it was accompanied by two additional guarantees.
Firstly, that the Commission can propose continuing to keep certain mandatory sizes for certain mass-marketed products if consumers experienced disruption at the end of the transitional period and, secondly, that the Member States should be encouraged to extend unit pricing to local shops.
That is what the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection decided on on the basis of my proposal and it is also what we agreed with the Council and the Commission at the end of two trialogues held over recent weeks.
Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, I shall draw three lessons from this legislative procedure.
Firstly, on this occasion, we have, for the first time, carried out an impact assessment.
We commissioned this assessment from an independent body, and it was the first time that Parliament had used this procedure, which has, I believe, a great future.
Secondly, what we are doing means that better lawmaking does not necessarily consist in doing away with all legislation because - and this is the third lesson I have drawn - through this debate, we have strictly taken into account the needs of consumers, and, in particular, the most vulnerable consumers.
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I propose that our Parliament vote tomorrow for the three amendments that have been adopted by the Commission on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
Vice-President of the Commission. (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Toubon for his constructive work on this very difficult legislative proposal and agree with everything that he has just said, particularly when it comes to the lessons to be learnt, that is what we can learn from this dossier.
I should like to make one additional point: I hope very much that the Council will see fit to follow Parliament's example and in future, when it is making amendments to legislative proposals, that it will also carry out an impact assessment.
This would certainly help us greatly in our ongoing work of creating better regulation.
This is actually just one part of a major project being implemented by the Commission and all of the other institutions: better regulation.
We began with the clear political goal of improving and simplifying the European Union's existing body of legislation.
Mr Toubon is quite right: improving it does not mean abolishing it.
Improving it means making it simpler, more transparent and more manageable.
Obviously, however, the levels of protection that we have in place should remain intact.
In principle, all of the institutions and certainly also consumers and business agree with this.
Despite this agreement of principle, however, there are always specific reservations once a proposal is actually drafted and tabled.
Then it becomes clear that a political compromise is needed and I am pleased that in this case we have produced a good solution together.
What is this really about?
We are dealing here with regulations from the 70s and 80s.
At that time mandatory sizes were laid down for a large number of prepacked products.
These included such varied goods as toothpaste, detergent, fish fingers, tomato puree, solvents and even dry and wet dog and cat food.
At the time of their adoption around 30 years' ago, this was the best way of achieving two aims: firstly, to open up the internal market for goods even more, as provided for in the Treaties of Rome, and secondly to ensure the necessary level of consumer protection in the cross-border trade of these goods.
Since then, however, we have significantly developed the internal market and consumer protection within the European Union.
Now it is a question of following suit by simplifying and harmonising the regulations on packaging sizes.
Here, less European regulation means more innovation and greater competitiveness.
I am convinced that this proposal will have a positive impact, in particular for consumers.
Consumers will gain greater freedom of choice.
Furthermore, thanks to the existing directive on unit pricing (pricing per kilogram or litre), they will also continue to be able to compare the prices of different packaging sizes easily in the future.
I am grateful to the rapporteur for his commitment.
I also think that we have agreed on transitional rules.
As Parliament has requested, the Commission will review the situation in a few years' time.
There is therefore nothing to prevent an agreement at this second reading.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, with slightly more time at my disposal I would like to congratulate you on becoming a Vice-President.
As a valued colleague of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, it is a pleasure to speak with you chairing the sitting here tonight.
I would also like to thank Jacques Toubon, who I think has led an outstanding review of this process, as the Commissioner has indicated.
I also echo what the Commissioner said about the way that we approached this.
I think we were one of the first committees in Parliament to commission an impact assessment on our proposed amendments.
Some of the issues raised by that have now been reflected in the amendments which we shall support tomorrow, particularly concerning what I might call the safeguard clauses that the Commission will be observing in order to closely observe the behaviour of the market.
Overall we are very much in support of your aims, Commissioner, in wanting to push forward to remove unnecessary legislation, much of which dates back 20 or 30 years, as you indicated.
Now that consumers are better informed, we want them to take advantage of that and to have information about pricing.
We want to give manufacturers the flexibility to produce products in different sizes that would suit different family sizes.
I am bound to say that in my own country - and I suspect in others - it is such a surprise for them to find the Commission producing a deregulatory measure.
As you will see from some colourful newspaper stories in my stories in my own country, this directive has been freely misinterpreted as in many cases preventing British consumers from having access to their preferred sizes for products.
I think that you as a Commission need to work on the fact that misrepresentation is so easy, because at the moment this is such an unusual proposal.
In that context I am very grateful to you and to the Council for giving consumers of pre-packed bread in the United Kingdom - that is over 80% of regular eaters of bread every day - assurances that their traditional sizes of loaf, which they perceived to be under threat from this proposal, are guaranteed and that they will still be able to enjoy and consume every morning with their marmalade toast made in their traditional sizes of pre-packed bread.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the piece of legislation that we are debating today is very important, because the reason why this directive was created in the past was of course to open up the market for goods.
Opening up the market and producing nominal quantities have now been replaced by consumer protection.
How we deal with this proposal is therefore extremely important and that is why the European Parliament has stated clearly that simply doing away with all of the regulations in this sector could lead to difficulties, particularly for people with disabilities, especially the partially sighted.
If we look round large supermarkets, for example, we note that prices are not always displayed as clearly as they might be.
For Parliament, it is of great importance to appeal to the Member States and say that it is not enough to display prices in units of litres or kilograms in the large supermarkets, but that it would also be appropriate to introduce this pricing method in other outlets. They should identify ways of achieving this, as it is particularly important for vulnerable customers.
It was very important for us to make this appeal and it is good that it has been heard.
The second point that is particularly close to our hearts as social democrats has just been mentioned by my fellow Member, Mr Harbour.
It concerns loaves of bread in the United Kingdom.
At no stage have either the Commission, the Council or the European Parliament wanted to call into question these packaging sizes, but the debate in the United Kingdom has taken on a life of its own.
To make this clear to the people of the United Kingdom it was important to include a corresponding recital in this legislation, so that we really could ensure - and British Members, in particular from the Labour Party, have asked me to stress this once more - that bread in the United Kingdom will not be affected in any shape or form, but that it will continue to be able to be sold in the forms that the British public is used to.
A third issue in this context concerned the fact that we wanted to ensure that these nominal quantities would not be abolished automatically after a certain time, but that the European Commission would assess the consequences and the possibilities beforehand and would consider by means of an impact assessment whether this was appropriate, what consequences could arise as a result and how we might respond to any disruption of the market.
The detergent market has provided us with an example of what happens when there are no nominal quantities, and in that case we could consider what action might be taken.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Verheugen, Mr LÃŒtke Daldrup, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur and also to thank him because Mr Toubon has worked in a spirit of complete cooperation with all his colleagues.
Consequently, we have always been informed of his positions and of the progress of the dossier after every discussion with the Commission and the Presidency of the Council.
Mr Toubon has sought our opinion, providing us in good time with clear, precise notes, which have enabled us to make up our minds with full knowledge of the facts.
At the time of the vote at first reading, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe took a stand against maintaining packaging sizes insofar as these mandatory categories did not exist in the 27 Member States and these obligations could hamper innovation and competition by limiting consumer choice.
The ALDE Group has, however, come round to the Council common position and supports the idea of transitional periods for certain categories of product.
On the other hand, the ALDE Group did not necessarily want a revision clause to be entered into the actual body of the directive, as it felt that the reference to this review clause in a recital sufficed.
Recognising, however, the persuasive powers of the rapporteur, the ALDE Group will support him on this point as, I might add, it will support his amendments as a whole.
Aside from this vote, however, may I express my regret that none of the institutions has taken up the idea of concordance tables, which appeared in Article 8 of the basic proposal.
In accordance with the 'Better lawmaking' interinstitutional agreement, the Member States are in fact encouraged to establish for themselves and in the Community interest their own concordance tables between the directives and the transitional measures and, above all, to make them public.
This point is particularly important for the ALDE Group, which is very committed to improving information for consumers and, beyond that, which is fighting for better information for European citizens.
(SV) Madam President, the Swedish Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are opposed to a Packaging Directive.
Ideally, we would want to do away with the whole directive.
I have made efforts to rescue Swedish milk packages, reduce bureaucracy and prevent a debate on milk snatching.
The rapporteur, Mr Toubon, has negotiated, and reached a compromise, with Members of the European Parliament and with the Council.
The compromise now looks quite different.
Today's date is 9 May, a day of peace for Europe.
The motto is jaw not war, and in that spirit I shall try to do my bit.
Negotiations presuppose compromise.
Whoever is able to compromise contributes to the development of Europe.
It is more difficult to say yes in the right place than to say no.
I personally am in favour of Mr Toubon's compromise, irrespective of whether or not my Swedish fellow Members are.
This is my way of celebrating 9 May, that is to say by showing some additional willingness to compromise on the issue of a Packaging Directive, for it is in that way that modern Europe is being built - stone by stone, compromise by compromise.
I also want to try to help, so I am agreeing to the proposal and would conclude by saying:
(FR) My respects, Mr Toubon.
In fact, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, Mr Toubon is behind you on the other side.
In any event, the debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive) (09911/3/2006 - C6-0040/2007 - (Rapporteur: Malcolm Harbour).
rapporteur. - Madam President, it is a pleasure to be able to present this report on behalf of the committee tonight.
I would like to pay tribute to my colleague, Mr Gargani, who handled the report at first reading - a substantial amount of work was done by Parliament at that stage.
I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council, because we have worked very hard together on an extremely complex and technical proposal.
In total it is a report of almost 400 pages, which must be one of the biggest reports to come before this Parliament.
In particular, Commissioner, I would like to thank your own staff - Mr Schulte-Braucks and Mr Delneufcourt, who I think has been largely responsible for many of those 400 pages.
I think he deserves a special mention this evening.
This is a very important report in terms of completing the internal market for motor vehicles.
The whole basis of technical regulation for motor vehicles was one of the earliest areas of harmonisation within the European single market, but it has taken until now for us to have a fully comprehensive type-approval framework for all categories of motor vehicles, trailers, major component systems and critical components.
Therefore, on Europe Day, I think this is a notable achievement that we have reached at this stage.
This of course means that we will get the benefits of improved environmental and safety standards for vehicles, consistent and independent validation of performance and that true level playing field we often hear businesses talking about.
We have actually achieved that in this case.
In particular, I think the ability of manufacturers of all scales and sizes to be able to get their vehicles approved by a national type-approval authority to a European regulation and to be able to sell those vehicles in every market across the European Union is a major step forward.
At second reading we have an unusually large number of amendments that were tabled and will be voted on tomorrow.
These reflect a lot of further improvement and work on our part.
I would just like to highlight some of those points this evening.
I am particularly grateful to the Council, also, and I am pleased that Mr Deldrup will be speaking as well, which I think is an indication of the importance that the Council attaches to this important file.
First of all, we have had some debate to finalise some of the issues around the type-approval for buses and the timescale for that.
The bus sector is important because this type-approval directive brings into play the bus directive that many of us worked on.
This brings with it notable safety improvements and important issues like disability access to all types of buses.
This will essentially be brought into play as the single homologation approval framework for buses across the European Union.
The second aspect, which was a new element of the directive added between first and second reading, was the provision to apply a new scheme of type approvals for after-market parts, which affected the environmental and safety systems of vehicles.
It is important that we have an approval process for those categories of parts so that we have very full consumer protection in that area.
But equally this brings the whole of the type-approval process into the focus of many small and medium-sized businesses.
Therefore, together with the other institutions, I worked hard to ensure that we had a very effective procedure, first of all for identifying those parts and to ensure that the producers of those parts were involved in that, and to develop the new test standards that would be required for approval.
But of course, having done that, it allows the producers of those parts, and particularly tuning and other companies, to have access to the single market with a single approval.
I think that is a major benefit that they are very pleased to have.
Another aspect that we looked at was the approval procedure for small series vehicles.
Mr Gargani asked for the lower volume vehicle limit to be raised and a compromise has been reached to raise that to a thousand vehicles for simplified type approval, a major benefit for the smaller serious producers.
We also identified that there was an important category of vehicle for disabled users - 'wheelchair accessible vehicles' - which were series volume vehicles modified to allow access by wheelchair passengers.
With the support of the Commission and the Council, I propose that we should devise a new category for that type of vehicle.
The producers of those vehicles, which are growing in importance, are very pleased to be recognised in that way and are also confident that this will bring into play a new attention to the needs of disabled users, as well as the strength and fittings of wheelchairs and so on. We will have a vehicle here in Brussels tomorrow to show what we have achieved.
In conclusion, this is a very important step forward for the single market.
It has been my privilege to handle it on behalf of Parliament and I commend it to this House for support tomorrow.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow you will be voting on an important new directive on the type approval of cars, lorries, buses and their trailers.
We in the German Presidency are delighted that we have been able to reach a prior agreement with the European Parliament on the remaining outstanding issues.
We should like to thank you, Mr Harbour, and your colleagues very much for the good and constructive cooperation.
This is an important step towards increasing road safety and vehicle safety in the Community and towards making the internal market in motor vehicles a reality.
The new directive extends the European type approval, that has hitherto only been foreseen for passenger cars, to lorries, buses and their trailers.
Manufacturers of these vehicles will therefore also be able to benefit from the advantages of the European type approval in the future.
At the same time, the directive ensures that in the future all new vehicles in the European Union will have to meet the same high safety standards.
The new directive will therefore benefit not only the European automotive industry but also the public throughout the Community.
We are counting on your support in tomorrow's vote and we will then adopt the directive at one of our forthcoming Council meetings so that it can enter into force as quickly as possible.
