This is the challenge ahead of us, and our answer, despite everything, should be that we are still persevering in our efforts and that we must take heart.
I am in no doubt, Commissioner, that in your enthusiasm this is exactly what you are doing; that you continue to be our ray of hope in these difficult circumstances.
That is why we support the initiatives you have adopted, such as the TIM mechanism, which we now know will be renewed.
You have our full support because we feel that this mechanism will cater for the basic requirements.
You also have our backing when it comes to the ability to provide direct assistance to the Palestinian authorities, naturally on condition that financial transparency is guaranteed, because it is the duty of this Parliament to ensure that the money is spent in a transparent manner.
It is a pity that we do not have time to talk about the other aspects of the Mediterranean because we know that the MEDA funds were spent in other countries and that they were spent in a way worthy of praise.
For example, the rate at which the money was spent in countries such as Morocco, Jordan and Tunisia has improved greatly over time.
Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for an important report, which reflects the excellent work the European Union is doing through the MEDA programme.
I have one caveat, however, relating to recital N, which does not reflect the realpolitik of the situation following the formation of the National Unity Government.
I believe that particular reference should be amended to more accurately make that reflection.
The European Union and the Quartet did not respond quickly or pragmatically enough, in my view, to the achievement of the formation of the Unity Government by the democratically elected representatives of the Palestinians.
I believe that this failure on our part was the straw that broke the camel's back.
We now have a coup d'Ã©tat in Gaza which threatens the longed-for peaceful future of the Palestinian people.
Yes, it has to be condemned, but any novice politician could have predicted this development.
Indeed, many of us who are more long-toothed did so last month in this very House.
After 40 years of brutal occupation and constant humiliation by the Israeli authorities, coupled with the world's refusal world to act in accordance with its own democratic norms and to recognise the democratic choice of Palestinians, it is not surprising that Palestine is undergoing this crisis now.
Even at this late stage, Europe must seek to act in partnership with all the elected representatives of the Palestinian people to restore confidence in politics, in negotiations and in elections.
We must do what we can to help restore law and order, which is just as important to the Palestinian people at present as humanitarian aid.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has dedicated a lot of time, effort and budgetary aid to cooperation amongst the countries of the Mediterranean.
The two MEDA programmes add up to more than EUR 7 000 million in commitments and more than EUR 600 million per year.
We believe that the MEDA actions have been one of the European Union's great successes and they have contributed not just to economic development but also, crucially, to democratic development and the defence of human rights throughout the Mediterranean Basin.
I believe that the majority of the entire network of civil society associations in the Mediterranean countries owe their existence to the work of the MEDA programme.
We are therefore very proud that the execution of all the aspects of this programme is very good.
Palestine has always been controversial from a budgetary point of view; it is the aspect of the MEDA programme that creates most conflict.
Direct aid to Palestine is very difficult to control, as certain Members have said, both in terms of its destination and in terms of its application.
I would like to mention that during the last term in office we had a committee of inquiry on direct budgetary aid, of which I myself was a member. Its results and conclusions led to a series of doctrines and measures that, amongst other things, made it possible to create this transitional intervention mechanism.
Of course, today we are faced with a situation in which the humanitarian and political reality goes beyond any budgetary aid predictions we could make from the point of view of budgetary control.
I therefore share this Parliament's practically unanimous view and we are entirely in agreement with this vote of confidence in the Palestinian Government.
We know that direct budgetary aid is very difficult to control, but we are expressing our confidence so that, with everybody's help, we can move ahead with it.
(PT) Mr President, although the MEDA programme is quite new, it has already had positive results on the ground, on the other side of the Mediterranean.
There is some way to go, however, before it becomes genuinely effective and is recognised by the people who benefit from it either directly or indirectly.
Having seen at first hand what MEDA has done in Gaza and the West Bank, I welcome many of the suggestions made by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou in this report, and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate her.
I agree that support and efforts need to be targeted at specific areas, but should be expanded to cover other areas that may prove fruitful in the short term without major investment, as in the case of microcredit.
We are going through a period of change in Palestine, which should, at the earliest opportunity, be the precursor to the resumption of international financial aid and ultimately to the end of Israel's illegal confiscation of customs revenue from a people and a government that is literally being strangled, without food, without economic revenue and without a future to fight for.
Salam Fayad has given us guarantees of political competence and responsibility.
It is up to us, the European Union, to give them the resources, both via financial aid that we channel into the territories and by lifting the blockade on the movement of persons, goods and services in the West Bank - any multiplier effect arising from this aid is rendered useless by the blockade.
For this to happen what is needed is a proactive, rather than reactive, European Union.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I once again express my special thanks to the rapporteur but also to all of you for the debate and your contributions, which have certainly underlined how important it was to launch the Barcelona process more than ten years ago and to formulate a policy for that purpose.
It was also an attempt to find new instruments.
Some of you made clear that the MEDA programme also served to promote improvements in the political situation and infrastructure in our partner countries.
When we look at certain countries on the southern fringes of the Mediterranean, it sadly becomes apparent that a good few aims have not yet been achieved.
Some of you referred to the need for greater efficiency here.
The continuation of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, however, will play a major part in consolidating this Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.
Allow me to return to the point about the particular situation of the Palestinians.
Several of you emphasised that the Commissioner had found a way through this difficult situation, and for that she was rightly praised.
It is also important to say that we must help, but when we do help - and sometimes our approach will be driven by pragmatism - the procedure must not suddenly come under fire after three months.
I do believe, Commissioner, that a way has been found in which we can actually provide help in the current situation.
As I said yesterday at the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, there is certainly a need to distinguish a little between cause and effect.
The European Union has repeatedly said how it intends to support the process in the wider Middle East, but it has also said that its recognition of newly elected governments depends on the fulfilment of certain criteria, namely renunciation of violence, adherence to the Road Map and acceptance of the State of Israel, all of which are long-established requirements.
It is important to be aware of that.
We too have made corresponding efforts, of course.
I would not keep putting all the blame on insufficient recognition of governments or on inadequate resources.
In the Council of Foreign Ministers the European Union has just pressed for and secured an important pledge from Israel to release the frozen funds.
That certainly involved negotiations with the Palestinians too.
As the Commissioner stressed in the debate with the Foreign Ministers on Monday, very rapid results will be achieved here, because it is important to provide assistance both on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, it is highly important to recognise that there is an important connection between MEDA and the new Neighbourhood Policy.
It is true that we have achieved a great deal: the Mediterranean countries are now working together with us, for the first time, not only multilaterally but also bilaterally, i.e. not only the Mediterranean and Barcelona programmes but also bilaterally in the Neighbourhood Programme.
The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is a special instrument which builds on MEDA as regards programming and implementation.
However, we have tried to concentrate and focus a little more in order to increase efficiency.
With regard to ECHO, Mr Michel, who is responsible for ECHO, has made everything possible; EUR 60 million from ECHO funds has already been allocated this year to the Palestinians via UN organisations and NGOs.
Allow me to speak briefly about OLAF.
As you know, the Director-General mentioned that he has to respect the various rules and regulations of OLAF.
At the same time, however, he has delivered a rÃ©sumÃ© of the main conclusions, around ten pages approximately, in a special report to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
He has also offered to attend that committee to answer questions in a closed session.
However, I must make it clear that this would concern money for the years 2001-2003 only and not the last period.
Allow me to return to the difficult question of Palestine and of our funding there.
First of all, you know that this is a European Union policy, not just a Commission policy, and therefore it is the Member States in unanimity which have decided on policy, and we have then tried to support this as much as we could.
Therefore, when the National Unity Government was formed, it did not take us long; I held my first meeting with Salam Fayyad the following week.
I had already met him before he was in government, and we tried to see what could be done.
It was he who said that we have to take some time: you have the Temporary International Mechanism so use it for the time being.
However, I am obliged to issue an order to the Finance Ministry, to the single treasury account.
He then also opened a special PLO account, but this was never the account that we used.
This was intended to be used for money from the Arab countries, in particular, and perhaps also for Israeli money which, in the end, did not materialise.
Therefore, it should be clear that this was an EU policy.
Now there is a new situation, to which we reacted immediately, and so has and had the Quartet.
I have just outlined what can be done as regards this policy.
In response to the Member who mentioned micro-credits, we want to assist in jumpstarting the economy and, for that reason, we are paying arrears to the entrepreneurs from the EUR 22 million that was a reserve programme.
This has not been done for a long time and we have now activated that, therefore we will also have good financial control over it.
On the whole, we have done what we can and have always taken into consideration that the Palestinian people should not suffer.
We try to at least assist them.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 21 June 2007.
External dimension of the area of freedom, security and justice (debate)
The next item is the report (Î6-0223/2007) by Mr Klich, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on an area of freedom, security and justice: Strategy on the external dimension, Action Plan implementing the Hague programme (2006/2111(ÎÎÎ).
rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, this report was initially supposed to be a review of the Commission's Communication from 2005 on the strategy drawn up by the Council that year.
However, during the course of the work it turned out that great progress has been made in creating an area of internal security, freedom and justice and that the work has gained new momentum.
New documents have been drawn up, new decisions have been made and new action has been taken.
Our situation today is very different to a year and a half ago.
That is why I have decided to look forward, rather than look back.
This is also the attitude that both the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which have worked on this report on closer cooperation, should take.
Therefore, it should not seem strange that the report actually amounts to a set of recommendations for the Commission and the Council.
The report is based on two assumptions.
First of all, in the modern world, internal and external security are intertwined, they influence each other and are really inextricably linked.
Secondly, our legal systems and political attitude need to maintain a balance between civil liberties and the safety of our citizens.
This means that if we want to ensure that our citizens are safe and free, both of these values must be promoted beyond the borders of the European Union, but a balance should always be struck between them.
Thus, our foreign policy must always take into account these principles and adapt its instruments, namely our common positions and actions, bilateral and multilateral agreements, accordingly.
In other words, we should, for example, include both anti-terrorist and human rights clauses in our agreements with third countries.
In its current cooperation with these countries, the European Union should promote both respect for human rights and the joint fight against international terrorism.
Here, in Parliament, we are also aware of the current limitations and barriers which restrict the effectiveness of the European Union in this field.
They partly result from our complicated and unclear institutional structure, and partly from a lack of willingness to deepen European integration.
Different procedures apply under each pillar to decisions concerning cooperation and external agreements.
The joint Community police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters that we have been hearing about for a long time has yet to materialise.
It must appear soon.
We expect the forthcoming EU summit to lead to an international conference which will, by the end of the year, produce a new draft treaty and that this treaty will give the Union a legal personality, abolish the current pillar structure, reduce the number of categories that apply to legislation and simplify and unify decision-making procedures.
However, before all this takes place, and before the treaty comes into force, as it may only come into force in 2009, the report proposes the application of a temporary clause, a passerelle, in accordance with Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union, in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and the policy on legal immigration and the integration of foreigners.
This would allow the Council and all of us to introduce the new Community mechanisms into these very important fields.
In view of the pressure of immigration on our southern borders and the threat of organised crime on our eastern borders, the failure to make these decisions would be a serious political mistake.
As we are discussing the issue of borders, I would particularly like to draw the Commission's attention to paragraph 42, which mentions the need for a visa to enter the Unites States, and is particularly galling to European Union citizens.
Once again, Parliament calls for this matter to be settled.
Finally, I would like to warmly thank all of my collaborators, including those from my political group, the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups and Commissioner Franco Frattini, for their excellent and fruitful cooperation.
Madam President, Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has set itself the task of providing its citizens with an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Union, however, cannot achieve this aim on its own.
Free movement of persons and goods and Europe's economic strength and democratic stability have made the European Union a magnet for illegal immigration, organised crime, international drug-trafficking and even Islamist terrorism.
This means that we must reflect on how we can develop the existing mechanisms and approaches in the field of justice and home affairs and, as the rapporteur just mentioned, integrate them into the external relations of the EU.
I warmly welcome the great interest shown by the European Parliament in the external dimension of justice and home affairs and particularly in the aforementioned strategy, and the recommendations contained in your report, Mr Klich, provide important food for thought for the Council's deliberations on how to strengthen the role of the Union's policy on justice and home affairs in its external relations and make it even more effective.
The strategy for the external dimension of our justice and home-affairs policy sets out the objectives and line of approach in detail.
One element of our cooperation with countries outside the EU is the support provided by the European Union to institutions and to capacity-building efforts.
This is a long-term task, and progress in its performance is discussed within the joint institutions.
The direct neighbours of the European Union play a particularly important role with regard to the security of the Union.
This is why the action plans adopted jointly with our partner states as part of the European neighbourhood policy contain very comprehensive chapters on cooperation in the domains of justice and home affairs.
Among the countries involved in the European neighbourhood policy, Ukraine has a very special status, not only on account of its long common border with the EU.
Cooperation with Ukraine in the fields of justice and home affairs is already far advanced.
Another cornerstone was laid in Luxembourg on 11 June with the signing of a working agreement between Frontex and the Ukrainian border-guard service.
In addition, visa-facilitation and readmission agreements were signed on 18 June.
The Union attaches special importance to close cooperation with neighbouring regions in the realm of migration.
On the basis of its Global Approach to Migration, the European Union has greatly intensified its cooperation with the countries of Africa and the Mediterranean region over the past year and a half.
The results are encouraging.
Only two days ago, on 18 June, the General Affairs Council decided to extend the Global Approach to Migration to the neighbouring regions on the eastern and southern borders of the EU.
Besides our direct neighbours, cooperation in the realm of justice and home affairs assumes particular importance in the context of the European Union's relations with its strategic partners, the United States and Russia.
Accordingly, the report also deals with many aspects of this partnership.
In May 2005, Russia and the EU adopted four road maps for the creation of common areas.
The common area of freedom, security and justice is the one in which the greatest progress has been achieved to date - a view shared by the Russian side.
This, of course, includes the agreement on visas and readmission, which entered into force at the beginning of June.
At the last EU-Russia meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, Wolfgang SchÃ€uble, the German Minister of the Interior, also openly addressed the issue of the Russian security forces' heavy-handed response to the demonstrations staged by the opposition in talks with his Russian counterpart, Rashid Nurgaliyev.
Shortly after the Troika meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, the regular human-rights consultations with Russia also took place.
During the German presidency, human-rights issues relating to Uzbekistan have also played a key role in the deliberations of the Subcommittee on Justice and Home Affairs.
Our last meeting with the United States focused sharply on the fight against terrorism, visa issues and issues of data protection, including the transmission of airline passenger data.
In the last few days the German Presidency has been continuing to do its utmost to bring about the conclusion of a new agreement on the transfer of passenger name records.
The United States is not an easy negotiating partner, as we have learned from these discussions.
In addition, the German Presidency has also brought Europe's two strategic partners, the United States and Russia, round the table to discuss common security challenges. These include combating the drug trade, fighting terrorism and managing border security.
Another part of the report is devoted to the reinforcement of police and judicial cooperation.
I believe the German Presidency has made considerable headway in improving cooperation within the European Union.
Special mention should be made in this context of the agreement to bring many of the provisions of the PrÃŒm Convention into the legislative framework of the EU.
Political agreement was also reached on the incorporation of Europol into the legal framework of the European Union.
Frontex has also been considerably strengthened over the past six months.
Let me also highlight the framework decision on exchanges of data from criminal records between Member States, which was referred to in the Klich report.
The extent to which cooperation is possible with non-EU countries such as Russia depends on the level of data protection in those countries, and that will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis.
Global threats and phenomena can only be effectively combated through international cooperation.
This strategy for the external dimension of justice and home-affairs policy is therefore indispensable to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Council will continue to rely on close cooperation, conducted in a spirit of mutual trust, with the committee and the European Parliament in the implementation and further development of this strategy.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, undoubtedly we all agree on the principle by which people's fundamental rights and freedoms can know no territorial borders.
Unfortunately, organised crime and terrorism know no borders either.
It is for this reason, as the rapporteur and the President-in-Office of the Council have said, that there is a growing link between the internal and international dimensions of European Union policies in the area of freedom, security and justice.
This means working together towards an important two-fold political objective: firstly, to strengthen an internal area of security guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms to citizens and residents of the European Union and a harmonisation of systems and rules to provide justice to those who need it, and secondly, to guarantee an international dimension that in some way provides an instrument for European Union foreign policy by strengthening the role of the law and the institutions, by promoting democratic values outside of our borders and by consolidating the institutions.
These are ambitious foreign policy objectives for the European Union, to be achieved through measures on security on the one hand and respect for fundamental freedoms and rights on the other.
These two values can and must go hand in hand.
As has been said, there can be no contradiction between guaranteeing security for citizens and all human beings, and at the same time guaranteeing respect for their fundamental freedoms.
I believe that these common values must form the basis for our agreements, relations and partnerships with non-EU countries.
When Europe plays a role on the international stage our policies must therefore include the promotion of human rights and democracy.
The report before us concerns fundamental matters that I fully support: improving democratic accountability, strengthening security and rights, guaranteeing citizens a higher level of protection against terrorism and organised crime, promoting cross-border cooperation among police forces and judicial authorities and developing an effective European Union immigration policy characterised by solidarity that must go beyond the borders of the European Union, a European asylum policy for those in need of international protection and a concerted effort to clamp down hard on people trafficking, which exploits the desperation of immigrants.
We are already part-way to achieving all this.
European immigration policy is growing.
Over the last few weeks I have put forward documents to Parliament and to the Council on opening up to economic migration and circular migration, promoting mobility and thus abandoning the solely repressive approach to migration policy, although it remains essential to combat all forms of illegality.
Just a few days ago I proposed a Green Paper on asylum policies, which will enable this Parliament and all interested parties to participate, so that by the beginning of next year I can present an action plan creating, as promised, a single European system on political refugee status by 2010.
There are thus many issues regarding immigration and asylum policies in which Europe already plays a role in the international arena.
I believe that the Euro-Mediterranean dimension of Europe should be further strengthened in this area, just as Europe plays a part in the east, as regards the Balkans, the Caucasus and relations with the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
We are already conducting activities in various sectors in this region, from people trafficking to the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and women and the fight against cybercrime, another issue that obviously knows no boundaries or borders and which must be tackled at international level.
Much has already been said on terrorism.
Clearly, the fight against terrorism must continue using the means of the rule of law, but it is certainly necessary to pursue and improve international cooperation with the major world players.
For this reason, I very much welcome the fact that the rapporteur has highlighted the importance of decision-making processes that enable the European Union to make its own decisions.
I very much welcome the reference to Article 42 of the Treaty, known as the 'bridging clause', but I believe that it is extremely important not to waste the opportunity presented by the next European Council to discuss the future institutional framework of the European Union and not to forget that, in the area of security, justice and fundamental freedoms, Europe cannot remain at a standstill.
Europe must have the means to make decisions quickly, effectively and with greater democratic legitimacy, for example by assigning a greater role to this Parliament and to the European Union Court of Justice.
Finally, I would like to say a few words on Euro-Atlantic cooperation.
As the President-in-Office of the Council has said, with the United States of America we have two sets of difficult negotiations in progress.
One of these concerns the transfer of information on financial transactions, born out of the SWIFT affair, and the other concerns the transfer of information on passengers on flights to and from the United States.
I hope that in both cases agreements can soon be reached guaranteeing both the certainty of our legal positions - therefore a European legal basis rather than reliance on bilateral relations - and a balance between the needs of the fight against terrorism and ensuring the confidentiality of personal data, both of which are key human rights.
I hope that the United States will accept the balanced position that the German Presidency, with the Commission's support, has tried to put across and that these agreements will be reached by the end of this month, before the German Presidency comes to an end.
I have briefed the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the status of the negotiations.
There are aspects that cannot yet be made public because the negotiations are still in progress, but I have endeavoured to provide the Chairman and the parliamentary group coordinators within the committee with frequent updates on the outcome of the talks.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Madam President, this report was prepared under enhanced cooperation between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I am pleased to inform my colleagues that Mr Klich and I have agreed on a comprehensive text which, I believe, reflects the views of both committees.
I very much thank Mr Klich for his time, cooperation and flexibility.
In addition to the many points made in the report, my main message to the Council and to the Commission would be as follows.
Firstly, it is obvious that the internal stability of the EU is to a degree dependent on external factors, such as the situation in neighbouring countries.
Secondly, no standard approach will work to improve the political situation in these countries, as the countries differ greatly in their economic, political and social realities.
Thirdly, I therefore stress the need for a tailor-made approach towards neighbouring countries in EU policy in the area of freedom, security and justice.
This debate is now adjourned until 9 p.m.
Council Question Time
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, the common system of value-added tax was established in 1967 by the first and second VAT Directives.
These two directives prescribed the general structures of the system.
The detailed provisions governing the application of the common VAT system were introduced in 1977 with the adoption of the sixth VAT Directive.
This directive has since been subject to numerous amendments, most of which were occasioned by the creation of the single market and the accompanying removal of tax barriers between Member States.
On 1 January 2007 the sixth directive was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value-added tax, which incorporates all of the statutory amendments to the original directive.
As far as VAT rates are concerned, the directive establishes the principle of applying a standard rate plus one or two reduced rates.
The standard rate must be at least 15%.
This minimum rate is fixed until 31 December 2010.
The reduced rates, which must amount to at least 5%, are applicable to goods and services defined in the directive.
The directive also provides for certain exceptions to this general rule and for transitional arrangements, allowing the Member States to respond to specific situations.
So that the effects of the reduced rates can be more accurately assessed, the directive also lays down that, by 30 June 2007 at the latest, the Commission is to present to the European Parliament and the Council an overall assessment report on the impact of reduced rates applying to locally provided services, focusing especially on job creation, economic growth and the proper functioning of the internal market and based on a study carried out by an independent economic think-tank.
(EL) Madam President, Minister, as the Commission has said, you must have information on the impact on economic prosperity and job creation in the Member States from different value added tax rates at your disposal and make it known by 30 June 2007.
It is only to be expected that different VAT rates have a strong impact on sectors of the internal market and on the flourishing of the economies in the Member States, with the result that individual economic indicators are affected and inequalities in the economy and society are exacerbated.
I ask you, Minister, do you already know the impact different VAT rates have and, if you do, what is it?
Finally, what policies is the Council considering in order to mitigate the adverse repercussions of these differences?
Mr Mavrommatis, I also said that there has been a variety of developments and decisions within the scope that exists for this in the European Union.
It should be particularly useful in that, when the report of the expert group is presented, we shall have the facts on the table and be able to assess whether or not there are obstacles, as it were, to the functioning of the internal market, and what has been the impact on certain sectors to which reduced rates have applied in the past.
I am sure you will understand that we ought to wait for this report.
After that, we - the Council and Parliament - must conduct an assessment together.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, I should like to extend the question a little.
The attempts to achieve uniform or harmonised VAT rates in Europe are admirable, but surely the objective of European tax policy should be the ultimate achievement of uniform, or at least comparable, taxation rates and taxes throughout the European Union.
I should be interested to hear what kind of discussion there has been on this issue in the Council in general, whether this issue has been approached, and if so, how.
The Council has discussed in detail the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children.
Following this discussion, the Article 36 Committee decided at its meeting of 22-23 March 2007 to deal with these issues in connection with the Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States, and to amend this draft Framework Decision accordingly.
On 13 June 2007, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg, the Council reached agreement on a general direction for a Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States, and brought the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium to a conclusion consensually.
In so doing, the Council took account, in particular, of the important aspect of the Belgian initiative that Member States should have access to information on the relevant convictions pronounced and prohibitions imposed in another Member State, so that each Member State can draw such conclusions from this information as are necessary to protect children from the risk of sexual abuse.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that answer, but I should also like to ask him to acknowledge in the German Presidency the real concern across the European Union about recent incidents of possible child abduction for the purposes of exploitation.
I would ask him to acknowledge that this is now a major issue in the European Union, for his country, for mine and for others, and to ensure that we come to a conclusion, before the end of the German Presidency, on the exchange of criminal records on people who work with children and will be a danger to them.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Moraes, as I said before, we have indeed taken up the initiative, and the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs, too, have recently agreed to implement the key concern at the heart of the Belgian initiative.
Notwithstanding certain differences concerning the information permitted to be passed on, the EU has now found a joint solution to the core issue forming the basis of Belgium's initiative, which I believe is a significant step forward.
I am sure you appreciate that the time remaining to the German Council Presidency will presumably be insufficient to bring about agreement in other fields.
Is it not a pretty dire situation that, three years on from the proposal and when everybody agrees that making cross-border information available on sex offenders is one of the most urgent priorities and one very much supported by the public, we simply have no agreement?
And the Council says it will look at this soon!
Is it not also pretty shocking that the UK Government is seeking an opt-out from this law enforcement area of European cooperation so that, even if it were agreed, our children would not even be protected by measures to track sex offenders?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I should like to start by saying that the Council Presidency considers this a very important, valid question.
The Council is fully aware of the importance of guaranteeing the welfare of disabled people and of children with learning difficulties.
The Council would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the general legislative framework for the fight against discrimination in employment and occupation on grounds of a person's religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
The Directive, which is based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty, lays down the minimum requirements to be met by all Member States.
The problem is that this legislative framework extends to neither insurance nor the education system.
Nevertheless, Member States may introduce or retain provisions that do even greater justice to the principle of equality than those of the Directive, and which envisage protection against discrimination in fields subject to national competence.
Concerning the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the Council notes with satisfaction that the Commission is intending to publish a number of studies relevant to the honourable Member's question.
These studies are intended to highlight the social situation of disabled people, including with regard to education and training, and to summarise the statistics on disabled people provided, in particular, by social-security institutions, with a view to obtaining a realistic overview of the situation of disabled people, including with regard to the educational dimension.
(EL) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply.
I wanted to point out that, as a country, Germany is already demonstrating understanding for people with disabilities and there is legislation allowing them to obtain insurance, so that they are treated equally in employment.
European schools do not have the same measures to help children with disabilities as the Member States and that is why I am asking for initiatives on the part of the Council.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, I crave the House's indulgence, as I shall have to refer to many technical aspects in my reply that may not always be easy to follow, but those actively working on the subject matter are of course aware of how important the principles are in this regard.
Currently, measures in this field - that is, the field of migration - can be taken pursuant to Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
The fields in which measures are taken by means of codecision with the European Parliament are extended by Council Decision 2004/927/EC of 22 December 2004 providing for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty, in accordance with the second indent of Article 67(2).
Most measures referred to in these provisions are now taken by means of codecision.
However, the European Council took the view that, until the entry into force of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the Council should continue to act unanimously with regard to the measures referred to in Article 63(3)(a) and (4) of the EC Treaty in the field of the legal migration of nationals of third countries into and between Member States.
These and other issues are still being examined in the course of the ongoing process of Treaty reform.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the information that he has given us, of which, despite its technical nature, this Parliament is clearly very well aware.
At the moment there is immense concern in Parliament at the Council's inability to resolve immigration issues by means of intergovernmental cooperation.
I shall refer to a single case, that of the maintenance of the Dublin II Regulation, which currently prevents us from showing solidarity towards the Republic of Malta in order to deal with the immigration problems, something which could be resolved in a Community fashion.
My worry is that the intergovernmental method is not sufficient and that we should move over to the first pillar.
One example of this is the issue of the Dublin II Regulation.
Mr Medina Ortega, the migration issue has been the subject of frequent discussions in past rounds.
I have pointed out many times, including in connection with another of today's debates, that the global approach to migration will undoubtedly play a key role in the Council conclusions tomorrow and the day after, and that it is not just an issue, but rather is being dealt with.
The honourable Member is right to ask how we can help Member States of the European Union such as Malta.
However, we shall also endeavour to find solutions to the issues surrounding, and causes of, migration, particularly illegal migration, together with the countries of origin.
The other question is of a technical nature, but of course this all depends on how we deal with the issue of the future of the Constitutional Treaty.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, mass legalisation of illegal immigrants in various Member States has often been interpreted as an invitation, and has led to veritable waves of refugees, as well as gift-wrapping a boom for people-smuggling gangs.
To what extent are there plans to extend readmission agreements, particularly with countries receiving financial support from the EU?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Readmission is an important issue, one that has been on the agenda of the joint debates between the European Union and African countries, and most recently of last year's joint conference on migration in Tripoli.
This is true of many areas, of course, as - even though this has not had a decisive influence on the present discussion - there is currently a wave of migration not only from South to North, but also from East to West.
In that regard, the very issue of whether it is possible to arrive at regulations for the respective readmission agreements is always included in discussions on visa provisions.
This is also the case in the talks with African Union countries, for example.
I cannot give you any figures at present as to the countries with which such agreements have already been concluded, but I am sure we shall be able to provide these at a later date.
(MT) Although I agree with the President that what has to be discussed are the causes of emigration, I would like to know what the German Presidency's position is regarding Malta's burden-sharing proposal.
We agree that, eventually, this will have to be discussed in the light of the Constitutional Treaty, but this is an urgent catastrophe and requires urgent action.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) At the 2007 EU-USA Summit, the European Union and the United States agreed the following: consistent with our common values, we confirm that we have long been working to ensure that efforts to combat terrorism are in line with our obligations under international law, including human rights standards, refugee law and international humanitarian law.
We shall continue and intensify our ongoing dialogue on the fundamental rights under international law that are relevant to our common fight against terrorism.
This dialogue has helped us obtain a better knowledge of each other's legal framework and should promote cooperation between us on fighting terrorism.
The Presidency informs Parliament regularly about transatlantic relations, including about issues connected with international law.
One such briefing was given here in the run-up to the EU-USA Summit on 24 April 2007.
On the subject of transatlantic dialogue, the legislator contributes to the transatlantic dialogue on security.
The Council noted the European Parliament resolution of 14 February 2007 on extraordinary rendition on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 5 March 2007.
The Presidency has neither sought nor received any responses from the Member States to the said European Parliament resolution.
The post of counter-terrorism coordinator is currently being assessed, and the search for a suitable candidate is under way.
It would have been preferable to have a full debate on the CIA renditions and European complicity this part-session, as the Liberals wanted, but unfortunately the largest groups on the right and left strangely refused to support that idea.
We could then have pressed the Council collectively to respond at last to Parliament's and Dick Marty's reports.
How is the Council ensuring human rights compliance, as stated in the summit conclusions, when we know that US efforts are directed at persuading EU Member States to dilute legal protections?
Is the Council going to let MEPs into those ongoing secret discussions given that we are supposed to have a high-level trialogue on terrorism?
We have never been consulted on the action plan, and I think it is about time the Council improved its partnership with Parliament on these matters.
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) If I remember rightly, I have already explained, in the debate on the subject, the importance of transatlantic dialogue and what the European Union and also the Council Presidency have contributed to that debate.
It is indeed the case that many an impetus has been given and that the relevant talks are currently being held - admittedly not high-level talks, but talks at working level.
I hope you will understand that these are confidential talks.
Regularly including the subject of transatlantic relations on the agenda, however, ensures that the possibility of exchanging views on how far both parties' efforts towards a resolution have progressed will continue to exist in future.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, allow me to express my opinion that your efforts in certain part-fields have not yet proved entirely successful, particularly - with regard to my area of competence - in the field of the checks on European passengers at US airports, which I consider shameful and without doubt in violation of human rights.
I believe that this state of affairs is unacceptable in the long run.
I should be interested to hear what the President-in-Office intends to do about these measures, which have been taken in the United States under the guise of combating terrorism?
Mr Papadimoulis, the US missile defence system and the planned stationing of 10 rockets in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic has not yet been discussed in the Council.
The bilateral cooperation between the United States and some EU Member States in connection with the stationing of elements of the US national missile defence system falls within the national competence of the Member States concerned.
Consequently, the Council has not considered raising the issue of missile defence in talks with the USA or with NATO.
Ballistic missile defence is the subject of consultations within NATO and the NATO-Russia Council.
On 19 April, special meetings of the North Atlantic Council and of the NATO-Russia Council were held on the subject of missile defence.
This subject was also discussed at an informal meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Oslo on 26-27 April.
(EL) Madam President, I am surprised by the Council's reply.
Fine, you do not want to discuss it with the Americans and ÎÎÎ€Î.
Do you intend to discuss it in the Council, with your Czech and Polish colleagues?
Or have you handed everything over to ÎÎÎ€Î?
The German Minister of Foreign Affairs has expressed his concern.
Mr Solana likewise.
Germany wants smooth Euro-Russian relations.
Do you intend to discuss the matter during this summit?
Do you intend to discuss it at some point?
What is the point of the Council talking if it does not talk about issues which worry all the citizens of Europe?
President-in-Office of the Council.
(DE) I should like to refer once again to the starting position. A few years ago, at the North Atlantic Council in Prague, the partners agreed on the new challenges presenting themselves and on the answers - possibly new ones - NATO had to find to these.
NATO has set up the relevant working parties.
This debate was continued in Riga, but no definitive result has been achieved as yet.
For example, we agree on the joint threat analysis.
At this stage, however, the United States made its proposal for a national missile defence system.
We take the view that, as a rule, the subject of the missile defence system should be discussed within NATO rather than within the European Union.
I can only reaffirm that this neither has been, nor will it be, discussed within the Council.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, you say - rightly - that the Council does not wish to deal with this issue, but I should like to ask, against the background of surveys according to which 51% of Poles oppose the planned stationing of this US missile defence system, why calls by citizens' action groups for a consultative referendum have been dismissed on grounds that referendums are unsuitable in this case.
What is the Council's position on the subject of public participation in such important decisions?
Does the possibility of negotiating on this, at least, still remain?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) As far as public participation is concerned, this is a national decision, and no guideline is required on the part of the Council Presidency.
This is a matter for Member States on their own responsibility.
In this connection, however, I should like to reiterate that there has indeed been movement on this issue in general terms, particularly between Russia and the United States, who have agreed to an intensive exchange of views on the subject and to confidence-building measures.
This currently remains open.
As the honourable Member is aware, Mr Putin recently made proposals to this end to the USA, too.
I believe that we should await these talks.
(DE) My question follows on directly from this.
Has the EU Council Presidency taken a position on Vladimir Putin's proposal to involve Azerbaijan in this missile system?
Secondly, does the position of the EU, or rather the Council, on the US missile system correspond to NATO's position, or is there a difference?
If the latter, what is the nature of this difference?
Thirdly, does the Council intend to deal with the issue of the missile system at any stage?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I would point out that there is no legal basis for the Council to formally approve or reject projects such as those mentioned in the honourable Member's question.
In other words, such projects can go ahead without the need for the Council's prior approval.
As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, Decision 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decision 96/391/EC and Decision 1229/2003/EC makes reference in several places to a gas pipeline between Russia and Germany running across the Baltic Sea via the offshore route.
I also assume the honourable Member is aware that, in accordance with Annex I to this Decision, a North European gas pipeline is categorised under 'projects of European interest': the category of projects given the highest priority.
With regard to the special provisions governing projects of this standing, the Council would draw attention to the operative part of the aforementioned Decision, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by the codecision procedure.
I should like to refer Mr Lundgren, in particular, once more to Article 13 of the Decision, which reads as follows: 'This Decision shall be without prejudice to the results of the environmental impact assessment of projects, plans or programmes which define the future framework for such projects.
The results of the environmental impact assessments, where such an assessment is requested in accordance with relevant Community legislation, shall be taken into consideration before a decision on the carrying out of the projects is actually taken in accordance with the relevant Community legislation.'
Regarding the second part of the question, in accordance with the Treaty, it is up to the Commission to ensure the correct application of Community legislation and, in the case of infringements, to take such measures as it deems appropriate.
Naturally, this principle also applies to the Community legislation in force for environmental impact assessments.
(SV) Madam President, as an EU country and as the country holding the Presidency right now, Germany is appealing for a common energy policy for the EU.
In spite of that, it is concluding a bilateral agreement with Russia concerning a very considerable investment in infrastructure in the form of the gas pipeline and is doing so without consulting other EU Member States around the Baltic Sea.
What are there by way of comments on this?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) This issue has also been the subject of a previous Question Time.
I can only reiterate that this is a private rather than a State project, and that any enterprises carrying out this project have to submit all the relevant documents, including in the countries in which this pipeline is ultimately to be laid, where they have to carry out this examination in accordance with the relevant provisions.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, as we know, this gas pipeline has been severely criticised by various politicians, experts and scientists, particularly from Scandinavian and Baltic countries and Poland.
Perhaps the Council could help bring the competent experts and politicians together to discuss the problem and perhaps reach a practical compromise?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) Mr Paleckis, it is primarily the task of the parties planning and wishing to carry out this project to keep the countries concerned informed as appropriate - which is done by making the appropriate application.
This application will undoubtedly be followed by an examination of all possible aspects, particularly those of the environment and security.
I am assuming that the appropriate talks will also be held.
However, first and foremost, it is entirely up to the parties involved in the project to take the initiative on this - and these parties are private and not State enterprises.
(LT) Madam President, Minister, this is not the first time we are discussing this issue.
Talking about its ecological consequences evokes all sorts of concerns and fears.
Now Russia, implementing the project, is carrying out its own environmental impact assessment, saying that the weapons on the seabed are not dangerous.
Do you not find it illogical that a private project manager is carrying out the environmental impact assessment?
The Council has not discussed this issue in terms of the aspect which has been mentioned by the honourable Member.
The physical distance or proximity to the 27 Member States is not, in itself, decisive as regards relations between the individual countries and regions of the European Union.
Relations with overseas countries and regions are regulated in the fourth part of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, as well as in Council Decisions.
The currently valid Council Decision, which was adopted on 27 November 2001 and amended on 19 March 2007, will run until 31 December 2013.
The Council will review the situation again before then.
My point really was that what we decide in this Chamber - as you said in response to the last question, when you referred to EU laws that have to be respected - applies in places like Martinique, or Guadeloupe, or French Guiana on the coast of South America, thousands of kilometres away, far removed from this place, but it does not apply in places like the Channel Islands, which are between France and Britain, or the Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Andorra - I could go on.
There are all these peculiar little tax havens and exemptions that we seem to allow and where EU law does not apply.
Does the Council not consider this position to be such an anomaly that we ought to look at it again and consider a more modern way forward, rather than trying to legislate thousands of kilometres away, and not on our own doorstep?
I presumably do not need to make specific reference to the fact that the areas associated with your question concern regions outside Europe but which are part of the European Union because, as it were, they are members of the European Union in view of their links to the mother country.
You are aware, of course, that countries such as Andorra or Liechtenstein are not members of the European Union even though they are situated in Europe.
A corresponding review in Council will establish whether these regions will continue to be affiliated and whether legislation will continue to be transferred to the areas mentioned.
(DE) Overseas territories where military bases of EU Member States are located are certainly a frequent occurrence.
I would like to mention another specific case: Cyprus has designated sovereign military bases which belong to Great Britain but which are not part of the European Union.
My question here is as follows: Is it a tolerable situation where an EU Member State has areas belonging to another EU Member State which are not part of the European Union?
Mr Bushill-Matthews, you are aware, of course, that monitoring of the proper transposition of EU legislation by Member States is the responsibility of the European Commission in the first instance.
The Council does not therefore wish to comment on the specific case mentioned.
Well, that was a very short answer, but not very sweet.
I am aware that the Commission has certain responsibilities, but are you saying that the Council has no interest whatsoever and does not care about age discrimination?
Because that is the clear message you are giving.
You have just said that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties.
It will review this accordingly.
Furthermore, the opportunity exists for the parties in question to have a corresponding review carried out in the event of discrimination.
(DE) I believe that air travel basically requires reorganisation.
The question to the Council is therefore justified: In future, is it envisaged proceeding more within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation or on a bilateral basis in this area in the event of discrimination, or do you consider it right that the Commission takes an initiative in this area?
Mr Posselt, the entire political situation in Kosovo continues to be determined by the status process.
When the UN's Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, forwarded the Comprehensive Proposal for a Kosovo Status Settlement to the UN Security Council, this process became the definitive responsibility of the Security Council.
EU Foreign Ministers have repeatedly given their unequivocal support to Special Envoy Ahtisaari as well as expression to their conviction that the Ahtisaari package represents an important basis for sustained, economic and political development in Kosovo and can also contribute to the consolidation of stability in the region as a whole.
Following the G8 Summit of Heads of State or Government, at which agreement could not be reached in relation to Kosovo, the EU Presidency called on participating parties to intensify their efforts in order to adopt a new UN Security Resolution at the earliest possible juncture.
The European Union is also continuing to follow the Status process intensively.
The preparations carried out by the European Union in terms of its contribution to a future, international, civilian presence in Kosovo following a solution to the status issue have, by and large, made headway.
The European Union is prepared to assume an important role, in close cooperation with other international actors as regards a possible future, international, civilian presence.
To this end, planning teams are to be found on site which are making preparations for possible future work undertaken by an EU special envoy and an ESDP [European Security and Defence Policy] mission in the areas of policing and the justice system.
The conclusion of these preparations will depend on how the status process itself and the actual status solution continue to progress.
As in the past, in future too, substantial assistance will be required from the international community in general, and the European Union in particular, in order to improve the economic framework conditions and the social situation in Kosovo.
This can only be achieved in close cooperation with international financial institutions and partners on site.
As soon as a precise cost estimate is available, which naturally also depends on the status solution, the Commission will draw up an overall finance package which will also be the subject of a donor conference.
This donor conference will only take place once Kosovo's status has been clarified.
(DE) My supplementary question to you is as follows: Can the issue of Kosovo's status not be resolved in terms that the European Parliament can agree to?
Is the Council aware that 75% of the European Parliament came out in favour of the Ahtisaari plan, international independence and provision of an immediate warning system concerning further delays?
Does the Council consider this to be a course of action which should also be adopted by other institutions?
What does the Council mean by suddenly coming out and advocating the postponement of the entire matter for a period of six months, something which the European Parliament expressly warned against by a significant majority, and what does it mean by the statements made by Mrs del Ponte, who has no jurisdiction whatsoever in this field?
Naturally, we are aware of the debates which have taken place in the European Parliament and the resolutions adopted by this House.
However, I would again make reference to a detailed discussion which took place last Monday in the Council of Foreign Ministers and which will continue tomorrow evening in Brussels.
In the course of this, unambiguous clarification was again provided in relation to the fact that although the Ahtisaari proposals constitute a basis, we do need a UN decision to assist in finding an acceptable solution.
It would now be completely wrong, and this has also been discussed with the governments of neighbouring regions, to take a unilateral decision.
I believe that we should also be able to convince our partner, the United States, that a multilateral decision under international law is required.
To this end, further talks will soon take place at a bilateral meeting between Mr Putin and Mr Bush.
These talks will also certainly involve Kosovo.
However, I am now giving due notice that a unilateral decision would not represent a sound basis for other decisions which are in the pipeline.
I am aware that impatience also prevails in the region.
We have, for example, particularly thanked the Albanian Government for its influence over recent weeks and months and declared that a decision under international law is necessary and not just unilateral acceptance by individual countries.
(DE) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what initiatives are planned by the Council Presidency in the area of economic policy, above all, in the sphere of energy policy as well?
Could you envisage the SME Charter or the Energy Charter, for instance, being used as a starting point for also counteracting unemployment in the economic process as well as for transposing the Lisbon agenda there in an attractive manner?
Mr RÃŒbig, we are certainly aware, and Mr Posselt's question has also helped trigger this awareness, of the importance of establishing economic stability alongside political stability.
A precondition is now a basic decision.
We all know the circumstances.
As regards future prospects (you have mentioned the Energy Community which already exists in the region), decisions must then be taken if the preceding political decision has been taken.
However, you are also aware following other debates, including those relating to neighbouring regions, of the opportunities afforded these countries by the European Union in terms of promoting regional cooperation.
The aspect you have mentioned certainly has far-reaching implications.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Subject: Athena system
While the EU Treaties prohibit the use of EU budget appropriations to fund military operations, the Member States have agreed on a special Athena system.
How much funding from the Member States has been used to fund the various operations through this system?
Subject: Military budget for Athena financing mechanism
According to information from the German Federal Government in the summer of 2006, the EU is acquiring certain communications facilities from NATO (with costs shared between the two organisations) for the purpose of implementing operation Althea, is negotiating the acquisition of the cartographic material for Bosnia and Herzegovina originally produced for NATO or is renting a precisely defined infrastructure (container) at the shared headquarters Camp Butmir, albeit already in the form of a regular contractual agreement that goes beyond Berlin Plus.
Does the Council consider that adequate democratic budgetary control is guaranteed for the Athena military budget after the most recent Council decision on the Athena financing mechanism and why has it not so far been possible to identify the payments to NATO initiated from the Athena budget, to publish details of the precise utilisation of appropriations from the Athena budget and to inform the European Parliament accordingly?
Article 28 of the Treaty on European Union lays down the principles for financing civilian and military crisis management operations.
Military or defence policy-related operations cannot be financed from Community funds.
Athena is the mechanism created by the Council in 2004 to manage the financing of the joint costs of such operations.
The joint costs are less than 10%, which amounts to the total additional costs of an operation.
The remaining expenditure is financed directly by Member States according to the principle whereby costs are borne where they accrue.
Athena is managed under the supervision of a special committee made up of representatives from Member States who are accountable to their own national parliaments through their respective ministers.
As far as the Althea operation is concerned, both the European Union and NATO pay for their share as regards jointly used facilities, personnel, etc. NATO does not receive any reimbursement from Athena for the services rendered.
(FI) Madam President, Secretary of State, this is a peculiar system, which has no democratic supervision.
By democratic supervision I mean parliamentary supervision, not supervision by the European Parliament or the national parliaments.
This is the way to recycle the rules of the Treaties, as you just said.
I would now like to ask if the new Constitution, regarding which the Presidency has drafted a proposal, will alter the Treaties in such a way that this money could be granted out of the EU budget without the Athena system?
Mr SeppÃ€nen, on the eve of the European Council, I do not wish to speculate today on the future of the European Constitutional Treaty.
We will see which debates will be held and the consequences in terms of the contractual provisions.
On the second point, I would like to say that the respective ministers from the Member States are represented in committee and these ministers, in turn, are ultimately accountable to their own parliaments since the contributions come from the Member States.
As far as I am aware, parliaments either have relevant specialist committees which can pass judgment and question the respective minister on the use of funds, or there are budgetary control committees which examine how these funds are used.
(DE) Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different.
In the security and defence sub-committee, I am told that the EU has paid money to NATO.
You are now saying that no money has been paid.
This is very interesting.
The problem is that we do not receive any figures when enquiring about them in the individual national parliaments, nor do we receive figures through the Committee on Budgets or in the security and defence sub-committee.
Would it be possible for the Council Presidency to compile a summary of the expenditure effected hitherto in relation to this Athena mechanism?
As Council President, I can inform you that no initiatives have been taken in order to provide the Commission with a mandate to start negotiations on corresponding agreements with Georgia.
However, provision is made at any time in the EU-Georgia action plan within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy for the initiation of a dialogue on issues connected with the transit of persons, including issues of readmission and the issuing of visas.
In connection with discussions on the possible unequal treatment of citizens living in Abkhazia who receive visas there on the basis of the new agreements, as well as in connection with the issue regarding whether imbalances may indeed exist in this area between the rights of people living in Abkhazia and those of people living in Georgia itself, I would like to add that this debate, which has also taken place at another level within the European Parliament, will continue to bring about a solution.
(LV) Mr Gloser, you just referred to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and it is well known that Russia is currently issuing Russian passports on a massive scale to inhabitants of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, thus artificially reducing the proportion of Georgian citizens in those regions.
The European Union, in hesitating with regard to the allocation of this visa facilitation to Georgia, is indirectly creating an additional incentive for Russian passports to be acquired, since Russian citizens currently have more opportunities of travelling to the European Union than Georgian citizens.
I would like to ask a second question: why were these talks on visa facilitation for Georgia not begun in the Council?
What specific solutions do you see that might resolve this situation which is, in my view, unacceptable?
President-in-Office of the Council.
(DE) Mr Rutowicz, you enquired as to the status of the Regulation on roaming at the part-session back in February, and so I am pleased to be able to give the following answer to your further enquiry - even though you should already be aware of the subject matter, as the subject of roaming concerns us all given that we can no longer do without mobile phones.
As I am sure you are aware, the Regulation on roaming, which is based on Article 95 of the EC Treaty, is subject to the codecision procedure pursuant to Article 251 of the EC Treaty.
I can assure you that all three institutions have set themselves the objective of adopting the Regulation on roaming as quickly as possible.
At the European Council on 6-8 June, the Council reached a political consensus on the proposal, and thus approved the opinion of the European Parliament at first reading.
The legal and linguistic experts are already carrying out the final revision of the text, so that it can be adopted under an expedited procedure.
It is anticipated that the legal act will be adopted at the end of June.
It will be published in the Official Journal immediately afterwards.
(PL) Madam President, unfortunately, the question was asked when the situation was quite different.
Therefore, I imagine that we should at this point applaud the fact that these directives have been adopted so quickly and that European society will benefit from this work.
Incidentally, this is a great success for the whole European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
However, the rates set out in this directive are not such a great success.
According to experts from the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, these rates were previously lower.
The rapporteur increased them during the consultation process and, finally, they were increased in the directive itself.
However, I do have a question I would like to ask.
Roaming remains, if I may say so, something that is unacceptable in Europe.
My question, therefore, is when might roaming be abolished altogether in European Union Member States?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) action plans consist of political documents that represent a political consensus between the European Union and the individual partner countries on an agenda of political, economic and sectoral reforms and contain both short- and medium-term priorities for action.
They are adopted between the EU and the respective partner country by the Association or Cooperation Council.
ENP action plans have been concluded with five of the six partner countries in the East, the first being that with Ukraine on 21 February 2005 and that with Moldova on 22 February 2005.
These were followed by individual ENP action plans for Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia on 14 November 2006.
No such action plan has been adopted with regard to Belarus, as the EU has no contractual relations with that country.
Belarus will not be able to enjoy the extensive benefits of the European Neighbourhood Policy until it introduces a democratic system following free, fair elections.
The following ENP action plans have been adopted with regard to partner countries in the South: that with Israel on 11 April 2005, with the Palestinian Authority on 4 May 2005, with Jordan on 2 June 2005, with Morocco on 22 June 2005, with Tunisia on 4 July 2005, with Lebanon on 19 January 2007 and with Egypt on 6 March 2007.
No action plan has been concluded with Algeria as yet, and no action plans have been adopted for Libya and Syria as the EU has no contractual relations with those countries.
The EU will provide a total of EUR 12 billion in Community funds for the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in the 2007-2013 period, representing an increase of 32% in real terms.
Following discussions with the EU Member States, and pursuant to Regulation No 1638/2006 of 24 October 2006 laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, the Commission decided on the financial breakdown and adopted strategy papers and indicative programmes covering countries, regions and cross-border programmes for the 2007-2010 period.
The multiannual appropriations for the country programmes under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, ENPI, for 2007-2010 are as follows: EUR 220 million for Algeria, EUR 98.4 million for Armenia, EUR 92 million for Azerbaijan, EUR 20 million for Belarus, EUR 558 million for Egypt, EUR 120.4 million for Georgia, EUR 8 million for Israel, EUR 265 million for Jordan, EUR 187 million for Lebanon, EUR 8 million for Libya, EUR 209.7 million for Moldova, EUR 654 million for Morocco, EUR 632 million for the Palestinian Authority, EUR 130 million for Syria, EUR 300 million for Tunisia and finally EUR 494 million for Ukraine.
It should be remarked that no strategy papers or indicative programmes have been adopted for Libya and the Palestinian Authority, as medium-term programming is not possible in those cases, and therefore the appropriations stated are only position numbers.
(LT) Madam President, thank you for the comprehensive response.
I would like to clarify one thing.
In the implementation of this policy, certain agreements and action plans are made with particular countries: the European Union and Ukraine, the European Union and Georgia.
Are the Member States neighbouring these countries involved in drawing up the action plans?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) This afternoon, we held a debate on MEDA and the European Neighbourhood Policy, but more in relation to the South.
I should like to underline that saying that the EU now has an external border, but that it also has neighbours and is interested in the political, economic and social stability of these countries, has given the Member States who joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 an impetus.
When we developed the ENP, therefore, we also established a priority, particularly with the important aspect that a programme can be drawn up for each neighbour having the appropriate relations with the EU, depending on the progress made in the individual case, with the result that there are customised programmes for Ukraine or Moldova, for example.
I can only say, Mrs BudreikaitÄ, that the countries you mention are cooperating on drawing up these action plans and have every interest in these.
The content of these plans and this neighbourhood policy can play a vital role in certain fields, for example access to the internal market.
The fact that the European Council is to give its blessing to this new approach of neighbourhood policy in its conclusions tomorrow and on Friday will mean that the subsequent Council Presidencies are hopefully able to use this programme as a basis for their further work.
(FI) Madam President, you said that there are no Neighbourhood Policy programmes in effect for Belarus, because no free elections have been held in the country.
A programme of this sort has nevertheless been agreed with Azerbaijan.
Do you think that the elections in Azerbaijan were free and above board, and do you think it is logical that such a programme has been agreed with Azerbaijan but not with Belarus?
Mr Nicholson, in accordance with Community law, it is the Commission who bears responsibility for the application of the protective clause, and thus the Council has no direct influence on the decision that the Commission has taken with regard to Brazilian beef.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, but I am a bit frustrated by that reply.
I also put a question last night to the Commission, which was not very helpful either.
I would like to put to the President-in-Office that, when the Irish Farmers' Journal and a representative from the Irish Farmers' Association visited Brazil, they found clear evidence that rules were not being followed in Brazil.
Traceability is non-existent.
There are no controls at regional borders.
Animal movement in Brazil from foot-and-mouth areas is taking place every day. There is evidence that substances banned in the European Union are being used in Brazil.
Is it not beyond time that we in Europe stopped paying lip service to this type of problem - when our consumers could have the possibility of being affected by this - and have a ban on Brazilian beef, which everybody in the European Union wants for the betterment of the producers and the consumers?
President-in-Office of the Council.
(DE) I do not like having to say that the Council does not have competence in this area, but you said yourself that you have taken the opportunity to raise this problem with the Commission, too.
The Council is also aware of the problem, of course, but it is now up to the Commission to look into the relevant information.
Subsequently, the Commission is also responsible for making the relevant proposals and taking precautionary measures.
This really does not fall within the competence of the Council.
President-in-Office, you say this is a matter for the Commission, but the health of European citizens must be a matter in which the Council has more than a passing interest.
The United States of America has imposed a total ban on all fresh beef imports from Brazil because it says traceability is non-existent, illegal growth hormones are in widespread use and, generally, controls are alarmingly weak.
Is the health of EU citizens less important than the health of American citizens and, if not, then why have we not already banned Brazilian beef?
I have heard what the Council has said, but I think it is sidestepping the issue here.
At the moment we are negotiating with the G4 in Potsdam and I would like to know whether we can ignore the recommendations of the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which called for a ban on the import of beef from Brazil.
Can we ignore the conclusions of the final report on a mission carried out in Brazil by the European Food and Veterinary Office, which tell us quite clearly that the present system of residue and veterinary medicine control is not adequate?
Major shortcomings remain in the design, scope and implementation of the National Residue Control Plan.
I should like to ask the same question as the others.
Do you not agree that now is the time to take action and to protect European consumers?
President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) I agree with you that the European Union has to take action where there is information such as you have just described, but we have laid down rules for ourselves in this area.
All I can do is take up your calls in the interests of consumers and encourage the Commission to inform the relevant bodies of the extent of its examination and what measures it is able to take, but I regret that we cannot constantly swap roles.
We have clearly defined fields of responsibility, and this is the Commission's.
I cannot anticipate the answer of the Commission, which does not need to be present for today's Question Time.
I can only offer to make a renewed enquiry, so that you, as citizens' representatives, receive a suitable, clear answer from the Commission.
I should like to take this opportunity, President-in-Office, to thank you very much for your cooperation and courtesy during your country's Presidency at our Question Times.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

Exchanges of information extracted from criminal records (debate)
The next item is the report by AgustÃ­n DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States C6-0052/2006.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank all of my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their cooperation on this report and particularly the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg, Mrs VÄlean and Mrs Grabowska.
Information on criminal convictions circulates between Member States under the mechanisms of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance on Criminal Matters of 1959, but there are serious difficulties with that mechanism.
These deficiencies were demonstrated dramatically by the case of Fourniret, a French man sentenced in the 1980s to seven years in prison for the rape of a minor and then released after just two.
We would discover years later that, between his release and his re-arrest in June 2003, Fourniret had murdered nine girls and was suspected of killing a further twelve.
He had managed to evade judicial action for more than 14 years, simply by changing his residence from one Member State to another, and furthermore, to top everything, he even managed to get a job in a school.
It was clear that the mechanisms for exchanging information on criminal records had to be modified and improved.
The proposal for a Council framework decision intends to replace the information exchange mechanisms regulated in Article 22 of the Convention of 1959 and repeal the decision of 21 November 2005, all with a view to guaranteeing that the Member State of nationality is in a position to provide a correct, rapid and exhaustive response to requests for information that it receives with regard to convictions of its nationals.
Of the measures included in the Council's proposal, we must highlight the following:
the principle of centralising information is retained;
a framework is established for contributing to, designing and implementing a computerised system for the exchange of information on criminal convictions, based on the use of a standard European format that makes it possible to exchange information in a standard, computerised and easily translatable form by means of automated mechanisms;
the principle of obligatory forwarding to the Member State of nationality is taken up, eliminating the dispensation of notification when the person also has the nationality of the Member State passing the sentence; and, finally,
the obligation to conserve the information forwarded to the State of nationality is laid down.
With regard to the parliamentary measures proposed, I would highlight the following:
with a view to guaranteeing the integrity and authenticity of the information forwarded, the Member State handing down the conviction shall be considered to be the owner or proprietor of the data relating to the sentences passed by their courts and tribunals;
the future framework Decision must provide for a range of additional guarantees in the field of the protection of personal data;
with regard to the definition of convictions, for the sake of consistency with other reports by this Parliament, the definition contained in the report by my esteemed friend and colleague, Mr Demetriou, must be retained;
the inclusion of sentences in the register of criminal records of the Member State where the sentence was passed is a prior obligation, since it guarantees the authenticity and accuracy of the information forwarded; the information on sentences will therefore only be forwarded once it has been registered, but not before;
it must be made clear that the deletion of criminal records depends not just on completing the sentence, but also on compliance with other additional conditions, such as fulfilling the civil responsibilities arising from the crime, or not re-offending within the time period laid down in law;
it is necessary to establish clearly which legal framework will regulate the deletion of data, that is to say, whether the legislation of the Member State where the sentence is passed is applicable, or that of the State of nationality of the convicted person.
With regard to the conditions for use, Mr Frattini, I genuinely share your concern regarding personal data.
The proposal is much more restrictive than the provisions in force in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, which is justified by the speed with which information on criminal records can become out of date.
Therefore, each time information on a person's criminal record is required for the purposes of a new criminal procedure, it will be necessary to submit a new request for information.
I would like to end, Mr President, by calling upon the honourable Members to vote in favour of the proposed report, and I thank you for listening.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are debating this evening is a necessary step towards the development of judicial and police cooperation between the Member States of the European Union, a step towards promoting the strategy to develop an area of justice and security and I congratulate Commissioner Frattini on promoting proposals such as we are examining today, which promote the Hague programme.
Recording convictions and passing them on for recording in the Member State of which the convict is a national and exchanges of information on convictions in general will undoubtedly help in combating both national and cross-border crime.
There are, of course, gaps in the proposal.
There is no Community method for regulating the question of recording administrative convictions which, in most Member States are not entered in the criminal records.
There is no Community regulation of the question of recording convictions extracted from criminal records.
Unfortunately, the variety of national regulations is still needed.
There is still no approximation whatsoever of laws even on these procedural issues.
Nonetheless, the coupling of national systems for recording and using information on convictions in the framework proposal goes some way towards dealing with the lack of a single Community policy on all aspects of the matter.
However, we must emphasise the need for respect for the right to protection of personal data, not only theoretically, but also in practice.
This will become clear in the natural course of events.
We hope that respect for this right will be real and constant.
I support the report by my honourable friend Mr DÃ­az de Mera and I congratulate him on the interest which he has always demonstrated in the European Parliament in the promotion of this strategy to create an area of freedom, security and justice.
I believe that the report will be supported by a large majority in Parliament tomorrow.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Member States have their own guidelines for collecting data on those convicted in criminal trials. Sentencing data is stored in national criminal registers.
Each Member State is responsible for the central storage and management of information on court sentences.
However, we are crossing national borders ever more frequently and, as we are no angels, we sometimes come into conflict with the criminal law system in another Member State, and are tried and sentenced there.
What should we do with these sentences?
Should we register them or not?
The Member States have different, not very cohesive practices and that is why we need to harmonise this field.
We need closer cooperation between judicial bodies, we need a better and more efficient exchange of information and we need to ensure that the Member States exchange accurate, comprehensive and exhaustive information in response to each request for information from criminal records.
This is what the framework decision proposal aims to do.
We need a European system for exchanging information in a standardised, computerised format, where interpretation is facilitated by automated procedures and a standardised format.
That is why my political group support this report. However, my group does have one serious doubt concerning the report, which discusses judicial cooperation and the exchange of information.
Bearing in mind the importance of telling the whole truth, respect for the rights of and fairness towards the victims of the terrorist attacks in Spain on 11 March, we would like to express our concern regarding the choice of rapporteur for this report.
He has also drawn up other reports on the issue of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
The European Parliament must be seen to be an institution based on the principle of transparency and which serves the citizens.
That is why the authors of specific reports cannot be seen, in view of their activities at a national level, to be controversial figures.
To conclude, I would like to indicate that my political group welcomes the good compromise that has been achieved in this report.
We support this report and we intend to vote in favour of it.
We also believe that the implementation of this decision will mean that Member States will trust each other more, and that this much-needed basis of trust will also apply to criminal proceedings.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra rightly notes that information on investigations shared between countries should have a standardised format and should be shared as flexibly as possible.
The report is also aimed at ensuring the exchange of other information that in certain situations may prove useful.
Every time such information is exchanged there are, of course, potential pitfalls: at the very least there are the different legal systems in the Member States and the different classifications of the same acts.
In extreme cases this may involve the boundary between a crime and a minor misdemeanour.
Personally, I am not happy that Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra was appointed rapporteur for this report despite being accused of non-cooperation with the Spanish police in connection with misleading information implicating ETA in the Madrid train attack.
Where is the political and human responsibility of the former head of the Spanish police?
To conclude, my group has significant reservations regarding this report.
(PT) Mr President, I must begin by referring to the last speech.
It is unacceptable here in this Chamber for attempts to be made at curtailing the parliamentary and political rights of any MEP whose rights have not been curtailed either by decision of this Parliament or by legal decision in his or her own country.
We cannot accept this kind of political persecution of Mr Diaz De Mera Consuegra, who has a distinguished record in combating crime and defending justice as a professional in his own Member State and who has been an outstanding Member of this House.
The report before us today is further proof of his political ability and of the rigour that has characterised both his parliamentary work and his professional life.
I should like to say to Mr Frattini that I am firmly behind everything he said in relation to the Council's attitude.
This measure is a much-needed one, and it is a great shame that the Council did not go further, in terms of both trust between the Member States and Parliament's involvement.
In any event, I share everything that other speakers have said regarding the need to look into criminal background in detail and regarding the fact that the sharing of this information between the Member States constitutes a value-added in combating crime, in terms of identifying suspects, supporting criminal investigations and determining the severity of a punishment.
I should like to finish by saying that I also agree with those who say that the Council must act more quickly in adopting, on the one hand, the framework decision on procedural guarantees for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings and, on the other, the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar, for which the rapporteur was Mrs Roure, a further essential element in striking an appropriate balance in the legal measures in the sector.
(ES) Mr President, I have requested the floor in order to rebut some unacceptable personal remarks, but I have essentially requested the floor in order to thank my colleague, Mr Coelho, who has spoken not just as a friend, but also with knowledge of the facts.
I will just make one comment demanding a correction and an apology from Mr KohlÃ­Äek.
Mr KohlÃ­Äek, the only possible explanations for your extremely unfortunate comments tonight in this House are ignorance, bad faith or some immoral purpose.
I am sure, Mr KohlÃ­Äek, that you have heard - I hope you have heard - of something called presumption of innocence.
I am sure you have heard of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 48 thereof. I am sure you have heard of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and Article 11 thereof.
I do not imagine that you are familiar - and there is no reason why you should be familiar - with Article 24 of the Spanish Constitution.
But all free and democratic Constitutions contain their Article 48, Article 11 or Article 24.
I therefore hope that, when you are in a position to understand what the presumption of innocence means, and, in particular, when you are in a position to properly understand a case about which, to judge from what you have said, you clearly know absolutely nothing, you will be capable of making a private and public apology, and I shall be willing to accept it.
Yours was an unfortunate and unacceptable intervention with which to end the debate tonight, Mr KohlÃ­Äek.
(Applause from the right and from the centre)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia (debate)
The next item is the report by Martine Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council concerning the progress of the negotiations on the framework decision on action to combat racism and xenophobia.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the European Union is based on humanist values, of tolerance, multiculturalism and protection of fundamental rights.
We share strong values that should be protected.
The fight against racism and xenophobia is one of our priorities, but we must bear in mind Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is devoted to freedom of thought, conscience and religion while respecting the inalienable right to freedom of expression, in accordance with Article 11 of this same Charter.
The Commission presented a proposal for a Framework Decision on racism and xenophobia in November 2001, in order to bring closer together the legislative provisions of Member States in relation to racist and xenophobic offences and to fight more effectively against racism and xenophobia in Europe.
Until now, and despite an initial opinion issued by the European Parliament in July 2002, this Framework Decision has been at a standstill.
In spite of the efforts of several Presidencies, Member States have still not been able to reach an agreement on the definition of punishable behaviour and the level of corresponding penalties to be imposed.
It is, therefore, absolutely essential to have a European instrument that makes it possible to combat racism and xenophobia.
Recent statistics show that racism and intolerance are on the increase.
The growth in extreme right-wing parties in Europe and, unfortunately, within our own Parliament, obliges us to strongly condemn any speech that incites hatred.
This Framework Decision obliges us, however, to find a fair balance between freedom of expression and sanctions for offensive behaviour.
The freedom to mock and criticise certain excesses, be they political or religious, are necessary in all democracies.
The European Council has finally come to an agreement on this subject and we are pleased about this.
Indeed, the European Union must spread a strong political message to fight against public expressions of racism or hatred.
We cannot allow ourselves to fail again on a text that is symbolic for the European Union.
I should like to thank the German Presidency for this strong message, which confirms that Europe is not just a great market, but is working for the defence of the fundamental rights of all European citizens.
This new compromise is the fruit of long and difficult negotiations and we are aware that, of necessity, it has its weaknesses.
Nonetheless, I want this political compromise to constitute a minimum level of harmonisation that will allow Member States to go further in future, and I am particularly pleased by the addition of a review clause which will make it possible to achieve a higher level of harmonisation in future years.
Having said that, in order to compensate for these weaknesses, I call on the Commission to present in parallel a proposal for a directive on the fight against all the forms of discrimination listed in Article 13 of the Treaty, in order to strengthen European legislation in this area.
I know, in fact, that Mr Å pidla is working towards this, I think.
I hope that we shall soon have a proposal for a directive.
Finally, this political agreement on the framework decision has brought about substantial changes in the text in comparison with the Commission's first proposal on which Parliament gave its opinion.
Consequently, Parliament should be consulted again in the next few weeks.
We will issue our opinion quickly, you can be sure of that, because we have all worked hard for several months.
We are all set.
This instrument is absolutely necessary for us to live in a world at peace, in which everyone is respected with their differences, beliefs and ways of life.
This instrument is essential if we are to put an end to hatred and racism in a united and fraternal Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Roure for her speech and for her report.
The political agreement reached at the Council last April, after five years of negotiations, was certainly highly significant.
This agreement, albeit on a less ambitious version of the framework decision than the Commission's original proposal, in fact ensures that from the moment the framework decision enters into force and is transposed in each Member State, there will no longer be any safe haven in Europe for those who incite racial hatred, racism and xenophobia.
This represents a political success.
I appreciate that the text of the framework decision contains penal provisions that could have been much harsher.
I would have preferred stricter legislation.
However, as the rapporteur has just said, we had to accept a compromise because, it being a framework decision, the principle of unanimity meant that we could not set our sights as high as we would have liked to.
Nevertheless, for the first time we have a common rule, stipulating that behaviour inciting hatred or discrimination based on race, skin colour or religion must be punished with criminal sanctions in all Member States.
Consider how important it is to punish behaviour inciting anti-Semitic or Islamophobic hatred at a time in which we are talking about integrating immigrants from outside the European Union into our communities.
One of the main issues has certainly been to find the balance between criminal punishment for such behaviour, which is not free expression of thought but concrete incitement to commit violent acts and must be punished as such, and due respect for freedom of expression.
We have worked hard on this aspect and I believe that the final result is satisfactory.
The measure is not intended to punish ideas, but behaviour inciting other people to commit criminal acts, to attack, to wound, to kill and to commit real acts of violence.
All this has absolutely nothing do with freedom of thought.
We are not punishing ideas, but those who, on the basis of a mistaken, if legitimate, idea, move from this idea to behaviour inciting others to attack and to commit criminal acts.
This is the boundary between freedom of expression of thought, which must be safeguarded, and concrete incitement to violence.
This is why I believe this decision to be significant.
It is for this reason that we have established the principle - which is highlighted in Mrs Roure's report - by which a racist motive shall be considered an aggravating circumstance in all offences.
If an ordinary offence involving physical violence is committed for racist motives, it must be more severely punished, since not only incitement as such, but also racist motives, make a given offence more serious than the act itself.
This is an important principle, and I believe that the fact that all 27 Member States have accepted it unanimously puts the European Union in a better position to uphold this key value listed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to apologise for Mrs Esteves, shadow rapporteur for my group, who unfortunately will not be able to take part in this debate.
I thank Mrs Roure for her work, her application and her perseverance because, yes, perseverance was needed to keep on demanding that the Council reach an extremely necessary agreement.
More than five years of negotiation to reach a proposal for a framework decision on racism and xenophobia: is it really reasonable to have stalled for so long measures that are so fundamental to the lives of our fellow citizens?
I should like also to warmly thank the German Presidency for succeeding in breaking the deadlock on this text.
The European Union is founded on communities with values, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity.
By uniting, we have all decided to share those values.
Ladies and gentlemen, declarations of good intentions are not much use, if they are not followed up with strong actions.
That is why it was necessary to act, to act practically, so that intolerance, in all its forms, should no longer poison our continent.
Harmonisation of the legislation of Member States in relation to offences of a racist nature was vital.
Henceforth, every Member State will have to make it an imprisonable offence to publicly justify, deny or crudely trivialise crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and I am satisfied about that.
Nonetheless, I will not hide from you that my satisfaction is not absolute: yes, the adoption of this text sends a strong signal, especially in this European Year of Equal Opportunities, but I am afraid that its added value may be minimal.
In fact derogations are anticipated and flexibility accepted.
Therefore, behaviour will be penalised only if it could incite to violence or hatred towards a group of people.
How, then, is it tolerable for a revisionist to be able to express his views in some European countries in the name of freedom of expression?
Freedom of expression stops when the rights of others are flouted.
I completely understand that there are different cultural and legal traditions in our Member States, but the fight against racism must not be the subject of any compromise.
Tolerating certain expressions of hatred is, in actual fact, accepting them.
Ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives, we shall have to be clear and condemn forcibly these acts of violence.
We must remain vigilant because our fight in defence of human rights and for respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights is far from over.
I ask you, tomorrow, to vote very broadly in favour of this text.
This battle is ours.
It is an honour to our European democracies and an honour to our Parliament.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am not only indebted to Mrs Roure for her report, it also receives my unqualified support.
Racism is a persistent and growing problem in European societies.
This is why more and better instruments are needed to address it, including at European level, should this prove necessary.
As racism knows no boundaries, neither should measures to address it therefore.
Last year, my resolution on racism in football met with overwhelming support in this House, and I hope that this will also be the case for Mrs Roure's report tomorrow.
In the resolution on football, we called for a tougher approach, but a European stand on racism should not confine itself to football alone.
Europe must promote the safeguarding of equal treatment for all its citizens.
This is why proper education is needed, as is Europe's active commitment in favour of social inclusion in a bid to isolate those advocating racism and xenophobia and to strive towards a tolerant and diverse society.
I am pleased that hate crimes are being highlighted in particular in Mrs Roure's report.
I also endorse the appeal not to introduce a hierarchy among the different grounds for discrimination.
All forms of discrimination, including Islamophobia therefore, should be addressed in the same tough way.
The report mentions 9 million victims of racism and xenophobia.
This is probably an accurate figure, but as I see it, 494 million citizens are the victims of racism, because if racism goes unpunished, then this has a damaging effect on society as a whole.
Europe is there for everyone, and we should, above all, keep it this way.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Roure for her persistent work with the Council in putting together this framework decision.
It has taken a long time, but we can say that we have at last reached an important milestone.
It is quite right that we should combat racism and xenophobia with legal instruments, but I think that above all we must implement widespread cultural action.
I believe that this Parliament also has the means to initiate an effective information campaign in Member States, to ensure that this framework decision can be organised into a great cultural battle of ideas.
I believe that it is necessary to fight against racism and xenophobia, because the data provided by the European Monitoring Centre are alarming.
There are increasing reports of racist and xenophobic behaviour, and it is my belief that we must tackle those who frequently attempt to incite racial and religious hatred.
This can be achieved primarily through the media, which are all too often used to communicate messages that are highly dangerous for society.
I believe that the initiative adopted by the Council, but above all the work carried out by Mrs Roure in this Parliament, will serve as an effective tool for the political efforts and for continuing this work.
As Mr Frattini has said, we need to establish the limits within which there is a balance between freedom of expression and the fight against racism and xenophobia.
I believe that this is vital and that we need to implement strong political measures and important cultural action.
(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, in the Berlin Declaration adopted on 25 March this year it is stated: 'European integration has shown that we have learned from our history full of bloody conflicts and suffering'.
I believe this is so, and one proof thereof is the document we are considering today.
The basic resolution defines the following as crimes: fomenting hatred and violence, public endorsement of genocidal crimes, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and refusal to acknowledge these crimes or immense trivialisation of these crimes.
The basic resolution limits itself to crimes perpetrated on the basis of race, skin colour, religion, ancestry, or national or ethnic origin.
However, it does not deal with similar crimes committed for other reasons, such as hate and violence against certain people because of their political beliefs, or their affiliation with a certain social group, or the social situation of groups of individuals - for example, the crimes perpetrated by totalitarian rÃ©gimes.
I think the time is coming for a supplementary document which could deal with fomenting hatred and violence, public endorsement of genocidal crimes, crimes against humanity and war crimes directed against groups of individuals defined by criteria other than race, skin colour, religion, ancestry, or national or ethnic origin, which I have already mentioned.
Such a document might address, for example, social situation or political beliefs, refusal to acknowledge these crimes, or trivialisation of these crimes.
Criminal responsibility could be laid down in these instances.
The European Commission's initiative in fostering public discussion at the European level of genocidal crimes, crimes against humanity, and war crimes perpetrated by totalitarian rÃ©gimes and those who endorse them, grossly distort them or diminish them, is welcome and worthy of support.
On the basis of these discussions, after two or three years it should be possible to submit another proposal concerning a fundamental resolution on these crimes.
(LT) Mr President, I congratulate the author of the report, Martine Roure, on her courage, and extra loud praise goes to Germany, which has proclaimed adoption of a resolution on the fight against racism and xenophobia to be a priority of its presidency.
The idea of the European Union is based on tolerance, trust and peaceful coexistence of nations.
Unfortunately, in recent times the number of racist and xenophobic attacks is not diminishing; instead it is getting close to 10 million per annum.
Racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic elements are being used not just by extremist parties - even the apparently more stable mass-membership parties and their leaders do not shy away from them.
Even in this Chamber and in some national parliaments it is not uncommon to hear speeches steeped in extreme nationalism and xenophobia.
I agree with the rapporteur that in a culture based on rights and freedoms, criminal law is the last resort to be used desirably as little as possible.
However, it is inevitable that penal policy will have to be used to tighten up this area.
I fully support Commissioner Frattini's opinion that a racist motive in a crime should mean an increased penalty for that crime.
No less a priority is education, likewise dialogue between different religions and cultures, and a measured and thoughtful look at the past.
Even when people are feeling their most tolerant, if discussions start about whose tragedy is the greatest and whose pain hurts the most, this is the road to the trampling of tolerance and lack of trust in one another.
For the new countries of the European Union the issue of restoring historical justice is particularly sensitive.
The time is coming for an attempt to reconcile the attitudes of old EU members and the new countries to the tragedies and painful events of the 20th century.
This needs to be done without some parties feeling a monopoly on morality, able to force their opinion on other nations.
The most important aim is not to exacerbate, but to heal wounds, to learn from history and to block the path for any rebirth of racism and xenophobia.
Mr President, whether it is the increase of Islamophobia or the sharp rise in anti-Semitic attacks, intolerance in Europe is on the rise.
It is long overdue and more important than ever for the EU to remain firm by adopting legislation to counteract these worrying phenomena.
This text does not, in itself, constitute the concrete action needed to address the persistent problems of racism and xenophobia in Europe today.
It could be stronger by using the International Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination as a benchmark.
Secondly, this legislation must reaffirm Europe's commitment to our core values of respect for diversity and intolerance of discrimination, a commitment that must amount to so much more than the sum of the political compromises of the Council's text.
In the current political climate, where support for right-wing extremism across Europe has brought racism into the mainstream, moderates must use this legislation and the dialogue that will surround its implementation to take back ownership of the diversity debate.
We must rebuild the bonds of trust between divided communities and we must ensure that feelings of alienation are replaced with a much-needed sense of security.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, first, I am delighted to say that I share Mr Gaubert's kind words for Mrs Roure.
She is an MEP to whose outstanding work we have become accustomed, and she has once again proved this and, as Mr Catania correctly pointed out, her tenacity.
Crimes of a racist nature continue to be a constant, persistent problem in all Member States.
The first step must always be that of prevention.
It is necessary to try to prevent racism and xenophobia by means of a policy of education as early as possible and by means of political and social discourse aimed at preventing the dissemination of hate and the promotion of xenophobia and racism.
The figures from the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia confront us with this reality in the EU.
Whilst it is important to recognise, in legal terms, that the Member States have legal provisions at their disposal, it is also necessary to point out that there are major differences between these provisions, and that harmonisation needs to take place.
This framework decision is therefore welcome insofar as it comprises a certain level of harmonisation of the Member States' criminal law and improved mutual assistance in combating racism and xenophobia.
With this initiative, Parliament has presented its recommendations and adopted its positions on an issue on which - let us not forget - it has been much more consistent than the Council.
(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Nazism and communism are two banks of one river.
Nazism has been studied in detail by academics and politicians; it is well known and condemned by the international community.
Germany itself has contributed to this process, understanding and acknowledging its historical mistakes.
We know little about the other bank of the worst crimes of the past century - communism.
It is hardly discussed; therefore, its crimes against humanity have not yet been acknowledged on a global scale.
About 20 million people died during the Nazi period and the Holocaust; but 100 million people of various nationalities became the victims of communism.
I support the Council's basic resolution and the declaration adopted with the basic resolution, in which the Council condemns the crimes committed by totalitarian rÃ©gimes.
I invite Member States to continue the work of exposing the crimes committed by communist rÃ©gimes, assessing them appropriately and supplementing the basic resolution.
I invite the European Parliament to initiate discussions about the crimes of communism and to make its own input by acknowledging communism to be a crime against humanity.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Roure, for her excellent report on this important but, it seems, highly controversial subject.
It is important since it is estimated that millions of people fall victim to racist crime each year.
It is controversial since it involves striking a balance between effective action to combat racism and xenophobia on one hand and respect for freedom of expression on the other.
In fact, the subject apparently seems to be so controversial that the text currently under discussion has been the product of several years of negotiations.
This of course begs the question, was it strictly necessary that so much time was and still is spent before arriving at a suitable solution?
Let us think of the millions of people who have suffered as a result of this serious time lag.
Is the reason for this extreme delay purely technical politics, or even negligent indifference?
Or is there some underlying attempt not to proceed speedily as some influential political forces are not so favourable to such action and are themselves bordering on being racist and xenophobic?
Perhaps the Commissioner can reassure that the latter is not the case at all and that my fears are utterly unfounded.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - I have become increasingly concerned by the rise of racism and xenophobia across the EU, both in new Member States and established Member States.
In a Union which has the free movement of people as a central pillar, this is doubtless an issue which requires Community action.
Indeed, initiatives like the European Year of Equal Opportunities, which we are currently in, are key to spreading best practise in eradicating discrimination.
It is important that these efforts are redoubled in order to counter the rise in Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism and discrimination against other minority groups, especially those from new Member States.
We, as a House, and all of the European Union institutions and Member States must do our utmost to rid Europe of the scourge of racism and xenophobia, and make clear that it will not be tolerated.
Decision-making in the common European asylum system (debate)
The next item is the report by Hubert Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on asylum: practical cooperation: quality of decision-making in the common European asylum system.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the proposals we have drawn up in this report take us one step closer to a common European asylum system.
The report, which - I assume - will receive broad support from Parliament, represents a clear declaration of commitment by the European Parliament to a functioning European asylum system that aims to take speedy, fair, sure decisions in the interests of those concerned.
It is based on closer cooperation between authorities, cooperation that should have the objectives of building and increasing trust between Member States, of speeding up decisions and thereby providing help more quickly than before to those with a genuine claim to asylum, and of enabling us to combat abuses of the system accordingly.
I have been able to highlight 10 core demands, and I should like to express my particular thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their support and to the Commission for its excellent proposal, on which this discussion has been based.
These 10 core demands are as follows.
The first concerns the establishment of uniform procedures so that speedy, sure decisions can be taken.
The second demand is for the introduction of a list of safe countries of origin, to enable a very clear decision, depending on the individual case, as to whether or not a claim is justified.
The third is the drawing-up of a joint database on the situation in countries of origin, so that all the competent civil servants in the various Member States have the same information at their disposal regarding this situation and thus are all in a position to take sure decisions on the basis of the same information source.
The fourth is that we need highly skilled civil servants to take the decisions.
This is the rationale behind the proposal for the development of a European curriculum, so that qualifications are acquired according to the same standards in all Member States.
The fifth demand is that we help Member States who are under particular pressure from migration flows by temporarily - for as long as necessary - providing teams of experts comprising members from the various Member States, to enable the speedy completion of asylum procedures.
The sixth point is that we need to improve measures for the repatriation of persons, more particularly those who have not been granted refugee status or whose refugee status has been revoked.
The seventh point concerns prevention, and I have already mentioned it many times.
We have to launch intensive information campaigns to inform potential migrants in countries of origin and transit of the risks inherent in illegal immigration and the consequences of denial of refugee status, and also inform them of legal means of entry into the European Union.
The eighth point concerns the European Support Office.
The committee disagreed with the Commission proposal on this.
I think it would be better to provide the Commission with more staff and funds than to set up yet another agency, as I believe this would be more efficient and economical.
The ninth point is that we must demand that Member States do indeed transpose the directives or regulations adopted at European level.
In this regard, a 'table of equivalences' has been proposed - namely one in which Member States set out the measures with which they believe they have transposed the corresponding Community requirements.
The tenth and final point concerns the sharing out of the burden that is afforded by, for example, teams of experts providing support to enable faster completion of procedures in exceptional situations.
Indirectly, the fact of having uniform procedures would also share out the burden to a certain degree, as it would avoid people heading in larger numbers for countries where procedures are lax or based on incorrect information.
This should not be the case.
We have endeavoured to present a catalogue of points highlighting in specific terms how we believe that, in future, help can be provided quickly to genuine refugees to whom refugee status has been granted and, equally, it can be made clear to others that they cannot attain this status.
I should like to express my thanks for the cooperation and support I have received.
Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, I should especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, for the report, which contains a series of very useful recommendations.
Many of these recommendations address the level of ambition that a truly comprehensive common European asylum system should have.
Many of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in this report are addressed in our Green Paper on the future of asylum policy, which I proposed on 6 June and which the Commission has adopted, and on which I intend to launch a broad European debate.
The ultimate objective pursued at European level is thus to establish a level playing field.
Asylum seekers should have access to protection under equivalent conditions in all Member States - that is the first precondition.
The goal pursued in the first stage was to harmonise Member States' legal frameworks on the basis of common minimum standards, but the goal in the second stage should be to achieve both a higher standard and greater equality of protection across the EU, as well as greater solidarity between Member States.
It will be necessary to identify existing gaps and deficits and to pursue further legislative harmonisation while guaranteeing high standards.
For example, models need to be explored for the design of a single procedure for assessing applications for refugee status and for subsidiary protection.
It is also necessary to reflect on the need for fuller harmonisation and clarification of the European rules regarding the reception conditions granted to asylum seekers.
Reflection is also needed on whether the criteria for allocating responsibility currently applicable under the Dublin system should be complemented in order take other factors into account, such as more equitable distribution between Member States on the basis of their capacity to process asylum applications and to offer long-term prospects to recognised refugees.
This is a very important point, raised by a number of Member States, particularly by our Maltese friends, who stressed the importance of integrating the current Dublin regulation.
I am studying this point.
Based on the results of this wide debate and after a public hearing to be held on 18 October with the full involvement of Parliament, I will issue a policy plan at the beginning of 2008.
The policy plan will set out further measures to construct the comprehensive asylum system along with a timeframe for adoption.
I am confident that with the due institutional framework which will fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process - I refer to the codecision procedure - we will be able to match this high level of ambition.
On the specific issues addressed in Mr Pirker's report concerning practical cooperation, there is a need to enhance converge of practice between Member States.
Training is certainly one of the areas where practical cooperation is taking place.
At the moment, the development of a common curriculum is under way.
We will establish a first pilot European-wide portal on the exchange of country of origin information by the end of this year, in a few months' time.
For the time being, this will only connect some of the existing databases and will be accessible to selected national authorities, but my services also intend to carry out a feasibility study on how to provide a better structural support to practical cooperation activities; the idea is to have a European support office.
It should be remembered that the European Refugee Fund can provide, through Community actions, financial support to Member States to implement projects, in cooperation with the United Nations, to improve the quality of their asylum systems.
In the new World Programme for 2007, specific mention is made of this point.
The Commission has also proposed to amend the European Refugee Fund, precisely to provide rapid financial support to those Member States that face particular pressure because of sudden arrivals of migrants at their borders, some of whom are in need of international protection.
In addition, the new budget line 'Preparatory action: Migration management - Solidarity in action', which is the name of the project, will be used to assist Member States faced with particular difficulties.
We will fund it with a supplementary amount of money of about EUR 7 million.
Finally, of course, as the rapporteur has just said, one of our main political objectives is to make a clear distinction between economic migrants on the one hand and true refugees on the other.
Thus, there will be credible European policies for the return of third-country nationals who are staying illegally, in full respect of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
rapporteur on behalf of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has always been committed to setting up a common asylum system by 2010.
The report by Mr Pirker, whom I congratulate for his excellent work, points out the necessity of maintaining this objective.
The purpose of creating a common asylum policy must be the protection of the individual and not the reduction or externalisation of asylum applications.
European policy must be based on the obligation to admit asylum seekers and the principle of non-refoulement, in accordance with the Geneva Convention.
Working out a uniform status, improving the quality of decision-making, single European procedures on compilation and examination, common use of information on countries of origin, and improving cooperation between Member States will, I hope, allow people whose situation requires urgent protection to enter European territory in complete safety and to see their application examined as it should be.
Nonetheless, the need to improve cooperation in relation to information on countries of origin should not be limited to keeping a generalised list of third countries, as the reliability of such a list would be uncertain.
On the contrary, assessment case by case on the basis of the rights of the individual needs to be introduced.
Europe must also share between the different Member States the burdens and responsibilities of its asylum and immigration policy by helping countries such as Malta, which are no longer capable of absorbing further influxes.
Furthermore, I pointed out with concern, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the total absence of gender issues in the European Commission's communication.
Aspects relating to women's rights as well as protection of minors are completely ignored.
The same goes for the rights of homosexuals and transsexuals.
I consider also that gender-based persecutions, that is marital and domestic violence, female genital mutilations, sexual abuse, crimes of honour, rape, forced marriages and crimes resulting from enforcement of Sharia law, must be legally considered as sufficient reason for granting asylum.
The Commission must establish practical criteria for granting asylum or a special humanitarian status for women suffering violence of this kind.
I also highlighted the need to put in place special training for people authorised to admit asylum seekers, in particular women, children and older people, and to provide reception centres suitable for these people.
I am delighted that the rapporteur has taken note of this, although I regret that his report devotes only one paragraph to these concerns relating to gender, which seem to me to be of vital importance's the more so because we can no longer ignore the lack of respect by most reception centres for the basic human rights of the individual.
I realise, however, after listening to the Commissioner, that this is a subject he feels strongly about, for which I thank him, and so I have high hopes.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Pirker and to say to him - although I am sure Mr Weber will do so with greater authority - that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will of course support his report, which is aimed at improving cooperation and the decision-making process in asylum policy.
I wish to congratulate Mr Frattini on his speech and I must tell him that this is an issue that very much reflects the difficulty we are having in making decisions.
In an area without borders, an area of free movement, asylum is perhaps the clearest example of an area in which there needs to be harmonisation between the Member States and the creation of a common system.
The point is that we are working towards 2010 and, if all goes according to plan, we should have a common asylum system up and running by then.
I am aware that this is a tricky issue on which a lowest common denominator, 'race to the bottom', strategy has been adopted, which leaves the way open for differences between Member States and for the continuation of so-called 'asylum shopping'.
I should like to raise three brief points on issues that I feel are essential.
Firstly, I feel it is necessary to create a single EU-wide procedure to ensure that decisions are taken quickly and are duly substantiated and fair.
Secondly, I wish to echo the view expressed by Mr Frattini, that the quality of decisions depends on the quality of information.
It is therefore necessary to deliver the best possible procedure in terms of gathering and exchanging information.
Lastly, I feel it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between the Member States, which also means addressing the issue of solidarity and burden-sharing.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome this report because over recent months we have clearly seen a fall in the overall number of asylum-seekers coming to the European Union from the key asylum-producing countries.
But that number is of course now increasing, partly as a result of Iraq, and the number of people coming to the European Union because of extreme poverty - the people that we see coming to Malta, Lampedusa and so on - is a huge issue for this House and for the European Union.
Because of this, any report which moves towards a better procedure and a better common policy on asylum is welcome.
The compromises which we have had in this report are very welcome and the cooperation from the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, is very welcome also.
What are we trying to achieve in this report?
In referring directly to what Mr Pirker has listed, and to Mr Frattini's speech, we believe that the single procedure is extremely important.
Decision-making with one operation for the assessment of applications granting refugee status and granting access to subsidiary protection is extremely important.
This kind of efficiency in asylum decision-making is vital.
We also believe that the quality of asylum decision-making is extremely poor across the European Union.
To increase the quality of asylum decisions - and I speak from my own experience as a lawyer having dealt with asylum applications - is vital.
We know that, in creating this quality of asylum decision-making, we need open systems with information that can be genuinely assessed: sophisticated information, information which can be cross-referenced.
What we probably do not want to see are databases which are, perhaps, for officials only, but ones that can be examined by outside experts.
Many Member States currently have this quality of decision-making, and it is extremely important.
In terms of the role of the Commission, we also want to see the door kept open to a European agency, because we want to see the Commission's role being full and resourced.
We cannot have it both ways; we cannot have a role for the Commission in the issue of asylum for the European Union and, on the other hand, not pay for it and resource it.
Finally, there will be differences between our parties on the common safe list, but the compromises we have sought to create, I think, are worthy of support in this House.
On Dublin II, we know that there are imperfections in burden sharing, one of the most vital issues in this report, and on the issue of asylum in the European Union.
We need to strive towards making Dublin II and burden sharing a reality.
If this report can move us towards a better common asylum system, then it is worthy of support in this House, and we in the Socialist Group will be supporting this report fully.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the rapporteur's intent is commendable; he has put together an excellent report aimed at rationalising asylum practices and making them more efficient.
Nonetheless, we must continue to work along these lines, not least to correct the legal and practical interpretation of this institution, which, precisely because it is so crucial from a humanitarian point of view, must not be subject to abuse or be confused with other areas and other concerns such as economic migration, which have nothing to do with the inalienable principle of the right of asylum.
Furthermore, for reasons of decency, we cannot allow an institution of such importance to be used by criminal organisations, as was shown recently by the highly significant findings of an investigation carried out by our police in Italy, which routed an extremely dangerous gang active in various criminal sectors and using the very asylum system itself to recruit people to carry out crime.
I am sure that the Commission is deeply concerned about these problems, which we must never tire of highlighting, in order to protect this institution that is so important.
I would also like to point out the need to create reception areas for asylum seekers in safe third countries outside of the European Union, since Dum Bruxelles o Strasburgo consulitur, Saguntum expugnatur [while Brussels or Strasbourg talk, Saguntum falls], in the sense that the landings continue, the assault by criminal organisations continues and, above all, this tragedy of trafficking in human flesh continues, the consequences of which we are all aware of.
We must also be on full alert to ensure that asylum is not granted to members of fundamentalist Islamist organisations.
This does in fact happen and it is often in this way that the threat of Al Qaeda and its presence in Europe increases.
I do not agree, however, that the European Court of Justice should be given greater powers on asylum, thus taking jurisdiction away from Member States.
In particular, I would like to invite the Council to restore to the Court of Justice all of its powers on preliminary rulings.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I am not quite sure how we got from the subject of the need for high standards of protection to al-Qa'ida; I will try to concentrate on the report rather than what is not in it.
My group would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report, even though, on some compromises, I think all of us could feel the eggshells cracking as we moved towards agreement.
As has already been said, the report covers a number of important points: the high standards we expect, the primacy of protection, the issue of raising the quality of decision-making, the availability of sound country information to all those involved in the process, effective staff training, the use of the quality initiative (recently seen in the UK, which certainly needed some help) and the involvement of the UNHCR.
All these points are necessary, because the people making decisions are deciding on what are matters of life and death for many of the people they see.
We welcome the recognition of the need for a single procedure in all Member States and find it very interesting that we are talking about reviewing the role of the Court of Justice this week.
This might be a good time to pass that point on to the Council.
We are also looking forward to the debate on Dublin II, although our group will support Amendment 17 on that.
We agree that the Commission lacks sufficient resources to monitor effectively the implementation and quality of the common asylum policy.
We hope that our political groups will take up that message when looking at the budget and decisions in that area.
We know that there is disagreement on the Support Office, but, like the Socialists, we would welcome the opportunity to hear the Commission to spell out its intentions in that regard in order to see whether we want to move ahead with that proposal.
We have tabled no amendments to this report, but we shall support the constructive amendments relating to the issue of safe third countries.
However, there is no way that we can support some of the amendments.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 20 June, is World Refugee Day, which makes this debate particularly fitting.
There is however great hypocrisy in our debate, as just two days ago this Parliament decided to remove the issue of Iraqi refugees from the list of urgent matters.
This is an extremely important issue, given that we are talking about over four million people fleeing an infamous and illegal war.
We should in fact be discussing this matter and the difficulties that the European Union has in receiving these refugees, the majority of whom are received outside of the European Union, and considering how these refugees are often received in our territory.
A European Parliament delegation recently visited Samo and noted that within the detention centre on that island - a horrifying place - there were Iraqi, Palestinian, Lebanese and Afghan asylum seekers, all people from war zones.
I therefore believe that we must think long and hard about the need to guarantee respect for the right of asylum, in order to prevent that which has unfortunately occurred frequently in Europe in recent years, namely mass expulsions and failure to honour the right of non-refoulement.
We have witnessed too many symbolic cases; the fact is that over the last few years migratory pressure has increased and successful applications for asylum in Europe have decreased.
I believe that this is indicative of a problem that we have within the European Union.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I could not agree more with the 10-point emergency plan by Mr Pirker, whom I should like to warmly congratulate on this.
Last week, we were again shocked by the fact that people are drowning on their way to Europe.
Eleven people drowned near Lampedusa.
Today's Dutch newspaper, Trouw, features the harrowing account of Somali refugees who tried to reach Yemen under adverse conditions.
We should therefore try to set up a better asylum procedure and at the same time take measures to distinguish asylum seekers from illegal immigrants as a matter of relevant urgency.
Whilst achieving better asylum policy thanks to practical cooperation may sound like a very good idea, it is unrealistic.
Practical cooperation is not enough.
We also need the political will to take the necessary steps.
When I read the Dutch newspapers about the Justice Ministers' meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday of last week, I get the impression that this political will is absent, because the ongoing issues in the discussion are the real deployment of people and equipment.
While we cannot agree on the common Frontex deployment, a common admission policy for refugees from Iraq, for example, is unlikely.
Without a common position on third country security, European official reports cannot be compiled, which is, after all, a precondition for moving harmonised asylum policy forward.
I anticipate major problems surrounding the implementation of the plan to compile a list of safe countries of origin.
Which sources are reliable?
Can the sources of information from countries that are unsafe be made public?
After all, it is highly dangerous to collect evidence against regimes in the grip of a dictatorship.
This is a double-edged sword though.
A list of safe countries includes countries with which we can forge trade relations, but if a country does not feature on the list of safe countries, refugees should be welcome.
It is then necessary to suspend trade relations with unsafe countries in order to promote human rights.
This is where big problems will arise.
It is unlikely that former French or British colonies that are currently in the grip of a brutal regime will be excluded from relations with the European Union.
I should like to hear from Commissioner Frattini how he will avert this problem.
In addition, harmonised asylum policy benefits from clarity.
Mr Catania has tabled an amendment in which he pleads in favour of open reception centres for asylum seekers and other immigrants.
In my country, asylum seekers stay in open asylum seeker centres.
Illegals are brought to closed centres, with good reason.
It strikes me as unwise to set up open reception camps on the Union's external borders.
Support for asylum policy is bound to be undermined if people can move around freely without any valid documents.
If the European Union seeks to formulate a charitable and fair asylum policy, there must be a political will to back this up.
I call on the Council and Commission to display this will in a bid to prevent new victims.
(SK) First of all, I too would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for drafting the report on this serious topic.
I welcome the strengthening of practical cooperation between Member States in view of the need for solidarity in dealing with problems which Member States without internal borders cannot address effectively.
I concur with his view that decisions on granting refugee status should be taken more quickly, more fairly, and more predictably, which in itself is the ultimate objective of introducing a common European asylum system.
As a rapporteur expressing an opinion on EU strategy in the area of children's rights, and specifically on the situation of children in developing countries, I deal with the issues of the children of refugees, children of immigrants without nationality and internally displaced children.
Many children of refugees and children seeking asylum are treated like adults, which leaves behind a lasting trauma.
Children suffer in refugee camps, where they very often become victims of neglect, violence, abuse, intolerance and inadequate legal protection.
Immigrants, refugees and displaced children account for 5% of all asylum seekers.
This suggests that on their arrival in the country, such children should be assigned well-trained legal representatives who will be in a position to best represent their interests.
Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Pirker for his excellent report and I am also glad to hear that the Commission supports the call of my country, Malta, for a fairer share of responsibility, even with respect to the Dublin Regulation.
In fact, any review of the Dublin Regulation must surely take into account the unintended effects of the current rules, whereby countries such as mine are being obliged to carry a disproportionate responsibility simply because they are border Member States.
To establish a fairer division of responsibility we need to ensure that solidarity is truly rendered meaningful.
So far, it has to be said that in EU policymaking 'solidarity' has always meant granting financial assistance.
Now this is no longer sufficient. We need to go beyond that.
A true meaning of solidarity must also mean something beyond throwing money at the problem; beyond merely writing a cheque.
It must also mean sharing the burden, sharing the responsibility.
It must also mean opening up our borders to share with border Member States the responsibility of dealing with asylum seekers and others who make it often perilously, but alas illegally, to EU territory.
So in reviewing Dublin, I agree with the report that we need a fairer share of the burden.
Finally, one issue regarding timing: we are discussing the establishment of a common asylum system by 2010. However, we all know that a common asylum system is not needed in 2010.
It is urgently needed today. So we should ask ourselves, how many lives will be lost before 2010?
How many things will go wrong before Member States rise above their national egotism and get there?
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Pirker for a constructive report.
Following the discussions in the committee, the feeling is that we can support it.
Asylum policy is an area that EU citizens expect us to deal with together, because the problem concerned is a cross-border one.
Here in plenary and in the committee we have often discussed the current situation in the Mediterranean, which we MEPs have still not succeeded in resolving.
It is scandalous that people are still dying there every day.
There are both immigrants and asylum seekers in the group I come from.
Since the start of the war in Iraq, my own country of Sweden has welcomed more refugees - approximately 10 000 - than any other country in the whole of the EU, and we are not even one of the larger EU countries.
As Mr Pirker said, we must share the burden.
I therefore believe that we cannot just make declarations and pledges that we do not fulfil.
Instead, we must, as is proposed in the report, not only speed up our procedures for handling cases and make a considerable investment in exchanging and gathering information but also have the courage to say that we believe in an open Europe in the future.
Human trafficking must be brought to an end.
There must be an end to the trafficking of women and children led into prostitution and the sex industry.
It must no longer be possible to provide the EU with cheap labour whenever employers need it, only then to send the workers back home when the jobs concerned have been completed.
These are difficult issues, but we have an obligation to solve the problems if we are serious about introducing a common asylum procedure in 2010.
For me - coming as I do from Sweden, which has always been generous in welcoming refugees - it is still absolutely crucial for us to talk in terms of an inventory of third countries, but every refugee's case must still always be examined individually.
Otherwise, many refugees will continue to be discriminated against because they belong to a minority or because of their gender, background or sexual orientation or because they are fleeing a war where they perhaps belonged to the group that is not going to win.
I hope that this report means that we are now taking the next step and that all the EU countries and we MEPs will together assume responsibility not only for solving these urgent problems but also for finding long-term solutions.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the right to asylum is universal, and that is why we need a European response - which, to some degree, we have already given.
The Commission proposals are very good, and I should like to place on the record officially here that we can be very proud of our Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, who is doing a very good job.
The proposals our rapporteur, my colleague Mr Pirker, has presented are excellent.
Anyone managing to achieve support across the group divide for such a difficult issue has clearly done an excellent job, and I should like to thank the rapporteur for this.
Even though none of its representatives is present, I should like to thank the Council.
This evening would not have been possible, and we could not have taken all these decisions, if we had not had an active German Council Presidency in recent months.
Therefore, I should simply like to say 'thank you'.
Judging by the lateness of the hour, the politicians working on home-affairs policy are the hard-working ones: we are still at work.
Therefore, I should like to express my sincere thanks, and refrain from using up my full speaking time so that we can go home earlier.
(PL) Mr President, it is very important, in terms of cooperation and improving the quality of decision-making process within the framework of the common asylum system, to create greater flexibility in the use of the European Refugee Fund.
The rapporteur, whom I would like to thank for his excellent report, refers to this problem in a number of the points he raises.
Last year, we finished work on the legal basis for the forthcoming version of the Refugee Fund for the years 2008-2013.
At the time, we already supported the additional proposal put forward by the Commission during the course of this work.
The Commission suggested that we should change the existing operating principles of the Fund and aim its activities more at areas such as harmonising practical cooperation between the Member States, providing aid in the event of pressure resulting from a particularly large influx of immigrants, as well as intra-Union migration and regional protection programmes in third countries.
This meant increasing spending on Community action from 7% to 10%, making the procedures for providing financial aid to countries experiencing sudden mass influx of asylum seekers more flexible, and allocating specific amounts within the distribution chain.
These sums vary from three to five thousand euros per person for intra-Union transfers and within the framework of regional protection programmes.
Special financial incentives have been introduced to provide aid to those particularly affected, namely children, those in need of medical aid or women.
Therefore, the Commission and Member States need to make effective use of the Fund.
We are waiting for guidelines, action plans and specific results in relation to the use of the Refugee Fund, which will significantly improve the situation of refugees in Europe.
I would like to once again thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

Consumer confidence in the digital environment (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs RoithovÃ¡ on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on consumer confidence in the digital environment.
rapporteur. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that, after a year's work, I and the shadow rapporteurs can now present to you the complete report on consumer confidence in the digital environment.
With this report Parliament is sending out a strong political plea to the Commission and the Member States to update the conditions for online business and to take steps to enhance consumer confidence as regards the most recent trends in the digital environment.
Businesses and consumers are waiting for unequivocal, simple, enforceable rules that will enhance online business culture in the European market.
The report is merely the start of the whole process.
I am aware that implementing it would involve a considerable amount of work for the Commission, which is already limited in terms of financial and human resources
Public hearings and studies have revealed some telling facts, to which we cannot turn a blind eye.
Just 6% of consumers buy online from suppliers in other Member States. One third do not receive the goods or services they order on account of their nationality, their country of residence or the country in which their payment card was issued.
Some modern electronic services providing digital content are only available to customers in the old EU-15.
Users are bound by any number of digital contracts that they have simply clicked on and have not read.
They are therefore unaware that these contracts may contain a number of unfair and misleading contractual arrangements.
We have discovered that not even legal experts are capable of deciphering the exact content of digital contracts, for example, licensing arrangements with the end user.
Small businesses are unaware of their obligations in e-commerce and have difficulty in making their way around 27 different legal systems.
Consumers do not know their Internet rights, and indeed, there is no document summarising these rights.
Users are not sure what they can and cannot do with the digital content they have purchased.
They are afraid of resolving claims in another country and do not know about counterfeit medicines sold on the Internet.
We therefore propose the following: a worldwide campaign to be launched by the Commission to highlight the dangers of counterfeit medicines; the creation of a Europe-wide early-warning system to combat fraudulent activities on the Internet; and an extension to the scope of contracts on which bans are to be imposed due to unfair contractual arrangements.
The principle of the single market is less restriction and more opportunity.
Paradoxically, however, it is as though this principle did not apply to the electronic environment, despite the cross-border opportunities.
I would venture to say that 27 separate national markets are hampering the development of the information society in Europe, which lags behind that of the USA and Asia.
If we are to demolish the artificial or natural obstacles to e-commerce we will have to overcome the fragmented rules of the Member States.
This will be possible in the long term if the political will is there to achieve complete harmonisation.
Such a dynamic sector, however, calls for a quicker and more flexible solution.
This is why in the report I opted for coordinated work on voluntary standards, or rather super-standards, for example an optional standardised contract geared towards cross-border e-commerce. The content must be agreed upon by business and consumer organisations, in which the Commission will have a vital role to play in terms of coordination.
Holders of the European trustmark for cross-border e-commerce must adhere to these standards.
Consumer organisations welcome the implementation of the trustmark and are committed to revealing and disclosing any misuse, with the help of existing technical and legal resources.
