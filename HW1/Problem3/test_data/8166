There have been deep misunderstandings over the role of vaccination and the Commission's own position on this issue.
I do not propose to repeat today what I have already said on this matter.
My remarks now are therefore confined to future policy.
The Commission remains of the view that prophylactic vaccination of the entire susceptible livestock population or even particular species is not advisable for sound scientific, technical and economic reasons.
The situation in the EU cannot be compared with the endemic FMD situation in South America or elsewhere. FMD is not endemic in the EU, and prophylactic vaccination is not appropriate in the EU.
The Commission takes the view that emergency vaccination should, however, be moved to the forefront of the response mechanism in the event of future outbreaks.
The means are now available to detect infection in a vaccinated population and the Commission - now supported by the OIE - actively pursues further improvement of these tests.
The forthcoming Commission proposal for a Council directive on FMD will reflect this position on emergency vaccination in line with the recent modifications made to the FMD chapter in the animal health code.
But we must not be under any illusions: vaccination is not a miracle cure to solve all our problems.
While it must play a much more important future role, it cannot serve as an excuse to weaken our efforts to keep FMD out of the EU, nor can it fully obviate the need for difficult measures in the event of future outbreaks.
I will now turn to contingency planning.
There are many lessons to be learned from the events of last year, but they are not necessarily new.
The fact remains that success in avoiding future outbreaks - or eradicating them if they do occur - will depend on well prepared contingency plans, the main elements of which I outlined to the committee last September.
Contingency plans must be regularly reviewed, updated and tested by periodic simulation exercises.
The lessons of the outbreak of last year are virtually identical to those of similar outbreaks in the past.
The challenge is to act on these lessons.
Delayed by the outbreak last year, my services have now completed the inspections of implementation of the approved contingency plans and will continue to monitor the implementation of a whole package of measures adopted at Community level for the prevention and control of major epidemic diseases.
In this regard, let me emphasise that I reject the criticism of the Commission at paragraph 54 of your report relating to Commission inspections of contingency plans in Member States.
The Food and Veterinary Office will continue to play a decisive role in this process of review and the Commission will ensure that it can deliver the required services, even in an enlarged Union, within the reserves allocated by the budgetary authority.
I should like to mention the sensitive issue of compensation for disease-related expenditure incurred by Member States.
My services have carried out audits in the UK and the other Member States concerned.
Payments to the Member States will be in conformity with the results of these audits.
Moreover, the European Court of Auditors is preparing a separate report on the financial aspects of the outbreak.
I have taken note of your request for harmonisation of the different compensation schemes applied in Member States.
I should recall, however, that the Commission is bound to act on the basis of Council Decision 90/424.
The Commission has now finalised the terms of reference for an external review of the current compensation schemes and the elaboration of possible solutions for the future.
But we should not be under any illusion that veterinary fund compensation should be made available to all indirectly affected members of the rural community.
To conclude, may I praise once again the valuable role played by your committee as regards its contribution to the Commission's approach to FMD.
Much work remains to be done, and the Commission's proposal for a new directive on FMD will reach Parliament very soon.
I trust that the assessment of our proposal by Parliament will benefit from the expertise acquired during the work of the temporary committee.
Mr President, firstly I should like to thank Mr Byrne for his statement and all those involved in drawing up this report.
When I first brought it to the attention of Parliament, I had no idea that it was going to be the success that it has been.
It has been a positive achievement, not just for the people of the United Kingdom, and not just for the people of the European Union, but also for the European Parliament.
There were many cases, as we travelled across the European Union in our quest to find out what had happened, where people said 'thank goodness you are organising a public inquiry'.
This is the only true public inquiry into foot and mouth.
It gave the general public an opportunity to voice its opinion.
That is what it was about and what I had hoped to achieve.
I shall read from a letter we received from the National Foot and Mouth Association.
'May it suffice to say that without this report, many would not have been able to deal with the epidemic and its effects.'
The epidemic had a catastrophic effect on people's lives right across the European Union, not just those in the agricultural business, but many people in the whole of the rural community.
At this point I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, the Chairman, and the Commission which helped us tremendously in the Foot and Mouth Subcommittee, working with us every single day.
I would also like to thank those people who submitted evidence to the Foot and Mouth Subcommittee.
We covered businesses right across the European Union.
There were people from the United States and many other countries.
On one occasion some of my colleagues were sitting there almost with tears in their eyes while listening to the evidence being given.
One lady summed it up when she said 'they have taken away our dreams'.
That was a direct reference to the British Government.
This must never happen again.
This is why this temporary committee was set up.
Yes, the report has been critical of the British Government and, yes, it has attacked it on many aspects, but if the government made mistakes we, as a committee, had to look into it.
The report would have been wrong if it had not looked into it and then made a judgement because the whole principle of the inquiry was that we needed to know what had gone wrong - and things had gone wrong - and then put forward proposals.
We needed to see how we could put in amendments to the proposals that Mr Byrne is going to bring out.
I look forward with great interest to what Mr Byrne will say.
I have one criticism of what he has just said - and here we will have to agree to disagree.
In the United Kingdom, we still only have two dogs - in fact they are still in training - to check imports, compared with the 3 000 people in the United States to cover illegal imports.
Mr Byrne said that he was against any proposal that would control imports from countries where FMD is endemic.
I would say to him that we still do not know where this outbreak originated.
We do not know exactly how it was brought into the United Kingdom.
One thing we found out was that the US, Australia and New Zealand still do not have foot and mouth and they control their imports wholly.
I will sum up by saying that we need to change legislation, but we need to change attitudes - welfare, transport, imports.
I know the Commission values the findings of this report and I look forward with great interest to its own report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have come together today having completed several months of work, hearings, visits on the ground, meetings with experts, farmers, with men and women, in fact, with all those who have had first-hand experience of the foot and mouth crisis, who have been deeply affected by it and, who above all, never want it to happen again.
This was very much the aim of our work: understand what happened, analyse events from every angle - economic, social and psychological - in order to learn lessons from this and minimise the risks and the effects of this type of disease in the future.
Some would have liked the main aim of the temporary committee's work to be to seek out the guilty party or parties, which is an understandable reaction when one is desperate and appalled by what one is going through.
This, however, was not the specific aim of our committee or the reason why it had been set up.
Can we accept the fact that, in a report that is intended to be the product of the most objective investigation possible, there are some very subjective elements and some irrational guesswork?
I think not.
The very credibility of our work as parliamentarians depends on this and that is why our group tabled a number of amendments designed to restore balance to the report.
Apart from a few petty political digressions, we must acknowledge that our work has been very rewarding and worthwhile, the large number of direct contacts enabling us to gain a better understanding of the problems of managing the crisis and its countless consequences.
We must point out that the epidemic was a traumatic experience for tens of thousands of people, particularly because the memories that we may have of foot and mouth disease are of an epidemic which is undeniably serious, but not to the point of destroying entire regions and leading to the slaughter of millions of animals that individuals had put so much effort into feeding and caring.
Having succumbed to new rearing methods and more movement of animals, we were unable to cope with this crisis and respond as we did 50 years ago when we isolated infected herds, since the number of infections was already too great by the time the epidemic was identified.
Of course, with hindsight, we can always say 'We should have done this or that', but we must not forget that, at the time, we were facing a crisis and that solutions had to be found urgently in tandem with institutions, local communities and populations who were unprepared for this type of situation.
Even experts believe that this crisis would have been of the same tragic proportions had it broken out in any other European country.
The unfortunate experience of the United Kingdom has enabled other Member States to be more vigilant and better prepared to deal with the disease.
What do we do now?
What decisions must the European Union take?
The rapporteur, several of my fellow Members and the Commissioner have just explained.
First of all, prevention is essential, and this prevention involves providing better information, on-going training of farmers - who were not always able to identify the disease early enough - animal traceability and more animal health professionals who can be called up more easily.
Vigilance within Europe's borders is essential, but we must also increase our controls on imports, both at land borders and at ports and airports.
We are at the heart of global trade and people are travelling more and more, and so we must take into account this international dimension.
We must also provide solutions in a crisis by anticipating responses with more appropriate emergency plans, by encouraging emergency vaccinations wherever possible, whilst remembering that slaughter is the only possible outcome when livestock has been infected.
The final comment I would add is that research is an area which we are entitled to expect to provide us with some results, on the condition that we provide it with the resources.
To sum up, I would like to reiterate, in the wake of the maritime disasters which have struck Europe once again, that our reports, whilst full of good intentions, are not worth a great deal if the European Union and the Member States do not shoulder their full responsibilities by swiftly implementing the recommendations that we make in this Chamber.
We now await the report on which the Commission is currently working and hope that it will support the conclusions of our temporary committee.
Lastly, I would like to thank and to congratulate the rapporteur, the chairman, and all the Members who contributed to the report, as well as the committee and all the staff involved in this work.
About a year ago Mr Sturdy put to me the idea of setting up a committee to investigate the recent foot and mouth disease crisis.
I immediately agreed to the suggestion and am still happy that the lists of signatures that subsequently circulated in Parliament included the names of two members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and two members of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
I continue to believe that it was a good initiative.
Rarely in my career as an MEP have I experienced the degree of interest awakened throughout Europe by this committee.
Wherever we went, in the United Kingdom or in the Netherlands, the interest was overwhelming, and to my mind it benefited the European Parliament itself.
I should also like to express my appreciation to Mrs Redondo as chairman, for her competent leadership, and to Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, who was an excellent spokesman for the committee's work, not only in his report but also in his tactful contributions during the many meetings.
What have been the high points for the ELDR Group over the past year?
Firstly: prevention is better than cure, and we strongly support the call for better border controls.
If we compare the situation in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, etc? with that in Europe, we find that controls on the external borders of Europe are abominable.
If I arrive at an airport there are scarcely any checks on my luggage, in complete contrast to the situation in other continents.
I consider it essential that such measures should also be applied in Europe.
There has also been much discussion about whether or not to re-introduce prophylactic vaccination.
I opposed this.
None of the experts we consulted was in favour.
Generally speaking, one cannot assume that a single vaccine exists that will offer protection against the hundred or so different foot and mouth disease strains that are found.
It is therefore an illusion to think that there will never be another outbreak.
I am, though, strongly in favour of emergency vaccination from the very beginning and at the same time of the consumption of the products of perfectly healthy animals locally or in the European Union.
It is impossible to explain to the public why healthy animals should be destroyed and I am glad that the Commission has announced that it is to change policy on this matter.
As regards financing: the Commission has been a little parsimonious.
Agenda 2000 assigns an annual amount of EUR 41 million for the combating of infectious animal diseases.
The foot and mouth crisis cost almost a billion.
We were fortunate in that the euro exchange rate was rather low and that there were surpluses in the agriculture budget, but that cannot of course continue indefinitely.
It would therefore be good if the Commission were to reflect on insurance systems.
And while we are talking about the Commission: we have heard appreciation from all sides for the Commission's role in the foot and mouth crisis.
Having said this, I must mention a down side: even before the temporary committee was set up, the ELDR Group had submitted two amendments to the 2002 budget.
One on research into marker vaccines and one on insurance systems, specifically to counter the competitive distortions in Europe, whereby farmers in one country have to pay for the outbreak of infectious animal diseases, and in another country they do not.
As far as I know, not a single contract has yet been signed, despite the fact that today is 17 December and that I had pointed out to all the Commission services back at the beginning of the year that the budgetary authority had already given its approval.
That is the only jarring note I have to sound in this speech.
Mr President, as a member of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, I have a very high opinion of its final report, which Parliament is to discuss today.
The rapporteur's drafting has made the final report fair and a polished piece of work.
The advice given by experts to the many hearings was characterised by a consensus that the progress of this disease was to be resisted.
Taking into consideration the fact that foot and mouth disease is present all over the world, continuing globalisation and deregulation, that is to say, the increase in worldwide trade, which is already very extensive, and in passenger traffic, mean that the European Union has to reckon with a growing danger of foot and mouth disease being introduced from infected areas.
Whereas, formerly, three types of FMD were present across Europe, and successfully combated by means of ring-vaccination, Europe now faces the danger of the disease being imported from a wide variety of sources.
The problem here is that - much as with influenza - vaccination only works if the vaccination is derived largely from the same strain as the disease.
There is little point in prophylactic vaccination against virus strains, as it is impossible to know in advance which actual FMD virus is being brought in.
What does make sense, on the contrary, is what is advocated in the report - the carrying-out of emergency vaccination in the event of an epidemic, which of course presupposes that it is possible to ascertain rapidly the actual strain of the disease involved.
This position is a controversial one, but, in the absence of effective action against epidemics in the areas from which they come, and given the current state of research, I can see no alternative and no other option.
I would emphasise that emergency vaccination is meant to help prevent foot and mouth disease from spreading.
It is for that reason that my group has tabled a motion to the effect that a worldwide strategy to combat foot and mouth disease should be worked out among the FAO countries.
What we demand of a policy came to us loud and clear in the many conversations we had with cattle farmers, with representatives of local authorities and associations, and with members of the public who were deeply unsettled and, in ethical terms, outraged.
Associated with this is the necessity of using suitable measures to at last halt the burgeoning live animal transports across Europe.
This is far from being only an animal protection issue; it is about preventing diseases.
There are circumstances under which the Community must involve itself in national preventive strategies, as each EU country belongs to the common internal market and can maintain important relationships with third countries.
All the Member States must be able to call upon the services of adequately qualified veterinary personnel in the prevention and treatment of animal diseases.
Further scientific investigation is needed into issues associated with emergency vaccination against FMD and the continued use of inoculated animals.
It is not possible to justify sending ten million animals to what is, at the end of the day, a senseless death, if ethically and economically preferable procedures are in the offing.
My fifth point is that I expect the Commission to come up with proposals for better legal protection for the affected parties in order to compensate for the great financial losses and resultant damage in the regions.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I would like great public awareness of the review of the common agricultural policy, and not only in the most arduous, and bleakest, times of crisis.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which is extremely important.
It is vital that Parliament gives a very strong signal that vaccination should be a tool of first resort in any future outbreak.
I am very glad that our committee has come to that conclusion.
I am also glad that we support a change in the law so that there is no automatic incentive to slaughter rather than to vaccinate.
We recognise that in Britain over ten million animals were slaughtered - many unnecessarily - because of the overriding priority that was given to the narrow economic goal of regaining export status as quickly as possible.
It is right and proper that we make constructive proposals for the future handling of foot and mouth outbreaks.
However, it is also right - where it is called for - that we are strongly critical of the past handling of foot and mouth outbreaks.
I, therefore, disagree with the rapporteur that it is inappropriate and unjustified to criticise the UK Government.
Such criticism reflects the evidence we heard, and if we do not learn from the past, there is no guarantee of any better action in the future.
For that reason, I am saddened by attempts from the British Government to water down this report, to rewrite history and effectively to whitewash the past.
Amendments by the PSE Group follow closely the briefing that all UK MEPs have received from the British Government, that argues, for example, that there is no evidence for allegations of violations of animal welfare.
That is untrue.
I would remind them of evidence given by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to the National Audit Office inquiry, which says: 'In many cases there was very good circumstantial evidence that an offence had been committed.'
The government says that a veterinary inspector worked closely at every slaughter.
In fact there was often one vet supervising ten slaughters simultaneously - an impossible thing to do.
The government denies that farmers were intimidated in connection with the culls and it asks for evidence.
We have evidence in plenty.
I would remind them that the committee went to Knowstone in Devon precisely to gather that kind of information.
They allege that the lessons learnt in the inquiry show that the contiguous cull was effective in curbing the disease - again, untrue.
The National Audit Office demonstrated that the epidemic had already peaked before the contiguous cull policies could have had any effect.
They allege that the firebreak or pre-emptive culling was legal - again, not true.
It is made very clear in the UK's new contingency plan that firebreak or pre-emptive culling requires 'the passage of the new animal health bill'.
That bill had not been passed last year and, therefore, such provision did not exist for legally enforceable mandatory firebreak culls.
People would have a lot more respect for this government if it could just bring itself to admit that it got things wrong.
It matters, because for as long as it does not admit that, then there can be no guarantee that in the event of another outbreak the government will not act in the same way again.
I hope that our report is one step in the process of ensuring that such devastation can never be allowed to happen again in the United Kingdom or anywhere in the European Union.
Mr President, the final report before us today, which was adopted unanimously by the temporary committee, represents the fruits of a most thorough investigation and consultation process, including numerous public hearings and visits to affected areas.
Since I have lived all of my life in the countryside and have been actively involved in farming and the politics of farming, I fully sympathise with those farmers and their families who were devastated by the outbreak.
We in Ireland were spared the worst because of our geographical location and, in no small measure, because of the extreme exemplary precautions taken by the Irish authorities - a fact referred to in today's report.
There are many lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the outbreak.
The rapporteur has done an excellent job in highlighting these and in showing how to avoid the mistakes of the past.
I am pleased that the Commission has been most cooperative with the temporary committee throughout the period of its work.
I seriously hope that the committee's final recommendations will be fully reflected in the forthcoming legislative proposal.
In particular, I would urge that close attention be paid to those areas where resource gaps have been identified.
I await with interest the evaluation report by the Commission as to whether the Food and Veterinary Office in Ireland has the right staff and infrastructure to enable it to carry out its duties effectively in the long term.
In conclusion, I sincerely hope that this lengthy exercise will bring about some very tangible results.
We have an array of legislative measures which should go a long way to preventing future outbreaks and, more importantly, to ensuring that any such outbreak does not reach the proportions witnessed last year.
The Member States, as well as the Commission, have clear responsibilities in this area.
Legislation on catering waste, animal transport, animal welfare, surveillance and disease control must be properly implemented and monitored.
I fully support measures leading to a ban on all meat imports from non-EU countries where foot and mouth is endemic and likewise support stricter controls on illegal meat imports.
Mr President, whether it is a jumbo jet crash in an isolated Scottish village, a tanker wreck on an ecologically sensitive coastline, a terrorist bombing or a major civil disorder, the effectiveness of a response depends almost entirely on advance planning.
The same applies to a major epidemic of a commercially important animal disease such as foot and mouth.
In this context, however, the Commission had assumed statutory responsibility for dictating the nature of planning undertaken by Member States - the so-called contingency planning.
It should also have monitored its adequacy.
Therefore, notwithstanding the obvious and manifest failing of the British authorities in this respect, clearly the Commission's performance was disastrous.
Rightly, the temporary committee had identified this lamentable lack of diligence on the part of the Commission.
Yet what is missing from this report is any indication of why the Commission failed so manifestly in its duty.
I rather regret therefore that the temporary committee has chosen to draw attention to, and I quote, 'the high quality of the Commission's work in controlling the crisis... stressed by the national veterinary authorities of Member States concerned'.
I would suggest therefore that, before leaping into the usual role of telling everyone else what is going wrong, the Commission this time spends its time examining why, when the chips were down, it performed so badly.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was essential that we learned from the foot and mouth crisis which struck the United Kingdom in 2001, because it reached such unprecedented levels in the UK, as a result, in particular, of mistakes - on the part of the British Government as well as the Commission - in the area of contingency planning, because it posed such a serious threat to other European countries and, lastly, because it gave us a terrifying reminder of how quickly this disease can break out, how fast it can spread and of the damaging economic and psychological consequences that it can have.
Our committee has, on the whole, done a good job.
The Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler report particularly emphasises, and this is a crucial point, that the sheer size and specialisation of herds, the livestock density in certain regions, the closure of local abattoirs and the astonishing increase in the transport of live animals are factors which, in the absence of prophylactic vaccination, enable the epidemic to spread like wildfire.
When we come to examine the future agricultural policy guidelines, we must remember this, in order to ensure that we encourage farming that is evenly spread throughout the countryside and that we refuse to encourage regions to specialise to a major degree in high-density holdings.
It is therefore clear, for example, that the withdrawal of milk quotas - which the European Commission appears to favour - might very soon lead to the end of milk herds in areas that have natural handicaps, such as mountainous or rainy areas, and the increase of livestock density in plains.
We must therefore ensure that we maintain a network of family-run farms of a manageable size; this is the best possible way to prevent foot and mouth disease.
Our temporary committee was right to recommend emergency vaccination as the best way to combat the epidemic, since this avoids the mass slaughter which, understandably, caused such great public outcry and was so distressing for farmers.
When hundreds of millions of people are starving, it is unacceptable to destroy the meat of millions of healthy animals, which is what happened in 2001.
With emergency vaccination, a pen will be set up near the source of the epidemic where the animals will be vaccinated, animals which could then potentially be destroyed and used for consumption without the pressure of an emergency situation.
On this point, however, I regret the fact that the Commission did not make bolder proposals.
With the progress made in vaccinations - we now have vaccinations with a broader spectrum, longer-lasting vaccinations and marker vaccinations which make it possible to distinguish vaccinated animals from infected animals - it is now possible to give Member States the freedom to authorise or even make compulsory prophylactic vaccination, in other words preventative vaccination, as applied before 1992, where the risks of epidemics are the highest.
This possibility should be left to the discretion of the Member States, which are best placed to assess the consequences of specific risks for their livestock.
I also regret that the report does not call more clearly into question the current framework, laid down by the International Office of Epizootics, the rules of which are obviously too rigid, too restrictive and too dogmatic as far as the conditions for granting 'FMD-free area' status are concerned.
It is obvious that they are excessively in favour of New World countries, which have a large amount of open space, where the land is less densely populated and which, therefore, face less of a risk of a disease spreading.
It is an absolute necessity that these rules are developed.
Mr President, we are now destined to live under the constant threat of further outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, as new strains are constantly coming to the fore.
This is especially true of Europe, which is surrounded by countries where foot and mouth is endemic.
This is particularly true of Turkey, which represents a constant danger, and the rest of the Middle East and North Africa too.
There have also been a number of outbreaks in Asia and Latin America.
The globalisation of the live animal trade can therefore only encourage and accentuate the globalisation of diseases and viruses.
This explains why short journeys are preferable, why a certain inappropriate form of extreme specialisation which increases animal transport over long distances must be rejected, why rearing and fattening on the same farm premises is preferred and why slaughter must be carried out in the producing region. These methods are dictated by common sense and are the best possible way to prevent the development of new diseases.
We must remember this, Mr President, Commissioner, when we come to debate the future CAP, if we want to avoid a repeat of the nightmare of 2001.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is now a year since the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease began its investigations in order to provide solutions and make proposals for the future in relation to this problem which, as well as causing serious economic damage to the European cattle sector, caused significant moral damage to all cattle breeders and had a great impact on society in general.
We all remember the great number of animals which had to be culled following the outbreak last year which seriously affected the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
And the main task of this committee was to prevent situations such as that caused by this disease from reoccurring in Europe.
During this year of intense work, the committee has listened to the opinions of dozens of experts in all fields, from economic to veterinary, dealing with logistical and political aspects, Community and international legislation, as well as tangential aspects such as tourism, goods transport, emotional aspects, etc.
Many of the people invited to the committee occupied very important posts during the management of the last outbreak of the disease.
But the committee also gave the owners of farms affected and the local authorities and associations in these areas the opportunity to express their opinions during the various visits organised both to the United Kingdom and to the Netherlands.
Furthermore, as chairperson of this committee, I have held several meetings on this disease, together with the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, with experts and top officials from non-Community countries, such as Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil.
The fruit of all this work is the report being presented today for the vote of this House.
The report produced by Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler has achieved a broad consensus amongst all the political groups and we hope that, in the same way, the other Members of this House will find sufficient points of agreement to approve it by a majority without substantial changes, with the approval of some of the amendments presented.
One of the essential aspects included in the final report of the committee I chair is emergency vaccination, which is considered to be an essential method for controlling any future outbreak of the disease.
The current policy of the European Union - to quell outbreaks of this disease by culling the cattle of the farms in which any infected animal has been detected and that of neighbouring farms where there is a likelihood of contagion - cannot continue in the current form.
The policy of emergency vaccination must be part of a strategy which allows animals to live.
The current policy of not vaccinating prioritises the political and commercial aspects and this is something that must change on an international level, taking the approach initiated by the International Office of Epizootic Diseases and the FAO.
The future policy must also take account of the social and psychological impact of an epidemic of foot and mouth disease on the public and must not ignore the consequences it causes in all sectors, such as tourism, commerce, social aspects and emotional aspects.
In its report, this temporary committee advocates emergency vaccination and not preventive vaccinations, since, ladies and gentlemen, these could be considered as a backwards step in the policy of eradication for the scientific, technical, economic and commercial reasons which both we and the Commissioner have expressed.
Ladies and gentlemen, another of the most important aspects of the work of this committee relates to the control of imports.
The European Parliament must insist on a policy on meat imports which imposes zero tolerance in order to guarantee that not a single kilogram of unexamined meat originating from a third country enters the European Union.
This House should insist on this issue and must remind the Commission that it cannot ignore the problem of illegal imports.
The great food crises are always based on non-compliances with Community legislation.
Furthermore, I believe we must congratulate the Commission on having acted so quickly with the legislative proposals the Commissioner has just announced, with regard to control, identification, the quality of products and vaccinations.
In the same way, the temporary committee is asking the Commission to draw up a global strategy for diseases and zoonosis in the European Union.
For all these reasons, I would ask that the House give this report its majority support.
I would especially like to congratulate the rapporteur, with whom I have found it so easy to work; all the members of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, who have worked hard, and whose work and criticisms have been constructive; I would also like to congratulate in particular the secretariat for its rigour and for its bold work and our interpreters, without whom this committee would not have been able to carry out its work.
Mr President, bad farming practice was the root cause of the foot and mouth outbreak.
Pigs were fed improperly treated swill, which was bad farming practice.
Diseased pigs were not reported - bad farming practice.
Neighbouring sheep became infected.
Bad farming practice was compounded by stupidity when pigs which no longer showed physical symptoms but could still transmit the disease were sent to an abattoir.
Other animals became infected and this delayed the identification of the source of the outbreak.
The outbreak farm was so severely infected that it was six months before it was safe to disinfect it.
Bad farming practice led to a situation where the disease was spreadeagled over 57 farms in 16 counties by the time its presence was confirmed.
The result was the worst foot and mouth outbreak ever recorded, well beyond the contingency planning of any Member State.
The report does not shirk the horrendous consequences to farmers and to rural businesses, the heartache, the trauma and the financial losses.
Nor does the report shirk the operational problems faced by government.
No one pretends that there were not mistakes of policy and failures in implementation, but the lessons-to-be-learned inquiry clearly shows that decisions made were justified by the available evidence at the time.
The report is particularly good - indeed it is its main strength - on the measures needed to combat any future outbreak.
Of special importance is the need for effective monitoring of animal movements and traceability.
That said, regrettably the report contains errors of fact.
These relate to the legality and effectiveness of the contiguous cull.
They also relate to allegations of animal welfare abuses and to biosecurity lapses allowing further spread of the disease.
Eight amendments have been tabled to correct these errors.
As the Chair said so revealingly during the committee vote, we are not dealing with reality.
Hearsay and hindsight have been the chief witnesses.
The reality is that the contiguous cull was legal.
It was legal under UK law; it was legal under European law.
The cull was an essential weapon in bringing the disease under control.
Vaccination would not have worked in the UK situation.
The reality is that the heroic efforts of government officials, veterinarians, farmers, police, the military and many others brought the disease under control more quickly than the smaller outbreak in the UK which occurred in 1966-68.
That was the reality.
Mr President, I too would like to repeat all the thanks that have been conveyed to all those involved in this excellent committee of inquiry, particularly the Chairperson, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, and Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, both of whom played exemplary roles in the whole process.
I would also like to register a note of thanks to the countless people in the United Kingdom who helped organise our visits to the various parts of the UK during the course of our investigations.
It was quite a challenge for many of them to deal with this rabble of argumentative poly-lingual MEPs who suddenly descended upon them, but on the whole those visits went extremely well.
The report, as many speakers have said, is judicious and balanced.
It is bold and forthright in exactly the right areas, particularly on vaccination and import controls.
The report conveys some very clear messages about what should be avoided in the future and what should be done in the horrific eventuality that another outbreak occurs.
On both of those points, it is clear that the report has already had an influence on the shift in public policy which is starting in the United Kingdom.
I would join Mr Sturdy and others in saying that the response, particularly on the issue of import controls - certainly within the United Kingdom - is still too slow.
Insufficient resources have been allocated to that important task.
I see that the PSE Group and the rapporteur have tabled some amendments to protect the reputation of the United Kingdom Government.
I would only suggest to my colleagues that they should not be so over-sensitive.
It is simply part and parcel of the independence of a committee of inquiry such as this that there should be some critical remarks.
Frankly, it is an aspect of independence that the government has deliberately shunned by refusing to hold its own public inquiry in the UK.
Some of the amendments which have been retabled seem to be just plain wrong.
I pick out arbitrarily an amendment which says that there was no evidence of health or environmental problems arising from some of the burial sites in the south-west.
I would invite my colleagues, for instance, to see and visit, as I have, the Viridor site near Kingsteignton in the south-west and then come back and say to me with any real confidence that they think there are no environmental or health effects.
If they speak to any of the residents in that locality, they will see what a silly amendment that is.
Finally, I would ask colleagues to pay particular attention to paragraph 128 of the draft report.
The ELDR Group will be asking for a split vote to delete the last sentence of paragraph 128.
That last sentence suggests that any compensation in future should be conditional on appropriate insurance mechanisms being in place.
We are very keen that a study should be made on the feasibility and the pros and cons of insurance systems, but we do not feel it is appropriate at this stage to make any future compensation automatically dependent upon the existence of insurance schemes.
Mr President, we have read the detailed report on foot and mouth disease in Great Britain and elsewhere, but we believe that this disease broke out and spread as the natural consequence of a number of factors.
The first factor is that animals and products of animal origin can be transported with complete freedom - or should I say unaccountability - throughout the world nowadays, thanks to the globalisation demanded by big business looking for ways to make a fast buck.
The second factor is that cross-border veterinary checks on movements of livestock between Member States of the European Union have all but been abolished.
This basically means that animals can move unchecked from one country to another, as can any dangerous diseases they may be carrying.
This is compounded by a third factor, the abolition of government veterinary services, staff cutbacks and the generally scant importance attached to government control mechanisms, all as a result of the demand by big business for any controls to be minimised between or within countries which might obstruct the need for livestock to be moved quickly, together with the profit generated.
Finally, and this is not unrelated to what I have just said, there is the feed factor - with no controls whatsoever on feedingstuffs - which appears to have helped foot and mouth disease to spread.
This is not a minor factor, as we know from previous crises in the livestock sector in the European Union, such as dioxins in poultry and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
We are under no illusion that crises such as these, which threaten livestock and public health, will keep on happening as long as production is governed by the profit motive and the rules of production, movement, and trade imposed by multinational and other capitalist enterprises in the sector.
Any structural or other measures taken will be no more than fragmented measures which work until the next crisis strikes.
The only long-term solution which will not jeopardise the agricultural economy of the Member States or wipe out entire livestock holdings is to abolish capitalist profit from production and introduce adequate border and other controls, contrary to the demands of the multinationals which have managed to get them lifted.
Mr President, the end of December is a time for drawing up a balance: what went well this year, what went wrong, and what needs improving.
Sometimes one's conclusion is: if only I had ?
After a year of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease I conclude: if only we had not agreed the policy of non-vaccination in 1991!
The costs of that policy have been greatly underestimated.
But worse still is the fact that the non-vaccination policy with the accompanying culls where there is an outbreak, fails to meet any ethical test.
Mr President, Noah's ark was filled not with production factors, but with living creatures.
As the stewards of creation we must take that to heart.
Parties who do not wish for such a test, should pay the penalty at the ballot box for the consequences of a foot and mouth outbreak.
Much more far-reaching consequences than simply economic ones are involved.
To call the combating of the foot and mouth crisis a veterinary success, as has been suggested from the liberal side, is to lose all sense of proportion.
The combating of foot and mouth was not a success, neither veterinary, nor economic, nor in terms of communication.
The report admits that.
An exception is a clause on Friesland, where according to the draft text there was optimum involvement of regional experts.
Fact and fiction have been confused here.
An amendment that I submitted jointly with fellow MEPs Mr Maat and Mr De Roo attempted to restore a correct version of events.
For years prophylactic vaccination protected our livestock.
The argument that vaccination is pointless because of the number of variants of the foot and mouth virus is about as cogent as maintaining that flu jabs in human beings do no good.
If we consider the real costs of the non-vaccination policy, only one conclusion remains, moreover: preventive vaccination is not only the most ethical but also the most economical solution.
In conclusion I should like to compliment the rapporteur on his courageous, lucid and valuable report.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur and also the chair of the committee, Mrs Redondo, most sincerely, since both come from countries where there has been no foot and mouth disease and yet have managed to produce this report with great involvement in the subject.
The same also applies to our secretariat, since our work as a temporary committee consisted to a significant degree precisely in visiting people who had been affected.
Without the enormous commitment of our secretariat we would not have been able to do that and that means that this committee occupies a special place in the work of Parliament.
Mr President, Mrs Redondo's words are close to my heart.
She said that current policy is focused too much on political and economic values, and insufficiently on human values, if one looks at foot and mouth disease, and one must try to change course in that respect.
I wholeheartedly agree with her and I am able to speak on behalf of the inhabitants of the affected areas in my country: the Veluwe and Friesland, who greatly appreciated the fact that parliamentary colleagues visited these areas and listened to them.
It gives them the feeling that in this instance European democracy really came into its own.
That strikes me as essential, partly also with a view to the forthcoming elections in 2004.
At the same time, we must realise that we have been through a disaster in which seven million animals were destroyed, an economic loss of over EUR 10 000 million was incurred, and that in some areas, for example around Carlisle, many more people are presently taking anti-depressants than previously.
Such was the impact.
I will just mention the story of the school in Oene, where performance at primary level declined.
That indicates the impact this crisis had on people.
This means that if we are to take European citizens seriously, we must change policy.
In that sense I am glad that Commissioner Byrne at least has indicated that he appreciates this.
It is essential, however, that if we do not adopt general vaccination, emergency vaccination should become standard in the case of an outbreak, as the Commission has said, and that even after emergency vaccination the farms involved should receive the same treatment as if there had been a cull.
That means that the area would be cut off for no longer than 3 months and that there will be free marketing of products.
That is crucial if a future policy is to succeed.
It also means that the Commission has a serious responsibility, as a result of which it will not be able, in the proposals it may present tomorrow, to avoid the fact that new rules on this matter must also be agreed in the OIE, in order to bring deadlines into line and to ensure that products from vaccinated animals can be marketed, since that has nothing to do with food safety and everything to do with ethical behaviour in agricultural policy.
I have already indicated that this committee tried to give European citizens a voice in European politics.
As a committee we tried at least to give the crisis a face, to show what befell people, what befell animals and to demonstrate that those things are politically relevant.
In that respect I look forward to the new debate on the Commission's proposals.
The Commission and the Council have a heavy responsibility.
They cannot brush aside this report by Parliament.
They must take this report on board in their policy, or else we shall find ourselves in new difficulties regarding democracy in Europe.
First of all, my sincere thanks to my colleague, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler.
He has done a splendid job, and his objective approach has made it possible to bridge political differences.
The foot and mouth crisis has left deep scars, the culls have brought unhappiness to countless families but have also led to public indignation and rage, sometimes impotent rage at the authorities.
Also rage at Europe, which forbade the vaccination of livestock in the area surrounding affected farms.
The European Parliament is today presenting a closely argued view, a view that I can endorse entirely.
Yes, we are against the unnecessary culling of healthy animals.
Yes, we want vaccination in the event of foot and mouth outbreaks.
Yes we must persuade supermarkets to sell the meat of vaccinated animals as a matter of course.
Yes, there must be emergency action plans.
We must introduce a global dimension, a clear statement must be issued by the OIE and there must be effective monitoring of imports, including at airports.
And yes, we must improve the structural health of the sector: good hygiene, no more ramshackle transport and an end to subsidy policy that gives too much encouragement to the movement of animals.
We must also ensure good monitoring at all times.
I am in complete agreement with all these points.
We cannot leave it at that, however.
A political wish list is not enough.
As long as the European Parliament has no say in the agricultural field, there is a risk that our resolution will remain a paper tiger.
Unless we link this resolution to concerted pressure in the Convention, all our efforts will have been in vain.
Worse still, we shall have awakened unfounded expectations and we shall be fuelling renewed Euroscepticism.
In the Netherlands, the 2001 foot and mouth crisis was a kind of harbinger of the political upheaval in 2002.
We must also at any rate learn the political lesson.
Confidence in politics suffered a heavy blow.
An important reason was that political responsibility remained vague, since who was actually responsible for the non-vaccination policy?
Was it the government, was it the EU or the international bureau for infectious diseases?
It was all very vague.
Ministers pointed to the EU, the EU Commissioners pointed to the national governments and the OIE. For citizens, the complex structure of responsibilities was scarcely comprehensible, and that created the impression of politicians who took up positions but subsequently preferred to hide behind others.
Politicians who shirk responsibility destroy the credibility of politics.
This game of buck passing has backfired badly on Europe.
The hundreds of angry letters and angry e-mails were the signs of a human but also an interinstitutional tragedy.
A future foot and mouth outbreak must never lead to a mass slaughter of livestock.
In the period ahead, we must direct all our efforts to this end.
This requires a foot and mouth policy in which responsibilities are clearly established, at regional, national, European and international level.
Parliaments must be involved.
Our aim must be a foot and mouth policy that is not anonymous.
Responsibilities for choices and for compliance must be clearly established, and it is our task to communicate these.
I hope that this report may contribute to this process and again thank the rapporteur.
Mr President, I should firstly like to thank the chairman of the committee, Mrs Redondo, and the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, for an outstanding piece of work.
Unfortunately, the work has not shown unambiguously that there is any alternative to the present non-vaccination policy.
It is very clear that there are neither vaccines nor laboratory capacity and that, overall, everything is missing that would be necessary to enable us to abandon the non-vaccination policy.
This means that, if a decision on vaccination is to be made, it will be a political decision and not a decision based on scientific and veterinary fact.
I want finally to say a little about the consequences in terms of trade policy.
The reactions have been very clear.
When there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the importing countries - or third countries - exclude all imports of fresh meat from the whole of the EU.
The Commission must be required very clearly to ensure that third countries, particularly the United States, accept that the EU consists of Member States and of regions, especially following enlargement in 2004.
If foot and mouth disease occurs in a particular country or region, it is not therefore necessary to halt all imports of fresh meat from the whole of the EU.
On the contrary, supply and demand become totally chaotic when that happens.
That is why I want very clearly to call upon the Commission to renegotiate the agreements, which are nowhere near specific enough at present.
If a new case of foot and mouth disease should occur, the agreements must be in place, particularly with the United States, so that exports from those countries that do not have foot and mouth disease can continue.
Mr President, foot and mouth disease was not created by human error, as was the mad cow disease BSE, but is a long familiar natural phenomenon.
It used to be considered normal for every cow to be affected by it occasionally, thereby building up immunity.
Later people attempted to eradicate once and for all that disease that was infectious, expensive, dirty and painful for livestock by means of vaccination.
Without extreme globalisation and the world market the disease and the way in which people believe they can combat it would never have attracted so much attention.
The rich American market does not want meat from animals that have been sick.
Simply because, without marker vaccine, we cannot easily distinguish such animals from vaccinated livestock, people became confident that the disease would gradually be eliminated entirely.
Just as people believed this of human tuberculosis.
Export interests have replaced animal welfare and human ingenuity.
Unfortunately the mistake was made not only by a number of companies or whole Member States but also by the European Union as a whole.
For ten years Member States and our farmers have been pressured from above into collaborating in something that is neither sensible nor acceptable.
Virtually no one had expected that during the latest outbreak in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands extensive mass slaughter of healthy livestock would be necessary in order to ensure that nowhere in the immediate vicinity could any animals be found that might be infected.
Even rare and exotic breeds or the pet animals of country children were compulsorily killed.
Quite rightly many people declared authorities that compel such behaviour insane and withdrew their confidence.
Thus far Ministers of Agriculture and the European Commission may have admitted that things may change in the distant future but they have not yet changed course entirely.
Vaccinations are seen at most as an emergency measure for healthy livestock that cannot be destroyed quickly enough.
As is often the case government power is more stupid than human society as a whole.
So many people are protesting.
It is the task of Parliament to put an end once and for all to the misguided policy of preventive culling and not rule out once and for all the option of prophylactic vaccination.
Thank you.
Mr President, foot and mouth disease is a highly infectious disease for our livestock, but completely harmless to humans.
I come from the Netherlands where our cattle were prophylactically vaccinated for over 60 years.
The United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland do not have this tradition.
After their entry into the European Union they lobbied for 20 years for the abolition of prophylactic vaccination in Europe.
Unfortunately they were successful.
Export interests were placed above all else.
In both Great Britain and the Netherlands, we have seen the dreadful consequences for animals, farmers, part-time farmers, the tourist sector, in short the whole of society.
The proposal of the temporary committee is to make emergency vaccination easier.
That is a good idea.
There is also a proposal to force supermarkets to sell vaccinated meat in future.
The latter smacks of a planned economy and will not work.
The Netherlands produces far more meat than the Dutch themselves can consume.
What is necessary is a return to prophylactic vaccination.
At least for those countries, like the Netherlands, that wish to do so.
New techniques, such as marker vaccines make it possible to distinguish between a sick animal and one that has been vaccinated.
That means that even the sacred exports can be maintained.
It is a mystery to me why the majority in Parliament does not opt for this approach.
For me this report is only half a step in the right direction.
Nevertheless, half steps in the right direction are better than no steps at all, and I shall vote in favour of the report.
But I am bound to say that I find it a great pity that our agricultural colleagues in particular have made the interests of direct exports paramount.
Mr President, I am very glad to say that the health crisis is behind us, but its side effects are unresolved.
The first thing we must do is understand.
Unfortunately, at this juncture, we can still only speculate as to the source of the infection and the factors that caused the disease to spread.
Nevertheless, we can still learn our first lesson, namely the importance of a policy of proximity, which may mean bringing the activities at all stages of the process closer together or maintaining public services at local level in order to avoid transporting animals, which appears, in this case, to have played a significant role.
It is clear that we cannot repeat a slaughter on such a huge scale.
The report also puts forward proposals that we shall support such as the revision of emergency plans in conjunction with all partners, a training policy, an effective exchange of information between Member States and an increase in resources for research into marker vaccines.
These prevention programmes should also take into account the conservation of genetic resources while wild species, game and dying breeds must be protected through specific measures.
Lastly, prevention programmes will only be effective if adequate compensation is guaranteed.
Mr President, as someone who was at the forefront in instigating the setting up of this committee, I would personally like to thank President Cox for his invaluable help and all those Members who have made this report and this committee such a resounding success.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler for his unstinting work, his readiness to listen and his even-handed approach.
The visits to the UK and the Netherlands allowed us to listen to everyone who was affected.
I believe that the European Parliament has delivered what my own parliament in Westminster would not.
What we have in this document is a fair and balanced report on the terrible devastation and suffering the disease brought to my country.
Let us not forget that foot and mouth disease is no respecter of borders.
This blight could have appeared in any European country and could still hit at any time in the future.
Looking at the situation in the UK, the British Government quite simply got it wrong.
Mr Adam may try and blame everything on the farmers as usual - and he talked much about the farmers getting it wrong - but what about the government getting it wrong?
There is no denying that mistakes have been made.
That could be accepted by British farmers - we all make mistakes.
What is not acceptable is that this government still refuses to accept they got it wrong and still refuses to apologise to those who suffered.
Look at Mr Adam's amendments and look at the latest British Government briefing - they have learnt nothing!
This disease did not just affect farmers, it affected hotels and tourism; it affected butchers and traders across Europe.
We must not allow this terrible slaughter of 10 million animals to happen again.
I am pleased that this report contains a sensible and workable approach to vaccination in the future.
Our visit to the Netherlands demonstrated the great benefits of emergency vaccination.
This would remove the necessity for the huge funeral pyres and burial pits that were hallmarks of the British Government's handling of the outbreak.
Those unforgettable pictures must stand as a lasting reminder of what could happen again if we do not learn the lessons of this most terrible disease.
I am pleased that this report sets out plans for the future.
It is vital that we have a workable and effective contingency plan in place.
This report goes a long way to developing a positive approach for the whole of Europe.
The European Commission has worked hand in hand with the committee, and it is no coincidence that tomorrow it will come forward with its proposals for the future.
I commend Commissioner Byrne's team for their work.
I would make one final plea to the British Government: please listen and accept this report so we can plan for the future.
The suffering caused last year by foot and mouth disease was simply unacceptable and it must never be allowed to happen again.
I hope you will all support this report and the measures contained within it.
Europe's farmers and Europe's rural communities deserve to know that they are valued.
They deserve to know that Europe's politicians are prepared.
I hope that you will give this your support today.
Mr President, no one on the temporary committee will ever forget the aftermath of that great foot and mouth plague of 2001.
When we travelled the country we talked to the victims, those who could not be compensated, as well as those who were, those who could restock and begin again, hopefully in a more balanced and less intensive system of livestock production, and those whose lives were utterly changed, who had, as Mr Sturdy said, lost their dreams.
I would like to be able to agree with every word in this report and I salute the rapporteur's attempt to produce, as the Commissioner called it, a balanced, straightforward and future-oriented account.
Where should it begin?
It has to begin with the outbreak itself, with what actually happened and with the apportionment of blame.
A balanced report is one in which all those responsible accept some measure of the blame, including the UK Government.
I would point out to the House that there have been five separate reports in the UK alone, two by local authorities severely affected by the crisis.
There have also been reports by the National Farmers Union and others who were participants in the whole tragedy.
So to say that this is the first time we have looked at this is quite wrong.
Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler has produced an objective account and one which seeks to be fair in its allocation of blame and responsibility.
I am sorry that some of the amendments that have been tabled run counter to that intention.
We should not be attempting 20:20 hindsight.
We should not be using shock logic to invent legal rules that were allegedly broken.
When I hear Mrs Lucas speaking I am reminded of a Russian historian who once said to me that the wonderful thing about the past is that things are always changing there.
You never know what is going to happen.
The past is being rewritten here.
That is not right.
Some of the allegations in Mrs Lucas's speech were factually incorrect and should not be in this report at all.
I prefer to look ahead.
I would like to think that we can salute others who have not been mentioned so far in this debate, in the blame culture in which it has been shrouded.
Firstly, the foreign vets, more than 2 000 of whom came to the UK and tried to help us solve the problems with the outbreak.
Also the farmers, the officials, the police who struggled through those terrible days in March and April before we knew where and how we could bring this under control.
Let us look ahead now: at inspections, movements of animals dead or alive, a fresh look at different kinds of agriculture, based on accountability, lessons learned - yes, including the lesson in objectivity which Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler and the Chairwoman tried to bring to our committee and which persuaded most, though perhaps not all of us.
Finally, I would like to thank the Commissioner.
It is right that it should be this Commissioner with his concerns and priorities who is replying in this debate.
Essentially, it is a matter, not just of animal health, but of human health and welfare as well.
Mr President, as a representative for Cumbria - the area most affected by this disease in Europe - to think back 20 months is to remember the distress of farmers who, in many cases, saw their animals being slaughtered - although there was no evidence that they were infected - and, in particular, the distress of those who made their living from tourism in the Lake District.
All too often the cries of those people whose economy depended on tourists and whose contribution to the economy was worth six times that of the farmers went totally unheeded.
We saw the pictures on our television sets: visitors were turned away because of the mass culling; animal welfare concerns were being disregarded; the fires were making a nonsense of the policies adopted by this European Union in its attempts to address the concerns about dioxins spreading in our atmosphere.
People were really upset by the illogicality of the situation: mountains, hills and footpaths were closed for no reason.
At the same time, you could walk along a country road and the sheep and lambs would stick their heads out through the fences.
People felt a sense of anger and despair.
This must never happen again.
I am glad that this report makes clear that the UK Government's policy was wrong, and that we should be thinking about emergency vaccination if this situation occurs again.
I also believe that, in order to take account of the wider considerations and in view of the relatively small role which farming has in our economy these days, we also need to look at preventive vaccination as a long-term solution to difficulties of this kind.
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, I recall how we discussed foot and mouth disease at the Brussels conference all of a year ago, when I was still Chairman and followed what you had to say on the monitor.
I must say that our positions have now grown closer together, whereas at that time they were still rather more divergent.
I explained the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was that a policy of culling and keeping countries free of the disease would not enable us to solve this problem.
At that time, the Commission still took another view.
I concede that the international organisations took yet another line on the question of when inoculation should take place.
Now we have moved on a bit, and I call that progress.
I believe that targeted vaccination will enable us to limit the damage, in material but also in cultural terms.
The scandals associated with foot and mouth disease and the burning pyres gave the world an image of Europe that we must not allow to be repeated.
Let me just say something on the subject of prophylaxis.
I am not in favour of constant prophylactic vaccination, but we must also make it clear that control vaccination always amounts to prophylactic vaccination.
The right time for this has to be identified, and this is where the Commission has to watch out.
We also have to give the Member States leeway to enable us to have ring-vaccination and control vaccination at an early stage.
That does not, however, necessarily include ongoing prophylactic vaccination, to which I wish to express my opposition.
Mr President, this committee and its report have been an extremely good exercise.
I would like to congratulate all my colleagues, particularly Mr Sturdy for initiating it, the Chairman Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez and the rapporteur Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler.
A lot has already been said about 'to vaccinate or not to vaccinate', be it prophylactic vaccination, ring vaccination, emergency vaccination or contingency vaccination.
The one thing we have agreed upon is that we are not going back down the route of prophylactic vaccination.
At least that is what this report is saying, and I think that makes sense.
After all, when we are talking about vaccination, we talk about cattle only, but it was the transport of sheep in the UK, Ireland, France and elsewhere that actually spread the disease the last time, and we must not lose sight of that.
I would like to concentrate on one point that concerns me greatly and that is the future availability of veterinary resources, particularly in remote regions of the European Union.
There is sure to be another outbreak of an exotic disease - if not foot and mouth - with the movement of people and animals and modern travel today.
How we handle it and how it is detected is absolutely critical.
If we do not have the vets on the ground, particularly in remote areas where it is not viable to have veterinary practices, we have no detection system for the future.
I urge the Commission to take particular interest and to evaluate the availability of veterinary resources for future disease management within the EU generally.
Identification of animals, issues of transport, insurance and many other matters came up apart from the vaccination issue.
I urge sensible handling of transport and the individual identification of animals.
I congratulate Joe Walsh and Brid Rogers for their great cooperation, which resulted in the worst of this outbreak being avoided in Ireland.
But, if we go down the route of identifying and tagging each individual sheep, apart altogether from a flock identification tag, and then removing it when the lamb goes to the fattener, we could be left with sheep with three or four tags, or you would be removing tags and adding others: something we are trying unsuccessfully to sort out in Ireland at the moment.
Finally, I would like to thank the Chairman for accepting our point on the protocol for the movement of non-susceptible animals and, in particular, the promise of a review of the movement of equines during future outbreaks, as horses are not susceptible in this case.
Mr President, we are dealing with an excellent parliamentary report which is flexible, courageous, balanced and positive, in a very difficult field.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Wolfgang Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, on this magnificent piece of work, and I would like to highlight the following points I agree with:
Firstly, it brings up to date areas which were not covered, such as the vulnerability of sectors like tourism.
Secondly, it introduces flexible innovations in relation to emergency vaccination, rejecting the obsolete elements of the current regulations.
Thirdly, it criticises the shortcomings, but in a positive manner.
Fourthly, it points out the insufficiencies of information policies.
Commissioner, in view of paragraphs 20 and 21 and of what I experienced myself during the dioxin crisis, mad cow disease and now the Prestige, I believe the Commission should take its ability to directly provide Europeans with information very seriously.
Fifthly, I very much agree with paragraphs 81 and 82 on compensation.
And, finally, Mr President, although it does not fall within the competences of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, nor of this parliamentary report, I would like to draw attention to the annual report of the Court of Auditors for 2001, because it makes some criticisms in relation to corruption and, for the sake of combating corruption in relation to CAP subsidies, very good account must be taken of this.
Mr President, firstly I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to all involved in bringing about this report.
It is a balanced report and has been a good initiative.
It has been good for this Parliament because it has proved that it could produce a report that the national parliament was afraid to.
I would like to comment on one of the Commissioner's remarks.
He said that the effect was the same as other diseases or previous outbreaks of foot and mouth and we need to act, but the question is how do we act?
That is what has to be addressed.
This report and investigation brought home the wider effects.
Coming, as it did, on the back of BSE in the United Kingdom, this disease wrecked the rural economy and destroyed many farmers in the UK.
I come from Northern Ireland, and Mrs Doyle has referred to the fact that she comes from the Republic of Ireland.
The reality is that we were very lucky.
Let us not underestimate this.
We were not all that good, but we were very lucky.
A load of sheep left Longtown market, went all the way across the Irish Sea, were dropped off at Larne in the middle of the island of Ireland and it took a long time to detect them.
Let me be clear: we need better controls there as well.
What will remain with us is the sight on our TV screens of the burning pyres.
It brought home to us how horrific the situation was.
There has to be a better way of controlling it.
Ring vaccination has to be the way in which we look at trying to control it.
We should put in place more resources and more finance for research and development to achieve a traceable vaccine, so we know that animals have been vaccinated.
I will finish by re-echoing what has already been said on border controls: border controls are totally inefficient.
Meat is being brought into the European Community, into the United Kingdom and other countries, and it is not being caught.
We are going to have to deal with this as other countries have done.
They have been more effective than we have been.
We must ensure that our ports and airports are properly controlled in every way.
The truth is that this disease can strike anywhere and at any time.
I hope it does not, but we must be ready if it does.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nowadays, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease even in one small part of one Member State has very rapid and grave effects on the Community as a whole.
The loss of considerable numbers of animals as a result of the slaughter of whole herds and the profound disquiet and insecurity felt in society as a whole in the countries affected and also throughout the other parts of Europe, meant great financial loss in the affected areas, not only for farming, but also for the economy as a whole and tourism in particular.
The control of disease can today be understood no longer as merely a means of preserving the stock of farm animals or of defending specific commercial interests, but must also take into account the population's changed lifestyle, their mobility, and their changed attitudes towards the environment and the protection of animals.
With these things in mind, the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease engaged intensively with the whole range of problems associated with epidemics, including their effect on the public and the economy.
Whilst we do not need to reinvent the wheel, there is much that we can do better when it comes to limiting risks and minimising damage to the economy, while at the same time taking account of the welfare of animals and the sentiments of the public.
This is not just about a few cows and sheep.
We are all affected; this is relevant to all of us, and it helps not a bit to make sweeping assertions about who is guilty and who is not.
I would also like to unambiguously refute the accusations - and there have been some - levelled at farmers, be it in Great Britain or any other country.
What is important is that all imports should be controlled, that plans for emergencies should be kept up to date, and that the Commission should actively involve itself in them without delay.
Mass slaughter cannot be a solution, and I wish to put the case for emergency vaccination as being the very least we can do, and, apparently, the best means of getting a speedy grip on the disease and sparing the animals' lives.
We all know that meat from vaccinated animals is completely safe and therefore capable of being marketed.
I would like to express my gratitude to our rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler.
I would like to thank Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, who chaired our committee, and also the Commission, and those of its members who were of assistance to us.
I trust that you will all now go and enjoy a nice juicy steak!
Mr President, in this Chamber we are very frequently engaged in debating what we consider to be the great political issues.
But I seem to remember that when we were elected in 1999 our greatest concern was how we made our debates relevant to our electors.
I want to tell you that the area that I represent here in Parliament - the constituency of Wales - is a country that was markedly affected by the foot and mouth outbreak.
This debate is very relevant to people in my constituency who suffered from what has been described as a community tragedy.
There was an impact on a really human scale.
We sometimes do not recognise the sense of isolation that was felt by many farmers and by other people living in rural areas because of the devastating economic and other impacts of this outbreak.
I therefore want to begin by thanking the committee for visiting Welshpool, Builth Wells and Sennybridge and meeting people within my constituency who said to Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler that the European Parliament was the only official body that came to listen to their views.
That addresses, in my view, the issue of the relevance of the European Parliament.
Setting up the committee has been a worthwhile exercise.
Secondly, I am sorry we had such difficulty in establishing the committee.
I am sorry it was such a struggle.
I am sorry that the British Government was so anxious about its own position - that there might be any criticism of its position - that we struggled for some six months to get the committee up and running.
We all recognise that it was just one group that was opposed to setting up the committee.
Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, though coming from that group, has been a paragon in approaching this issue in a non-political way.
His report is first-rate.
His report has endeavoured to address the real core issues that are of concern.
Contrary to the views of the people who said that this exercise was going to be irrelevant, Commissioner, we are looking forward to your statement tomorrow, and to having a statement that addresses the concerns outlined by the committee that have emerged in the course of the last year.
Others have touched upon the details.
I do not want to do that.
All I want to say is this: this is a report that had almost universal support in committee.
I am sorry that some additional amendments have been tabled because we should cling to the consensus that is within the report.
It is the best example, in my view, of the European Parliament addressing the concerns of voters in a practical way.
It is a huge example for the future relevance of the European Parliament.
It is a tragedy that at the last minute there are some people who still feel it is appropriate, rather churlishly, to protect the reputation of the UK Government.
We are engaged in much more important things than that.
I ask you to look at the report as it came out of the committee and to respond accordingly, Commissioner.
Commissioner, I support Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler's report and I congratulate him on the unanimous consensus reached in the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease.
The committee has shown that, in the light of events thus far, the European Union can no longer get away with not altering its policy and ensuring more effective use of vaccinations, given that our aim is to keep the greatest number of animals as possible alive.
The concerns relating to animal welfare and the social and psychological damage caused by the considerable sacrifices demanded by last year's crisis must take precedence over commercial matters, as the Chairman, Mrs Redondo, has rightly pointed out.
I fully support Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler's report because, taking an epidemic as a starting point, he has described a general situation which encompasses more than just the issue of foot and mouth disease.
For example, take the proposal to extend compensation to sectors associated with livestock breeding, which were - albeit indirectly - heavily penalised by the problems caused by foot and mouth disease. Again, in considering the idea of a guarantee fund or an insurance scheme covering the costs deriving from epidemics, which are increasingly rare and cause extensive market distortion, we are addressing all the problems of the farming world.
In this regard, Commissioner, we need to reflect carefully and at length on the role of the public veterinary services.
Because of the increasingly disturbing general state of public finances in many of the Member States, we are witnessing a drop in the number of veterinarians, which is totally unacceptable, and we also need the public veterinary services to develop a new kind of relationship with the farmers: we need new forms of cooperation.
If the legislative package you present includes a revision of directive 92/102 leading to a very close relationship between farmers and the public veterinary services, then it may well be that, in the future, we will be able to avoid a whole range of situations that we have experienced hitherto.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease has had some important observations to make on the handling of last year's crisis.
It has defined necessary strategies for the future, which also incorporate important suggestions for the legislative work on which we are about to embark.
Taken as a whole, this is a good result for cooperation across group lines, for which I wish especially to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, and to the committee chairman, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez.
There is no doubt that the primary and principal requirement in animal husbandry, to be adhered to in the areas of breeding, veterinary health, hygiene and prophylaxis, is that keeping a system of animal husbandry as self-contained as possible can make an important contribution to the protection of animals and also to their health and to that of human beings.
I do believe, though, that public debate must also pay closer attention to the need for a distinction to be drawn between epizootics that endanger human health, and epidemics in which we are exclusively concerned with the health of animals and with their welfare and with the protection of valuable stocks.
Despite last year's crisis, let us not forget that it was in the control of epizootics hazardous to human health that past decades saw great successes achieved by dint of massive economic efforts on the part of all concerned.
In fact, it was and still is absurd that the practice of vaccination against foot and mouth disease was stigmatised in the public eye at the same time as prophylactic measures, including treatment and vaccination of animals, are in daily use as part of the necessary repertoire of modern and responsible husbandry of many animal species.
What are we supposed to do if the worst comes to the worst?
Are we supposed to use protective emergency vaccination at the right moment?
I would add flexibility in ring-vaccination.
Vaccination and testing should, in principle, be the primary option and should become standard practice. The trade restriction should be reduced to three months at most, as advised by the Scientific Committee as long ago as 1999.
I will add one very important point, quite without reference to the forthcoming legislative work. If all the participants in the market could agree among themselves that infected farms that wanted, and were obliged, to avail themselves of these new tools, would not be left high and dry and would not end up enduring the scorn of the market if they used this strategy for the future, then we could save ourselves all this bother.
I believe that what is needed is to achieve social consensus on the part of everyone involved.
If that is done successfully, we will have been able to develop a strategy for the future capable of encompassing the protection and health of animals and enjoying acceptance on the part of society.
Mr President, as some colleagues may know, I live in Cumbria at the heart of last year's foot and mouth outbreak.
I and many of my friends, neighbours and constituents lost our animals.
For us the pyres were not on the television screen, they were over the garden fence.
I would like to make one thing absolutely clear: the vast majority of those affected were good farmers whose husbandry bears no relationship to that of the few described by Mr Adam.
Because of my own involvement I have, quite rightly, not played any direct part in the inquiry's proceedings, but it seems clear to me that its findings make a valuable contribution to drawing the right lessons from the 2001 outbreak.
I would merely like to make four comments.
Firstly, what occurred in Cumbria, in the United Kingdom - and I have said exactly the same in debates in the UK Parliament and House of Lords - was exacerbated by mistakes made by the United Kingdom Government's handling of the outbreak.
Secondly, while those whose physical assets were destroyed received compensation, those whose livelihoods were damaged to a similar extent by administrative measures introduced to fight the disease received nothing.
This loss, which flowed directly from what the government was doing and was entirely foreseeable, was equally real.
Their contribution to the fight against the disease was equally valid.
In my view, an injustice has been done to them.
Thirdly, the evidence now emerging in Cumbria suggests that the public health consequences of the outbreak are much wider-ranging and much longer-lasting than was supposed at the time.
I would like to end with an appeal beyond this House to the Commission and the governments of the Member States: learn the lessons of 2001.
Do not let other people go through what we did last year.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, for his collegial cooperation in the temporary committee.
I am equally grateful to Mrs Redondo, who guided the committee very constructively and with great diplomacy and calmness.
I would also like to thank all my colleagues.
Our discussions with officials, experts and victims, as well as our visits to affected sites, helped us to engage in depth with the crisis caused by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and, in general, with diseases and the means whereby they are dealt with and controlled, as well as with their prevention and with vaccination policy in Europe.
I am also most grateful to the Commission for always having been there with us and for doing its bit.
What makes foot and mouth disease especially problematic is that it is highly infectious and is therefore easily passed from one animal to another.
It is therefore absolutely vital for appropriate measures to be taken to combat the disease as soon as there is an outbreak, so that we never again have to see the sort of images that quite rightly prompted society's displeasure.
At this point, I would like to say, on a rather critical note, that the report could have made it clearer that a crisis of this sort could have been prevented if appropriate control measures had been taken and if the existing EU regulations had been adhered to or, in certain cases, transposed in the first place.
The important point here is that outbreaks of diseases such as this one can only be avoided if there are sufficient numbers of well-trained inspectors and if everyone concerned observes minimum standards and safety measures.
Furthermore, I would like to point out that it is the Member States that are responsible for extending the inspections carried out under their veterinary systems and for relevant research.
We should stress this again and again.
I therefore see it as self-evident that bureaucratic procedures and an inadequate information policy must no longer be allowed to be the causes of the spread of a disease.
Nevertheless, it must be clear to all of us that unfortunately epizootics can break out again in future, whatever is done to prevent them.
Mr President, Commissioner, the message from this morning's debate was that 'prevention is better than cure'.
No to prophylactic vaccination; yes to ring-vaccination.
The recurrent refrain was that, in future, all-round improvements to systems will be required as a matter of necessity.
In terms of the number of animals culled, the course taken by foot and mouth disease in the European Union in 2001 made it, no doubt, the most serious outbreak ever.
The Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease worked hard, and very efficiently, over the course of several months, and those involved were complimented and thanked this morning.
It is important that any future changes in policy should take as their starting point an analysis of how the disease has been handled up to now.
European producers and consumers attach equal importance to the transposition of Community legislation, Community finance and, in particular, to the drafting of proposals for the prevention and control of diseases in agriculture.
What I will now say, I say as one who comes from the region bordering on the Netherlands, with a very high number of granivores. We must, yet again, draw attention to the need for better networking when cooperating on an acute case of the disease.
Political requirements are important, Commissioner, but real work on the ground, on farms, done by veterinary surgeons and the inspection authorities, using the necessary crisis plans and an emergency room, is an absolute necessity if decisions are to be taken quickly and efficiently.
Perhaps I may conclude by giving the example of my constituency, where many institutions have caused a great stir among farmers by participating in a large-scale test of how they would manage a foot and mouth crisis.
You have to think of it as a practice exercise for firefighters, a call-out without a fire.
What was called for was the most rapid reaction in case X, and this cross-border cooperation between the Netherlands and Germany achieved a really most impressive result.
Let us all hope that this exercise never has to be done for real.
We are backing the Commission's proposals.
We look forward with eager anticipation, hoping that we will, in future, have a policy on epidemics that will gain greater acceptance among farmers and consumers than has been the case in the past.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that, at this juncture, over and above the measures which need to be adopted immediately, two things will be discovered which are more important than the race to adopt emergency measures, namely how the epidemic started and why it spread so quickly.
Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler's report - although acceptable in every other way - does not give us a definitive answer on these points, whereas what does emerge, once again, is the disturbing weakness, the shortcomings of the European Commission's veterinary control systems, a weakness which has been admitted by the Commissioner himself with great intellectual honesty, which is tantamount to saying that the lessons of the BSE crisis during the previous legislative term have not served much purpose in this respect.
It is, however, reassuring to know that the Commission unanimously intends to give due importance to the recommendations which emerged from the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy, of Agenda 2000, as regards animal health, transport and feed, in terms of precautionary and preventive measures to avoid epidemics and, most importantly, in terms of future controls on imports.
We agree as regards vaccinations: mandatory vaccinations are not yet feasible; preventive, emergency vaccinations are more appropriate but there must be well-coordinated emergency plans: not plans generated by emotion on the spur of the moment at the height of a crisis but plans which take into account the situation throughout Europe and the historical development of the disease, so that such disasters can be understood and prevented - prevent being a word which needs to be stressed once again in this House.
Mr Sturdy said just now that, even today, there are people who do not understand how all this could have happened or where the epidemic came from.
At this juncture, at the end of the work of our committee of inquiry and at the end of this debate, it would, in any case, be reassuring to be able to say that we know, most importantly, what to do to prevent a similar scourge occurring in the future.
Mr President, I also wish to thank the Chairman and rapporteur of the committee, Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez and Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, who have been excellent in the way they have handled this committee.
In particular, I thank them for allowing the committee to visit Northumberland, in my region, where the disease originated.
I do not have time to cover all the issues now but I want to point out in particular that it is very likely that the disease was caused by illegal imports of meat.
One of my great concerns is that, although this is well known, we still do not have proper controls in place at our ports and airports to prevent further illegal meat imports.
There is much anecdotal evidence in the UK that large amounts of illegal meat are still entering the country.
I would ask the Commissioner to address that in his response tomorrow, because it is a time bomb waiting to go off.
The disease could easily happen again anywhere in Europe.
People were particularly grateful to have the opportunity to submit their comments to the committee members in person.
Never again must we see the enormous funeral pyres all over the landscape of the north-east of England, which had such a devastating effect on the tourist industry and all related industries, not just agriculture.
Above all, despite the efforts of some Members of this Parliament, I hope that we will learn the lessons from the outbreak of this disease and ensure that it never happens again.
Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this valuable and important debate on this report.
A number of issues have been raised by many speakers which I ought to address - even if only briefly at this stage.
Firstly, on the question of control of imports, many - if not all - of you have addressed this important issue.
It is of critical importance to ensure that not only is there legislation in place to deal with this kind of issue but also that the controls are in place to ensure that the legislation is properly implemented.
It is the job of the Commission to bring forward legislation on the control of imports.
It is, however, for the control authorities in the Member States to ensure that legislation is fully and properly implemented and not, as Mr Santini suggested, a function of the Commission to ensure that controls are in place.
We must ensure that we identify who is responsible for what, so that we can clearly indicate to those who have the responsibility that they must exercise those functions properly.
With regard to legislation, since 1972 we have legislation in place at EU level in respect of imports of commercial products.
It is illegal to import goods in contravention of that legislation.
More recently, we have put in place legislation on personal imports, which will be operational from 1 January 2003.
I, like you, call on Member States to ensure that their control authorities make sure that these pieces of legislation are properly and fully implemented.
This issue is also addressed in the hygiene regulations before Parliament at the moment.
Therefore, cooperation of all parties in this is of critical importance in trying to ensure that another outbreak does not happen in the future.
The second issue that was raised with some passion is vaccination.
I noted what Mr Whitehead said about the past constantly changing.
However, in this instance there is one point that I have had to address on many occasions.
It was again raised by Mrs Corbey and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
It is the function of the Commission in the application of vaccinations.
Two Member States out of the four that had the outbreak of foot and mouth disease sought permission from the Commission to administer emergency vaccination.
That permission was granted - there is no doubt about that.
One of those two Member States did not apply it all, the other did, but then decided that the animals that were vaccinated should be killed.
They had permission from the Commission to vaccinate and keep the animals alive.
However, for reasons associated with trade considerations - they are not irrelevant and I do not criticise them - that Member State decided to vaccinate and then cull those animals.
Any of the Member States involved could have applied vaccinations of their own volition, based on their own legislation, without any need for permission from the Commission.
At this stage, I should like to clarify that issue, rather than to leave in the minds of some people that there may have been some fault on the part of the Commission in failing or in refusing to allow Member States to respond to this outbreak by using vaccination and leaving animals alive.
That did not happen, although it could have been done because the Commission authorised this in very clear terms.
I repeat that one of the Member States involved decided not to use vaccination at all and the other decided to use vaccination but nonetheless - for trade considerations - went ahead and culled the cattle involved, even in circumstances where it could have allowed those animals to remain alive.
I am very happy that a number of speakers praised the work of the Commission.
I am sure that the people who work with me, my collaborators who are here, take pleasure in that also.
They have worked very hard on this.
I am very pleased that the two institutions have worked so well together in this instance, as Mr Jonathan Evans said.
We have tried to ensure that what we do here at European Union level - whether in Parliament or in the Commission - has relevance for people.
In this instance, the debate and the report have been of relevance to citizens of the European Union.
I also hope that the legislation that will be published tomorrow will respond not just to the needs and desires of Parliament, but also the needs, desires and the wishes of ordinary citizens of the European Union.
You will see many of the issues you have raised in your report echoed in our legislation which will be published tomorrow, because we have worked closely together on your report and in the drafting of the legislation.
One further piece of legislation to be published tomorrow governs the individual identification and traceability of sheep.
That will also contribute to providing some kind of security against an outbreak of this type in the future.
Finally, I congratulate Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez for chairing this committee and Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler for the excellent work he has undertaken and for the cooperation that he and his people offered not only to myself but also my officials.
This is a clear example of the two institutions working very well and effectively together for the benefit of the citizens of the European Union.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)
Mr President, I would like to request that the vote on the DamiÃ£o report on asbestos be added to the voting list today.
It is a matter of urgency.
We have only the three amendments before us that were voted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
No new amendments have been tabled here in plenary.
Those amendments have been available for over two weeks in translation.
If we can vote today, the college of Commissioners, as I understand it, could consider the matter this afternoon.
It can then be taken at Council on Friday of this week under the Danish Presidency.
The Danish Presidency has worked very hard to agree these amendments with us, and this would allow us to close the dossier at second reading without going into conciliation.
I hope it can be added to the voting list today.
Am I right in thinking that Mrs Thors wishes to speak on this matter?
Mr President, I would ask, with reference to Article 110a, to take the floor in connection with the reading of my report, for the session services reject the possibility of adding to the report the answer I obtained from the Council during the reading by the committee.
I am therefore forced to take the floor now instead.
What is at issue here is Mr Tony Bunyan's complaint to the Ombudsman, the outcome of which is a success for Parliament, the Ombudsman and Mr Bunyan.
Through our work, a long conflict between the institutions about what characterises a document, as distinct from more incidental papers, was resolved.
The Council had refused to give the complainant access to documentation on the grounds that the documents were ephemeral or only reflected the views of individuals.
(The President cut off the speaker)
In accordance with our Rules of Procedure, you are perfectly entitled to take the floor in your capacity as rapporteur, but you can only do this just before the vote on your report.
I therefore suggest that you wait and I shall let you know when you may take your two minutes' speaking time.
We received a request from Mr Hughes, who suggested that we take the vote on the DamiÃ£o report today.
Mr President, I support the request made by Mr Hughes.
It is very important that we vote on it today.
There is no real problem concerning this report, so we can vote on it today.
Is there a Member who wishes to speak against Mr Hughes' request to take the vote on the DamiÃ£o report today?
Since no one wishes to speak against this request and since this means a change to our agenda, I suggest that we first vote on this proposal for a change.
(Parliament agreed to the change to the agenda)
The vote will therefore take place after the vote on the Langenhagen report.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The committee chaired by Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez is giving farmers a wonderful Christmas present by proposing to put an end to the shameful systematic slaughter of between 6 and 10 million animals struck down by the virus.
Reintroducing vaccination, especially since we now have detection tests that are capable of distinguishing serologically between viral infection and immunological response to the vaccine, is the correct solution.
There were 320 000 cases of infection in France in 1952 compared to 2 030 at the peak of the UK crisis in 2001.
Ten years after vaccination was introduced, there were as few as 148 cases, and 30 years on, only 18.
Vaccination is effective and objections based on the cost of vaccinating 300 million animals, like objections from world trade requiring countries to be free from infection, do not hold water.
The costs incurred by the epidemic are greater than the costs of vaccination.
As for the commercial need, it is extraordinary that this argument should be used when it is internal national consumption that absorbs most of the production.
Unless, of course, foot and mouth disease was merely a pretext for getting rid of surplus meat and avoiding storage costs.
Not to mention the market sectors opened up for New Zealand sheep, New Zealand being part of the UK-USA alliance of English-speaking countries, of which the US is also a member, and the US has benefited from BSE, which also broke out on the territory of its ally, Britain, which would officially declare that transmission to humans was feasible in 1996, in other words at the peak of the battle between Europe and the US on hormone-treated beef.
(Statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)
Mr President, I repeat that, because the session services have rejected the possibility of adding to the report the answer we received from the Council during the reading by the committee, I am forced to take the floor instead.
I want what the Council said added to the minutes, so that my fellow MEPs might know what the answer was.
A long conflict between the institutions about what constitutes a document and what are more incidental papers has been resolved.
The Council had refused to give documentation to the complainant, Mr Tony Bunyan, on the grounds that the documents were ephemeral or only reflected the thinking of individuals.
Everyone who has come into contact with the decision-making process knows that precisely these documents are important.
Following the reading by the Committee on Petitions, the Council has promised to introduce a new practice.
The Council's list of documents is to be complete and so also include texts distributed at the meetings of the Council.
This means that the arrangement we adopted previously will operate still better and that the public will more easily be able to follow the decision-making process.
I would cite the letter sent by Mr Brunmayr, Director-General of the Council Secretariat.
Thank you very much for this clarification.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, Amendment No 14 was tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
As rapporteur, I am not qualified - as I have not been mandated to this end by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - to give an opinion in its favour, but I shall simply reiterate that this amendment is fully in line with the traditional positions of the European Parliament, and particularly with the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen.
That is why, personally speaking, I approve this amendment.
Mr President, this concerns the translation into English of the term 'loi organique', which has been rendered as 'organic law'.
We are not very familiar with this concept in the English language.
I note that the Commission document - the so-called 'Penelope' document - uses the term 'institutional law' for its English-language version, which is at least a little clearer.
I propose that we harmonise our English-language terminology with that of the Commission, which would make things clearer all around.
I suggest that all the versions are reviewed in the light of your comment, Mr Corbett, so that we are all clear on this point.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
Given the time, I suggest we suspend voting and resume immediately after the formal sitting for the presentation of the Sakharov Prize.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before we move to the final vote, I would just like to say a few words.
Never before, in eight years, have I taken the floor after a report, but I think it appropriate that I do so today.
There is no doubt that some of the amendments on which we voted today are perfectly in order.
Whilst I do not want to revisit the subject of Great Britain, which we talked about for long enough this morning, some of those that did not get through had to do with the removal of duplications, for example in connection with the OIE's three-month probation period, which causes us concern.
We were also concerned to give the report a coherent form.
We did not succeed in that, but it does not matter.
What I would like to say is that I am very glad that the Greens' Amendment No 25 was rejected.
I also want to tell you why.
The fact is that it would make the internal market fundamentally null and void, and, when your farmers vaccinate, you would have to explain to them that they were enabling British farmers to eat their own sheep and Dutch farmers to drink their own milk, since these products would no longer find their way onto the EU market or the markets of third countries outside the European Union.
You simply have to bear that in mind.
It may be all very fine as far as protecting animals is concerned, but there is no political mileage in it at all.
That is why I am very glad that the amendment was rejected.
Quite apart from that, I am very happy that we worked together extremely well in the committee, without regard to group allegiances, and that this report is supported by a large majority today.
May I remind you, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, that it was by concession from the Chair that you were able to take the floor, as I do not want to launch another debate at this stage of the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
This European Parliament and Council directive, which aims to bring together in a single text all the regulations on the organisation of working time drawn up by the EU over a number of years, is an even clearer illustration of the desire to allow bosses to organise working time as they see fit.
That is why we are taking this opportunity to reiterate, in particular, our outright opposition to night working where this is not socially indispensable, as it is then merely another way to increase profits at the expense of workers' health.
As for the length of working time, the considerable number of pages devoted to exemptions authorised for a transitional period of five years, beginning on 1 August 2004, certainly illustrates the extent to which this is less of a question of organising employees' working time than of allowing bosses a free reign so that they can exploit workers as they wish.
This is what one of these many scandalous exemptions stipulates: 'The Member States shall ensure that the number of weekly working hours does not, under any circumstances, exceed an average of 58 hours during the first three years of the transitional period, an average of 56 hours during the following two years, and an average of 52 hours for any additional period.'
We are obviously unable to endorse a directive of this nature.
We voted against this report, and against those on Bulgaria and Romania, as they incite, or even oblige, the governments of these countries to 'restructure' their steel production.
On the pretext of 'streamlining', the text calls for a reduction of the productive capacities of these countries.
We condemn this absolutely stupid and inhumane 'streamlining', which will mean some of the existing businesses will close, that their workers will be made redundant and unemployment will get worse, and the only purpose of this streamlining is so that surviving factories make a profit for their owners.
Whilst we support the enlargement of the European Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, we are opposed to the fact that enlargement is being used as a pretext for making the living conditions of the working classes in these countries worse.
If the European Parliament wishes to punish war crimes, it should start by putting its own house in order.
France, Great Britain, Belgium, Portugal and Spain, virtually all the States in other words, whose representatives are sitting in this Chamber, have in the past waged shameful colonial wars leaving a trail of crimes against humanity.
It is out of the question to prosecute the generals or colonels who tortured Algerians, just as it is out of the question to try the political leaders who covered up for them and justified their actions.
How many other conflicts have occurred, even after decolonisation, in Rwanda, Sierra Leone or in Liberia for example, where European States have been responsible for or accomplices to crimes against humanity, should we not condemn these too?
Who will judge the crimes being committed, even as we speak, against civilians in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, by rebel soldiers, yes, but also by soldiers of the regime, under the direct protection of the French army?
It is not the population that the French army is protecting there, but French money.
Get the French army out of CÃŽte d'Ivoire!
As for the report, it reeks of hypocrisy, and that is why we voted against it.
- (NL) For centuries, no prosecutions were brought for crimes committed during wars.
Cruel intimidation and the murder of civilians were an accepted tool used for engaging in territorial expansion and securing economic spheres of interest.
The military was above the law.
Not until 1945, after the defeat of Germany and Japan in the Second World War, were war criminals from those countries convicted by the victors.
Were they the only war criminals?
Or is the designation of war criminal equally applicable to those responsible for the destruction of Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
Evidently one needs to be the loser in a war to be tried and sentenced after that war.
Partial losers, who have not lost control over their home base, get off scot-free, witness the colonial wars of the Netherlands in Indonesia, France in Algeria and Portugal in Angola and Mozambique.
Despite that selective approach, it is good that crimes should be punished, even if an attempt is made to justify them in terms of the exigencies of war.
In this way we can discourage repetition in future.
Unfortunately the Kirkhope report offers mainly a policy of harassing refugees accused by their political opponents of having dirty hands. It will scarcely help us to prevent future crimes of rulers against their people.
I have voted for this report because I believe that it deals very well with a complex but urgent issue - that of bringing war criminals to justice within the European Union.
Mr Kirkhope as a former Home Office Minister in the UK has a good understanding of the complexity of the issue and has shown in his reports the benefits of action at a European level.
The Council text has been amended so that some articles which may have breached rules of subsidiarity (those that are concerned with the regulation of investigations and prosecutions rather than with the exchange of information), in fact are now, in my view, in line with this principle.
. (PT) I believe that this Danish initiative, which seeks to promote closer cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of inter alia war crimes and crimes against humanity, makes an effective and practical contribution to the important objective being proposed for the EU, through the action plan adopted by the Council on 20 March 2000, under the title 'The prevention and control of organised crime: a European Union strategy for the beginning of the new millennium'.
I also considered some amendments tabled by the rapporteur and adopted by the specialist parliamentary committee to be appropriate and justified, concerning the protection of personal data, concerning this Council decision not interfering in the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and concerning the clarification that the authorities responsible for prosecuting these crimes are the national authorities responsible for ensuring that national legislation is complied with, not those responsible for immigration, particularly those established at European level.
I have therefore voted in favour of the report.
. (PT) I wish to congratulate Mr Sousa Pinto on the quality and the boldness of his report.
I agree with his criticism of the Danish proposal's lack of ambition and scant substance.
No progress has been made on the mutual recognition of judgments and we are still a long way off from implementing the principle of the mutual recognition of sentencing.
The proposal that has been made only proposes the establishment of a system of exchanging information between Member States on disqualifications imposed in the courts, but does not provide for any type of mutual recognition of sentencing for the purposes of its implementation, which means that an individual who is sentenced to disqualification or to the loss of rights in one Member State can still exercise these rights freely in another State of the Union.
We must fulfil the desire expressed in Tampere and Laeken to make the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters effective.
The issue of the recognition of judgments in criminal matters is highly sensitive, and raises delicate issues.
There are differences in the various Member States and we must avoid the possibility of 'havens for criminals', and prevent freedom of movement from benefiting those acting outside the law.
We must provide a clear response to the citizens' demands for the EU effectively to confront the problem of the increasing threats crime poses for their freedom and rights by means of a solid and common policy for preventing and combating crime.
Rejecting the Danish proposal would therefore send an important political signal to the Council and to the Member States: the European Parliament wants consistent and coherent progress under the third pillar and does not want unambitious initiatives that appear to focus all their energy on winning media approval.
British Conservative MEPs do not believe that mutual recognition is necessary in this field.
Disqualifications should remain a matter for intergovernmental cooperation.
As such the British Conservative Delegation supports the rejection of this Council proposal.
. (PT) The creation of a genuine European area of security and justice covering the entire territory of the Union can only be achieved through better coordination between the national authorities of the Member States, pursuing a dual approach: on the one hand, promoting a coherent and coordinated policy on combating organised crime - that has been very skilful in exploiting the completion and deepening of the internal market and, on the other, providing a clever answer to what is, as the rapporteur has stated, the third out of Europe's citizens nine greatest concerns - combating organised crime, coming immediately after peace and security and unemployment.
Although this Danish initiative seeks to establish a system of information-sharing between the Member States on disqualifications issued against an individual in a criminal judgment, it does not, however, provide for any type of mutual recognition of sentencing for the purposes of its implementation.
I have therefore supported this report and agreed with rejecting the Danish initiative as the rapporteur proposed and as the specialist parliamentary committee accepted.
In fact, this initiative only concerns the creation of an information-sharing system between Member States, and this instrument lacks genuine operability in the fight against organised crime because the initiative does not seek to create, at the same time, any mutual recognition of sentencing with a view to its implementation, which is a prerequisite for the disqualifications it is seeking to achieve.
. (PT) The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has submitted a proposal to Parliament rejecting an initiative from the Kingdom of Denmark under the third pillar.
The Commission and your rapporteur believe that this position must be adopted to ensure that Parliament clearly states its deep dissatisfaction with the situation of paralysis afflicting the third pillar, for which the Member States are responsible.
Important Commission proposals both before and after 11 September 2001, primarily the package of measures to combat terrorism, remain blocked in the Council or are still awaiting transposal or ratification by the Member States.
Unable to achieve the consensus necessary in the Council, or to honour their commitments in national legislation, the Member States are using and abusing their right of initiative.
We have received a plethora of outlandish proposals, by which I mean proposals that do not form part of any plan and did not feature in the Commission's 'scoreboard'.
These are arbitrary, insignificant, incoherent proposals, sometimes dictated by the national political agenda, and transform the third pillar into an ever-expanding universe, containing chaos in all directions; a bureaucratic ball of thread without ends.
It is the European Parliament's duty to condemn this smokescreen, which consists of apparent legislative hyperactivity, which contributes to disguising the Union's lethargy in a crucial area, especially after 11 September 2001 - and the political inability of the Council and the Member States to bring a single significant measure coming from the Commission and laid out in the scoreboard into force.
The gulf between the words of political leaders, not least government representatives, and their translation into concrete actions is taking on scandalous proportions in the field of combating transnational crime.
We must put an end to this situation.
This is the message that the European Parliament wishes to send to the Council and to the Member States.
We are in favour of the development of scientific research and its applications in all the areas that can help move humanity forward.
Dealing with the subject of research and technological development activities in Europe, this report explains that it would be a good thing for citizens, women, researchers, Europe, competition with the United States and Japan, sustainable development, the developing world, the environment, sustainable development.
It is not an omission on its part if this list does not include businesses, which are in fact the first to be concerned, since it proposes to increase their subsidies.
It is quite simply that the report seems to think that this goes without saying.
We think otherwise, however.
We reject the fact that this pretext is once again being used so that public money can be employed to bolster private profits.
The only reason that we are abstaining instead of voting against this report is because it also provides some subsidies which could help researchers and state and university research.
One of the problems that is fundamental but all too often neglected by scientific research in Europe is that of the flagrant under-representation of women.
This is not only a problem of equality and justice - it is also a problem relating to the effectiveness of European research, which therefore demonstrates that the EU is still far from able to harness its potential in human resources.
That is why, in the light of the objective that the Union set itself in Lisbon to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, it is particularly important to vote in favour of this report, which gives the issue of women in research the attention that it deserves.
It is basically a question of supporting the efforts made within the framework of the European research policy, such as the prominence given to 'Women and Science' as part of the specific programme entitled 'Structuring the European Research Area'.
We also note that there is a great deal of work still to be done, such as integrating a gender perspective into all levels of future framework programmes and continuing to compile and disseminate statistics on the participation of men and women.
More generally speaking, the report also raises the issue of how to achieve better reconciliation between one's career and family life, to the benefit of children as well as working men and women, through the establishment in each Member State of crÃšche and nursery facilities, for example.
. (PT) This report is based on the misguided principle that aid granted by the EDF falls within the sphere of Community competence.
It has been clearly proven that the nature of relations between the various Member States and the countries receiving development aid is quite different.
This is partly a result of historical factors and old ties which, in many cases, such as Portugal, lead to relationships involving very close cooperation.
These relationships are expressed in frameworks that can only be identified and given due consideration in the context of consultation with the Council itself.
I disagree with communitarisation and have therefore voted against the report.
Mr President, cooperation in the field of education in Europe has brought many students together from different parts of the European Union, as well as students from the accession countries.
The students taking part in these activities are not just increasing their own knowledge and abilities to deal with the ever-changing nature and shape of the world in which we live, they also represent the future building-blocks for a new society and a new understanding and tolerance of the cultural diversity within the European Union.
The number of people who have taken part in the Erasmus programme since its inception will exceed one million during the academic year 2002 to 2003.
A total of 30 countries presently take part.
I welcome the fact that the European Union is now putting in place a charter for Erasmus students which will be available to all students in 2003.
This charter spells out responsibilities and entitlements, such as full recognition by the home university of academic achievements, as well as credits to be obtained by students during their term on Erasmus.
It is the goal of the European Commission and Parliament to reach two million participating students by 2007.
We must also ensure that, while they are abroad, students continue to receive education grants from their home Member States and that the Erasmus programme is not exclusive to those who can afford it.
The Youth for Europe programme has been very successful in encouraging more exchanges between students.
We should encourage further development of this area, in particular for those who are disadvantaged.
It should also be pointed out that the Socrates programme has already been extended to cover the period 2000 to 2006 and EUR 1 850 million has been allocated for this programme.
Finally, as a result of the Court of Auditors' decisions, we must ensure that our accounting and delivery practices are better, to ensure that all students can benefit not only from a tremendous academic achievement but also from a cultural experience.
This motion concerns the Court of Auditors' report on the application of the Socrates and Youth programmes (1995-1999).
The Court of Auditors highlights design weaknesses (Socrates is excessively complex, resulting in different interpretations and problems between the Technical Assistance Office and the national agencies) and shortcomings in implementation (delays, management shortcomings, suspicions of fraud, seven cases referred to OLAF) and evaluation.
Evaluation reports were delayed and there were so many irregularities that the Court of Auditors found it hard to come to a judgment as to whether or not the programmes' objectives had been realised, while the mid-term report on the Youth programme was produced by a company owned by a former director of the TAO.
The motion contains worthwhile comments and proposals.
It calls on the Commission to act on the Court of Auditors' recommendations, including its recommendation to replace the TAOs by Community public-law agencies.
It also calls for any 'framework' contracts with external bodies to be phased out and for monitoring and evaluation to be awarded to public bodies.
There also appears to be some doubt as to the efficacy of the programmes themselves.
These positive comments, however, are simply ways of improving programmes which, as we have stressed time and again, have been designed for purposes which bear no relation to their lofty titles.
These programmes aggressively impose the Euro-unifying education model in the field of education and youth and are designed to familiarise young people with so-called European ideals.
Having taken all these factors into account, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from voting.
. (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, because I believe that maintaining Community funds for promoting exchanges between European students, specifically under these two Community action programmes, Socrates and Youth for Europe, is extremely important.
Despite the shortcomings highlighted by the rapporteur and by the specialist parliamentary committee, not least the inadequacies of the programmes' development and administration, for which some suggestions have in fact been made, it must be acknowledged that a take-up rate of around 90% enables us to see the great importance and consequently, the considerable success that this type of programme has had, is having and will have in enriching and developing both future generations of Europeans and in contributing to lifelong learning, which is becoming increasingly necessary.
I therefore agree with maintaining these programmes and the budgetary approach that is proposed, because it is of crucial importance that we continue to promote the creation of a European educational area through informal educational experiences amongst young people, including physical mobility in particular, to promote lifelong learning, foreign language learning, greater use of new technologies in education and to promote cooperation at European level between the various Education providers concerned.
Mr President, next Thursday at 3 p.m, I am going to meet Professor Alexis Valas and his students from the Robert Schumann University in the University of Strasbourg, who, having been informed of Mr Fatuzzo's explanations of vote, have asked for a lesson on the subject.
I will tell these students that I voted for the DamiÃ£o report and called for precisely that for which they are going to ask me, namely for those who are exposed to asbestos in their workplaces to be authorised by Europe to work half a day only while being paid as if they were working full-time, with the cost of this being borne by all the other workers who have the good fortune to work in a healthier environment which does not put them at risk from serious illnesses such as asbestosis.
Mr President, in the context of the fight against terrorism, the Coelho report proposes, inter alia, the establishment by Council decision in each State of an office known as 'SIRENE'.
In Italian, the word sirene [mermaids] is used to describe beautiful women with fishes' tails, naked from the waist up, who live in the sea.
I therefore feel - and I had to vote for the report - that, with this system, the terrorists will be vanquished. How will the terrorists be able to resist the mermaids?
If I may, I would therefore recommend that the mermaids should have the features of Claudia Schiffer, Kim Basinger, Sabrina Ferilli and - why not - more recent stars such as Britney Spears, Shakira, Christina Aguilera and various others, that each person can add as they wish.
.
(PT) This initiative forms part of an approach of introducing proposals little by little in the aim of increasing discretionary powers, on the pretext of the fight against terrorism, in this case, through the completely unjustified creation of SIS-II.
This initiative must be rejected, because, in particular:
it allows bodies, particularly from third countries, to have easy access to information of a personal nature, without any sort of control;
it provides no guarantees that every proposal for the SIS's functioning will be approved by the Schengen Joint Supervisory Authority;
the argument and the concern about terrorism cannot be used as a pretext for creating files on citizens, for purely political reasons, which could lead to the SIS becoming a political information service, serving a future European police policy, with unforeseeable consequences for safeguarding citizens' freedoms and rights.
The Schengen Information System is an electronic system for recording, identifying and monitoring suspects and is used purely for policing and repressive purposes.
It is applied with a great deal of enthusiasm in order to suppress the burgeoning grass-roots movement opposed to European Union policy and to ensure that Fortress Europe keeps out immigrants.
Even though a great many complaints have been made, including by advocates of the SIS, about its lack of transparency and threat to human rights, the European Parliament assented last year to a new, second-generation system, on the pretext of fighting terrorism.
We would remind the House that the Schengen Information System started up in 1995, well before 11 September 2001.
The Spanish initiative, which the Coelho report endorses despite its rhetoric on protection of civil rights, proposes that all the repressive agencies of the ?U (Europol, Eurojust etc.) should have access to the system and that it should extend to new data categories.
The proposal to collect and exchange information on foreigners applying for residence permits, using the fight against terrorism as an excuse, is in keeping with the racist and xenophobic attitude of the rulers of the ?U.
This is an anti-democratic initiative and the grass-roots movement is fighting to reject both it and the Schengen Information System itself.
- (NL) The proposal before us implies a tacit shift in the function of the Schengen Information System from a monitoring tool in the context of the free movement of individuals to a detection tool in the context of the war against crime and terrorism.
Despite the fact that there is insufficient clarity about modalities, particularly supervision and data protection.
The rights of citizens are therefore insufficiently guaranteed in this proposal.
Mr President, if I may, I wanted to highlight the exceptional nature of Mr Bourlanges' report, which comes at just the right time, given the development of the Convention.
The Convention has been bled almost dry by a virtual IGC with the arrival of numerous Foreign Affairs ministers.
Thanks to Mr Bourlanges' report, it is the European Parliament that is restoring to the Convention its strength with the absolutely essential elements of clarity and a sense of perspective.
Clear legislation, because if we are all meant to be aware of the law, the legal categories must be perfectly clear, and a sense of perspective, because it is always important clearly to distinguish between constitutional data and actual policies.
Mr Bourlanges' report will contribute significantly to this.
In fact, we get the feeling that this is less a report than the framework for a Bourlanges Constitution.
We voted in favour of the report because a point of fundamental importance to us was otherwise being voted away.
Paragraph 5(2) proposed that the ratification procedure for a future constitution should be designed in such a way that a 'small minority' of Member States should not be able to oppose ratification.
That is unacceptable because this veto is one of the constitutional cornerstones of the EU.
We believe it would have been very unfortunate if the European Parliament had signalled to the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference that, as proposed by the report in its original form, a minority of a third of the EU Member States could be ignored.
Moreover, we wish to point out that it would not be especially appropriate to demand that future constitutional proposals from a Convention could not be changed by the European Council without the Convention's approval.
The Convention's democratic representativeness in such a case cannot be seen to be greater than that of the governments.
We wish to emphasise that, even though we are in principle in favour of extending the codecision procedure and the procedure whereby decisions are taken by qualified majority to include all legislation, we believe there may be a requirement for unanimous decision-making where foreign and security policy is concerned.
We also wish to point out that codecision in connection with the procedure laid down in Article 139 should not mean any restriction in the ability of the two sides of industry autonomously to reach agreements.
Codecision must not lead to a shift in current procedure whereby the material content of agreements is examined, something that would not be the role of the legislative authority.
One of the Convention's core tasks is to make proposals for simplifying and clarifying legal instruments and rules of procedure used by the EU, as well as to clarify which powers the Member States have delegated to the EU.
The Convention's efforts to bring about a uniform decision-making structure based on codecision and the Community model within a combined 'constitutional treaty' amount to important changes with a view to democratising the EU's decision-making process and making it easier to grasp.
The report contains sound proposals for new terminology aimed at clarifying the ways in which the EU's legal instruments work and at making the decision-making process more easily accessible.
The report makes it clear that the EU can only act in areas delegated by the Member States.
Those areas that the Member States choose to delegate are characterised by the clear added value entailed in cooperation as distinct from the Member States' acting individually, especially with regard to the internal market and the joint combating of serious cross-border crime.
The report is unclear regarding whether treaty changes should only be based on the outcome of the Convention and whether future conventions need to approve possible changes by intergovernmental conferences to the conventions' recommendations.
An obligation on the part of future intergovernmental conferences to comply with the Convention would fundamentally alter the relationship between the EU and the Member States.
The requirement of unanimity in the case of treaty changes must be maintained.
The ratification processes must be respected and continue to operate as they do at present.
What is also unclear is whether it will be possible for the proposed laws supplementary to the constitution, based on decision-making by qualified majority, to determine how the EU is funded in future.
The funding of the EU must be decided upon unanimously.
The Moderates are opposed to proposals that may lead to the EU's being funded by EU taxes.
. (FR) In the minority opinion annexed to the Bourlanges report, I criticised, in particular, the proposal in paragraph 5 to allow the Treaties to be revised by majority vote, albeit an extremely qualified majority vote, instead of unanimously.
Taking Europe further along its current path, this method would distance the Member States from the European decision-making process.
One of our Luxemburgish fellow Members, Mr Poos, former Foreign Affairs Minister for his country, and former President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, has written to Mr Bourlanges to tell him this.
Stating 'that no Member State will agree to a change to fundamental law being imposed on them against their will', he adds: 'the citizens of States thus made a minority will reject a Europe with vague authoritarian ideas.
As many successive constitutional changes are made, an increasing number of Member States could be reduced to the status of vassal states.
We can imagine the result in terms of adhesion to the Community project'.
In the end, the adopted resolution contained a more vague passage on this point, but the intent remains.
In any case, the spirit of this proposal is more widely present in the idea of the report (and the Convention) to make codecision with a qualified majority in the Council the rule, without counterbalancing it with any national veto system.
We almost feel sorry for the rapporteur, who tries to introduce a little order into what he himself terms 'chaos', in other words the jumble of contradictory or inapplicable rules, regulations and directives resulting from the horse-trading that has taken place between Member States throughout what we incorrectly call European integration.
The chaos he criticises is not just in the texts, however, but also in reality.
There is total conflict between the process underway, which is developing according to the varying degrees of pressure from rival private interests defended by the Member States, and genuine unification creating a borderless Europe with a rationally-organised economy at European level.
In wanting to reconcile European unification with competing capitalist interests, the report is reduced to squaring the circle.
This report falls in line with the prospect of the federalist integration of the European Union, and points towards establishing a constitution, striving to increase the supranational powers of the European Parliament by extending codecision. It consequently advocates extending the use of qualified majority voting in the Council with the communitarisation of a greater number of policies.
The resolution also strives to change the method of amending the Treaties and advocates the institutionalisation of the 'convention' method with increased powers, laying down different amending processes - making a distinction between what is known as the 'constitutional' part and the 'policy' part - and opening up the possibility of the national parliaments no longer being able to play their full role in ratifying the Treaties.
Although we welcome the withdrawal of this resolution, as proposed by my group, from the point where it recommends the end of decision-making by unanimity in the Council for any revision of the Treaties (when what is at stake are issues as crucial as the decision to transfer national competences to the EU), the resolution envisages an EU legal system that takes precedence over those of the Member States, thereby increasing the powers of its supranational institutions.
It even proposes creating a new institution, by institutionalising the 'convention', laying the foundations for creating a future 'European State' and undermining national sovereignty and independence, not least of Portugal.
Hence our vote against the report.
- (NL) The rules presently applying in the EU form an incoherent patchwork.
They have emerged over the course of fifty years via treaties, ordinances and directives, with the Court of Justice having to act as arbiter.
It is unclear to the citizens of Europe who is responsible for those rules, how far-reaching they are and how they can be changed.
In the EU, ordinance is the name for direct legislation at the most centralised level, while the same term is used in the Netherlands for rules established by municipalities and provinces within the scope allowed by national legislation.
The word 'directive' creates the impression that these are non-binding recommendations, hence well-meaning advice.
In reality national parliaments are forced to establish corresponding legislation within two years, so that the essence of the decision to be taken there has already been established before public discussion of its desirability can get under way.
Anyone wanting a European superstate with lots of centralised legislation will be given an excellent overview by the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges of the relation between constitution, ordinary legislation, programme legislation, framework legislation, organic legislation and financial legislation.
I do not support his intentions, but I do support his clarity.
He quite rightly wants executive measures of the European Commission to be submitted for the approval of this Parliament if we register an objection within three months.
Given the talent that Mr Bourlanges normally demonstrates, we could have expected more from him than this report of no great value, which, in particular, is certainly not distinguished by originality.
The hierarchy of legislation he proposes (constitutional bloc, organic laws, ordinary laws) is nothing more than an exact copy of that laid down by the French Constitution of the Fifth Republic.
Furthermore, insofar as the hierarchy of legislation necessarily implies a hierarchy of functions and bodies, the rapporteur does nothing less than set out a new Community architecture that reproduces the Member State's constitutional model at European level.
As with any exercise of this kind, institutional mimicry does, however, have its limits.
Is it really appropriate to attempt to transpose to Community level the constitutional model that is common to the Member States?
The answer is clearly 'No'.
What the rapporteur is forgetting when he substitutes European law for current legislation, obviously requiring the extension of the codecision procedure in doing so, or when he mentions a reform of the procedure for revising the Treaties, is that the Union, even equipped with an identical political system to that of the Member States, will always lack the essential factor: democratic legitimacy.
. (PT) I broadly share the legal assessment this report makes of the Community legal system.
One could hardly agree more with the rapporteur's observation that we are facing real legislative, procedural and linguistic chaos; and even more so when he says that the inconsistency between the various categories of legal acts of which this system comprises is making it unintelligible to members of the public, even the most well informed about legal issues.
The current framework ignores any principle for designating legal acts and is based on terms that are frequently obscure and sometimes misleading.
Nevertheless, I could not support the report when, in political terms, it seeks to take advantage of this need to establish a coherent typology of Community laws and a logical hierarchy of acts - a legislative necessity - in order to move forwards in the 'long march' of the highly debatable federalist and constitutional doctrine, presuming that a 'de facto' sovereign European State with constituent power already exists and goes so far as to omit any reference whatsoever to national parliaments or actually proposing to end the procedure based on the Treaties themselves.
The fact is that giving the Community legal system coherence and clarity by no means requires imposing a federal legislative framework and this is something we all know.
I have, therefore, voted against the report, whilst regretting that the rapporteur - who has produced a technically superb piece of work - should have blundered into what I consider to be federalist opportunism.
. (FR) This report, without commenting on content - the advantages for consumers of the ionisation process, which it does not contest - highlights a number of dangers and instances of abuse in this field.
We are only voting for this report because it advocates prudence, which we consider beneficial to consumers.
The real problem does not arise from the ionisation process itself as much as from the use to which it is put.
Although it can already be applied to the benefit of producers and consumers (conservation of foods, eradication of parasites, etc.), the agri-food and mass marketing sectors, concerned solely with increasing their profits, can turn the process against users.
The report illustrates this danger: the consumer is not warned by adequate labelling that the product, despite its appearance achieved through ionisation, will nevertheless deteriorate, and this has already led to food poisoning (cases of fatal exposure of workers to ionising products have been reported in some companies).
Once again, where an innovative process could lead to progress for the people, the irresponsibility induced by market pressures is dangerous as operators disregard human life and health in the pursuit of capitalist profit.
. (PT) The final report is to be welcomed because it upholds the current restrictive list of products.
It is also to be welcomed that it insists on the immediate removal of all products falsely labelled 'Not Irradiated' when this claim has been disproved by the appropriate tests.
It should be remembered that the precautionary principle must always be observed.
The issue is that any technology needs to prove the benefits of its use and take account of the potential risks to health and to the environment, given that food-irradiation technology is highly problematic.
In fact, on the basis of a civilian use of nuclear energy, this appears to have no other use apart from replacing the normal hygiene and safety rules that processed foods should already follow.
There also appear to be no benefits to consumers because, apart from the risks of improper use, with the possibility of poisoning, irradiation makes it more difficult for the consumer to discern the true state of the product.
Consequently, the overriding aim of this technology appears to be something else - speeding up the liberalisation of international trade and increasing the centralisation/concentration of the mass production and distribution of foods throughout the world, with consequences for the delocalisation of agri-food production and for the decline of small-scale local farmers, thereby calling sustainable development into question.
Mr President, British Labour Members voted against the report because our amendments to remove errors of fact were not carried.
These errors remain in paragraphs 15, 22, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32 and 33.
In addition, the following paragraphs contain statements which are not supported by the evidence and findings of the lessons to be learned and Royal Society reports: paragraphs 6, 16 and 25.
The following paragraphs contain statements not in line with the balance of evidence presented to the committee or contain errors of fact of lesser importance than those to which amendments were tabled: paragraphs 3, 7, 9, 11, 20, 21, 34 and 57.
Mr President, I voted against this report, not because I do not support the recommendations on the way forward in the event of another unfortunate outbreak of foot and mouth disease, but because of the basic inaccuracies in the preamble.
I prefer to vote for fact and not fiction and, because certain people wish to obscure the truth with political fiction, I have voted against.
It has been claimed that over 10 million animals were slaughtered during the foot and mouth outbreak but owners have only claimed compensation for 6.5 million.
