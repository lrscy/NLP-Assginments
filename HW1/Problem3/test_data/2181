I call, on behalf of my political group and as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safetyfor the Commission to apply the 'polluter pays' principle at long last, not only to those who owned the vessel but also to those who owned the product, the cargo, and to everyone else involved in this saga.
The basic political conclusion, if we are honest, is that rich industry in the north must stop using poorer countries in the south as one big illegal dumping ground for toxic waste.
We are talking about 2 200 tonnes of waste, containing carcinogenic chromium, contaminating the waters of the Mediterranean and we know full well that contamination has cross-border repercussions.
Commissioner, it is time for action, not just the right words.
Â Â  Mr President, it is self-evident that things went badly wrong for the waste ship in south-western Turkey.
It is also clear that this disaster could have been avoided.
Now, more than 300 million litres of water have been polluted, and the clearing operation will require huge investments.
It is much more important, however, to look for ways to avoid situations like this in future.
This particularly applies to the implementation and enforcement of the Basel Convention and the European Regulation for the movement of waste, on the review of which I have, as rapporteur, been working hard for more than a year now.
The current Regulation clearly stipulates that Member States need to take back their cargo if it is refused for good reason.
In November last year, the European Parliament proposed to extend the grounds for refusal.
I would take this opportunity of calling on the Commission to adopt these proposals by this House.
The carried hazardous waste, and, as it is extremely unusual for a ship to set sail without authorisation from the receiving country, it appears that Spain acted in contravention of the rules.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission to take additional enforcement measures, and, if need be, legal action.
Â Â  Mr President, in this debate about the environmental disaster involving the , I hope that you will allow me to make a few observations that I see as being of fundamental importance.
Firstly, the environmental disaster that we potentially face has to do with toxic waste from thermal power stations, so maybe the time has come to stop pointing to nuclear energy as the only scapegoat.
In my country, for example, the government has committed itself to phasing out nuclear energy completely within the foreseeable future.
It is very questionable whether the environment will eventually derive benefits from this, since there are no real alternatives at present and this is once again an illustration of the fact that the very real and serious problem of toxic waste is not only the result of nuclear energy.
Secondly, I am a Euro-sceptic.
I am very critical of European interference and of excessive intervention at European level in the politics and culture of our Member States, with the exception of environmental protection, which requires the closest possible cooperation.
Indeed, this is one of the few areas â and one in which progress has been minimal â in which this very close cooperation is an absolute necessity and can also be democratically legitimised by public approval.
Thirdly, we are once again establishing that we must strive towards the best possible relations with our neighbouring country, Turkey.
I fear for the future if a blind Europeanism in this neighbouring country were to create the impression that it could, in time, really become a member of our European Union.
Neither geographically, culturally, nor historically is Turkey a European country, and we must now have the courage to say so, and only on the basis of this candid stance can we, both now and in the future, maintain the best and closest friendly relations with our Turkish neighbour.
Â Â  â Mr President, although I do not want to drag matters out, there is something remarkable about a ship being held somewhere for four years, a ship that has already been the subject of 18 proceedings for transporting prohibited materials, and one that is over 35 years old.
The effect of the over recent years, has been some small progress in lawmaking, and if the Member States were to be more prompt in processing the Commissionâs proposals, we might well make some progress as regards pollution of the environment and criminal law.
It is not the Commission that is dragging its feet, but the Member States.
Even though we are seeing a changeover to a new Commission and will not be able to sort this out this evening, let me ask, Commissioner, that the Commission should respond to this calamity by producing a proper report with good analysis of both the environmental and transport aspects; then it might put forward some proposals for legislation, perhaps as part of the package.
Then we will be able to use European law to close the loopholes whose presence this calamity has made so obvious, or, where there is negligence or a lack of vigilance, we will know who is responsible.
It will enable the imposition of sanctions for sloppy work.
I think it would be possible to do this over the next few months, so that we not merely learn from this catastrophe, but also make our seas rather safer in future than they have been in the past.
Â Â  â Mr President, the shipwreck of the , carrying toxic waste without a consignee between Spain, Algeria and Turkey, and another ecological disaster, which will even have repercussions on the food chain, via fish, confirm what we too have been saying in the European Parliament for years now: that toxic waste management and pollution of the marine environment cannot be addressed solely as crimes, because everything still takes second place to safeguarding and increasing the profits of big business, which controls the sources of energy and production, and of shipowners, who control the means of transport.
Who, after this accident, which has been waiting to happen for years, given that the ship was moored in the port of Iskenderun for four years, would now dare to claim, as crowing reports and expert opinions have claimed from time to time, that 80% of accidents are due to human error?
We have always denounced such claims as mistaken, unscientific and suspicious, because they endeavour to conceal the fact that toxic and nuclear waste are transported unchecked from large, monopoly-owned factories with the backing of governments, state authorities and shipping companies, while at the same time revealing the adverse consequences of an old fleet and poor surveys.
The sole purpose of initiatives to date, including those of the European Union, has been to prevent a public outcry by concealing who is responsible and promoting the interests of big business.
I think that the baton for action needs to be passed to the grass-roots movement, so that it can overturn this policy, introduce strict measures governing the transportation of toxic and nuclear waste and, on a more general note, protect human life, the sea, public health and the environment.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, we have a common interest in keeping our seas safe and preventing environmental catastrophes of this kind.
I would, of course, never contradict the Commission's statement â probably supported by all institutions â that we should learn from accidents of this kind.
We should also do everything to prevent this continuing to be only the tip of the iceberg.
We also know that there is a lot of money involved in wasted shipments; but I do not accept that the Commission should take the blame for everything that has happened in this particular case.
It is not the responsibility of the Commission alone.
We have a responsibility, we will accept that to the full; but in this case, I repeat, the problem should have been prevented at source.
It is not entirely a legal problem or to do with something missing in the legislation, but it is a combination of illegal actions and legal and administrative problems, which delayed a solution until it was too late.
We have to concentrate on implementing environmental legislation to the full, thus avoiding problems of this kind.
Of course, we will see if there is anything to be learned from this.
Can we act in a better way, can we prevent this happening in the future?
It is also very clear from the existing legislation where the responsibility lies.
It is not that this case opens up enormous gaps in the existing legislation, but rather how the legislation is being interpreted, implemented and enforced in different Member States.
The issue was raised about the âpolluter paysâ principle, which is one of the fundamental principles in EU legislation and in EU environmental policy.
But in this case the pollution has taken place outside the EU where, of course, the Commission has no competence to apply EU law.
We have to get the facts right.
I hope this discussion will prove fruitful for the future, because it is in our common interest to make sure that this does not happen again and that we learn lessons and can keep our seas safe.
It is very important that enforcement is also carried out, to make sure that the signal goes out to all actors in cases like this.
Thank you for a good debate.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(1)
Please note that yesterday evening the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted the report by MrÂ Bourlanges.
Â Â  . Mr President, please excuse me, but the time it took to find the rapporteur, to get him seated, and to find him a microphone that works, means that his speaking time is pretty well used up.
I simply wanted to say that we are in fact requesting urgent procedure for the measures relating to the freezing of the assets of war criminals in the former Yugoslavia.
Our committee had already debated this before being asked to do so, which we were in fact doing only yesterday.
The Council has asked us for urgent procedure, and we regard that request as justified for the very simple reason that, as my grandmother used to say fifty years ago, you do not want to wait until the cows have gone before shutting the gate to the enclosure.
What that means is that, if we want to act effectively in freezing the assets of war criminals, the procedure for doing so must be adopted as soon as possible.
I therefore endorse the Councilâs request for urgent procedure, as does the committee of which I am chairman.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my Committee, I ask that the request for urgent procedure be refused.
The funding to be allocated to the new financial instrument for the Turkish Cypriot community â amounting to EURÂ 259 million â relates to the period from 2004 to 2006.
Only EURÂ 6 million was provided this year for feasibility studies, so this should not be a problem.
I would add that the legal basis â Article 308, in consequence of which Parliament is still consulted â is not uncontentious, and I am being cautious in my use of language when I say that.
I can also tell you, however, that, although we have no difficulties of any substance as regards the content of the Commission proposal, the political significance of this issue means that we do need more time to examine it more closely.
What I would propose to you is that we should make a prompt start on the work and come to a decision on this point at this Houseâs second October part-session.
I think that this delay should not give rise to any problems when it comes to playing our part in improving relations between the two ethnic communities.
I would ask you to support the proposal.
Â Â  â Mr President, I just wanted to say, on behalf of my group, that we endorse the view expressed by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, that this is not a vote on the content, but about our shared view that this matter needs prompt and thorough discussion.
The message we should be sending to the world out there is that we are ready to discuss this, but not as a matter of urgent and topical importance.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I should now like to address you as President of the House.
I will begin by saying how honoured I am that you have decided to place your trust in me and choose me as President of Parliament.
At the time you elected me, I said I would wait until this plenary sitting to outline my strategic vision of the first half of this legislature to you.
Obviously, this does not entail presenting a political programme or putting forward my own ideas on the building of Europe.
As President, my aim is simply to describe the priorities on our agenda and place them in context.
As I do so, I should like to share with you my pride in belonging to this, the greatest of all multinational parliamentary institutions.
It stands for peace and democracy whilst respecting diversity.
Although many Europeans are not sufficiently aware of the fact, this House is a forum for debates and decisions affecting our daily lives and the future of the world we are to live in.
Our shared pride must go hand in hand with a sense of responsibility. It is incumbent on us to be responsible as we exercise our powers, determine our stance on international affairs, and ensure the smooth operation of this enlarged Parliament.
The Unionâs legitimacy springs from two sources.
One is to be found in this House and flows from the citizens of Europe it represents.
There is no reason why it should always be in line with the other, which flows from the MemberÂ States.
This Parliament now brings together 25Â parliamentary traditions.
It expresses itself in 20Â official and working languages, with the consequent expense and complexity.
Even this large number of languages does not reflect the whole of Europeâs linguistic diversity, as I am often reminded.
I have had occasion to discharge the aforementioned responsibility during the last few days of the summer break. It has been my sad duty to issue a series of statements on behalf of the House, condemning unequivocally those terrorist attacks and actions inflicted on different parts of the world in a most cruel and savage manner.
The EuropeanÂ Parliament is therefore at one with all democrats in expressing its sadness and solidarity with all of those families so unfairly cast into mourning by that brutal scourge that unfortunately no country is now free from.
I approached the 25Â Heads of State or Government of the MemberÂ States of the Union with a view to expressing this feeling in the most solemn and collective manner possible. I suggested all schools across the Union should join us, the representatives of the citizens of Europe, in a minuteâs silence today in memory of the child victims of the Beslan school killings and more generally, in memory of all other child victims of terrorism.
I am happy to say that several countries have already agreed to participate, thus allowing European citizens to express their feelings on these terrible events.
This House condemns and rejects all terrorist acts because, regardless of its affiliation or the country where it takes place, terrorism negates the very values on which the EuropeanÂ Union is based.
The people hope a united Europe will be better able to combat this threat, which is one of the main causes of concern and insecurity in the region.
I am bound to say that expressing the horror we feel is not enough.
When condemnations follow each other in quick succession, our words of anguish come to reflect frustration and impotence.
There can be no excuse or reason for events as ghastly as those we witnessed towards the end of the summer or for what took place on 11Â September in NewÂ York, or on 11Â March in Madrid.
Terrorism of all kinds is to be condemned. The debate currently taking place at world level, however, especially in our western and developed world, concerns how to combat terrorism in all its forms, rather than condemning it.
Obviously, suicidal fanaticism will not be brought to an end by reasonable arguments put forward by cultured and intelligent individuals.
On the other hand, one cannot expect to eliminate all its causes through the simple and indiscriminate use of force, taking revenge on other children for the harm inflicted on our own and triggering an unbearable spiral of violence.
The war on terrorism will not be won if terrorism is perceived as a conventional war.
This House should develop the area of freedom and security. It must actively promote an anti-terrorist strategy based on international cooperation involving the police, the judiciary and the intelligence services.
International cooperation is also needed to tackle the underlying causes breeding murderous and suicidal fanaticism.
No analysis equates to justification.
Parliamentâs debates and resolutions should never be interpreted as justification for terrorist violence.
The fight against terrorism requires us to consider its causes in order to combat it more effectively.
Parliament must continue to debate with full freedom of conscience, as it has done to date. In particular, it must consider the situation in Chechnya, in Iraq and in Palestine, regardless of the angry reactions that may follow.
Ladies and gentlemen, a further source of concern and insecurity in Europe has featured in the news this summer.
I refer to the increasingly common decision to transfer companiesâ economic activity within an integrated economic area, in order to benefit from a more favourable fiscal and labour situation.
This has become known as relocation.
You will have noted that this phenomenon produces a defensive reaction in certain MemberÂ States that can impact on the Unionâs solidarity policies.
It certainly makes very clear the conflict of interest between economic competitiveness and social cohesion.
These two aims ought to be complementary for us.
Both are vital to the building of Europe and to the LisbonÂ Strategy in particular.
This is all more complicated than it appears.
A simple numerical comparison of labour costs is probably not the only explanation of the phenomenon.
The debate is bound to be of particular interest to those Europeans hoping Europe will prove to be a solution, not a problem.
It should therefore feature prominently in Parliamentâs work, and mainstreamed in the many issues filling our agenda. I shall refer to these later.
I venture to remind you first that the primary duty of the House is to contribute to the optimum performance of the enlarged Parliament. Romania and Bulgaria will soon be represented here too.
It is important for Parliament to bear in mind that it is an institution in receipt of public funds facing new challenges of size and efficiency.
I shall myself chair a working group tasked with ensuring that the size of the House does not detract from its effectiveness.
Two issues are particularly significant in this connection, namely the StatuteÂ forÂ Members and the language regime.
I stated earlier that the Statute would be a priority issue.
Accordingly, on 8Â September, I met with MrÂ Balkenende, President-in-Office of the Council, who assured me that he would make contact as appropriate with representatives of the governments that were unable to endorse the draft Statute, and establish what alternative measures they had in mind.
I should remind you that Parliament was never informed of the reasons why certain countries were unable to agree to the draft.
I do not believe that the consensus reached in the House should be jeopardised until this information is received.
I would like to reiterate, however, that we remain fully prepared to enter into dialogue and open to any suggestions made by the Council or the MemberÂ States best placed to promote an agreement.
Concerning the language regime, I must remind the House that its implementation is governed by provisions laid down by the Bureau of the previous Parliament, through a CodeÂ ofÂ Conduct on Multilingualism.
I appeal to all Members, especially to the committee bureaux and coordinators, to make every effort to ensure correct application of the Code, bearing in mind the scant interpreting and translation resources available.
It will be some time before the situation improves.
I urge you all to make a sustained effort to adjust the language cover for working meetings to the resources available.
In the previous plenary certain Members argued for the right to express themselves in their mother tongue, even when it is not yet an official Union language. In this regard, I must point out to them that the language regime is authorised by Council agreements.
A unanimous decision in Council is required. Until the relevant decisions are taken, the Presidency must insist on compliance with the RulesÂ ofÂ Procedure, regardless of its personal views on the matter.
I should also like to emphasise that if and when the Constitutional Treaty is ratified, the European Parliament will come of age. It will then have a framework in which its roles and responsibilities are defined once and for all.
Nonetheless, if it is eventually ratified, the Constitution will not come into force until 1Â NovemberÂ 2006.
In the meantime, one of the main tasks before the House is to stimulate a wide-ranging debate on ratification of the ConstitutionalÂ Treaty.
Between 29 October, the date when the Constitutional Treaty is to be signed in Rome, and 1Â NovemberÂ 2006, when it is due to come into force, my Presidency will be dominated by the ratification of the EuropeanÂ Constitution in the 25 Member States.
Ratifications are set to take place at the rate of roughly one a month. In most cases, the procedure will involve a referendum.
My home country, Spain, will be the first to hold its referendum, in February 2005.
This two-year period will be an excellent opportunity for Europeans to learn about the Europe they wish to create, as it is defined in the text. It will be a chance for the citizens to assess what such a Europe could mean for them and why it is important for them.
Members of this House are called upon to be at the service of the citizens.
Creative ways of communicating with the latter and establishing helpful positions for them must be found.
A report drafted by Mr Corbett and MrÂ Mendez de Vigo and debated in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is to be adopted before the end of the year.
Parliament must strive to become a genuine European assembly. It must become a model of open, plural and democratic debate.
It must not be dismissive, hypocritical or claim a monopoly over European spirit or logic.
Nobody can claim ownership of the one true idea of Europe.
The debate is bound to be complex due to the range of identities and ideologies, and the different ways in which the various parties understand the notion of Europe we want to achieve.
This is why the key issues in the draft Constitution must be dealt with in the CommitteeÂ onÂ ConstitutionalÂ Affairs, in major debates.
I have asked the Chairman of this committee to forward me specific proposals on which to base the parliamentary debate.
The debate itself is not as important as the way it is perceived by the citizens, however.
The latter need to be informed on the nature of the Constitution, on what it does and does not actually contain.
It is crucial for them to vote on the text of the ConstitutionalÂ Treaty itself, and not in response to the political situation in each of their countries.
Once Parliament has formed its opinion, it must ensure that its view is known and taken into account in the ratification process.
It is most regrettable that the latter will not be more genuinely pan-European, close to the people, and that it will not take place in all countries!
Our main challenge must be to Europeanise the debate and ensure internal political issues do not impinge on it, as was the case in the recent European elections.
The House will liaise with the national parliaments. It already worked closely with the latter during the Convention.
In addition, I shall personally chair a working group tasked with promoting the Constitution as a political project that will be the subject of the most significant debate Europeans have engaged in since they set out together to journey into the future, leaving behind the devastation of war.
I invite you all to play your part.
Parliament needs to deal with some more pressing issues beforehand.
The first of these is the investiture of the Commission.
Certain press reports have alleged that this is merely a formality.
There are those who believe that the outcome is a foregone conclusion, and that the House will simply go through the motions, and not provide any added political value.
You know that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen.
The House must prove it to the world.
Members are entitled to their views on the BarrosoÂ Commission.
Nonetheless, its investiture presents a splendid opportunity to make the main guidelines of its programme known. It is also an opportunity to become acquainted with the personal and political talents of the men and women who make up the incoming Commission, and to become aware of what Parliamentâs political groups are demanding of it.
The Commission is, of course, the engine of the Communityâs government.
At the start of my address I referred to two major issues currently causing insecurity in Europe, namely terror and the social factors affecting employment.
The new Commissionâs statements and proposals on these two subjects are eagerly anticipated, as are its views on reform of the StabilityÂ Pact.
The ProdiÂ Commissionâs initial response is already known, and it is also known that the Commissioner concerned will remain in office.
There will also be an opportunity to continue debating the proposed reform of this Pact, which has such considerable bearing on the LisbonÂ Strategy.
MrÂ Barroso has placed it at the top of his agenda.
Questions must be asked concerning how the Commission intends to make Europe a model where environmental issues, sustainable development and development aid are concerned.
The Commissionâs views on the concentration of the media in Europe, and on how it might react to this problem, also need to be ascertained.
It is important to establish the Commissionâs approach to the relationship between Europe and other continents and with the Islamic world, and also its approach to the development of the Euro-Mediterranean relationship and reinvigorating the flagging Barcelona process.
We are eager to learn what kind of relationship the Commission intends to forge with this House, and how it envisages its relationship with the Councilâs High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy during this transitional stage.
All these issues will be raised.
An effort will also be made to ensure that hearings are livelier, more spontaneous and less rigid than in the past.
Once the Commission has been invested, in my capacity as President of this House, I shall call on it to increase its presence in the EuropeanÂ Parliament.
I shall ask the President of the Commission to hold regular meetings with the presidents of the political groups.
I shall ask the Council to do likewise, particularly MrÂ Solana, the EuropeanÂ Union High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The House must continue its usual legislative work, in which the ReachÂ Directive on chemical products stands out. In addition, however, there are three important matters to be discussed before the end of the year.
Given its strategic importance, I shall mention Turkey first.
The ConferenceÂ ofÂ Presidents is due to receive the Prime Minister of Turkey, Mr Erdogan, on 23Â September, as we hoped. Mr Erdogan will therefore visit Parliament prior to the Commission tabling its report, as was our wish.
In theory, Parliament has no say in the decision on whether or not to open accession negotiations in December. Consequently, the House is not required to express its view on the matter.
It would, however, be inconceivable for us not to make our voice heard at the start of this long journey because at the end of it, whenever that might be, the agreement of the House will be required.
It should be borne in mind that the important thing about journeys is not their length, but where they lead.
In my view, the House should prepare a report on the accession of Turkey before the December EuropeanÂ Council, so that we can make our views known to the latter.
Ladies and gentlemen, issues such as Turkish accession serve to justify Parliamentâs existence.
They are an opportunity for the House to become involved, and cease to be a mere spectator.
Decisions of this nature could be times when the two sources of legitimacy do not coincide.
Governments may come to a different conclusion from the people.
It is certainly an excellent opportunity to debate the nature of the Europe we hope to create, and the consequences of going about it in one way rather than another.
It is very much to be hoped, therefore, that the Commission will produce an objective report. This would enable the House and the Council to form a political judgment in full awareness of the consequences of a decision one way or the other.
I refer to the implications of Turkeyâs accession for the Union, and the implications its rejection could have for our relations with the Islamic world.
The same applies to acceptance or rejection of the Constitution.
Parliament needs to free itself from all preconceived ideas and unfounded reactions as it engages in this debate.
The debate should be seen as part of the strategic perspective, with a view to the medium term.
This is because the House needs to be aware, as I am sure it is, that the most important challenge facing the Europe of the future is its relationship with the Islamic world. That relationship involves Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine.
It is also a relationship underpinned by a new neighbourhood policy, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the integration of immigrants into our cities.
There are 10Â million Muslims in Europe and 1Â 000Â million in the world.
Regardless of the decision taken, it is incumbent on us to prove to the Islamic world that we do not set our borders according to the clash of civilisations some are determined to bring about.
By way of contribution to our debate, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform you that I have received a report drawn up for the Commission by an expert group including three distinguished Members of this House. The report has kindly been made available to the EuropeanÂ Parliament.
Allow me to suggest that it is well worth reading.
The House will also need to take a decision on the financial perspectives before the end of the year.
The Commission has completed its initial draft and we are due to receive it shortly.
Clearly, the Unionâs financial resources need to be in line with our ambitions and allow the expectations enlargement has raised in many citizens to be met, whilst taking account of the concerns it has raised amongst others. The 2007-2013 financial package contains more than budgetary proposals.
It is much more than a budget.
It is a reference framework for a whole range of legislative proposals on financing the common agricultural policy, the StructuralÂ Funds, youth programmes, Trans-European networks and so on. The final shape of the reference framework approved will determine almost all of our legislative tasks.
The House will have a vital role to play in the adoption of a legislative package.
Its role in the adoption of this package composed of over 50Â proposals will be essential, as it will have to be adopted by the codecision or assent procedures.
This will be another excellent opportunity to show Parliament is not simply a talking shop, but a body that actually takes decisions on specific issues with far-reaching consequences.
It will in fact be a unique opportunity for the House to promote its political priorities.
The citizens of Europe cannot fail to take this on board if we contrive to translate our jargon into their everyday language.
To this end, I have suggested to the ConferenceÂ ofÂ Presidents that a temporary committee be set up to launch the debate, bringing together all the points of view from which it should be approached. The plenary is to decide on this today.
The budget is the hub where all the spokes of the European wheel come together.
All its details need careful consideration.
That is why I believe that an committee, possibly chaired by the PresidentÂ ofÂ Parliament, would send out a clear message on the importance we attach to this task.
It is essential to keep in mind that the financial perspective links in with other aspects of our policies the citizens are constantly hearing about, though I suspect they fail to grasp their full implications.
I have in mind the LisbonÂ Strategy and the StabilityÂ Pact.
One might well wonder what is supposed to be stabilised, and if it is prices, why only them.
By 2005, five years will have elapsed since the Union decided to set itself the aim of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
Does the House not think all this is beginning to ring rather hollow, and that the significant political implications involved were not accompanied by the democratic debate needed to generate the spark required for growth?
It has to be recognised that the Lisbon objectives are not being met, and that it seems unlikely that they will be between now and 2010.
It is incumbent on Parliament to sound a note of concern regarding this vital objective for the future of the Union.
It keeps being restated, like a mantra, whilst insufficient thought has probably been given to how best to attain it.
MrÂ Kok will be invited to present the report he is charged with drawing up, concerning the shortcomings of the process and its prospects for the future.
I believe debate in the House should centre on this report.
The objectives set out at Lisbon were extremely ambitious, and were established against the background of the economic prosperity enjoyed in 2000, shortly before the start of the crisis that was later intensified by terrorism.
This must be admitted, as should the fact that the objectives were the subject of an intergovernmental process relying on the good will of the MemberÂ States for their implementation, through a coordination procedure in need of strengthening.
It is well known that throughout this period investment in technology has been low in comparison with the UnitedÂ States, and that the latter is still draining off our best brains.
This probably calls for a focused debate.
Human capital is not being developed as was decided at Lisbon.
The LisbonÂ Process goes hand in hand with the increased prominence given to environmental policies.
Like the Maastricht criteria, Kyoto will put pressure on Europe.
Our society will be forced to change its methods of production and consumption in a way that the citizens may not yet be sufficiently aware of.
We are in favour of this, but will have to consider what it means and fulfil the ensuing obligations.
Turning to the proposed reform of the StabilityÂ andÂ Growth Pact, I believe Parliament should make an effort of political imagination to make it work for the LisbonÂ Strategy, even though the House only has limited competence in this area.
More generally, I feel Parliament should endeavour to bring more democratic debate to bear on the main guidelines of European economic policy.
The debate must take place in this House, with the involvement of national parliaments, so that they feel part of European decisions with consequences for budgetary debates in each country.
In this connection, I welcome the arrival of MrÂ Juncker, known as MrÂ Euro.
It is certainly true that we did have a problem in Europe regarding the call for greater coordination of economic policy.
It will of course be necessary to study the role played by the EuropeanÂ Union at world level. Special attention must be paid to transatlantic relations.
I think the time has come for the House to demonstrate the maturity and responsibility of its parliamentary diplomacy by working more closely with the Commission and the Council on the international scene.
Ladies and gentlemen, the EuropeanÂ Union is a role model for the rest of the world.
The founding fathers had a vision of a united and reconciled continent. That so-called European dream has now come true.
Unfortunately, it has lost its democratic magic in the process. It no longer has the power to stir wills and engender active consensus.
Allow me to set you a challenge, ladies and gentlemen.
Dare one dream a different European dream, a dream of a more pluralistic Europe?
Dare one dream of a Europe that differs from the one the founding fathers and the six founding MemberÂ States had in mind?
Is it possible to fashion an ideal for a civilisation based on inclusiveness, which would help combat intolerance, the rejection of immigrants, ethnic conflict and religious intolerance?
I believe Parliament must engage in this endeavour.
After all, most of the citizens it represents realise, at least intuitively, that none of their countries will be able to cope with globalisation on their own. No single country will be able to deal with environmental imbalances either, or with the emergence of so-called Continent States, terrorist threats, poverty or the resulting immigration.
Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for the citizens of Europe to make their voice heard.
I want to work shoulder to shoulder with you, and hope we can succeed in mobilising the peoples of our continent and in breathing new life into its societies, so that this new European dream can come true.
Good luck and thank you very much for your attention.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, thank the President for his speech.
It is, I think, clear that this House as a whole can endorse the broad outlines that you have sketched out, and we will support you in your effort to strengthen the hand of the European Parliament, in so far as we are able to do so.
You spoke as the representative of what is one of the most important institutions in the European Union, if not the most important.
Let me say, in the presence of the Vice-President of the Commission, that I very much regret â and this is not a criticism of the Dutch Presidency, but of the Councilâs General Secretariat â that the Council is not present on this important day.
That is something that will have to change.
In the past, too, we have heard Presidents of the Commission outline their strategic programmes, which are about making laws, and that is what Parliament and the Council of Ministers exist to do, yet even then the Council was not present!
I call upon the General Secretariat of the Council to ensure in future that the Presidency of the Council is represented in this House, for that is the General Secretariatâs function â to ensure that the most important institutions are present.
You take up office, Mr President, at a time when we have Members from the twenty-five countries of the European Union here, and you were right to address the language issue.
What distinguishes us is our commitment to Europeâs unity in diversity, and that is why we have all the languages of the European Union here in the European Parliament.
I see the main task facing us â facing you as President and us in the groups â as being to have respect and high regard for each other and for all our national and personal backgrounds, whilst nonetheless being aware that, at the end of the day, we are, men and women, Europeans together, seeking to work together to make this Parliament stronger.
You spoke about our relationship with the Commission.
Everyone here in this House knows that our group did, of course, support JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso as President-designate of the Commission; that does not mean, however, that the healthy tension that exists between the Commission and Parliament has thereby been dissolved.
Instead, even before the whole Commission gets our vote of confidence, we must get the President-designate of the Commission to make important concessions to us in this House as to how the European Parliament can be given greater powers in relation to the European Commission.
For that reason, our group has submitted a list of ten points that we want to see put into practice before we give the Commission as a whole our votes and put our trust in it.
We want the Commission to consult with Parliament when considering how to formulate its strategic policy programme, we want the Commission to take the subsidiarity principle into account when proposing legislation, and we want this to result in a reduction in bureaucracy in Europe, with the Commission giving us prognoses in this regard when submitting its proposals for legislation.
We also want to know what it is all going to cost.
You referred to REACH, which is not just about reshaping chemicals policy.
That is something we will have to argue about.
In essence, it is about us maintaining jobs in the European Union and creating new ones, and the European Union must not, through its own legislation, contribute to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, for example as a result of chemicals policy.
That is why we must join together with the Council â which is why I find its absence regrettable â in getting the relationship between the environment and the economy right.
Let me tell you what our main task is.
When we talk about Europeâs ability to compete, this is not something abstract to do with businesses; it has to do with workers in the European Union being in jobs and with businesses not taking themselves off to America or other parts of the world and the jobs being lost to Europe.
One of the core points our President addressed â and this is something I welcome â was terrorism.
Terrorism can never be justified, and we must fight it with all the strength and determination at our disposal.
Likewise, though, the need to fight terrorism must not mean that we jettison human rights.
We have to value the life and dignity of a European as much as the life of a Palestinian; we have to affirm that the life of an American is worth as much as that of a Chechen and that of a Muslim as much as that of a Christian or a Jew.
That is why, necessary though it is to combat terrorism, we in this House â without regard to the âreasons of stateâ that governments invoke â must always speak up for human rights throughout the world.
Whether it is convenient for us or not, whether the regimes we are dealing with are left-wing or right-wing or of any other description, we must always defend human rights in the world without deferring to reasons of state.
I hope you will not mind if I conclude by saying something about the Membersâ Statute.
We want one, but the ball is now in the Councilâs court.
We have done our work; now it is the Councilâs turn, and if the Council of Ministers does not want the matter to go any further, then it has only to say so.
We have done our work, and we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish you, Mr President, every success in yours.
If you stand up for Europe as a community â and I have no doubt that you will â then we will always be by your side.
The best of luck to you!
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank you, Mr President, for your speech.
You addressed the points that we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament regard as fundamental to the future that we face, and so we are glad that you have spoken about them.
I am not able to follow up all the points you raised, nor would I wish to do so, but I would like to revisit a number of the keywords that you used, because they determine the direction in which this House must develop.
In your speech, you made frequent reference to the two sources from which the European Union derives legitimacy, the Council being one and Parliament the other.
The Constitution speaks of a Union of states and peoples; the states are represented by the Council, and the peoples by this Parliament, and that is why it is right that this House should represent the diversity of Europeâs peoples.
For our group, that also means, for example, that this Houseâs language arrangements are not some sort of burdensome and necessary evil, but that they must guarantee the diversity of Europeâs peoples and enable it to be â in the truest sense of the word â articulated.
For that reason, I am grateful to you for referring to your establishment of a working party to arrange matters efficiently, which should also, however, continue to make it possible for any man or woman in the European Union, irrespective of their school or university education, to have the opportunity of being elected to this House and working in it.
That involves ensuring that they are understood, which I see as an important aspect of stabilising European democracy.
You also spoke on behalf of this House in repudiating all those who believe that the only way to combat terrorism is with the language of force, and for that I am very grateful.
Those who go to war claiming to be the bringers of freedom, democracy and human rights and sow the seeds of chaos, disorder and imported torturers cannot be surprised if their actions help to foster terrorism.
Those who seek to respond to terrorism by reintroducing the death penalty are countering violence with violence.
Undermining democracy in order, allegedly, to make a better job of combating terrorism is not the right way to go about matters.
Terrorists understand their own language; that is why, wherever they themselves use force, force â legitimate force on the part of the state â is the response that is needed to restore order.
What society needs, though, is open dialogue and the unconditional and fearless acceptance of whoever is the âotherâ in that situation.
It is the clash of civilisations that gives rise to continued terrorism; dialogue, of the kind you have described, could be a way out of the terrorism trap, and so I thank you for addressing this point in such clear terms.
You spoke about the accession of Turkey and about the decisions that now have to be taken.
This morning, I read in one of the major German daily papers that the debate on this cuts right across group lines in this House, and that all the groups in this House present a diverse picture.
That comes as a surprise to me, as I had always had the impression that only one group was united on this and that the picture in all the others was a varied one.
As of this morning, we know that there is a diversity of views in every group in this House.
At the end of the day, every individual Member will have to weigh up for himself and herself the benefits involved in seizing a short-term political and economic opportunity as against taking long-term, indeed geostrategic considerations into account, in particular as to how different cultures are to be integrated into this Union, but you were right to point out that it is we who have to take that decision, and that taking it without the European Parliament is unthinkable.
On this issue, then, this House will have to take up a position, and we in the Socialist Group will make our contribution to this debate, a contribution that â as is perfectly clear â will not be uniform, for there are quite different views in our ranks too.
It is in any case true that one thing we must not lose sight of when discussing our policy on Turkey is the need for Europeâs actions to be underpinned by reliable statements and promises made on the international stage.
I can scarcely imagine that one can, over a period of forty years, make repeated promises to a country and impose more and more new requirements on it, which it then meets, and end up telling it that the entire process had been of no avail and that all their efforts had been in vain.
Whatever criticisms one might â and must â make of Turkeyâs domestic situation, it is a self-evident fact that, over the past three years, the prospect of accession has made possible more reforms in that country than the forty years of discussions that preceded it.
That, too, is something we must not lose sight of.
As regards the Membersâ Statute and increased efficiency, you said what had to be said.
You have our backing for the strategy you described, and, if you take it further, you can count on our absolute support.
I would like to conclude by saying something about your comments on the audition of Commissioners.
We in the Socialist Group will use this occasion to make it clear that the incoming Commission must take seriously your statement that âcompetition and social cohesion are two sides of the same coin.â
Those who believe that all Europe needs is competition and that social cohesion is not that important destroy Europeâs basis, for it has been the social model that has made Europe stronger.
It is for this social model that we in the Socialist Group will contend; we will defend it, even against those elements in the Commission who tend to highlight competition to the exclusion of all else.
That is why, when examining every single Commissioner, we will emphasise the project of the social Europe.
Let me conclude by saying that, no matter who it is that turns up and presents himself, we will judge him by his policy statements, and not by his political past.
The fact is, Mr Poettering, that if Lazlo Kovac had not been Secretary of State to Gyla Horn, then Germany would not have been reunited.
It was the Hungarian Government, in which Lazlo Kovac served, that made German unity possible.
I welcome Lazlo Kovac as a European â let me say that right at the outset â and so let it be understood by those who seek to make the Commissionersâ hearings into a battle of ideological principles that they have not seen anything yet.
Â Â  Mr President, Liberals and Democrats in this House welcome your Presidency Programme and we offer you our support in your work.
When you speak impartially for this House, when you are a credit to its standing and a defender of its prerogatives, you can count on our backing.
The stature of this Parliament is growing, and the stature of its Presidency must grow with it.
You have inherited a House larger by some eight dozen MEPs and richer by nine new official languages.
It is a machine of four and a half thousand parts, speaking twenty languages, a million words a week.
The parts must move in time, the machine must stay in motion.
You must make sure that it does.
Benjamin Franklin once said of the Vice-Presidency of the United States - before the days of Dick Cheney - that it was a position so lacking in influence and stature that its holder should be addressed as 'your superfluous excellency'.
The European Parliament cannot afford a superfluous excellency, because you will be our voice; you will speak for us in the Council; you will be the will of this House: you will be our resolution.
Every one of us carries the burden of building the legitimacy of this House and thus European democracy and the work that it does - but none more than you.
In your opening remarks you spoke of two sources of legitimacy.
This House indeed has a particular duty to stand up for the rights of European Union citizens.
Sometimes that means defending their rights from encroachment by the Union's Member States.
I think, for example, of the nine million stateless Roma or the citizens of Cyprus and also of the people of Gibraltar, now represented in this House for the first time, thanks to a judgment in the European Court of Justice.
I am proud to be one of Gibraltar's representatives here, because only in Europe can Gibraltar look across the line at La Linea, or at the British battleship in the Bay of Algeciras and finally see no contradiction.
This House is the manifestation of the belief that we are better than our histories and more than our nationalities and it must be manifest in its President.
In two areas of your mandate you can expect aggressive backing from Liberals and Democrats.
The first is in reform of this House.
An enlarged Parliament means a reformed Parliament.
We welcome your emphasis today on reform of the Members' Statute.
The package agreed at the end of the last session is not an end but a point of departure.
We cannot hide behind it.
We must call the bluff of European governments and go straight back to work, because for our voters the price of legitimacy is open and ambitious reform, nothing less.
The second area is the defence of the European Constitution.
Here we expect you to lead a concerted campaign across the continent.
So renew your frequent flyer package: Europe has never had a more important product to sell.
Mr President, Liberals and Democrats in this House urge imagination and we expect ambition.
Political institutions rise and fall by the respect that they command.
For a quarter of a century this Chamber has gathered powers and asked European citizens for respect, for trust.
We must wake and work and sleep as if that trust must be won anew every day.
In wishing you well in your term of office, Mr President, I would say that we expect nothing less from you.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we support the open, positive approach of your speech and the long list of priorities you have outlined.
There will certainly be plenty for both us and you to do over the coming years, but we believe that the most important challenge for this Parliament is to overcome Euroscepticism and, as Mr Watson said as well, to show that we are not superfluous.
If we want not 40% but 80 or 90% of our citizens to take part in the elections in 2009, there are three things that we have to do better than we have done in the past, and to do them we must go beyond our political differences and try to resist the trend that can already be seen here in Parliament today, which makes it a kind of Council appendage in which the parliamentary groups are increasingly an expression of the power relations among the various national delegations rather than independent and truly European political bodies.
Mr President, this Parliament has to produce better laws; it has to demonstrate in practice that it is possible to make democracy work at a supranational level and to let the people see that it works; and it has to act as the eyes of the international community on matters where there is no place for hypocrisy or double standards, such as the protection of human rights and decisions on peace and war.
With regard to our role as co-legislators, we must not forget that for years the European Parliament has had to fight hard to gain the Councilâs and the Commissionâs respect for its powers.
Even now there are still at least four unresolved issues, which we call on you to place on the agenda for the trialogue with the other Institutions as soon as possible.
First, there is the ever-present temptation to somehow bend the rules to prevent Parliament from being able to fully exercise its powers.
Examples of this are the PNR case â the agreement with the United States on passenger details â and the comitology procedure on GM organisms, but I could mention others.
This is a real political issue that you, personally, must raise.
Secondly, there is the review of access to sensitive documents.
Here, too, the Commission and the Council make our life difficult as representatives of the people.
One example out of many is that of the infringement procedures.
The Commission has stated quite clearly that it wants to reduce its influence on this matter and we have no access to these procedures, which very often prevents justice from being done.
We think that your role as President of this Institution is absolutely crucial with regard to this matter as well.
Thirdly, we must set up an interinstitutional agreement on trade, seeking in part to bring forward the rules to be determined by the Constitutional Treaty.
The other speakers have already mentioned the Membersâ Statute, and therefore I do not need to expand on it too much.
We certainly have to make great improvements in-house.
We are against hurried legislation pushed through at first reading and deals on legislation struck only between major groups, as often happened during the last part of the parliamentary term, while we are in favour of the more systematic, more political and more effective use of our power to initiate legislation â a power that we ourselves forget we have.
I have spoken of this Parliament as a laboratory for supranational democracy.
We are convinced that we must be involved in the Constitutional Treaty ratification debate, but we must, however, avoid making the mistake of campaigning too one-sidedly and shutting the door on those who do not think that this Treaty is the best solution for tomorrowâs Europe.
I believe we have to win them over as well, by trying to convince them.
I reiterate that Parliament must also act as the eyes of the international community.
Mr President, we are genuinely convinced that the re-establishment of the Subcommittee on Human Rights may enable this Parliament once again to be a place where we can fight realistically and get results in the area of human and personal rights, rather than the declamatory forum for wishful thinking that it has become in recent years.
We hope we can count on your support to ensure that the subcommittee can work completely independently to rebuild its vast network of contacts and collaboration with those who uphold human rights around the world, giving them a voice and legitimacy and maybe, in the long term, becoming a full committee in its own right.
Â Â  Mr President, I am in broad sympathy both with most of the main themes of your address and with the approach that underpins them, and, on behalf of my group, I thank you for what you have said.
It reinforces our conviction that we can build up a very constructive and cooperative relationship with you.
You mentioned company relocations, and, likewise, as regards the work of lawmaking that awaits us, I do not want to conceal from you our groupâs profound disquiet at the Commissionâs draft directive on the deregulation of services, the so-called âBolkestein directiveâ, which, in effect, proposes to replace the current law of the host country with that of the country of origin.
To put it another way, it aims to allow businesses providing services to apply in all countries the social security regulations of their countries of origin.
Such an arrangement could be, as one can well imagine, a recipe for social dumping.
We would also welcome, in due time, the measures envisaged under TampereÂ II.
As for the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda, to which you also referred, and which, in the year 2000, promised us that by 2010 we would have full employment and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, we should not wait until March 2005 before getting down to it.
Right now is the time for us to make our contribution to the debate in the form of thoughts derived from the last four years, which have been an enlightening experience.
Quite apart from our legislative work, there are certain great issues concerning civilisation with which we have to get to grips in order to raise at the European Council the issue of what sort of role the European Union should be playing on the global stage.
You mentioned some of them in your speech: our approach to the fight against terrorism and to defending global security, for instance; or the issue of our relations with the countries of the South, and, in particular, those on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
I am also thinking of the ever more worrying problem of global warming, and of that of media concentration, which is a very live issue in many countries of the EU.
All these things featured in your speech.
Obviously, there are still other issues, such as the need to take action to combat such scourges as Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, from which, last year, six million people died across the world.
Anyone here could add to the list of subjects that absolutely must have a place on our agenda.
You are right to say that discussion of these issues is among our responsibilities.
Finally, if you will permit me, I would like to address a transversal subject that you also mentioned: the European Constitution.
I am glad that you said, as you did, that the European Parliament will have to transform itself, by organising an open and pluralistic debate, into a great .
I do not actually think that this House should limit itself to telling our fellow-citizens, when the time has come â if I may use an expression of which Mr Giscard d'Estaing, the former President, is fond â what is the right choice to make, particularly given that such an injunction would probably have little effect on those who wonder what direction European integration is taking, and who, in one way or another, represent the majority of the EUâs citizens.
Contrariwise, far from fleeing problems or opposition, we will in fact have to initiate a real democratic, pluralist and open debate on civil society, without relying solely on quasi-institutional partners in dialogue at summits, a debate on the nodal points of this treaty, which has ambitions to be a constitution, and more particularly on those by which the EUâs citizens actually judge it, that is to say on its policies and its functioning as derived from the Single European Act and from the Maastricht Treaty, which the draft Constitution is intended to put on a permanent footing.
In itself, political courage of this kind would be, perhaps not the new European dream to which you, Mr President, have aspired, but at least an encouraging innovation, a positive message addressed to our fellow-citizens and a good start not only for this new legislature, but also â with more personal reference to you, Mr President â for your own term of office.
Â Â  MrÂ President, dear Josep Borrell, my group would also like to congratulate you on your election as President, and we hope you will be a good President for us all, irrespective of where we come from and irrespective of what we think of the draft Constitution.
It is not difficult to foresee the European Parliament approving the Constitution by a large majority.
It will give more power and influence to us here in this House.
The EU will be able to make decisions in 15 new areas.
We shall be given majority decision-making in 40 new areas in which it will be possible for the national parliaments to be voted down.
It will be much easier to achieve qualified majorities with the new rules, and the European Parliament will be entitled to table many more amendments to the laws that are to apply in our countries.
The democratic problem is, however, that the national parliaments will lose much more power than the European Parliament will gain.
Most of the power will pass from the electorate to 300 working groups in the Council of Ministers and 3Â 000 in the Commission, none of which operate transparently or are subject to the influence of citizens.
Democracy is being restricted in our countries, and the electorate will end up losing out the most.
What is reassuring is that we are now to have referendums in ten countries.
Would that this development could also extend to the majority of other countries, the outcome being referendums everywhere.
How can power be taken from the electorate without asking them whether they are in favour of shifting influence to officials and ministers with very little feeling for a very distant European Parliament?
We are now debating whether the EU institutions should adopt a special communications strategy to convince the electorate of the Constitutionâs merits.
The EU institutions have one single task prior to the referendums, and that is to make the draft Constitution available in different languages and reader-friendly editions. This is not something they have been able to do.
It is, in actual fact, my office that has published reader-friendly editions on the website www.euabc.com.
The Council has only managed to print a number of unreadable versions containing neither indices nor the minority opinion that we in the Convention were expressly promised would be included.
The European Parliament could take over the task that the Council and the Commission have not carried out, in spite of their wealth of resources.
The various groupsâ opinions could be appended to the official texts so that the voters might be provided with different recommendations and the opportunity to adopt positions themselves.
Referendums and constitutions belong neither to governments nor to parliaments, but to the electorate.
The voters in our Member States must be given a guarantee that free and fair referendums will be arranged everywhere so that, once the decisions â whether in favour or otherwise - have been made, everyone can say that things were done fairly.
The voters have spoken. We respect their decisions.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election and in thanking you for your address earlier this morning.
Rather than lay out a wish list of every new policy or new idea, I want to touch very briefly on some of the points you raised and try to re-emphasise those within our role and work here in Parliament.
First and most importantly of all, you mentioned the massacre at Beslan and in particular the slaughter of innocents that took place.
It is incumbent on us, because of the institution that we are part of, because of the moral authority which we have in this Parliament as the democraticallyâelected voice of the people, we should stand up and resist all violence against people.
We should be a beacon of hope and tranquillity for those who wish to have their viewpoint heard.
You mentioned in your speech that you do not see the issue as a clash of civilisations.
Some years ago, the Chief Rabbi in Britain, Jonathan Sachs, wrote a book called .
If there is one thing that the European Parliament and the European Union have achieved, it is that ideal of respecting the dignity of difference.
There are things that make us different, but they need not divide us if we can show tolerance, respect and understanding for them.
Over the next five years of the mandate of this Parliament, we should be striving to ensure that, in every aspect of our working life, we can give that respect and tolerance to differing viewpoints.
We may not agree with them and may not ascribe to them ourselves, but we should respect the right of Members of this House and other elected representatives to hold those opinions and try to bring them forward.
We will be faced with this even more now because of our recent enlargement and the reunification of Europe.
There are now people in this Parliament who know what it is like not to have freedom to speak, not to have the freedom to use their own language and not to have the right to teach their own history and culture to their children.
They want to make sure that those rights are never taken away again.
Some in this Parliament and other places may use Members' passion for and belief in protecting the cultures and diversity of languages within the European Union as a way of attacking such Members.
We should understand the reasoning behind this approach.
Mr President, you rightly say that the question of language should be dealt with by the Council with regard to what is and is not appropriate.
We should also have a bit of leeway within Parliament: for opening remarks in a Member's maiden speech or for other important occasions during the Presidency, people should be allowed to use their own language, even though it may not be an official working language, on condition that they give a translation to the services before they make their speech.
My last point is that this House must be seen around Europe as a House to be treated with respect and honour, because we have a mandate and we bring the voice of the people as close as possible to the heart of what the European Union is.
There must also be respect for the Members of this House in their work and for the style in which they work.
If we are not willing to give respect to ourselves within this Chamber, if we are not willing to work within the rules and the laws as set down by our own Rules of Procedure, invoking our rights and powers under the various treaties and under the new constitution â if it is adopted â then no one outside this House will have respect for us.
I am looking to you, in the light of our previous conversations and the work you have already done in this regard since taking office, to give leadership in ensuring that the respect and dignity of this House is protected at all times.
The rights of individual Members are foremost within that protection.
To conclude, here is a short quote, which could best be described as an ancient Irish poem.
I will not use the original Gaelic: 'Who shall speak for the lonely and the oppressed?
If not you, then who?
Who shall speak for the downtrodden and the unjust?
If not you, then who?
Who shall speak for you?
If not you, then who?'
We are given the authority to speak on behalf of those who do not have a voice and to give leadership to those who should be shown what the true way is.
Â Â  Thank you Mr President.
I too should like to congratulate you on your election, both on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Non-attached Group.
Just as the spectrum of colours adds to the beauty of a painting, I believe that the spectrum of political parties in the European Parliament guarantees that the decisions taken by this House will not serve just a certain part of Europe.
I should now like to return to the speech made by Commission President Barrosso in this Chamber, in which he clearly stated that the Union must have a strong and independent Commission.
I also believe that Europe needs to have a strong and accountable Parliament.
We must respond to the will and expectations of our voters.
In order for us to be able to uphold their interests, we must have the appropriate conditions for our work here.
Mr President, please allow me, at the very beginning of our term of office, to remind you of our requests for the removal of the discrimination which we are experiencing in the Non-attached Group.
First of all, the other political groups have better staffed secretariats, for example the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has 27 members and 34 officials.
We have 29 members but only 11 employees to take care of our work in the secretariat.
Our meetings are not interpreted into our mother tongues despite the fact that many nationalities are represented here.
The financial support allocated for the political groups is not audited until after it has been used, whereas we have to apply for resources and explain in advance why we are asking for them.
Mr President, all of us here today have been elected in democratic elections to represent our voters.
The European Union safeguards its prosperity through agreements and compromises and we must do everything to ensure that discrimination is eliminated in this Chamber.
I am therefore asking you to resolve these problems and not just put them to one side.
I have a feeling that the economic pressure on the Non-attached Group of members may be the reason why we have become politically integrated.
In your statement, you made mention of the problems with interpreting.
We are now looking at further discrimination being perpetrated by the European Parliament.
In the past, during the period when our status was that of observers, interpreters from the candidate countries did not enjoy a position of equality.
In particular, they suffered discrimination in the area of social security, with respect to their rights and benefits.
Since the accession of the ten Member States, that is, since 1 May 2004, their status has changed somewhat, but they are still suffering discrimination in comparison with their colleagues from the old Member States.
In the past, interpreters have never been recruited at A8 level owing to the demanding nature of their job.
The difference between old and new interpreters is more than EUR 1 000.
Mr President, I apologise for talking about economic and financial problems from the very beginning. But in Slovakia we believe in clearing the air.
The EP needs to resolve all financial matters for all members so that status is not an issue, so that there is no virtual frontier between the old and the new.
I therefore beg for the justice which lies in your hands.
In return, I can offer you honest hard work.
Members in the Non-attached Group will draw attention to injustice but we shall always strive to seek compromise and to resolve the important problems raised.
You are faced with trying times.
So I wish you well in coping with your difficult job and I also wish you strength in succeeding in it.
Not every politician is given the opportunity you have been given.
Prove that you are worthy of this historically very important job and that you are President for all of us.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs BelohorskÃ¡.
The Presidency takes note of all your comments and they will be analysed by the working group responsible for ensuring that this Parliament operates in a correct and fair manner.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Statement on the situation in Belarus.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to see how little the various debates held here in this Parliament over recent years on the state of democracy in Belarus have changed.
I would, however, like to take this opportunity to assess the situation in terms of our relations and to consider the prospects for improving them in the future, within the framework of a European neighbourhood policy.
I would like to point out briefly that, following its independence in 1991, bilateral relations with Belarus began to move forward satisfactorily towards the adoption of an association and cooperation agreement and a provisional commercial agreement.
Nevertheless, all these negotiations became paralysed as a result of the deterioration of the internal political situation in Belarus in 1996, and regrettably they have not improved since then.
Nevertheless, since 2002, the European Union has been trying hard to bring the issue back to the fore, to try to overcome the situation of deadlock, taking a points-of-reference approach with a view simply to improving our political relations with that country gradually.
So far, however, the continuous efforts of the Union, the talks, have not yielded any tangible results.
Nevertheless, the Union is still prepared to continue making progress provided that there is some movement on the part of the authorities of that country.
We must also remember that, following the latest enlargement, Belarus has become a direct neighbour â we have shared borders â and, in this regard, it is all the more important to us that it becomes a democratic, stable and prosperous country.
We believe that our proximity can and must manifest itself in the long term through close cooperation and exchange in fields of mutual interest, such as trade, justice, home affairs, transport, energy and the environment.
All of this requires fundamental political reforms in that country, however.
I would like to say once again that the European Union is deeply concerned about recent developments in Belarus, where all indications are that the situation is deteriorating in terms of respect for the Rule of Law, democracy and human rights, and where we are still seeing how policies relating to independent media â some of which have been closed down â the actions of the government and the forces supporting it with regard to political opposition forces and the situation of independent social organisations and higher education establishments are becoming increasingly difficult.
In this regard, I must point out that we are also following the debate taking place in the Council of Europe, here in Strasbourg, on the people who have disappeared in Belarus, with the greatest of interest.
In accordance with the information presented by the European trade union confederations, the Commission has also begun an investigation into alleged violations of freedom of association and of the right to collective negotiation within the framework of the Regulation on the system of generalised preferences.
Depending on the conclusions of this investigation, the Union will have to reconsider Belarusâs future access to the benefits of the system of generalised preferences.
A key element of our policy with regard to that country is support for civil society and for the process of democratisation.
In recent years, however, the authorities of that country have refused to apply tax exemption to European Union debt, which undoubtedly hinders the entry of that aid and, therefore, its use and access to it by Belarusian society.
The authorities of that country are currently registering all the free external aid projects, and in practice this is allowing them to reject any international assistance that they believe goes against their partisan interests.
So how can we improve our relations with that country in these circumstances?
We have developed a European neighbourhood policy in order to continue strengthening our relations with our neighbours, including Belarus.
By means of this policy we believe we will be able to consolidate our efforts to support democratic development in Belarus.
I would like to make it clear that if fundamental political and economic reforms are carried out, and as soon as they are carried out, Belarus will be able to participate fully in the European neighbourhood policy, with all the advantages that would come with it.
Nevertheless, under current circumstances, the minimum conditions required are not in place and we cannot therefore go ahead with this policy in relation to Belarus.
The first important milestone for Belarus will be the parliamentary elections and the referendum scheduled for October.
The Union has committed itself to supporting democratic parliamentary elections in the autumn, in coordination with the Office for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and with the Council of Europe.
We wish, however, to place the emphasis on the legal framework for the elections, as well as freedom for the media and the conditions under which the campaigns of the different political parties must be carried out.
The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE has established a mission of electoral observers for the parliamentary elections.
The Union will participate by supporting the election observers and at the same time we will remain in contact with the democratic forces.
I must, however, point out that we are very concerned about the referendum called on the modification of the constitution and the repeal of the current limit on presidential mandates.
We have informed the authorities of that country on several occasions of the consequences that referendum would have in terms of our relations if circumstances do not change.
The conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council approved yesterday are crystal-clear on this issue.
In this regard, the Commission once again wishes to send a clear message to the people of Belarus, letting them know that the Union is not forgetting them.
The important thing is that people â in particular those who are fighting for democratic change â do not feel they have no support.
Now more than ever it is essential that we continue our work supporting civil society and the democratic forces in that country.
Moreover, we have committed ourselves to doing so.
I believe that Parliamentâs resolution expresses similar causes for concern in Belarus and I am naturally interested in hearing the honourable Membersâ opinions about the current evolution of our relations and in particular in considering how we can improve our support, our backing for the democratisation of the country, and therefore our support and backing for Belarusian democratic forces in such a difficult situation.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am very glad that the Commission understands the significance of the situation in Belarus, and in particular the significance of the electoral campaign currently under way in the country and the forthcoming parliamentary elections.
These elections acquired added significance last week with the announcement of a referendum to be held at the same time.
This is of course an attempt to maintain the authoritarian rule currently in place, but it is also a tremendous chance for the Belarussian nation; a chance for the Belarussian people to be mobilised and to express their own opinions on the state of human rights and democratic standards in Belarus.
It is also a challenge for our common foreign policy.
There appears to be a need for a more courageous approach in the EUâs foreign policy, and for certain tasks and strategic goals to be reformulated.
Not only is it very much in the EUâs interest to keep Belarus an independent state, but Belarusâ independence will remain under threat if it is governed in an undemocratic manner.
What is more, it will only seemingly be a stable country, and stability in Eastern Europe will only seemingly be guaranteed.
Dictatorships generally fall with a bang rather than by means of velvet revolutions.
If the EUâs new eastern border is to be safe, it cannot be an iron curtain, let alone a screen behind which the rich and free cower.
Our foreign policy on Belarus must be much more active, which means it must differ from our foreign policy to date.
It was of course right to freeze all programmes under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement after 1996, and it is right to break off contacts with high-ranking officials of the Lukashenko regime, but our policy lacks political will towards Belarussians themselves.
I am very pleased that the Commissioner has acknowledged that the aim of the EUâs policy is to support civil society, but together we must develop procedures which prove to be effective.
Democracy in Belarus will not come about of its own accord, and Belarussians must build it themselves, but our task is to help them, and to do so much more energetically than to date.
This help should be targeted at specific social and political groups, as well as at local authorities, non-governmental organisations, schools and young people.
Its aim should be to support those who are currently planting the seeds of a civil society and democratic politics.
Help should also be given to the democratic opposition, which deserves praise for its recent integration into the 5+ coalition.
These are our friends.
They speak the same language, they have the same values, they think in the same categories and they believe in Europe.
I hope that the future belongs to them and that one day they will sit in this very House.
In short, a more active and subtle approach is required, which makes it possible to isolate an undemocratic government without isolating society.
The government should be isolated in order to provide positive support to the Belarussian people.
As far as short-term strategy is concerned, there is a need for energetic measures, or in other words the short-term measures to which the Commissioner referred.
Firstly, the current electoral campaign should be observed very carefully, and there should be a rapid reaction to any irregularities, such as the banning of the Labour Party, an event which has already occurred, as well as to the fact that many candidates are refused registration and opposition representatives are not allowed to sit on electoral committees.
This election and referendum are so important that our political group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is calling in its resolution for an observersâ mission to be sent to Belarus and for a report to be drawn up.
We would like this post-election report to also act as an opportunity for a serious discussion on the future shape of the EUâs foreign policy on Belarus.
Â Â  Mr President, first and foremost, I should like to say that I am in complete agreement with the analysis which the Commissioner gave a moment ago.
Although they may be new neighbours, we are talking about an old problem, one that has been around since 1996, when we, the European Union, first got into an argument with President Lukashenko, the key figure in Belarus.
The parliamentary elections of 17 October are around the corner and it is important for us now to turn our attention to the situation in that country.
A referendum has also been announced about a possible third term in office for the President.
I was fortunate enough to act as chairman of this Parliamentâs delegation in Belarus for five years and we have had bad experiences with elections in that country in the past.
On two occasions, a parliamentary troika of this Parliament, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, had to declare the countryâs elections unlawful, and I fear that this will now happen again.
It appears once again from all the reports I have received about the run-up to the elections that the opposition is being sabotaged, the opposition candidates are being thwarted and the media are being influenced in an improper manner.
That is why it is also important that now, with the elections more than a month away, we in this Parliament should send a message about what we expect, in the hope that we do not need to declare the elections unlawful again.
Earlier this year, we made an attempt to breathe new life into the troika of the three parliamentary institutions in order to get it up and running in time for the elections in Belarus, and this House, in particular, was hindered from playing its part, and I personally was declared more or less in that country.
It follows that this problem should be solved before this House can send a delegation to act as observers in the elections at all.
We want the opposition to be given the chance to conduct a campaign in a proper manner.
In addition, we want the candidates to be given the freedom to do what they want.
The use of government resources to sabotage the opposition and civil society must stop.
This change must go hand in hand with an improvement in the climate, which also entails more freedom for trade unions and academics.
There are countless examples of how trade unions are being manipulated and infiltrated. Academic institutions trying to work independently are being closed down either temporarily or outright.
The flow of subsidies intended to promote freedom in that country is being cut off.
Only when all the above changes have happened will we perhaps be able to say, after 17 October, that improvements have finally been made, and that there is at last room for the European Union again to make relations, which have been frozen since 1996, somewhat more open, and to develop more contacts with that country.
As I already said, this is possible only if the referendum is cancelled.
I regard what President Lukashenko is now trying to achieve via a referendum, one in which the population will undoubtedly again be manipulated in all kinds of ways, as some kind of constitutional .
To guarantee a third term in office would be a step in the direction of a system which cannot be described as other than authoritarian, as is already the case.
We must endeavour to ensure that Europeâs last dictatorship, which is what we generally tend to call these, is brought to an end, and that on that basis, we can actually establish a new neighbourliness policy with that country.
I hope that the elections will be a step in the direction of Europe, but I fear that they will rather be a step in the direction of a yet more authoritarian system.
I share the Commissionerâs pessimism about this development.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, often referred to as Europeâs last dictatorship, Belarus seems to have been completely unaffected by the tumultuous events of the last decade, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the democratisation of Eastern and Central Europe and the unification of Europe.
The dictator Lukashenko is clinging desperately to power, and he has now announced a referendum in order to extend his term of office for an unlimited period.
MrÂ Wiersma talked of a constitutional , and that is precisely what this is.
He appears to want to follow in the footsteps of another dictator, Fidel Castro, who is equally past his sell-by date.
With the systematic and hardly sophisticated system of electoral fraud devised by Lukashenkoâs regime, there is unfortunately not very much to suggest that either the referendum or the election on 17Â October will in any way be fair.
This means that Lukashenko can remain where he is, while his people become ever poorer and ever more isolated.
It is of course shameful that we in Europe have a Communist dictatorship as our closest neighbour.
In spite of countless attempts to influence the regime using the carrot and stick method, we have failed, and failed totally.
Trying to cooperate with the regime has been a pointless and fruitless exercise, and the country is thus miles away from embracing the values we defend.
Freedom of expression is minimal.
Human rights campaigners and opponents of the regime are oppressed and persecuted.
Peaceful demonstrators are arrested, tortured and given prison sentences following trials that smack of nothing more than farce.
Belarus is the only country in Europe that executes its prisoners.
There is extensive trafficking in women. We find thousands of Belorussian women on many of the streets of Europe.
Many people who have called the regime into question have disappeared in mysterious circumstances.
Belarus is our neighbour, however, and we cannot abandon the Belorussian people to their fate.
Just like everyone else, they are entitled to freedom and democracy.
Just as the Commissioner says, we in Parliament, the Council and the Commission must therefore try to find ways of giving economic, political and, especially, moral support to the courageous people and organisations that, in spite of everything, exist and fight for democracy, human dignity and the principles of the constitutional state.
The official pressure must be intensified.
We must demand that observers also be allowed to monitor this illegitimate referendum.
My group would like to see Parliament send observers on 17 October.
Our new Member States have not only afforded us geographical proximity to Belarus, but also knowledge of that country and of its history.
It is important to use this knowledge and to be creative in finding ways of supporting the forces of democracy in Belarus.
Many people see Europe in terms of hope for a better future and of the opportunity for, and possibility of, a new life.
We must of course preserve the dream that, one day, a democratic and open Belarus, operating a market economy, might also become a member of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on Belarus has, yet again, been characterised more by despair than by hope.
As Mr Wiersma said, it has been like that for years.
Although we have been keeping our eye on Belarus for years, it is one of the reunited Europeâs failures that we have not been able to prevent a dictatorship of dark and Stalinist stamp on its own doorstep.
Contrary to what the President of Belarus says on his countryâs television networks, which all toe the party line, his power brings the people no security, but rather fear and terror.
He rules through state-sponsored contract-killers and by using strong-arm tactics such as those of silencing all opposition, criminalising commitment to civil society, and banning the free expression of opinion.
The list could be made much longer, as you know.
It will be very difficult for Belarus to find its way back to democracy, and it is in that light that the referendum should be seen.
In order to keep his hands on his personal power, he chose the day of the parliamentary elections, the day when democracy could have returned to the country, to demand a vote of confidence in him, as a distraction from the real issues, the real questions that the people are asking, as to why things are getting worse and worse while the situation in the neighbouring countries is improving, why it is that they cannot share in the neighbouring statesâ prosperity, why the consequences of Chernobyl are denied, why aid projects are banned, why health care is being cut back and why experts collecting data to enable help to be given are put behind bars.
Even eighteen years after the event, Chernobylâs consequences have not been dealt with and many of the people are exposed to radioactive contamination.
I now turn to the dictator Lukashenkoâs latest action, the shutting-down of the humanist university in Minsk.
It was the last university to maintain and teach liberal and European values, and it was closed down in the teeth of opposition from the students and the people.
For that reason, we must not be silent; we must protest, for this is yet another course of action driving the genuinely pro-European elite out of the country.
I have to say, Commissioner â and this is where I agree with the first speaker â that the European Union is open to the accusation of not having done enough to drag Belarus out of the black hole of self-isolation, and we know why; our instruments are inadequate.
Even the new instruments that you are proposing as part of the Neighbourhood Policy are nothing like enough to deal with this special problem.
You have ignored Parliamentâs proposals for setting up special programmes for this with other options and financed in other ways, enabling us at last to take the action that is urgently needed, such as, for example, the development of civil society and the strengthening of a free press.
Last of all, let me mention my friend â my best friend in Belarus â Viktor Gonchar, who, as you all know, was one of the victims of the contract killers.
While I believe that we should do more to get the murderers punished and his death fearlessly investigated, we should also carry forward his vision of a democratic Belarus, one that allows its people to share in Europeâs progress and prosperity.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her report, even if there are many points upon which I do not agree with her.
This is the second time I have taken part in a debate on Belarus, the first having been as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and I must confess that I have never lost hope.
The EU institutions have the right to express their opinions on remarkable or even exceptional events and situations, and it is therefore natural for them to also pay particular attention to Belarus.
Belarus is a state in an exceptional situation.
It is one of Europeâs youngest states, with a political elite inexperienced in statehood.
It is a country where administrative borders have changed into state borders, thus dividing families, an economy and a culture.
Such a state merits not only particular attention, but also exceptional help.
In my opinion, one of the worst possible ways of providing help in such a situation would be excessive criticism of the government and unreserved support for the opposition.
After all, the aim should not be to topple the government, but to help the people of Belarus.
What do we know about the opposition, which some of our colleagues, in all respect, are endeavouring to bring to power?
Will it not be worse at governing the country than the current government?
What do we know of the real wishes of the Belarussian people?
Maybe they want a nationalist government, or anti-Russian policies, or merely more democracy and prosperity in their own country and the closest possible cooperation with their large and rapidly developing neighbour?
I do not believe that we know the answers to these questions.
In its present composition, this House is only just starting to grow accustomed to its duties and responsibilities.
The worst possible start would be to succumb to ideological prejudice and to pass judgment on the basis of the way in which our emotions are guided by the mass media.
We were not elected to this House in order to pass judgments without allowing the other side the right to defend itself.
We were not elected to make a fuss merely because we do not like someone or because television reports and newspaper editorials have painted a negative picture of them.
We were not elected to set Europe against itself.
We are in this House in order to put in place the conditions for mutual understanding, or in other words not to isolate people, but to conduct dialogue.
On this point I agree with my friend and colleague Bogdan Klich.
I support the proposal for Parliament to send a delegation to Belarus made up of representatives from all political groups, and I hope it will be able to establish the opinions of politicians, the public and experts.
Then we will be able to say what the situation in Belarus is like without using double standards.
Â Â  Mr President, Belarusâ current President has called a constitutional referendum to be held at the same time as the parliamentary elections.
The Belarussian people will elect their parliamentary representatives and decide on the form which the Constitution should take.
Voices have been heard from all over the world questioning the integrity of the Belarussian state authorities and the results of the elections in advance, although we will only know the results after 17 October.
It is taken as read that democratic principles will be violated.
I believe that questioning the integrity of elections and referendums before voting has taken place is also incompatible with the spirit of democracy.
We are entitled to observe the situation and must do so, but must not pass judgments ahead of time.
In addition, I doubt whether a structure which is as undemocratic as we believe the European Union and its bureaucratic institutions to be has the moral right to judge the level of democracy and decisions of a sovereign nation to be undemocratic.
Is the European Union competent to reprimand independent states?
There is an ancient maxim which says , that means physician, heal thyself.
The European Union wishes to impose the Constitutional Treaty on free nations, even though in such instances the mandatory national referendums approving the Treaty are not required.
Where is the democracy in such cases?
Parliament should first guarantee democracy and independence in European countries, and only then issue condemnations and reprimands to others.
âYou see the mote in your brotherâs eye, but you do not see the beam in your own eyeâ.
Pharisees and hypocrites!
This is not to say that we should not react to violations of human rights wherever they may occur in the world, but that is not Parliamentâs job.
It would be like the Congress of the United States of America passing a resolution on democracy in France or Germany, or the Polish Parliament reprimanding the European Parliament.
It is not Parliamentâs job.
Parliament should therefore not overstep its competences.
Democracy is based on respect for the sovereign decisions of nations, irrespective of whether we like them or not.
Let us await the results of the elections in Belarus, and then every Member will individually be able to make a judgment.
The European Parliament as such does not have the right to do so.
We are therefore opposed to Parliament sending any diplomatic missions to Belarus or to it drawing up joint reports.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1 May 2004 Belarus has been a direct neighbour of the European Union.
Despite this close proximity, it is a country in which universities and the remaining independent media are being closed down.
It is a country where political parties, such as the Labour Party and the Belarussian National Front, are made illegal merely for being in the opposition, regardless of whether they are left or right-wing.
Despite all this and despite this proximity we have no guarantee, contrary to what we have heard, that the referendum process and the forthcoming elections will be democratic.
This is not prejudice, these are facts.
People who hold views that differ to those of the official authorities in Belarus are being killed.
Media outlets in Belarus are being closed down.
Democratic candidates find it difficult to register with electoral committees in Belarus.
This is not prejudice.
Anyone who can see no difference between the Belarussian opposition and the Government should take note of the fact that it is not the Belarussian opposition which is responsible for the disappearance of individuals or the closure of independent newspapers.
Anyone who cannot see this difference should go to Belarus and take a closer look.
All these things are happening right under the nose of the EU, and the EU therefore bears responsibility for this aspect of its eastern policy.
If the EU today is to seek a distinct identity in the field of foreign policy, it must do so whilst not avoiding conflict with its closest allies across the Atlantic.
If the EUâs foreign policy is to be based on respect for fundamental rights, Belarus is one of its most crucial responsibilities today.
If we do not take action on this issue, our credibility in the debate on the shape of foreign policy will be weakened.
It is for this reason that the Belarussian opposition today must be certain that we have not forgotten it and must be entirely certain that we support it.
It is for this reason that President Lukashenko must be certain that his actions will not remain unpunished, and that the Belarussian nation must be certain that its European ambitions will some day receive a genuine answer from our side.
Â Â  Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, unfortunately the European Union has abandoned the concept of âWider Europeâ in the context of Eastern Europe.
Today this concept refers to North Africa, and the EUâs priorities lie with the Maghreb and Mashreq, rather than Belarus or Ukraine.
This is bad news, and it means that the gulf between the democratic and wealthy Europe and Eastern Europe can and will deepen.
This is not only bad news for them, it is also bad news for the European Union.
It is obvious that the situation in Belarus is deteriorating.
Newspapers and political parties are being closed down and people imprisoned.
Should the EUâs reaction be to turn our back?
Are we to be like Pontius Pilate, who washed his hands?
Let us not forget the disastrous results which this had 2Â 000 years ago.
Contacts with Minsk should therefore now be stepped up, Mrs De Palacio, not scaled down.
Human rights and democratic freedoms must be constantly emphasised.
The situation in Belarus is becoming ever more grave.
President Lukashenko has announced the possibility of restrictions on presidential terms of office being abolished.
He may be hoping to become president for life.
This is an even more pressing reason not to create a new Berlin Wall on the EUâs new eastern borders, on Polandâs borders with Belarus and with Ukraine.
Belarus is not on Mars, it has common borders with the EU.
Let us therefore not ask for whom the bell tolls, let us repeat after Ernest Hemingway that it âtolls for theeâ, for Europe.
The EU must take action on the issue of Belarus, we must not remain mere newspaper readers.
The proposal to send a special delegation of observers to Belarus, to observe the outcome of the election, should therefore be supported.
I also believe that the representatives of the Belarussian democratic opposition should be invited to the European Parliament.
Passivity on this issue, and pretence that the problem will solve itself is, in the words of Talleyrand, worse than a crime, it is a blunder.
The European Union should not act like a certain tribe in Africa which believes that if it does not talk about a problem or a disease, and does not mention its name, the problem will cease to exist.
On the contrary, the EU must talk about Belarus and talk details, Mrs de Palacio.
Â Â  Mr President, Belarus is in focus now, not only for sharing over one thousand kilometres of border with the EU, but also as the last surviving major European bastion of neo-soviet ideology.
One could say in its favour that unlike some of its neighbours it remains free of inter-ethnic strife.
It has also unilaterally renounced its nuclear arsenal, as well as much of its conventional weaponry.
Organised crime is low.
Rather surprisingly, Belarus is also enjoying a 4% growth rate economically.
However, the country is an increasing worry to the EU, having deteriorated into authoritarianism and repression of human and linguistic rights, while opposition political parties are now suffering harassment ahead of the referendum and parliamentary elections on 17 October.
Sadly, the Belarus House of Assembly is barely recognisable in western terms as a freely-elected Parliament.
The election of President Lukashenko in 1994 led initially to the hope that authority would be upheld, corruption rooted out and the economy put back on track.
Yet this has not happened, because the Soviet-style approach resulted in the re-introduction of the economic model of central control leading to clientelism and interventionism in all aspects of public life.
He now seeks the right, through the referendum, to become President for life.
Private enterprise in Belarus functions poorly and the bulk of financial investment comes from Russia after a promising but short-lived start, particularly in the SME sector.
The effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave consequence and something like a quarter of the country is still contaminated by radioactive fall-out.
In 2001 Lukashenko won 75% support, although the OSCE declared that the election had failed to comply with its minimum standards.
Nevertheless, no one actually disputes his victory.
Leading opposition figures have been arrested and beaten, and a few have disappeared, although â mysteriously â some have reappeared.
Two years ago three journalists were sentenced to three years of hard labour for slandering the President.
Many Belarussians support eventual EU membership for their country, although if asked they also claim to support union with Russia.
Lukashenko would ideally like to build an eastern pan-Slavic bloc hostile to the West.
However, especially since President Putin came to office, Russia has responded by seeking to partly distance itself from Belarus.
A Russia-Belarus state union treaty was ratified in 1999, but in practice it has been largely ignored, while the single rouble currency union has been deferred to 2006.
The municipal elections in March 2003 showed that some favourable political developments have taken in Belarus.
They showed that the democratic opposition parties have been afforded greater freedom and fairer treatment.
The EU should respond to Belarus accordingly by stepping up western contacts with pro-democracy parliamentarians who are willing to challenge the regime and are dedicated to making the country a fully-fledged member of the international community, and as such eventually entitled to a partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU.
Experience from Spain, Greece and Portugal suggests that given time and economic growth the transition from dictatorship to free market democracy is achievable everywhere in Europe.
Â Â  Our role as representatives of the people in our country and in Europe cannot and must not end at the frontiers of the European Union.
We must look beyond and must not consider ourselves to be like some fortress with its bastions keeping away all outsiders, but more like a turret that guides us towards values that unite us, especially those of solidarity and democracy.
It is in this spirit that we must treat the situation in other neighbouring countries such as Belarus.
This is done without assuming that we know everything or that we are definitely more knowledgeable than others.
However one can say that in all the countries that we come from, at some time or another, we experienced moments that did not reflect well on our democracy.
It is in this manner, as people hardened by such experiences, that I think we can make this appeal an appeal to the authorities of the country to show respect towards the rights of association and the basic principles of democracy.
We show our greatest solidarity towards the Labour Party of Belarus and towards the National Front.
The way the government is treating them is not acceptable in todayâs society.
Our appeal must be one of goodwill.
I am convinced, as I think many of you are, that in every organisation in every country there are people of goodwill who know how to distinguish good from evil.
I appeal to such persons, especially within the authorities of Belarus and its government to work and do so with all means at their disposal to see that democracy rules.
We must be aware that the present situation in Belarus is also our responsibility, due to what we did or what we did not do.
We must ensure that the policy that we adopt from now on will not be a reactive one, not one of embargos which, experience shows us, is hardly effective, but one that is pro-active.
It must not be a sporadic one but one taken in the framework of a neighbourhood policy, the need for which is felt more now than ever before.
Â Â  Mr President, with Belarus, we are confronted with the same problem as a number of other countries on different continents which appear rather indifferent to the means that can be deployed in order to persuade their regimes to adopt a more humane policy.
Neither the carrot nor the stick appears to have any impact whatsoever on regimes such as that in Belarus, and that is unfortunately also true of certain countries in Asia, Africa and America.
This shows that double standards do not apply here.
On the one hand, the impression is created that this debate is rather pessimistic, since many speakers have been forced to recognise our powerlessness to bring about constructive changes in Belarus.
This does not mean, however, that we need to give up.
Various speakers have indicated the way forward.
We need to join forces with civil society, and the population of Belarus must be able to elect their representatives in a free, transparent and honest manner.
In addition, NGOs trying to uphold values such as democracy and human rights in the face of adversity must be supported.
The object of the whole exercise is to give the people a chance to share in Europeâs wealth and prosperity.
The Commission and Council can count on our unqualified support in further efforts to bring about changes for the good.
Â Â  â Mr President, since 1 May of this year, Belarus shares its borders with the European Union.
It is a well-known fact that this geographical closeness does not exactly run parallel to political like-mindedness.
A week ago to the day, the Belarusian President Lukashenko highlighted this chasm by issuing a decree to legitimise and consolidate his authoritarian presidency via the ballot box even after 2006.
In just over one month, on 17 October, this constitutional change could be a .
This predictable development does nothing to simplify relations between Brussels and Minsk.
Since Belarus constitutes an important passage for energy and other supplies of goods from Russia to EU Member States, Lukashenko and his repressive regime are in a strong position.
Incidentally, over the years, it has appeared immune to direct international efforts towards gradual democratisation and reform.
Lukashenko's undeniable ambition to stay in power will, if anything, reinforce this trend in time to come.
What impact can the European institutions have in Belarus?
Indeed, is not the present leadersâ self-imposed political isolation from the West complete?
Despite this, we do not need to leave Belarusian society at the mercy of Lukashenkoâs unbridled thirst for power.
This undoubtedly difficult path is pointed out in a German study published this summer.
Change in Belarus can only be successful in the medium term by promoting that countryâs own initiatives from the bottom up.
There is indeed a glimmer of light here, because despite the grave circumstances of the past few years, to date, some 2Â 500 registered civil organisations have managed to hold their own.
This was definitely made easier by long-term contact with foreign partners.
With hundreds of initiatives, Germany is in the lead here.
How does the Commission view this way out of the political impasse between the European Union and Belarus?
It is certainly a long-term effort involving many risks.
What is inspiring, though, is the honourable object, the general well-being of the Belarussian population, with the active involvement of civil society and, if possible, both local and regional authorities.
I would like to ask the Commission once again whether it considers this a viable option and if so, what practical action it intends to initiate.
Â Â  âMr President, today I, a parliament member from Lithuania, have the opportunity and pleasure to address you in my native language, Lithuanian.
However, such an opportunity â to speak one's own language freely â is denied to Lithuania's closest neighbours, now neighbours of the European Union â 10 million Belorussians.
There is a nation quite close to the geographical centre of Europe, which is not allowed to speak its native language in either schools or universities.
Even more â it is denied freedom of speech and liberty of conscience.
I speak of an imprisoned nation at the centre of Europe, in a country which is ruled by Europe's last dictator, who on 17 October by means of a fictitious referendum plans to extend his dictatorship for life, and who sees Hitler's regime as one of the best in Europe.
We believe that the European Union's continued policy with regard to eastern neighbours has to be expressed not only in the condemnation of this regime, with general declarations, which do not have more concrete consequences, but also in concrete support for those democratic opposition forces, which are spreading the ideas of democracy and pluralism by non-violent means, so that the Belorussian nation might live in a country which recognises human rights and freedom.
This is why my colleague MrÂ SzymaÃ±ski and I move to endorse a draft resolution submitted in the name of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and in this context call for the Sacharov Prize to be awarded to those who will decide the future of Belarus - the opposition youth movement âZubrâ, as a symbol of all forces disobeying the regime and determining the future of a free Belarus.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  âBelarus is a neighbour of Lithuania and the European Union and what happens in that country is important to us.
As we know, the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, politically isolated by western states because of human rights violations and restrictions on media freedom, is using all means to attain a third presidential term in the elections for a head of state to be held in 2006.
The question, which is to be presented in a referendum scheduled for 17 October, is formulated in very simple and clear terms for the citizens of Belarus: 'Will you allow the first President of the Republic, Alexander Lukashenko, to participate as a presidential candidate in the elections for a head of state?' Unquote.
Lukashenko explains this to the people of Belarus in equally simple and understandable language. Quote: 'As I promised you before, if I decide to participate in the 2006 presidential elections, I will definitely consult you and ask for your permission - this is what I am doing now,' he said on Belorussian state television.
Today, as previously in the European Parliament, many cases of human rights violations have been mentioned, along with evidence of restrictions on press freedom, and the banning of university and non-government organisations.
However, the people of Belarus know little of our concern for their situation, their life.
If they manage to reach Belarus, statements on this subject by leaders of the European Parliament and other institutions in the democratic world are distorted, they are presented to the citizens of Belarus as the will of global capitalism, as attempts to dictate to Belorussians how they should live.
Information which Belorussians find on the internet, to which they do have access, is less censored, however the level of computerisation in that country is poor, and so a large part of society is fed state propaganda.
We must see that objective information reaches the citizens of Belarus via channels which they are accustomed to.
I propose: that in approving the European Union's budget for 2005, we must find funds to broadcast radio, perhaps also television programmes in Belorussian and Russian, which could be compiled with the help of Belorussian journalists [...] and could be broadcast from the neighbouring states - Lithuania and Poland - as was done until 2001.
A few million Litai each year from the European Union's budget certainly will not bankrupt the European Union, but in my opinion, would be a more effective means of strengthening civil, democratic initiatives and traditions than sending a delegation from the European Parliament to observe the elections, carry out monitoring and record the de facto situation.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am interested in discussing what can be done, and not what cannot be done.
Up until now we have mainly talked about what cannot be done.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner to make a note of three things that can be done.
Firstly, diplomats from the EU Member States can be instructed to monitor the pre-election situation in Belarus and to inform the EU institutions, including the European Parliament, on a weekly basis.
Secondly, Commission officials can be ordered to conduct urgent political consultations with states with which the EU maintains contacts, in particular with the United States and Russia, with regard to the development of the pre-election situation in Belarus and to defining the scope of joint appraisals.
As an MEP I would also like to be kept informed on this issue.
Thirdly, financial assistance can be provided for young people in Belarus who wish to study abroad, for example in Poland, and for small businesses that wish to develop outside the Lukashenko administrationâs sphere of influence.
This third point requires only a small amount of money, but it requires a great deal of courage, and I hope that the Commission will not lack this courage.
Finally, I have something to say to the speaker who could see no difference between Cuba and Belarus.
Here is a difference that is worth remembering: Cubans escape at night on boats to the United States and die .
Belarussians travel by car to Poland, that is, to the European Union, in order to find jobs and return to Belarus.
That difference is certainly worth remembering.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to add my voice to those calling for the European Union and our Parliament to play a more active and committed role with regard to Belarus, and in particular to those calling for observers to be sent.
To tell the truth, I am not particularly optimistic about the success of this mission, because as Josef Stalin once said, âitâs not who votes that counts, itâs who counts the votesâ, and a decision has already been taken on how the votes will be counted.
Nevertheless, the situation requires our constant attention, as it is becoming worse and worse.
There is no rule of law in Belarus, only the rule of those who simply exploit the law.
One result of this, amongst others, is the abolition of independent education, and the European Humanities University has already been mentioned.
I would also like to mention the closure of the Kolas Lyceum, the only secondary school in Minsk in which lessons are held exclusively in Belarussian.
Generally speaking, what we are witnessing in Belarus is quite simply a regression to a quasi-Soviet state.
Official ideology rules in the country.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is such a thing as an official Belarussian ideology, and there are high commissioners in each of the institutions and high-ranking executives responsible for ideology.
This has resulted in the return of practices which are completely incomprehensible to us, in the light of recent developments in Europe.
It is absolutely essential that the European Union take more active measures in this matter.
It is also extremely important to involve our neighbours, both near and far, in these measures, and I would like to return to a comment made by Mr Siwiec, namely that we should take advantage of all existing opportunities to exert influence jointly on Belarus.
These opportunities include Russia, and in particular the democratic Russia which is unfortunately in retreat, but still exists.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, as is well known, the cold war is over and the Soviet Union no longer exists, and yet, as the report of the Commission and the debates in Parliament incontrovertibly show, the Belarusian people still find themselves behind an âiron curtainâ.
This is a paradox!
Belarus is left as a remnant of the Soviet empire, a hangover from it in its image.
Now the whole democratic world has received a provocation from Mr Lukashenko.
A referendum is under way to allow him to prolong his dictatorship.
We can predict that the dictatorship will succeed, as the democratic opposition has been deprived of its rights and silenced behind prison walls.
Let us not forget that the President of Belarus was a prominent partner of the Iraqi regime and of Saddam Hussein.
And this is all happening on the borders of democratic Europe.
As a result, it poses a threat not just to the people of Belarus but also to the neighbouring democracies.
Why is Belarusâs partner, Russia, not concerned about this?
Was this a problem discussed with Mr Putin by Jacques Chirac and Gerhard SchrÃ¶der in Sochi?
In this situation, the only hope of Belarusian democrats is to place their trust in the parliamentarians of free Europe and in our readiness to give both moral and financial support to the Belarusians and, of course, to the Commission.
It is our duty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, throughout history, Belarus has belonged to both Eastern and Western Europe, and relations between the EU and Belarus are strained.
The isolation of Belarus has become more obvious and, at the same time, less sustainable.
With EU enlargement, Belarus has become a neighbouring country of the EU, giving cause for increased contacts in those areas where such contacts are possible.
Right now, it is, however, unlikely that contacts will be improved as long as there is no decisive turnaround in the policy conducted in Belarus.
This applies above all to the distribution of power, the constitution, increased opportunities for the opposition to operate freely and the protection of human rights.
So far, there have been few indications of such a change.
That distribution of power that is central to a democracy is at present absent from Belarus.
Changes to the election process before the autumn parliamentary election on 17 October are thus necessary.
Not only, however, is Belarus to elect a new parliament on 17 October, but President Lukashenko has also announced that a special referendum on a change to the constitution is to take place. The referendum is about changing the constitution to extend his own period of office.
That is unacceptable from a democratic point of view.
Ever since Lukashenko took office as president in 1994, he has been dictatorial in strengthening his position in that role.
If there is a majority in favour of this latest attempt to remove the limit on the number of terms of office a president is allowed to serve, this means that, in all likelihood, Lukashenko will serve for at least another five years.
If I have calculated correctly, that will make for an uninterrupted period of 17 years.
Together, we must act to bring about increased support for democratic development in Belarus and must combat that isolation of Belorussian society and of the Belorussian people that many have talked about.
The EU must continue to support human rights and the development of a pluralistic society, to oppose trafficking in, and violence against, women and to further civil, democratic society.
It is also of the utmost importance that the whole of the international community be alert and supportive prior to the presidential election in order to show that this is something of significance, that we are concerned that Belarus develop in a democratic direction and that, as a number of people have said, we support the people of Belarus.
We must not turn our backs on the Belorussian people.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not believe the situation in Belarus to be satisfactory and the results of the efforts to assist civil society and support the democratisation process are extremely frustrating.
We must try to improve the functioning and capacity of our support and therefore improve the capacity of any political measures we adopt with a view to applying pressure in order to promote the democratisation of Belarus.
It is regrettable that parts of the Berlin Wall, which has come down right across Europe, should remain on a border with the European Union.
There remain certain fragments, in Belarus for example, and if one of the objectives of European Union action and presence at world level is to support democratisation and defend human rights, that objective and concern clearly become all the more important in the case of an immediate neighbour, in other words, on our own border.
I would like to say that we in the Commission cannot accept Mr Czarneckiâs assertion that we are only concerned about the Mediterranean and not about Eastern Europe.
How can you say we have not worried about Eastern European when, amongst other things, we have carried out an enlargement involving eight Eastern European countries, and within three years two more Eastern European countries will join.
When you see Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and other Mediterranean countries becoming members of the European Union, then I will accept that we are more concerned about the Mediterranean, but that is not the case now.
All we are offering the Mediterranean is a neighbourhood policy â it is our southern flank â and if you consider the demographic figures, you will see that, although you may be in Poland, what happens in the Mediterranean affects you considerably.
If, moreover, you are in Poland â that is to say, in the European Union â the Mediterranean is your problem, not just a problem for the Italians, the Maltese, the Cypriots, the Spanish, the Portuguese or the French.
The Mediterranean is your problem as a Pole and as a Member of the European Union.
Let us not confuse our values nor our objectives and priorities.
Eastern Europe, Europe â there is a reason why we call ourselves the European Union â is also our priority.
So much so that we have been able to enlarge, to grow â and we are continuing to do so now â and there has not yet been any talk of closing those borders.
So let us see things as they really are.
With regard to the various suggestions, I will refer firstly to the possibility of participating as observers in the forthcoming referendum and elections in Belarus.
I would like firstly to point out that the Belarusian Government has only invited the OSCE to participate as an observer â specifically its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights â and that this Parliament has not been invited officially.
The European Union is prepared to work together with the OSCE, which has been invited to attend as an observer solely at the parliamentary elections, not the referendum, which we believe it should also be invited to.
We believe it to be important that that monitoring be extended to the referendum.
Furthermore, we are going to continue working to ensure that the number of observers is increased and, possibly, that Members of this European Parliament can also participate.
We must remember that this is not currently the case and that we need to be invited in order to participate in this type of activity.
The next issue raised by certain speakers relates to the idea that our actions until now have not been sufficiently effective, that they are not producing results and that we should be much more active.
We in the Commission are prepared to promote that activity, but we must appreciate that there are limits.
Furthermore, some of you have said that spiritual assistance is not enough and that what is needed is financial assistance.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that there is currently assistance for Belarus for promoting democratisation, as well as shaping and strengthening civil society, but we wish to increase that assistance.
The European Union will maintain its aid in support of civil society and democratisation, regional and humanitarian cooperation, neighbourhood programmes and measures for facilitating movement in border areas.
Specifically, the European Unionâs TACIS programme provides for EUR 10 million for 2005-2006 and will focus on supporting that civil society, cooperating in the field of higher education and alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident which unfortunately was not so much an accident as a disaster.
I must also point out that the European initiative for democracy and human rights will play a very active role in Belarus in the coming years.
Specifically, in 2005-2006 the candidates in Belarus will be able to request aid within the framework of two campaigns we are going to launch, aimed at promoting the culture of human rights and promoting democratic processes.
I would, however, emphasise â and I said this at the beginning of my speech in this debate â that the authorities of Belarus are placing administrative obstacles in the way of all the programmes for this type of assistance we are proposing, and we must be able to overcome this resistance.
Turning to certain more specific issues, is it possible to collaborate with regional or even local governments?
Yes, provided that the national authorities of Belarus do not prevent us from ensuring that current funds reach their destination.
Are there any funds? Yes, and furthermore the ceiling available is not being used because of the problems I am referring to, caused by the Belarusian authorities.
We are worried about the closure of newspapers, the restriction of freedom of expression, persecution â in some cases of opposition elements â and the outlawing of political parties â we have naturally protested and are continuing to protest.
In this regard, the Council of General Affairs Ministers â that is to say the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the 25 States of the Union â yesterday issued a protest at the development of the situation in Belarus.
We protested at the closure of universities â specifically the University of Minskâ and we will continue to do so, but we must be aware of how far we can go, and that limit is largely set by the authorities of Belarus, which is clearly not a democracy but rather a dictatorship.
I also believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we must make use of the family relations between Belarusian citizens and citizens of European Union countries to promote the European Unionâs ideology, which is the ideology of freedom, of human dignity.
I also believe that we must promote political cooperation between political parties as much as possible and, to this end â as I have said â there are funds, there are possibilities, and this Parliament and its Members have a role to play.
We must be aware that things are not easy, that it does not appear that the latest measures taken by the Lukashenko regime are going to improve the situation, but we must nevertheless have faith in the citizens of Belarus.
It is not, moreover, a question of telling its citizens they are going to become members of the European Union, as I heard some honourable Members say a moment ago.
It will be they who decide in the future whether to go ahead with their strategic alliance or reunification with their neighbour Russia.
We cannot get into that kind of argument, which could create more tension.
The main objective is the full democratisation of Belarus, economic support to promote that democratisation, and then, once that democratisation is achieved through our neighbourhood policy, support for development and economic recovery and the improvement of living conditions in that country, which is a European country and a neighbour of the European Union.
Â Â  I should like to thank you, Commissioner, and all the speakers in that important debate.
I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the stocktaking of the follow-up to the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2005.(1)
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are meeting here in this House to debate the political priorities proposed by the Commission for 2005 and to assess the results of our structured dialogue: a which has now been operating for three years and which has had some positive results, which has made our actions more coherent and effective and interinstitutional cooperation more positive and which has ensured that the European Commissionâs right to initiative, which is one of its prerogatives, is not inconsistent with listening to the demands and sensitivities of this Parliament.
I would like to remind you that on 25 February last we presented a document in plenary on the political strategy for 2005 which had been approved that same day by the College of Commissioners.
Naturally, we approached the broad political priorities for next year with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the enlarged Europe, relaunching growth and improving competitiveness, in other words, the Lisbon strategy as a whole, promoting and protecting European citizenship and creating a circle of prosperity and stability together with our neighbour countries.
We must remember that 2004 is a special year, with a new Parliament, and the current Commission will shortly be replaced with a new one.
Our over recent years for establishing and promoting this structured dialogue between Parliament and the Commission has been modified and simplified in certain respects.
In this regard, there was a meeting between the Commission and the Conference of Committee Chairmen on 20 April in which we held a very positive exchange of views and which replaced the debates with the different committees.
Subsequently, we have followed very closely the work of those parliamentary committees and the various resolutions approved by this House over recent months, in particular in relation to the budgets for 2005 and the Commissionâs annual political strategy.
At the same time, we have held debates with the Council, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee on our proposals and they have all contributed their point of view.
What we have to do today is assess the results of this dialogue and point out that, in principle, this Parliament has reacted favourably to our broad proposals from an outgoing Commission which â I would emphasise â is passing the baton on to a new Commission.
The first of our priorities for 2005 are competitiveness and cohesion in an enlarged Europe.
In this regard, we would like to thank Parliament for its support for our intention to move towards genuine application of the Lisbon strategy by concentrating efforts on achieving fundamental objectives and supporting common policies, including the common agricultural policy.
The consolidation of the European economy will continue to rest on a healthy macroeconomic policy geared towards stability and based on sustainable public finances, particularly in view of our demographic forecasts.
The basic factors will be an integrated strategy aimed at improving competitiveness and structural reforms, promoting the knowledge-based economy and ensuring that the economic, employment, social, environmental and structural policies of the European Union and the Member States operate efficiently and coherently while maintaining the competitiveness of our economy.
The Commission has also pointed out the need decisively to support initiatives aimed at sustainable development and to increase coherence between industrial policy and other Community policies.
Specifically, I am also delighted to tell the European Parliament that, in various areas of my responsibility, we have made progress in this direction of openness and competitiveness.
Hence, since 1 July 2004, the electricity market has been a reality for non-domestic consumers and in March 2004 the Commission adopted an extremely important liberalisation package in relation to the railways.
The latter constitutes a decisive step towards creating a completely integrated European railways market by 2010, which is essential to the competitiveness and sustainability of our transport system and all of this by means of the gradual opening up of the passenger rail market.
I do not wish to go into issues which you have already supported and approved during 2004, such as the networks, the implementation of the single sky or the measures to be adopted on GALILEO before the end of the year relating to the decision on the group chosen for constructing and managing GALILEO.
The second great priority is security and European citizenship.
The Commission has noted the increasing interest on the part of this Parliament and the Council in enhancing European action in the field of security, particularly through strengthening controls on the external borders of the enlarged European Union, through better management of migratory flows, and Parliament has also expressed its concern â of course â to increase the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism at European level.
These are extremely sensitive issues for the citizens and relate to the creation of the area of common justice and security.
In June, the Commission made an assessment of the progress made since the Tampere European Council in 1999, and following the reactions of all the institutions, in particular the European Parliament, the Commission will carry on with its work in the field of justice and home affairs.
In 2005, the new multi-annual justice and home affairs programme will be launched â which we hope will be supported by the European Council of 5 November â as well as new support measures within the context of the next financial perspectives.
The terrorist attacks in Madrid were a dramatic reminder of the threat of international terrorism facing the European Union and have made the essential need to combat it more obvious than ever.
All the institutions, and the European Parliament in particular, have emphasised their desire to move ahead with this fight.
Just this morning, President Borrell spoke about this key issue; and all of this, as Mr Poettering said in his speech, without prejudice to human rights, to individual rights and to the objective and will to support the victims of terrorism, an essential element in this fight.
The Commission intends to continue working in this direction.
The third element is our external responsibilities and, in particular, the policy of association and neighbourhood.
We have just held a debate on Belarus, but it should be pointed out that the Commission has noted broad support for an ambitious policy of neighbourhood and has expressed its opinions in that regard in the Communication of 12 May 2004 which was approved by the European Council in June.
With regard to the enlargement process, the Commission can confirm that it is working towards the accession of Romania and Bulgaria in January 2007.
On the basis of the European Councilâs decision in June, the Commission will begin an active phase of negotiations with Croatia at the beginning of 2005 and will produce a pre-accession strategy.
In October, the Commission will publish its recommendation on Turkey and will have to adjust its activities in 2005 in accordance with the decision of the European Council scheduled for the end of this year.
As the Council and Parliament have stressed, Europeâs international commitments must be maintained during 2005 and Europe must show greater responsibility in order to promote effective multilateralism.
The multilateral trade negotiations within the context of the Doha programme for development remain the European Unionâs main commercial priority, and at the same time we shall continue with the regional and bilateral negotiations under way.
Please allow me to comment briefly on two issues which are particularly important for next year. Firstly, the future financial perspectives, whose priorities largely coincide with the priorities proposed for 2005.
The Commission is aware of the importance of doing whatever is necessary to ensure that everything is ready on 1 January 2007 and to this end the current Commission has presented proposals this year, in particular in February and July, and intends to present a new package of measures which will be adopted on 29 September with regard to the aspects of JHA, RELEX and the environment which remain outstanding.
2005 will be fundamental and essential in terms of moving forward with preparing for close interinstitutional cooperation, but, furthermore, it is essential that these financial perspectives can be adopted as soon as possible during 2005 or very early 2006 if we really want them to be effective in 2007.
I would like to point out that the Commission's proposal in this field takes account, on the one hand, of the austerity required, for example, by the Stability and Growth Pact in all public finances, but also realism with regard to the political ambitions repeatedly expressed not just by the Council but also by this Parliament.
Increasing our capacities with regard to protecting external borders means more European Union investment in this sector, which will perhaps allow for greater facilities in certain States.
If we truly wish to promote a competitive and dynamic society, we must increase investments in the research and development sector in order to support European research and capacity for innovation, and that requires more funds for that sector.
Furthermore, we cannot forget that one of the objectives of European policy is the cohesion policy.
We cannot call for this policy if we do not provide the necessary funds.
We believe that what has been proposed, which is to keep 1.24 as the ceiling for commitments and establish 1.14 as the ceiling for spending, represents an appropriate balance between austerity and realism.
Any additional cut would be extremely negative and would mean giving up many of the policies being called for.
Ladies and gentlemen, the second point I wish to stress is that of the impact assessments relating to the Commissionâs proposals.
The Commission is implementing and generalising the use of these assessments in order to better define and justify its proposals.
In 2004, the Commissionâs services gradually increased the use of impact assessments with the aim of making them common practice by 2005, applied to all main documents â political definitions, legislative documents â as well as all proposals with significant economic, social or environmental impact, points which are included in the working programme and the legislative programme of the Commission and which are of great importance to this Parliament.
In February, at the time of the presentation, I emphasised that it was a complex proposal and a complex procedure, because this Commission is passing the baton on to the next one.
When the Prodi Commission established the cycle of strategic planning and programming, he wanted to involve the other institutions.
Today, at the end of his mandate, I am delighted to note, as the Commissioner responsible for relations with the European Parliament, that the results are very positive.
The interinstitutional dialogue has contributed to promoting greater mutual understanding and developing a shared vision which allows us to direct our policies more effectively.
I hope that the future Commission will draw what it considers to be the appropriate conclusions and that, where necessary, it will propose revisions of the current procedures which make the methods approved during this time even more efficient.
Â Â  The debate is now suspended and will resume immediately after the vote.
â Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday and this morning we have had the opportunity to deal with the issue of terrorism, its murderous insanity and the concern it brings to the whole civilised world.
We are now going to pay tribute to the child victims of the latest terrorist massacre at the school in Beslan.
Please be aware that, at the same time as us, tens of millions of children in the European Union are joining us in our tribute.
In addition to the reactions of governments, of political leaders, of parliaments, let us hope that this mobilisation contributes to finding the path to peace.
Let us dedicate a minuteâs silence to the victims.
Mr Pannella has the floor for a point of order.
Â Â  â Mr President, I take the floor pursuant to Rules 166 and 150 to say that, in my view, we are about to commit a very serious and inexplicable act.
As Members of the new Parliament, we are being asked to decide upon our times, places and methods of work for 2005.
Obviously, to decide on all that, we would need a draft proposal and the opportunity to discuss it and to table amendments.
Now, however, without any debate or discussion, without mentioning Strasbourg or our places of work, we find ourselves having to ratify a timetable drawn up by the last Parliament back in April, when there were different majorities and different historical situations in Europe, and which in fact excludes the ten new Member States and their Members.
I therefore believe, Mr President, that the Rules of Procedure have not been observed.
Â Â  The Presidency does not believe it appropriate to open a debate on this subject.
A decision has already been made on this issue.
There has never been a debate in this Parliament on the calendar of part-sessions.
It has been dealt with by the Bureau and consequently the Presidency does not believe it appropriate to accept the point of order tabled by MrÂ Pannella.
We shall now proceed to the vote on the calendar of part-sessions for 2005, to which no amendments have been tabled.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to know whether I am allowed to make an explanation of vote.
Â Â  I am sorry, Mr Dover, but it has been a vote without debate and in this case explanations of vote should have been presented in writing in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
I would ask you to respect them.
We will try to ensure that you can do so next time.
Â Â  . I voted in favour, although I remain opposed to not holding plenary sessions on Fridays of Strasbourg weeks.
Everyone has now realised that removing Friday mornings, halfway through the last legislature, tied in perfectly with both a strategy of trouble making and with the proposals of Members who are, as a rule, anti-Strasbourg.
This move â three yearsâ experience is ample proof of this â has adversely affected our work and has led to an even greater overload of schedules that are already very crowded.
Accordingly, I hope that this matter will be looked at again in the future and that, for the benefit of the running of Parliament, the Friday morning sessions will be reinstated.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Economic and Social Committeeâs request for consultation, as I feel that, quite apart from its purely procedural aspect, this committeeâs stance is crucial on the important legal instrument that may dominate the future of the Union in the coming years.
Indeed, in a European Union based on a common market and a single currency, and which claims common citizenship, it is crucial that we listen to the assembly, as it gives a voice to the interests of the various economic and social groups.
The social fabric of our lives is made up of employers, workers and representatives of specific activities such as agriculture, craftsmen, SMEs and industries, the liberal professions, representatives of consumers, of the scientific and teaching community, of the social economy and of families.
It is therefore essential that we become aware of how they see the issues that affect them directly.
I also hope that this consultation will serve to encourage the crucial wider debate on the new Constitution â hopefully reflected in democratic referendums â at the grassroots, among the citizens, through various economic and social groups, in conjunction with the local authorities and, of course, with the political forces.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the request for consultation on the part of the Committee of the Regions, as I feel that quite apart from its purely procedural aspect, this committeeâs stance is crucial on the important legal instrument that may dominate the future of the Union in the coming years.
Indeed, in a European Union that favours decision-making as close as possible to the citizens and respects the principle of subsidiarity, it is essential that we listen to the political assembly, which gives a voice to local and regional power.
I am aware of the declaration by the Committee of the Regions on 19Â March of this year, in which the committee stated that it would join the project and the constitutional process.
What I would like to know in greater detail, however, is its position as regards issues that concern it directly.
I also hope that this consultation will serve to encourage the crucial wider debate on the new Constitution â hopefully reflected in democratic referendums â at the grassroots, among the citizens, through various economic and social groups, in conjunction with the local authorities and, of course, with the political forces.
Â Â  . The aim of Draft amending budget No 7/2004 is to enter in the 2004 budget the surplus from 2003, amounting to EUR 5Â 470 million, which mainly consisted of the under-spending in the Structural Funds.
It should be noted that the surplus would be EURÂ 10.5Â million in 2003, had EURÂ 5 000Â million not been reduced by Amending Budget No 6/2003.
Budget surpluses have been consistent since 2000 â EURÂ 12Â 000 million in 2000, EURÂ 15Â 000Â million in 2001 and EURÂ 7Â 000 million in 2002 â due to under-spending in the Structural Funds.
If the funds for economic and social cohesion are the target of spending and are vital for economic and social cohesion, we must ask the following questions: Why is this not being done?
Is it because of the Stability Pact?
Is it due to a lack of political will?
Against this backdrop, it would appear to make sense, for those who say that there is extra money because money is not being spent, with the budget having to remain below 1%, to reduce the Structural Funds and even to renationalise the cohesion policy, which is not acceptable.
It is no coincidence that the main net contributors are among the worst performers. ...
Â Â  . Draft amending budget No 8/2004 relates to the revenue side of the budget and comprises a number of elements affecting the level of contributions by Member States to the Communityâs own resources, the correction of budgetary imbalances granted to the United Kingdom from 2000 and 2003 â the so-called âBritish chequeâ.
Although the rapporteurâs intentions have not appeared in the report â the approval of Commission decisions to create a general mechanism for correcting imbalances in the Communityâs own resources â we must, however, restate our strong opposition to the Commissionâs intentions and those of the main financial contributors; after all, you cannot remedy one injustice by committing another.
In practice, the aim of the proposals on the table is to implement a new kind of âBritish chequeâ for other financial contributors, given that it is not possible to cancel a âBritish chequeâ.
Indeed, the remaining Member States cover the shortfall.
The correction of imbalances would entail a harmonisation of effort per inhabitant, depending on the relative wealth of each country.
National contributions based on GNP would be the fairest way, albeit subject to improvement, of solving the evident imbalances in budgetary contributions.
Â Â  I am abstaining from voting on this report.
I do not regret the fact that there is a surplus in the EU budget, since this means smaller contributions for the individual Member States.
The Member Statesâ contributions should be reduced permanently with a view to limiting the way in which money is shunted around and, in the longer term, even the EUâs administration.
I wish to see a general review of the way in which the EUâs budget is funded, leading to a uniform system of payments.
Â Â  . As the United Kingdom Conservatives spokesman on the Budgets Committee I wish to explain why we voted against the two Draft Amending Budget Reports Nos 7/2004 and 8/2004 today.
The United Kingdom Conservative Members of the European Parliament are totally opposed to any suggestion, or proposal, that the British rebate should be reduced.
Why should Britain suffer for its economic success over the last 20 years?
Â Â  We are abstaining from voting on this report.
