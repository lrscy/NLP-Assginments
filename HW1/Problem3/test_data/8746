I am confident and I hope that, following that vote, which I hope and pray will be positive, Parliament will take the baton so that the Constitution is not put on ice indefinitely.
I myself thought that we had got rid of the ice when we reformed the common agricultural policy, once we no longer had butter mountains.
Now, though, I see that we are putting the Constitution and the financial perspectives on ice.
No, Europe does not need hibernation, it needs action.
Europe needs a clearly marked path.
So, the time has come to pass on the baton.
On the financial perspectives, we could have reached an agreement, and it is extremely regrettable that we did not do so.
I think that MrÂ Juncker gave as transparent a report as MrÂ Bonde has always hoped for, as transparent as possible.
We have spoken a great deal about various aspects of the negotiations.
We came within a hairâs breadth of reaching agreement, because we know that, had there been a true current of agreement, those who were rejecting it would have agreed in the end.
They did not do so because the current of agreement failed for the reasons of which you are aware.
Many reasons have also been put forward not to accept this agreement.
I have a bad feeling that, in the end, those reasons are more a pretext than real reasons.
If reform becomes a pretext for not adopting important decisions for Europe, this does Europe a disservice.
I tell you this, and MrÂ Juncker has already said it: we were prepared to make, in a declaration, a substantial commitment to reform.
Well, that commitment did not see the light of day because, in the end, there was no final decision on the financial perspectives.
Reform, yes, but reform in solidarity.
We will not have reform without the people.
We will not have reform without solidarity with everyone.
The agricultural policy was also the target of a great deal of criticism.
We forget rather too easily that there are, nevertheless, fundamental achievements in this agricultural policy.
Who would wish for the desertification of acres of European countryside?
Who wishes for that?
Who would wish poverty on the rural population?
Who wants that?
I think that, once again, we need to debate the agricultural policy and not blame it for every problem, not demonise it, so to speak.
I think that, on that subject, some honesty is needed.
Primarily, and on this point I think that I am echoing MrÂ Baringdorf, is everybody really so innocent when we discuss agricultural policy?
Does everybody think only of reforming it in one way without thinking about reforming it in another?
I think that you will have many more opportunities to discuss reforms, including reform of the common agricultural policy.
Do not forget, however, that there is also solidarity with the countryside, which is also a component of European culture.
I obviously regret that Europe has not been able to find the positive dynamic that it could have drawn from the adoption of a better Stability and Growth Pact, and particularly from a revision of the Lisbon Strategy.
We have no financial perspectives.
I wish the next Presidency luck in reaching an acceptable and balanced agreementÂ âÂ indeed, someone has already mentioned balanced agreementsÂ âÂ taking into account MrÂ BÃ¶geâs report which was adopted by a very large majority of your Parliament.
Given that the agreement in the Council was an agreement that would, in any event, still have had to be negotiated with your Parliament, it is an illusion to think that the Council alone decides on the financial perspectives, since it is clear that the Council can only reach an agreement within the interinstitutional framework with the assent of your Parliament and, of course, of the Commission too.
Much has been said about a fair return.
I think that it is a virus gnawing away at European solidarity: we must eradicate it.
Europe really must be vaccinated against this narrow idea of a fair return.
I will not talk about the definition of the richest countriesÂ âÂ I do not want to get involved in that kind of discussionÂ âÂ but what I have noticed is that there has been a great deal of fiddling with the numbers.
There has been much fiddling, in order to justify positions that, if they were explained a little better, would then appear much more qualified.
However, I do not want to conclude this assessment of the Luxembourg Presidency without stressing, as MrÂ Harbour did, that, although there has been a failure with respect to the financial perspectives, there have also been many successes.
Europe is continuing to work in other fields of importance to the populations of Europe.
I note, for example, that there has been an agreement, thanks in part to your Parliament, on the âexternal bordersâ code: this is vital if we are to increase security at our external borders, and I think that your Parliament will vote on it during this part-session.
It is a success that we must not minimise and that we must not now drown in an overly negative discussion on the current state of Europe.
I note, too, that there have been a dozen approvals at first reading with your Parliament on important matters, such as cross-border mergers, or concerning the internal market.
I think that these are important achievements that must not be minimised.
The same is true of the approvals at second reading, without recourse to conciliation, in a field such as car insurance, which has a direct effect on citizens who travel and who cross borders.
Yes, Europe is experiencing major difficulties, but I think that a part of its destiny is now also in your hands.
We want to open up a debate.
That debate must take place here, and it must take place in the national parliaments, within public opinion.
I wish you all the courage and all the creativity that you have shown before to feed this debate, so that we can extricate ourselves as quickly as possible from these difficulties.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to join all those who have expressed their sincere admiration and gratitude to Jean-Claude Juncker, Minister Schmit and their team for their engagement, the passion and what I would like to call the sense of Europe that they have demonstrated.
We often talk about the sense of State in relation to great statesmen and women, but it is high time to introduce the concept of a sense of Europe, and this is what Mr Juncker especially has shown throughout the Luxembourg presidency.
I would like to add that we also greatly appreciate the transparency and openness that you have introduced, Mr Juncker.
Of course, we should also highlight the successes that you have been able to achieve in a highly difficult political context.
However, this debate on the Luxembourg presidency has turned into a debate on the European crisis.
The most significant expression of this crisis is perhaps the feeling of confusion that we now perceive among the public and in the very basic questions that citizens have started to ask.
What will happen to the Constitution?
What does it mean if we cannot have a constitution in the end?
How will this affect enlargement?
Has it already started to affect enlargement?
In the different regions of Europe, they have already started to ask very basic questions about the budget.
What will happen?
Will we get our money?
What happens to all our projects?
May I just say to Mr Harbour and others that we should not underestimate the citizens of Europe.
Throughout Europe they know that Europe is not only about a market.
It is also about quality of life and they expect the European Union to deliver and to establish policies which affect their quality of life, the environment and all the other issues that are so important for our everyday lives.
These are the questions that European citizens will continue to put to all our institutions and it is our joint responsibility to provide the answers, as far as we can.
The European Union is a unique creation.
It works on the basis of this very constructive, or hopefully constructive, interaction of the âinstitutional triangleâ.
However, the outcome of the European Council this weekend seems to show that one of the corners is somehow broken.
That puts a bigger responsibility on the other two corners, the Commission and Parliament, but in this debate I have seen that there is a willingness and determination to work together.
Mr Juncker referred to the institutional maturity that the Parliament has shown.
We have seen this, for example, on the occasion of the recent Parliament resolution on the financial perspective.
As President Barroso said earlier, the Commission stands ready to assist the incoming presidency to find an agreement on the future financial perspectives.
We however have to bear in mind three crucial points.
First, we need the resources to implement those policies on which the citizens expect the Union to deliver, and we need the budget for that.
A deal that does not secure those resources will not allow us to bridge the gap between citizens and Europe.
Second, this House must accept the agreement.
Third, it must meet the legitimate needs of the new Member States who have shown their constructive attitude during the summit meeting.
The main challenge for the months to come is the launch of a real dialogue on the future of Europe. The European Council has called for that dialogue in which the Commission is also invited to play a central role.
We will of course give shape to what we call Plan D: debate, dialogue and democracy.
We will work with the other institutions and we will try to mobilise the necessary resources for this.
The Commission will accept its responsibility and we will also immediately start to work on the âstrategic roadmapâ, which will hopefully provide some more of the responses to the very basic questions that I mentioned before.
We will, more than ever, need the input, cooperation and support of this House and all of those, who like Mr Juncker, have developed the sense of Europe and are ready to respond to his very solemn invitation.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m.
I hope the European Parliament and the national parliaments can play a little role in the Plan D you put forward with the Council and Commission.
I have received six motions for resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
Â Â  â This was a European Council in which the impact of the double victory for the no campaign, in the French and Dutch referenda of 29Â May and 1Â June, was clear for all to see.
This victory paved the way for combating the increasingly neoliberal guidelines that have gradually been introduced in the EU in recent years, and that have ultimately been enshrined in the draft so-called European Constitution.
From a political and legal point of view, the people dealt the Constitutional Treaty a deadly blow in these referenda, given that a Treaty can only enter into force if it has been ratified by all 25 Member States.
The European Council of 16 and 17Â June had the evidence staring it in the face, yet it chose to ignore it, preferring instead to admit that it had suffered a setback and to prolong the agony for some more time by giving itself a year to take stock.
It will at some point have to acknowledge that this proposal in its current form cannot enter into force, and even in revised form it will be required to undergo the entire ratification process again.
With regard to the Financial Perspective, the complete absence of a spirit of solidarity is regrettable ...
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on amending the Decision of 4 June 2003 on the adoption of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament (2005/2124(INI)) (A6-0189/2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Membersâ Statute that we are discussing has to lay down the Membersâ prerogatives, in the first instance.
It must state who the Member of the European Parliament is, what his rights and duties are, and what his immunities are, transforming him from a national delegate to a representative of the European peoples in their entirety.
In essence, the Statute is a fundamental pillar of the process of European integration, and it is not approved in order to govern salaries or the reimbursement of expenses, but to govern and enhance the role and function of the Member in the European Community.
A standardised approach to salaries would risk being discriminatory, because it deals with different situations in the same manner.
Those who gave prominence to that part of the Statute â which I define as of lesser importance and which only serves a demagogic purpose in stirring the emotions of the mass media â are mistaken and have not grasped the profound meaning that new rules at a European level can have.
In my opinion, MrÂ Juncker, the decision that Parliament is about to make in a time of crisis is important, because working towards providing Parliament with a more European function is worthwhile and fundamental for the credibility of the Union.
It is for that reason that the Council and the Member States, who do not want the European Parliament to be strengthened, oppose the Statute.
We came close to agreement in the last parliamentary term, when Mr Rothley, a great legal expert, and I provided significant input.
The European Parliament in June and December played its part by listening to the suggestions of the Council, which the Council, however, after we had adopted them, subsequently withdrew and has not since approved.
I should like to mention MrÂ Lehne, who provided a significant, intelligent and cooperative contribution to the text in question; in December 2003, he summed it up neatly: âwe have been negotiating now for nearly five years, and we cannot continue any longer in a situation where the Council leads Parliament a dance like a bear with a ring through its nose in a circus arena.â
I repeat today the words that MrÂ Lehne spoke at that time.
Members of the European Parliament have to have their own autonomous reference standard, which no longer derives from their Member States of origin but from their being representatives of the Community.
In an official statement, the Council undertook to start up a process designed to provide us with common rules with regard to parliamentary immunity.
It is a strong political commitment, which I welcome and which we would like to see confirmed today in this House by the Luxembourg Presidency.
The text that we have approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs takes account of the umpteen suggestions of the Council and represents an important balancing point, MrÂ President, on which we must meet.
Once again, we Members have been ready to pay a price in order to have the Statute and I have to say that that is also true for the Italian Members, considered to be ill-disposed to the salary, who have made a contribution, since it gives them a drastic cut in their allowances.
So, although we have accepted all of the Councilâs requests, the Luxembourg Presidency has still expressed some doubts, and opposes a recital â number 12 â that I proposed and that the Committee approved, a recital enabling the Member States to lay down supplementary measures in order to make the status of the Members of the European Parliament equal to members of national parliaments.
Recital 12 is a mirror-image of recital 11, which in contrast allows the Member States to pay national rates.
If some countries are allowed to nationalise the system, effectively reducing our salary, why cannot others supplement it instead or give us the facilities that they provide to members of national parliaments?
Why is it so difficult to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the Statute provides the legal basis â and this is important â for allowing the Member States to provide those benefits that they also give to members of parliament in their own country?
By sending a personal letter and by failing to consult the Council, the Luxembourg Presidency â I have to say â has reacted hastily to this amendment, stating that it does not agree with it.
It has sent a letter that, in my opinion and â I believe â in the opinion of the majority ofMembers, is unacceptable from an institutional point of view.
It is undue interference, which I have reported to you, MrÂ President, in order to defend our independence and our sovereignty.
The Luxembourg Presidency needs to be reminded to respect the role and the prerogatives of Parliament.
If the Presidency had not wasted time criticising Parliament or finding specious, trumped-up obstacles, and had lavished more energy on preventing the failure of the Council, it would perhaps have acted wisely.
It is now seeking to take home at least one positive result, by promoting the announcement of this Statute, which I believe is an important moment in the life of Parliament.
Parliament is aware of the crisis of Europe, which we have discussed all afternoon, and of the need to change method.
Europe has to overcome the period in which the weight of bureaucracy prevailed over the dynamics of the issues.
Europe is a political issue, not a stereotype, for which clear guidelines are needed, and not a compromise at any cost.
I hope that the United Kingdom intends to begin a new course of action, just as a new course of action also needs to be begun by Parliament.
I am sure that the Council will not reject the Statute on the grounds of this amendment, the content of which lays down a possibility that the Council itself formally stated could be accepted.
That is the legal basis.
What if these measures did not exist?
In my opinion, MrÂ President, they could be considered invalid by the Court of Justice.
The exchange of letters between the President of Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council carries strong weight at a political level, but not for the Court of Justice: therefore, if they are accepted politically, why not lay it down in the Statute, unless there is a reservation in the minds of some people who I hope do not wish to stoop to similar trickery?
I will conclude with an appeal, MrÂ President: let us approve the Statute as tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Significant cooperation has taken place among all of the Members, and it is a balanced text, which will enter into force in 2009, which leaves adequate transition periods to adapt to the new system.
It is a genuine first step towards the single Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, for 15 years a statute for Members of the European Parliament has been under discussion and, as you know, many initiatives have been taken, both by your Parliament and by the Council, with a view to creating such a statute.
The statute we are examining today mainly took shape under the Belgian Presidency in the second half of 2001.
Parliament and the Council were very close to an agreement at that time, but the stumbling block proved to be the reimbursement of actual expenses and tax liability.
The process then came to a standstill, and it was under the Italian presidency that MrÂ Rothley presented a new draft report to Parliament, a draft that also seemed to have good prospects of success.
In his report, MrÂ Rothley proposed a solution with the potential to reconcile the positions of the Council and Parliament.
In particular, Parliament now favoured the reimbursement of Membersâ actual expenses under an arrangement that would enter into force along with the new statute.
On 21Â JanuaryÂ 2004, the Rothley report was presented to your Committee on Legal Affairs for discussion.
Unfortunately, on 26 January, the General Affairs Council failed to reach political agreement, chiefly because of the budgetary implications of the draft proposals.
In NovemberÂ 2004, in his address to the European Council, PresidentÂ JosepÂ Borrell â you yourself, MrÂ President â signalled that the European Parliament was willing to be flexible in this matter in order to secure an early agreement.
He also emphasised to the European Council that Parliament could not formally present a new proposal without being assured that it would be accepted by the Council and that there was therefore a need for informal consultations.
At the end of 2004, under the Dutch Presidency, these consultations took place in the presence of representatives of the future Luxembourg Presidency, and it was agreed that efforts would be made to reach agreement in the first half of 2005.
On 12Â January 2005, the President-in-Office of the Council, in his speech presenting the programme of the Luxembourg Presidency to the European Parliament, confirmed the Presidencyâs intention of ensuring, in cooperation with the whole of Parliament and its President, that the negotiations on this matter would be brought to a successful conclusion.
MrÂ President, after 26 years â yes, 26 years â of being directly elected by universal suffrage, the European Parliament still has no uniform statute for its Members.
That is why today and tomorrow, when the vote takes place, could be decisive, given that the Council and the European Parliament seem to be able to proceed at long last to a decision.
Let me pay special tribute to the efforts of MrÂ Gargani, rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and to the members of that committee, who have managed, within what was admittedly an extremely tight time frame, to present a report that should certainly satisfy the Council.
It is also true that the Presidency could perhaps have devoted even more time to this matter.
We thought we could resolve the issue of the financial perspectives at the same time.
Had we known then what we know now, we should have left the matter of the financial perspectives to the next Presidency in order to focus more sharply on the Membersâ Statute.
I am particularly grateful to you, MrÂ President, and to your office and your Secretariat for your combined efforts and for the continuous formal and informal dialogue with our Presidency.
You have displayed a great deal of courage and tenacity in pursuit of this statute, which has not always been an easy matter.
May I also thank all the other Members of Parliament who have patiently, and sometimes discreetly, helped us to work on this difficult and sensitive issue, which is always liable to be a target for demagogues.
This was brought home to me once again this afternoon right here in Parliament.
The Council, for its part, has kept its promise by trying to establish a consensus on a number of elements that might be the key to agreement on the draft statute.
In a letter of 6Â June to your President, I enumerated these elements, foremost among which are remuneration, the principle of reimbursing travel and staff expenses on the basis of actual cost and the principle that the European Parliament, and hence the Community budget, should shoulder responsibility for pension contributions.
The Council cannot but be gratified to note that, thanks to our close cooperation, all of these elements have been incorporated into the final report submitted to you today.
I believe that the draft on which we are preparing to take a decision is conducive to greater transparency, an ever-present demand in all of your deliberations and in all of ours.
The draft also respects a fundamental principle that underlies all European policies, namely that of non-discrimination, as well as the principle of equal pay for equal work.
In a letter of 16Â June, I expressed my satisfaction to President Borrell at the overwhelming vote of approval delivered by the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the report you have presented to us.
I also indicated that the amendments adopted by the committee were acceptable to the presidency, with the exception of the clause included in the final report, in recital 12 of the parliamentary resolution, about which MrÂ Gargani has just spoken.
We believe, in fact, that the substance of this recital falls largely within the domain of national laws and regulations.
There is nothing, absolutely nothing, to prevent a government from paying a supplement or allowance â call it what you will â to its MEPs to put them on a par with members of the national parliament.
That, however, is a national matter; it is not a matter for European legislation.
European law has to ensure that there is equality within the European framework.
We talk of subsidiarity; let us practise it for once.
It is certainly true that this provision has been discussed among the various parties.
We have exchanged correspondence, which, I believe, has a certain political value and which is based on a sort of code of confidence between the presidencies of the Council and Parliament.
These letters have spelled out clearly that such agreements or national regulations, as the case may be, are not opposed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on this last outstanding issue, namely recital 12, I hope that we shall be able to find a solution that satisfies the Council too.
It would be wrong to give the impression, in adopting a Community instrument, an act of the European Union, of creating a European statute while paving the way at the same time for its renationalisation.
This is essentially why we do not want this amendment in recital 12.
As far as procedure is concerned, once the report drafted by the committee chairman, MrÂ Gargani, has been approved by you along with the resolution and decision, the adopted documents will be submitted to Coreper for approval on 30Â June in accordance with Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty.
I hope that this procedure, so close to the finishing line, will have a satisfactory outcome.
I believe that, in doing this, in adopting this statute, we shall also be ending a situation that is completely incomprehensible to the public at large as well as ourselves.
As you said, MrÂ President, we shall be enhancing the credibility of the European Union, the credibility of your Parliament and its Membersâ Statute and also of the Council, which, after all, will have approved the statute.
I believe that the Presidency has displayed commitment â not always enough, perhaps; I accept that criticism â but what we want to do today is to make that final push and take our decision.
Lastly, as regards the question raised by MrÂ Gargani about the privileges and immunities of Members of the European Parliament, we attach considerable importance to that point, and we fully understand your Parliamentâs concern to resolve the issue.
The Council agrees that a clear declaration on that subject should be adopted, and we hope that we shall be able to resolve the question of privileges and immunities in the near future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I sincerely welcome the efforts of the rapporteur Mr Gargani, Parliament and the Luxembourg presidency, in finding a solution agreeable to all parties on the Membersâ Statute.
The Commission gave its opinion on the original proposal for a statute in June 2003.
It was favourable and made two general observations.
First, we pointed out that the provisions in the draft statute relating to the privileges and immunities of Members and governed by primary law could not be amended in an act based on Article 190 of the EC Treaty.
In this new draft these provisions have been removed.
Our second comment concerned the financial implications of the statute and these concerns have also been addressed.
We have seemed very close to agreement before, only to have everyoneâs hopes dashed at the last minute.
I sincerely hope that this time the statute will finally be approved.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have to admit that, as recently as a couple of weeks ago, I did not believe we would ever get as close as this to adopting our Membersâ Statute.
If anyone in particular is to be thanked for this unexpected turn of events, it is the Luxembourg presidency, although I can well imagine that it would have preferred â and regarded it as more important â to achieve success elsewhere.
I would also like to thank the President of this House for his efforts in this matter, along with the Chairman of our Committee on Legal Affairs.
Our being so close to having the Statute owes much to our former fellow Member and rapporteur Willy Rothleyâs dedication, to which I would like to pay tribute, and which the President-in-Office of the Council has already mentioned.
I hope I am doing what he would have wanted in recalling three fundamentals that have always underpinned our calls for a common statute.
Quite apart from anything prior to that date, it was the introduction, in 1979, of direct elections to the European Parliament, and the progressive improvement of its rights and prerogatives as the joint legislator for the EU, and its budgetary authority, that made it wholly inappropriate and improper that the rights of its Members should be subject to national law and that we should be dependent on national parliaments.
As is well known, one consequence of that is that we, Members of a single Parliament, are now subject to 25 different national systems of regulations, which makes a mockery of the principle that all Members of this House are equal.
There is some justification for the criticism that has been levelled at the internal arrangements, including the improvement in low basic rates of pay.
All these things give us at least three good reasons why any Membersâ Statute is better than none, but there is no doubt that what we now have before us, having for a long time been bounced back and forth between the Council and this House, adds up to more than that.
It adds up to a balanced and respectable proposal, and one that resolves the presenting problems to which I have already referred, although we have to take on board the need for long transitional periods as we move towards a standardised system.
Along with others, I personally would have liked certain arrangements to be different; I would, for example, have liked to see higher gross pay and to have us making our own pension contributions, but this is evidently neither the time nor the place to introduce many different and mutually contradictory individual variants.
If we want to have a Statute, then this is the only one we are going to get, and it is for that reason that my Group is going to vote in favour of it tomorrow.
We also perceive a problem in Recital 12, against which we have already voted in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
We have asked for a split vote on it, and my Group will be voting against Recital 12, even though we do not want the Statute to be brought down at the last hurdle by something that is a current problem, but not one with any legal significance.
We also have a problem with the amendment to ArticleÂ 23, as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the effect that the European Parliament, being a European institution, can make payments not only in euros, but also in the currencies of countries outside the eurozone.
I think it would be inappropriate for an entity such as the European Parliament to make payments in anything other than the euro, and this would also entail numerous administrative problems for the House.
We will therefore be opposing this addition, for which no provision was originally made.
I would like to reiterate my warmest thanks to all those who have played a part in this, while also pointing out, for the sake of fairness, that we want to make a number of additions to the resolution that we shall be adopting tomorrow.
Our particular concern is with expressing our desire for an Assistantsâ Statute.
It is only fair and right, if we MEPs are to at last have one set of rules for all, that there should also be one to put the legal position of our staff on a new footing.
This is not to make the one dependent on the other, but we who are Members of this House should do everything in our power to offer our staff fair arrangements.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are nearly there: a Membersâ Statute that has eluded us for so long.
This must be the best chance we have ever had and, on behalf of the ALDE Group, I would like to thank the Luxembourg presidency and you for getting us this far.
Of course it is a compromise, but it is an important compromise for two reasons: equal pay for equal work â and that means equal; fair treatment for all our colleagues.
This, of course, is between ourselves, but it is a small step forward for Europe.
Secondly, and probably more important, between our citizens and ourselves it will finally deliver a transparent system of expenses based on actual cost.
We will be cleaning up our act and removing a constant cause for public criticism.
This is a bigger step for Europe and the European Parliament as it confirms its maturity.
The ALDE Group will take a principled line of voting against all amendments, including recital 12.
That is not because we do not think some of the amendments have merit.
Of course we want a better language regime in this House; of course we want a statute for assistants; of course we want the pension fund sorted out; of course we would like earlier implementation.
However, what we most want is a Membersâ Statute and any amendment could risk destroying the delicate balance in this House and with the Council.
If this fails, let it be Councilâs fault, not this Parliamentâs.
Any amendment could potentially be a wrecking amendment in this situation.
This House must show its full maturity and restraint tomorrow, vote for the essential and deliver a Membersâ Statute for the European Parliament.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency and yourself for having arrived at this outcome today.
When the debate on the Membersâ Statute began, it was extremely noble: people talked about immunity, status, and it was a means by which to underline the existence of a supranational parliament directly elected by the European people.
Then everything went wrong: it has become a debate on money and various acts of pettiness, which is highly complicated by national exceptions that have partly drained away the European value of this Statute, which has now become almost exclusively based on money.
Even if we vote against paragraph 12, I call on the Presidency to consider that it is by no means this paragraph that makes the Statute less European.
It is precisely all those who interfered, particularly on the fiscal system, who have got rid of the truly European content.
That said, tomorrow my group will be equally divided between those abstaining and those voting in favour, because there are a number of elements of this Statute about which we have very serious issues, the issue of pensions, in particular.
We believe that we are citizens like everyone else, and that it is therefore entirely justifiable that, when you are entitled to a pension, you have in some way to contribute to, and participate in, funding that reserve.
That is the reason for which a number of our members will abstain on that issue and will consequently vote in favour of our amendment.
On the other hand, I should like to underline the fact that we are very strongly in favour of this Statute.
Even we perfectly understand that we are in a ânow or neverâ situation.
The final comment that I should like to make is the fact that in recent years certainly not only the Luxembourg Government, but also the Council as a whole, has complicated the situation and made it much more difficult, partly because it has introduced a new concept of, let us say, enlarged assent, by which people are not limited to saying just yes or no.
We hope that in future we too in the European Parliament will be able to take advantage of this enlarged assent procedure.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although there is unanimity within my group on the need for a Membersâ Statute, there are also â as of course in any group â very divergent ideas about what precise shape it should take.
This is one reason why not all the members of my group will be voting the same way.
Our demand â backed up by amendments to the Rothley report â had always been that the amount reimbursed in respect of travel costs should correspond to the expenses actually incurred, transparency being the primary consideration.
Any reimbursement over and above the actual costs is not acceptable.
I might add that the possibility exists already of repaying excessive travel expenses, and that the German Members, for example, have already undertaken to do so.
Turning to the pension fund, there are differences of opinion among us concerning the proportion of the MEPâs share in contributions as opposed to the share payable by Parliament, but we do, in any case, endorse the basic principle according to which Members of this House â in the same way as other citizens â must contribute to the social security systems and bear their share of funding the pension scheme, even though we are aware that this is a pension fund rather than a system founded upon solidarity.
The same applies to contributions to accident insurance.
In our debates, we should never lose sight of the fact that one reason why MEPs need to make contributions is that it is the taxpayer who pays our salaries.
We are all advocates of equal pay for equal work.
It is unacceptable that the incomes of MEPs from different countries should differ by as much as EURÂ 11Â 000, and that is why it is right that a uniform salary should be brought in.
As for how much this should amount to, we could of course have some really good arguments about that.
It also goes without saying that MEPs in receipt of a uniform salary should also be taxed on a uniform basis, namely in accordance with European tax law.
If the Member States go further and decide that they want also to levy the difference between the European and national tax rate, then they are perfectly entitled to do so, provided that this does not result in double taxation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Swedish June List believes that Members of the European Parliament should receive their salaries from their respective national parliaments and receive uniform remuneration from the European Parliament.
The principle of subsidiarity must be our guide.
It is up to individual Member States to decide the salaries to be paid to their parliamentarians.
The national salaries paid to Members of the European Parliament are adjusted in accordance with the actual salaries and costs that prevail in the respective Member States.
Members should have their salaries paid by their own countries and pay tax there too.
From the point of view purely of principle, we believe that the EU should not fix the salaries of MEPs elected by people in each of the EU countries.
It would not be fair if a Member of the European Parliament from a country in which salaries are low were to receive a salary several times higher than that received by someone with a similar or more senior post in his or her own country.
One consequence of a common Statute for Members of the European Parliament might, for example, be that one countryâs MEPs received salaries several times higher than those of their own countryâs Head of State or Government.
It is important for Members of the European Parliament not to be regarded as a privileged elite by voters in their own countries, but for salary conditions to be reasonably in keeping with the national salary situation for equivalent positions.
The present system of travel expenses, which does not take account of actual costs and which is based on standard payments, is quite unfair in our view.
Members should only be refunded the actual costs that arise in connection with travel.
The travel expenses system can be reformed without a common Membersâ Statute being adopted.
For the reasons given, the June List has chosen to vote against the motion.
In conclusion, I would point out that, in the statutes, Members of the European Parliament are called just that â Members or ââ.
It seems odd, therefore, that, in certain countries, MEPs refer to themselves as âhonourableâ.
Such expressions are antiquated in a democratic EU.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not keep to the speech that I had prepared and I apologise for that, but the speech made by MrÂ Schmit forces me to hurriedly change the scope of my speech.
I find the expression âthe same job, the same payâ completely outrageous.
I say that as a lawyer, as a legal expert: it is unthinkable that a Member can portray himself as an employee who is given a wage.
The Member has an allowance and therefore a sense of dignity, and if we want to give that back to Parliament, we are the first ones obliged to respect its rules, which are also rules of behaviour, in addition to written, and sometimes disobeyed, rules.
Among those rules, European law has to guarantee equality.
I ask MrÂ Schmit whether there is a principle of equality by which, a five-star hotel room in one of the new Member States costs the equivalent of EURÂ 40, as was our experience two weeksâ ago in Krakow, Poland, whilst it costs the equivalent of EURÂ 500 or EURÂ 700 for a hotel of the same standard in Rome, Paris or any other European capital.
Whilst you can dine out on EURÂ 10 in a restaurant in one of the countries of the East, a restaurant of the same quality in Italy, Germany or France charges EURÂ 70, EURÂ 80 or EURÂ 100.
Today, we are playing a part, fully aware that we are being hypocritical at least.
From a legal point of view, I believe that it is unacceptable, partly because the interpretation that we are going to give â and I am only talking about Articles 9 and 10, MrÂ President â is that the Members are entitled to a fair allowance, enough to give them an independent living.
What constitutes fairness and independence for a Member, however?
Independence with regard to what, if then, in Article 10, the Memberâs dignity is regarded as 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge in the Court of Justice?
I ask that that be not mentioned; the allowance required should still be laid down, but not by linking it to that of a civil servant.
The Memberâs dignity stems from his direct election by the people.
Being elected by an Italian electorate of 15Â million voters, as I was, is not the same as becoming a Member in an ordered list, produced by the parties in another country where a person has no expenses ...
Â Â  Mr President, this is without a doubt an epoch-making moment in the history of this House, for this debate and vote are, strictly speaking, illicit, and the content of this Statute now amounts to a package of privileges that undermines democracy.
I predict that what the overwhelming majority of this Houseâs Members have accomplished today, and will no doubt finalise tomorrow, will go down in history as the final nail in the European Unionâs coffin.
Its end result is that a peopleâs Chamber becomes so detached from reality that many view from a great height the real problems that afflict Europe â be they privileged eating arrangements or something else.
It was six years ago that I came to this House, a convinced supporter of the EU and lead candidate of the same party that provides with our President, who is currently in the chair and enabling this to happen.
I believed that we would be able to escape the trap of globalisation and make the European dream a reality; instead I have had to spend those six years watching the European trap being set â step by step, in a succession of misguided decisions, by one package of privileges after another.
It is tragic.
Nevertheless, I am still persuaded that it is possible to achieve real, serious democracy at European level, albeit not, of course, in such a manner as this.
At the same time, to accuse most of this House of blindness, as happens over and over again, is to insult the blind.
My grandfather was blind, and yet he was very sensitive, having a feel for, and noticing, many things.
The same cannot be said of most of those in this House.
I wish long life to any real, democratic parliament that is close to the people and binds peoples together.
It has to be said that this is not one; it is far more a colony of the privileged.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a few short messages can only be communicated in the space of one minute.
The first message is without doubt one of thanks to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for having in some way helped to put this debate back onto the agenda.
An even more heartfelt message of thanks is offered to this Parliament.
You will allow me to do this, because an objective that I consider to be of great political value, as a demonstration of the progress we are making towards a process of European political integration, is being reached through this acknowledgment of the coherent role of being a Member of the European Parliament.
This Parliament has also accepted a number of compromise assessments that I would prefer were not ignored.
The principle of non-discrimination is invoked, which is sacrosanct.
That is one of the reasons why I will vote with conviction in favour of those ideas: the principle of non-discrimination cannot be sustained, however, even on the assessments of the comparison with members of national parliaments.
Presenting the fact that the salary and allowance regime is different from that of national MPs as a privilege, while disregarding the fact that that was the one single condition preventing a Member of the European Parliament from being considered to carry out a hierarchically subordinate role to that of a member of a national parliament, is not, in my opinion, satisfactory.
The same is true for other items.
I will, however, conclude my speech by making just one point, MrÂ President â if you will allow me â in a second.
We are finally reaching an objective that does justice to so many false debates and so many provocations on the issue of transparency.
We will realise it.
We will realise it when we finally embark on a so-called system of âpayment of expenses actually incurredâ and see the effects on the parliamentary budget.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, let me say very briefly that I believe this statute is a transparent work.
It changes a situation which, while I do not know whether it was privilege-ridden in the way that MrÂ Martin has just said, was certainly unacceptable in principle.
Is it normal, in fact, that one Member of Parliament should earn seven or eight hundred euros while another earns ten to twelve times that amount, if not more?
Is it normal in any administration or in any service that the system for reimbursing expenses should be entirely devoid of transparency?
I therefore believe that the transparency introduced by this statute is understood by the public, because people do not understand how anyone buying a flight ticket can be reimbursed ten times the actual value of the ticket.
That is what people cannot understand.
Consequently, if this situation is changed, that in itself, I believe, is an important step.
For my own part, let me say plainly that I do not want anyone to indulge in demagogy now with this Membersâ Statute.
It is all to the credit of your Parliament that it has adopted this statute or will adopt it tomorrow.
I believe it deserves thanks for that, for the efforts of all concerned.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, one quick observation.
I am satisfied with a debate that has, to all intents and purposes, celebrated the work that we do â which pleases me â and that I believe has given due importance to a significant day for Parliament, if a conclusion is reached.
I have the pleasure of thanking the Presidency of Parliament for the assistance it has provided, and MrÂ Schmit for his commitment to the first part of the Statute, which, with another itinerary and with another procedure, must be approved by the Council, and furthermore for his readiness, even in the final hours between this evening and tomorrow, to find a compromise on recital 12, which, MrÂ President, I continue to believe is important for the legal basis of the Statute itself.
Â Â  On my own behalf and on behalf of this Institution, I too would like to express my gratitude to the Luxembourg Presidency.
This was a hot potato that everybody wanted to pass on to the next person in the hope that they would not have to hold it for too long.
The Luxembourg Presidency has had the courage to face the problem and to dedicate a lot of time, energy and good sense to it, aware that this is a compromise that does not satisfy anybody completely, but which will undoubtedly put an end, I hope, to a long-standing situation which, as the Minister has said, was not acceptable.
In any event, Parliament will express its decision tomorrow through the vote; I would simply like to express the gratitude I owe personally to the Luxembourg Presidency.
The vote will take place tomorrow and the honourable Members will then decide whether they accept or reject the rapporteurâs text.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  One of the Luxembourg Presidencyâs successes was its achievement of agreement on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
It is because the Membersâ Statute makes it possible to do away with many grey areas and inadequate rules and regulations that I see continued opposition to this compromise as making no sense whatever.
European regulations enable the public to get a better insight than do 25 or 27 sets of national rules and any number of compensation arrangements, some permitted and some not.
I am aware that there are unmistakeable defects in even this compromise.
One fundamental problem that remains is the rule on pensions in Article 14; what is needed is that Members pay their own share of contributions to the pension funds.
Although our amendment â No 1 â on this has now been lost, I am convinced that an opening still exists to find a solution at a lower level than that of the Statute and will continue to press the case for a solution of this kind, which must be supplementary to the Statute.
The Membersâ Statute also, at last, paves the way for an Assistantsâ Statute.
The House must now make all possible haste to complete the work on one successfully.
Â Â  âÎ€he next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Â Â MrÂ President, I was astonished to read in a British newspaper that several hundred Nazi war criminals are living in the United Kingdom.
They include 75Â Auschwitz camp guards who escaped justice.
I would remind the House that the Auschwitz-Birkenau death factory was the most horrifying of all the concentration camps.
I am appalled by such reports, particularly since only 700 of the 8Â 000Â camp guards, or less than 10%, were ever put on trial.
Most of these trials were conducted in Poland.
I would call on the Members of this House, on the British Government and on all people of conscience to remember the crimes that were committed, and not to turn their backs on the victims or take the side of the perpetrators of violence.
It is an affront to the dignity of Europeans and entirely reprehensible that murderers from Auschwitz-Birkenau should meet with forbearance and leniency in one of the EUâs Member States.
I would therefore call on the President of Parliament to take action as quickly as possible, and to ensure that the British Government is called to account on this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from my last speech before the House in Strasbourg, I should like to reiterate my views on the transport of live cattle.
Subsidies for live cattle exports are and always will be nothing short of scandalous, particularly since, in the majority of cases, they benefit either agribusiness or distributors and wholesale distributors, and do very little to help small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises.
It is up to us to do something, however, as we too can bring about certain changes in this respect.
I should like to point out that it is often enough to change cost structures in certain sectors to minimise various practices or to put a stop to them altogether.
I would ask the House to take this into account during the debate on the infrastructure pricing directive, as this would be one opportunity for us to take legislative action.
I should like, once again, to ask the Commission and the Council to initiate a reform of this system, on the one hand in order to put an end to the suffering of animals and on the other in order to support small and medium-sized farms.
Â Â  â Unfortunately, there is no interpretation at the moment in the language in which you elected to speak and your speech was not therefore translated.
Â Â  Mr President, as an Irish speaker I welcome the decision to accord the status of official working language of the European Union to the Irish language.
I extend congratulations and heartfelt thanks to all of those involved in the status campaign to achieve the status of official working language of the European Union for the Irish language.
I ask the President of the Parliament to convey to the Council our satisfaction in this matter and would ask also that everything possible be done between now and 1Â January 2007 to meet the needs that arise from this new status, and to ensure that the European Parliament and the other EU institutions will be able to provide the appropriate services in Irish.
Â Â  Â Â Â I wish to protest to the House about the defamation of Poles and of Poland as a whole.
The latter is a country that could serve as a model of multicultural coexistence, in view of the large number of national minorities living alongside the Polish nation.
In the latest report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, Poland is accused of virtual anti-Semitism and discrimination against Roma.
The report condemns national movements and singles out , even though the latter attempts to present an objective and truthful picture of reality.
Anti-Semitism has always been foreign to the Christian outlook of Poles, whereas the German Nazis and the totalitarian Soviet regime inflicted physical and moral harm upon millions of people.
Ever since Poland regained independence, attempts have been made to blame Poles for this harm.
Even the Jewish Diaspora in Poland objects to the reportâs accusations of anti-Semitism.
By way of contrast, the report makes no mention of the anti-Polish sentiments that are frequently expressed, in particular in those media outlets that have been bought out by foreign capital.
We therefore demand that the report be corrected and these insults withdrawn.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, IÂ have another contribution to the previous topic.
The date of 17 June 2005 will be recorded in European history as aÂ failure.
After aÂ clear signal from the European Parliament, when we approved BÃ¶geâs report on the financial perspective by a large majority, we waited anxiously for the result of the summit, hoping for a positive conclusion.
It did not happen.
One-fifth of the EU25 selfishly broke away, and the enlarged Europe received yet another slap in the face.
It happened in spite of the will of the poorer EU10, which were willing to accept a compromise even at the cost of losses for the sake of reaching an agreement.
With the unsuccessful referenda on the Constitutional Treaty and the budget fiasco at the June summit we have, unfortunately, started to build a new European wall between the old and the enlargement parts of the Union.
And the word âcitizenâ has again merely remained on the lips of us, the politicians.
Let us not forget, however, that the Chinese train is crashing into Europe with astronomical speed.
We have slowed down the European one, or even diverted it at no less than three points on the track.
Unless we breathe new life into the Union as soon as possible, we shall have to rename the unfulfilled Lisbon strategy as the âEuropean tragedyâ.
Â Â  Mr President, in the north of the Netherlands province of Limburg, the environmental standards are already being exceeded considerably on account of such things as location and road network density.
This situation is made worse by the addition of the A74 motorway to the existing A73.
The A74 will attract many extra lorries, which are major polluters.
The governmentâs decision to map out the A74 in this area demonstrates that it is not taking the Dutch and European environmental standards seriously.
The volume of fine dust will increase dramatically.
How can we possibly carry on along these lines?
We recently concluded that at this rate, Europe will no longer meet even the Kyoto standards.
This planned A74 is a motorway to hell.
If we want to make it to Kyoto, we will have to make a U-turn.
Â Â  â Î€he next item is the debate on the report by Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (COM(2004)0391 â C6-0080/2004 â 2004/0127(COD)) (A6-0188/2005).
Â Â  MrÂ President, a fortnight or three weeks ago, we celebrated 20 years of the Schengen agreements.
These agreements opened up a new dimension of Europe and put it in a new perspective.
I believe that the regulation we are discussing this evening, which reflects an agreement at the first reading between Parliament and the Council, is a good signal to send 20 years after the conclusion of the Schengen agreements.
We have achieved an objective in this domain, an objective set for us by the Thessaloniki European Council on 19 and 20Â JuneÂ 2004.
In other words, we have achieved this objective in something like record time, because the recasting undertaken in the framework of this regulation is designed, on the one hand, to remove obsolete provisions from the handbook and, on the other hand, to develop and clarify other provisions on the basis of an analysis of the everyday problems encountered on the ground at the external or internal borders of the Union.
The regulation, however, goes further than a mere makeover, because it establishes a veritable Community Code governing the movement of persons across borders, not only relating to the external borders of the Union but also, as I said, with a component on the internal borders, since these two aspects are undeniably complementary.
Moreover, the regulation resolves the problem of the ambiguous legal basis of the handbook by creating a proper legal instrument containing all the basic principles and rules relating to borders.
The internal-border component reiterates the provisions of the Schengen Convention on the abolition of checks on persons at internal borders and on procedures for the temporary reintroduction of such checks in the event of a threat to public safety or to the internal security of a Member State.
This regulation adapts these provisions to the institutional framework of the Community.
As far as the external borders are concerned, the basic principles governing checks at these borders as enshrined in the Schengen Convention and some parts of the common handbook have been more or less reproduced.
The practicalities for the conduct of these checks are laid down in the annexes and are mostly subject, like the core provisions of the regulation, to the codecision procedure.
Work began on the Community Code on 2Â JulyÂ 2004 under the Dutch Presidency and has been vigorously pursued throughout the period of the Luxembourg Presidency.
At the meeting of Coreper on 1Â June, a general agreement was reached on the wording of the Code and then, on 13Â June, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted the compromise amendments.
The Community Code is the first instrument in the field of asylum, immigration, visas and borders to be subject to codecision with Parliament.
For this reason, its adoption at the first reading is extremely important as a means of establishing, on the one hand, a relationship of mutual trust between Parliament and the Council and, on the other hand, a precedent that can only enhance the efficiency of future work on dossiers examined under the codecision procedure.
It also demonstrates that codecision is by no means a hindrance to rapid progress but, on the contrary, serves to hasten progress and promote efficiency and, most importantly, that it takes place in a more strongly democratic context.
The Presidency wishes to thank Parliament, and especially your rapporteur, MrÂ Cashman, for having worked with the Presidency and the Council in a spirit of openness and transparency but also of mutual trust.
This collaboration has served to establish compromises which all three institutions can now endorse.
It is, in fact, thanks to the amendments tabled by Parliament that the Community Border Code guarantees more transparency and greater protection for citizens of the European Union and of non-EU countries.
I believe there has been much talk of crisis today, of a European Union in crisis.
We undoubtedly have considerable difficulties, huge difficulties, but I believe that the act we are discussing this evening in preparation for its adoption at first reading tomorrow shows that the European Union is capable of taking decisions, of making progress in the interests of the people and above all, as I indicated before, of progressing democratically with parliamentary support.
I believe that is the crux of the matter because, in a field that concerns people first and foremost, codecision has finally been given its place, thanks to todayâs application of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Presidency also wishes to thank the Commission for its efforts and for its input, throughout the legislative process, of valuable technical knowledge without which the Code would never have seen the light of day.
I therefore believe that this is a good evening for Europe.
We are poised to adopt an important instrument. On behalf of the Presidency, I thank Parliament and the Commission for their collaboration.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am pleased to be able to state this evening, as Mr Schmit has just said, that we are achieving a genuinely positive example of institutional cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and that we are doing so by means of an instrument, the codecision process, that is having its first truly important application here today on a subject that affects peopleâs everyday lives.
The rapporteur has without doubt carried out some extraordinary work, and the same must be said of the Presidency.
The Luxembourg Presidency rightly sought to make a commitment â and the Commission has always supported that commitment â to being able to put a balanced provision to the vote in Parliament at first reading.
This provision has many merits, and it is difficult to point them out in a very few minutes: the first is the balance achieved between the need to confirm the principle of free movement of persons within the Union and the equally crucial requirement for effective controls at the external borders of the European Union.
The other significant merit is that of having adapted a number of procedures originating in a purely intergovernmental domain to the context of the European Union.
We have taken a step forward.
I am referring to the principle of reintroducing internal border controls for obvious reasons of policing, effectively for reasons of security: it was an extremely sensitive subject, and any false move would have been genuinely counterproductive.
There then follows a positive item for the Commission: the involvement and active participation of the Commission in the process of reintroducing the controls.
That is another sign, which I believe is important, of how the European Commission can offer a constant and â I am certain of this and I will obviously strive for this â constructive contribution to ensuring the optimum application of that regulation.
I will conclude by saying, MrÂ President, that those signs are the signs that the European citizens are waiting for.
They are signs of faith in a Europe, in a European Union, which is alive, which can continue to make progress and to obtain tangible results.
Security and freedom are two pillars of the European Union, and there is a good balance in this provision: I would say it is an exemplary case to point out.
Â Â  . Mr President, it has been a real privilege to work on this dossier, primarily because when we began people told us we would not complete it under the Austrian presidency, let alone under the Luxembourg presidency.
The importance of this has been underlined by the previous speakers.
It is the first time that the Parliament has acted in codecision in the area of asylum, immigration and border control.
It is extremely important that the Parliament dealt with this dossier in a mature, reasonable and practicable way.
Wish lists are for the past.
Of course we have not achieved everything that we in Parliament wanted; as we know that is the nature of compromise.
That is not to say that compromise is a bad word, it is a brilliant word.
Compromise is the whole notion on which the European project was built in the early 1950s and in 1957.
I am proud that today we are legislating.
In this House, and indeed in our other institutions, we talk too much and do not deliver enough.
Tonight we are legislating and bringing forward changes that will have a real effect on real lives.
As was mentioned earlier, each of us, especially as politicians, can talk a defining moment into a crisis.
But what do we achieve in doing this?
We actually reinforce the argument from eurosceptics and the europhobes that this House means nothing and achieves nothing.
We have difficulties, but out of difficulties comes a rebirth, a renaissance.
Without a renaissance there is nothing for the future.
So, codecision does not have to be slow, but it has to be thorough and it has to be built on absolute mutual respect for each of the parties involved in the negotiations.
Why have we have achieved so much?
Because we have done it on the basis that only by acting together can we achieve more than we could ever achieve by acting alone.
I have to thank my fellow rapporteurs.
There have been no shadows in this report; we have been equal rapporteurs, equal participants and without them we could not have presented this document today.
I would like to thank Mr Battilocchio for the opinion he gave on behalf of the Committee on Development.
More importantly, I would like to thank those people who sit behind us â sometimes seen, sometimes unseen: our assistants and our advisers, without whom we could not do this work.
Those people are so rarely thanked.
So let me say once again, we have achieved a great deal.
We have reinforced the role of the Parliament, especially in the re-introduction of internal borders.
We have reinforced the role of the Commission, but again I wish we could have done more in relation to spot checks on the application of the Schengen , which was not possible.
I wanted us to have a right of appeal or for the European Court of Justice to have jurisdiction.
We did not achieve this, but we achieved a great deal more.
On non-discrimination akin to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, for example, there is the right of people undergoing second line checks to have those checks conducted with dignity and, if necessary, in a non-public area.
On refusal of entry, there will be clearer explanations of the justification of that refusal and the right of appeal once the appellant has returned to their country of origin.
And where appeals are successful, the necessary compensation will be provided according to national law and corrections.
We have reinforced and upheld the principle of freedom of movement for EU citizens and others with a right to reside which, in a Eurobarometer poll, was seen as the single biggest benefit of being in the European Union.
As an inclusion to the main body of text, the annexes are extremely important when we come to adopt and review this regulation in future.
Regular reports on the implementation of the regulation are to be compiled by the Commission.
Also, very importantly, there is the declaration by the Council and the Parliament on the issue of stateless citizens which states that âthe European Parliament and the Council request the Commission to bring forward proposals, in the framework of the revision of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 539/2001, in order to exempt holders of aliensâ and non-citizensâ passports residing in a Member State from the visa obligationâ.
I am proud of what we have done, I am proud of the collaboration and I now wait to hear from my co-rapporteurs.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity of draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development, I should first like to congratulate MrÂ Cashman on the fine work he has carried out and on his excellent proposal.
His report supplements and includes a large number of the observations that I had set out in my opinion on this important topic drafted on behalf of the Committee on Development.
I should also like to highlight the political value of the fact, which in my opinion is very positive, that for the first time the Members of the European Parliament can follow the codecision process in this domain.
Among the numerous opportunities that would be lost if the process of ratifying the European Constitution foundered, following the ânoâ votes in France and the Netherlands, would also be that of embarking for the first time upon a policy on immigration shared by all of the Member States.
On this issue, the European Parliament has over and again established the need to balance the interests of the European citizens, immigrants, the Member States and developing countries.
The equation is not easy, but an effort is required in order to achieve a balance between the need for security for our countries, which has to be upheld and safeguarded, and a policy of openness towards those who lawfully venture within our borders in search of improved living conditions.
It should in fact be remembered that, as the European Union, we also have humanitarian duties.
It is therefore right to implement the necessary controls at border crossings in order to regulate the influx of those seeking visas and asylum, but we cannot, however, avoid adopting a global approach of solidarity and respect for human rights, particularly in humanitarian crisis situations, such as in the recent cases of the tsunami and of Darfur.
The citizens of third countries have to be thoroughly informed about the immigration rules and about the control methods; the criteria for refusing access have to be objective and verifiable, with a view to preventing the unpleasant, and, alas, frequent episodes of discrimination, which to date still occur. Strict controls based on a clear set of rules and respect for the rights of the individual: Community action in this delicate area must be based on this inseparable pairing.
It will not be easy, but it is a challenge that todayâs Europe has to accept and overcome.
Â Â  . Mr President, my speech this evening is rather incidental, because it relates to the study of the legal basis for the proposed Regulation.
The rapporteur, at one point, believed that a modification should be proposed, specifically the derogation of Article 22 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and presented Amendments 85 and 70.
In accordance with Article 22 of the Convention, foreigners should declare their entry to the competent authorities, either on entry or within three working days of entry, and the Member States should establish the conditions and exceptions in the field.
The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs raised the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs and, having studied it, the latter came to the conclusion that that proposed amendment would make it necessary to review the legal basis and that Article 62(1) and Article 62(2) would not be sufficient, but that Article 62(3) of the Treaty would also be necessary, since Article 62(3) of the Treaty refers to the conditions in which third-country nationals can travel freely in the territory of the Member States for a period of no longer than three months.
That was the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The rapporteur subsequently reached an agreement with the Committee in this regard and did not consider it necessary to continue with his amendment, and it is not therefore now necessary to change the legal basis.
In any event, perhaps the only value of this work is that we know that, in the case of the reference to the Schengen Agreements, not only will the reference to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 62 be necessary, but also the reference to paragraph 3.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal that we are discussing intends to establish a Community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders.
It falls within the context of the Treaty of Amsterdam, thanks to which the Schengen has been incorporated within the European framework.
This is the first real opportunity for this Parliament to deal with the issue in its entirety, keeping in mind the fact that the proposal has been transferred from the consultation process to the codecision process as a result of the decision made by the Council of the Hague.
This complex and substantial proposal has two main objectives: firstly, to consolidate the rules in force on the crossing of external borders, as laid down in the Schengen framework; secondly, to further develop the subject, particularly with regard to the crossing of internal borders.
The proposal is broken down into four titles: the first contains general provisions; the second regulates the crossing of external borders and conditions for entry in the Schengen area; the third deals with internal borders, reaffirming the abolition of all border controls and stipulating the cases and the procedures in which such controls can be reintroduced; and the fourth contains the final provisions.
A large proportion of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur aim at clarifying a number of the elements of the Commission proposal only in terms of the language used.
Such changes are designed to improve the quality of the text, and, simultaneously, to clarify and simplify the articles.
All of that will be highly beneficial when the code on the crossing of borders definitively enters into force and becomes an item of everyday reference for the border guards and the authorities.
The rapporteur has worked commendably, in close cooperation with all of the shadow rapporteurs and political groups, in addition to checking first-hand how the borders are crossed today.
Thanks to this ongoing dialogue, the rapporteur has fulfilled all of the requests submitted to him.
He has, moreover, taken part in lengthy negotiations with the Council, with the Luxembourg Presidency, and it is therefore desirable that the report is put to the vote during the current presidency.
The compromise that has been reached with the various political groups, with the agreement of the Council and the Commission, has been put to the vote and unanimously approved by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I personally made sure before the vote in committee that Vice-President Frattiniâs office was also in favour of the report, and I also received confirmation of this from the very positive outlook on each individual amendment tabled.
Precisely as a result of this general consensus, which was reached by means of a complex series of bilateral and multilateral compromises, the report should not be subjected to changes at the present time, and it is therefore desirable that it is adopted in full.
Having followed its development and having thoroughly established that no problem exists, I personally, as shadow rapporteur, propose that, through our vote, we give our full support to the rapporteur, whom I wholeheartedly thank for the valuable work he has carried out.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner Frattini, I wish to begin by thanking MrÂ Cashman and others for a very constructive report.
Because asylum, refugee policy and immigration are issues to which we in the committee devote a lot of time, it was necessary initially to obtain clear rules on the Community Code and the movement of persons across borders.
The fact that we can now revise controls and jointly strengthen the external borders means that the EUâs borders become more secure.
Criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers who import women and children for the purposes of prostitution will have fewer opportunities to move freely across borders, while other people, despite their foreign appearance, can now feel welcome.
When, tomorrow, we vote in favour of the report, we shall be able to get to grips with one of the committeesâ major tasks: asylum and immigration policy.
We have so many shared questions about how we in the EU are to safeguard the values referred to.
We want of course to see a more open EU, but that requires common solutions and respect for countries, as well as respect between countries and between people and groups.
That is the first step.
Thank you again for a very constructive report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is not mere courtesy that compels me to begin by offering my congratulations to the two architects of the achievement â and I use the term advisedly â that has paved the way for the agreement presented to us today on the basis, I must add, of an excellent proposal from the Commission.
My thanks go to those who are seated behind MrÂ Frattini today.
I wish to thank MrÂ Cashman, who, in the face of widespread scepticism, in which I initially shared, sought to reach agreement with the Council at first reading.
Congratulations, Michael!
But I also wish to extend my congratulations to the Luxembourg Presidency for showing the necessary drive and tenacity to stay on course while encouraging the essential compromises.
It is indeed a marvellous Little Big Land, this Grand Duchy of Luxembourg!
For my part, I had three particular concerns about this dossier.
The first was that, while guaranteeing the rights of the beneficiaries of freedom of movement under Community law, the instrument must also keep open the option of conducting the checks required for the identification at external borders of persons registered for refusal of admission and wanted persons.
The agreement reached on this point, which is reflected in the wording of Article 6(2), corresponds very precisely to the spirit of the amendment I had tabled myself but is an improvement on my proposal, and I am delighted with that.
It seemed to me â and this was my second concern â that, in cases where nationals of non-EU countries were refused entry to the territory of the Union, their rights ought to be clearly defined and made known to the parties concerned, but at the same time security requirements had to be rigorous.
The people of Europe do not want their external borders to be controlled by thugs, but neither do they want to have them controlled by blinded and limbless eunuchs.
The provision that is set out today in ArticleÂ 11(13) is a good provision, and I am delighted about that â just as I am delighted, MrÂ President, by the confirmation of the exceptional nature of the reintroduction of checks at external borders and by the more prominent role assigned to the Commission and Parliament.
In view of these three grounds for satisfaction, it will give me pleasure to vote in favour of this report, and the entire Group will do likewise.
Â Â  . Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for my group, I should like to extend sincere thanks to the rapporteur, MrÂ Cashman, to all of my counterparts from the other groups and, of course, to the Luxembourg presidency for the work we have done together.
The various groups within this House have amply demonstrated their ability to cooperate jointly and effectively, both among themselves and with the Council.
Let me give an example of the sort of case that could occur, the sort of case with which we were faced when we began work on this dossier.
A citizen of a third country wishing to enter the EU, and holding a visa to do so, could be refused entry if he was unable to produce all the required documents at a border crossing point.
This would have resulted in a stamp being placed in his passport showing that he had been refused entry to the EU.
It is hardly likely that the person in question would then have been able to travel to the USA, Canada or Australia with a stamp of this kind in his passport.
The point I should particularly like to emphasise is therefore that we have succeeded in enshrining the right to appeal in the regulation, following lengthy negotiations.
The most important consequence of this is that all stamps indicating refusal of entry into the EU will be corrected in cases where entry has been refused for no good reason.
We have also achieved other, equally significant improvements for thirdâcountry nationals.
Human dignity must be respected during border controls, and discrimination on any grounds is prohibited.
In a nutshell, our joint efforts have resulted in a solution which means that checks on those crossing the EUâs external borders will become a great deal more welcoming.
Â Â  Mr President, as the final Member speaking in this debate can I emphasise that I was not a shadow, but I have learned a great deal from the way Mr Cashman has achieved agreement on the most difficult of subjects, dealing with sensitive issues like the reintroduction of border checks, creating a balance between security post-9/11 and all the benefits of Schengen free movement and respecting the dignity of people, particularly from third countries, who want to enter the Union.
Doing all of that within a codecision procedure is a great achievement and we have learned a lot from the way that cooperation has taken place.
It is also a great success because Members like me have observed that reaching a compromise between security at border control on the one hand, and fairness on the other, is very difficult.
Therefore I commend in this report â the first time in a codecision report since the Article 13 directives went through this Parliament â the fact that we have an explicit reference to anti-discrimination and to the dignity of people while carrying out border checks.
There is a huge hidden minority of people that are harassed and victimised at borders.
Mr Cashman has understood this, he has put it explicitly in his report and he has created the balance that we all wanted to see.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the report by Bogdan Klich, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Security Research (2004/2171(INI)) (A6-0103/2005).
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, it has been a pleasure to draft this report for two reasons.
The first of these is the excellent cooperation on the part of both the committees that have delivered opinions, namely the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and on the part of the vast majority of political groups, in particular the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
The second reason is that the Commission has made an extremely valuable contribution on points of substance.
The European Security Strategy states that there are currently a great many new threats and challenges to our security, the most significant of which include the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of international terrorism.
It is a fact of life that the kind of terrorism to which Europe grew accustomed in the 1960s and 1970s has been replaced by a new kind of terrorism that affects many more people and is far more deadly and dangerous.
What this means is that the objectives of maintaining public security and making our security and defence policy credible are hard to achieve nowadays without high-tech tools.
The European Union currently invests four times less in the defence sector and five times less in research and development than the United States.
The result of this is that EU Member States are not in a position to close the technology gap that exists between the United States and Europe in terms of defence potential and security.
Accordingly, in response to this need for more effective security research, the Commission has proposed a European Security Research Programme, due to be launched in two yearsâ time under the umbrella of the Seventh Framework Programme.
The European Security Research Programme will be based on a coherent, flexible and coordinated approach, and will focus on research projects that enhance our technological capabilities.
The approach currently taken to security research at the highest EU level lacks coherence.
This leads to extensive fragmentation and weak cooperation between Member States, and also makes such research less cost-effective.
The establishment of a European Security Research Programme will therefore facilitate both interoperability and cost optimisation by putting in place common frameworks and structures at European level.
The Programme provides for the exploitation of synergies between defence and civil research, so it can be expected to boost the integration of these two sectors.
What is more, Parliamentâs adoption of the Programme, the proposed annual budget for which is EURÂ 1Â billion in addition to any research funding already earmarked for this sector by the individual Member States, should serve to narrow the gap that currently exists between the EU Member States and the United States.
Strengthening our research base and finding more innovative solutions is bound to enhance Europeâs competitiveness.
It is anticipated that this Programme will be an excellent opportunity for European industry, and also for our research centres.
I have in mind all such centres, academic, non-academic, civil and defence ones.
The Programme will undoubtedly improve external border protection and make it possible to modernise the armed forces of the EU Member States.
The report refers to several priority areas of interest, of which I shall only mention a few.
They include the fields of C4ISR systems, or in other words command, control, communications, computing, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and also research in the field of biotechnology and space and IT technology.
The report also encourages the Commission to support research in the field of social sciences, without which appropriate planning of research into modern technologies is inconceivable.
I have to say, and it gives me great satisfaction to do so, that this would appear to be the key contribution made by Parliament to the Commissionâs proposal, namely that any discussion of advanced technological research must first focus on support for such research.
Given that defence-related issues are at the top of the political agenda, there is every likelihood that this Programme will enable us to increase security and make it easier to achieve the EUâs objectives.
MrÂ President, I would therefore strongly recommend that the House vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss security research with the House today, and I should like to express my thanks for the recommendations and suggestions you have made to the Commission.
Security is an essential component of a number of different EU policy areas, including the common foreign and security policy and the area of freedom, security and justice.
At the same time, however, security is also a basic requirement for prosperity and growth and, as such, indispensable for achieving the economic policy goals of the Lisbon Agenda.
We need the best tools available if we are to be able to meet challenges to public safety, and we also need a strong knowledge and technology base.
Research at both national and European level is required to create such a base, and it was for this reason that the Group of Personalities made the following recommendation to the Commission one year ago; âtechnology alone cannot guarantee security, but security without technology is impossibleâ.
Security managers, industry and the public are among those who benefit from security research, and, in order to meet their high expectations, consistency must be achieved between its various facets.
Firstly, this research must actively help to create a social and business environment which is conducive to positive economic development and which lays the groundwork for prosperity, as this will ensure that it acts as a driving force for growth and employment in Europe.
It must also enhance the competitiveness of the European security industry, and in fact the European Security Research Programme will help create and extend a European market for security products.
A further aim of the Programme will be to focus on civil security matters.
Although research of this kind falls within the remit of the European Defence Agency, those working in the field of civil security research maintain close contacts with the latter in order to address the dual-use aspects of security technologies.
Finally, there is no escaping the fact that security research is a particularly sensitive sector with very specific requirements, which include intellectual property rights, the spread of information, cooperation with third parties â including those outside the EU â and the level of Community contributions.
Security research is one half of the two-fold thematic priority âSecurity and Spaceâ, which falls within the specific programme âCooperationâ under the Seventh Research Programme.
Current proposals provide for an annual budget of around EURÂ 500Â million.
The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliamentâs report calls for an annual budget of EURÂ 1Â billion, as proposed by the Group of Personalities.
Security research under the Seventh Framework Programme will focus on the following areas; protection against terrorism and crime, security of infrastructures and utilities, border protection and restoring security in case of crisis.
These four topics will be supported by a number of horizontal areas, namely systems integration and interoperability, security and society and coordinating and structuring research.
The European Security Research Advisory Board will play a leading role in helping to develop a longer-term vision, as it will act as a forum where users and the Commission discuss the structure of the Research Programme.
As proposed in the report on security research, and in order to ensure that Parliament is properly represented, Vice-President Verheugen has invited five committees to appoint representatives to act as observers on the European Security Research Advisory Board.
Parliament has always backed the current Preparatory Action for Security Research, and this backing has been much appreciated.
It is for this reason that we welcome the report upon which this House will vote, and which was drafted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs together with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I should also like to thank Parliament for giving its consent to security research in general during the debate on the Seventh Framework Programme, and in particular with regard to funding for the Preparatory Actions.
The Commission will be happy to continue submitting reports on the implementation of the Preparatory Action until such a time as implementation of the European Security Research Programme becomes possible under the umbrella of the Seventh Research Framework Programme.
Security research will focus on activities that provide a distinct European added value compared to national measures.
This will allow us to take action at Community level that enhances the competitiveness of the security industry, allows us to progress towards the Lisbon goals and helps our society as a whole to feel and be safer.
I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for his work.
Â Â  . Mr President, as representative of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate Mr Klich on his wonderful report.
Our contribution fundamentally consists of setting objectives optimising resources, clarifying responsibilities, classifying security research as of public interest â a fundamental and extremely important issue â providing great impetus, by means of research, for interoperability, which is so necessary in crisis situations, not so much in terms of prevention but in terms of response to and resolution of those crises, and advocating the need for adequate funding, linking security research entirely to gross domestic product, hence taking account of the economic weight of States and not allowing research in this field to be subject to considerable fluctuations in available budget.
Finally, Mr President, I believe that we will have a European programme for security research within the seventh framework programme and a plural, technical and political advisory committee.
By means of these research formulae, we are going to improve one of our greatest weaknesses, the so-called C4ISR â control, intelligence and monitoring systems â and it can only be corrected by means of the correct application of European research policies, without any links to or dependency on third parties.
It is essential to increase the efficiency of progress with the sensor system, biotechnology, space and communication technologies.
I would therefore like once again, Mr President, to congratulate Mr Klich on having dealt with this report of such essential importance.
Â Â  . We live in a time that demands rapid response to global changes and security threats.
When we attempt to formulate and define a policy of common security research, this does not involve irrational fears or ideology, but a very rational policy that will enable a higher degree of security for European citizens.
The dangers and threats demand that the problem is dealt with on a European level.
And security research, as set out, represents a tool for increasing European competitiveness and achieving the Lisbon objectives.
Indeed it represents an area that signifies major research, innovation and technological potential for the European Union.
In this light I would like to express great concern at the potentially fatal consequences that might be suffered by the area of security research if there is no suitable agreement on the financial perspective.
If the Council does not follow the guidelines of Parliament and the original proposal from the Commission, there is a serious fear of the termination of new programmes that are now still included in the seventh framework programme.
These new programmes include security research.
It must be stated clearly that without adequate financial support, we cannot expect good results.
The Kok report has already set out the clear finding that responsibility for achieving the Lisbon objectives lies first and foremost with the Member States, both in decision-making at home and in decision-making on the European level.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to give their determined support in the negotiations on the financial perspective to mechanisms that will enable the achieving of the Lisbon strategy, and thereby security research.
This is indeed important for each individual Member State, and in view of the numerous synergy effects, also for the European integration processes.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the proposal by the European Commission to create a European Security Research Programme is an initiative which moves in the right direction.
Both the European Council, with the European security strategy adopted in December 2003, and the European Parliament, in its resolution in April 2005, have highlighted the need to combat international dangers and challenges by reinforcing European defence and security policy and the common foreign policy and defence and security policy.
However, the problem is not only institutional and political.
It is, at the same time, operational.
It is a question of the effective application of the decisions taken at the level of the European institutions.
Consequently, it is also linked to the ability of the European Union to proceed more quickly in the sectors of research, technology and innovation for European security.
Our objective must not be blind competition with the United States.
However, it is true that, when investment by the United States is compared with investment by the European Union in internal security and even in the arms industry and defence equipment, the European Union and the Member States are, unfortunately, much worse off.
The European Union must move forward, because it has every interest in avoiding dependence and, at the same time, securing its interests, the interests of the Member States and the security and protection of European citizens.
It is also in its interest for the European Union to strengthen research programmes and policies and to contribute to economic development, to the strengthening of competitiveness and to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
The proposal to integrate this programme into the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union is particularly important, as is the proposal to give it an annual budget of EUR one billion.
The European Security Research Programme must not be one-sidedly orientated towards technology research.
Balanced development of research is needed which will also cover the fields of political, social and human sciences.
If they are to be combated effectively, the problems of international terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration need a broader approach, not for research to be encaged in a militaristic or police-state philosophy.
One of the main goals of the Programme is the protection of outside borders and basic infrastructures.
These are important goals which relate to the security of the European Union, because they strengthen the visibility of the Programme to European citizens.
Finally, I believe that we need to ensure, as the European Union, that security research does not undermine our collective principles and values about the protection of human rights and political and democratic freedoms.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klich, and to say that our group will be voting in favour of his report tomorrow.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it has almost become routine in this Chamber for us to have a legislative framework against terrorism in every plenary session.
Every measure we take against terrorism, which we cannot be sure will be effective against it, is by definition harmful to democracy and human rights.
In order to deal with terrorists, we have made our life difficult and, at the same time, we demean the life of citizens: body searches, microphones, cameras; none of this promotes democracy.
Despite its pretty words, this report also moves in the same direction.
Terrorism started to show its teeth thirty years ago.
Then we said that the Stasi, the KGB and Gaddafi were behind it.
Remember the aeroplane hijacks.
Now there is no Stasi, there is no Gaddafi, there is no KGB.
How does terrorism develop?
Who feeds it?
Another issue which it raises is why terrorists hit certain specific countries.
Perhaps they hit the big countries?
Then why do they not hit China, Brazil or Canada?
Why did the last generation of terrorists choose to pick on Spain out of all the European countries?
My country organised Olympic Games, squandered billions of euros of taxpayers' money and yet the terrorists did not hit us, which they could very well have done.
We need therefore to learn a lesson: violence begets violence.
In order to stop terrorism, we invaded two countries: Afghanistan and Iran.
As a result, opium went up in Afghanistan, the opium which is killing our children, including many in Greece, while in Iran oil went up from USD 20 to 60 a barrel.
We have new reports against terrorism and yet no report puts Mr Bush, who brought us to this point, in his place.
Mr Blair, Mr Bush's field marshal, will be here tomorrow.
So let us tell him that he owes us much more than he gives us, because the price of oil has risen from USD 20 to 60 a barrel, with the result that people are unable to pay and we are in this difficult position.
Yes, money against terrorism but, above all of course, a policy for the people of Europe.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  . â Î€he next item is the debate on the report by Catherine Trautmann, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the information society (2004/2204(INI)) (A6-0172/2005).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, my report deals with the World Summit on the Information Society, a process initiated by the United Nations.
The first phase took place in Geneva in 2003 and concluded with the adoption of a declaration of principles and a plan of action.
The second phase, which will take place in Tunis this November, will focus on the implementation of the plan and on two unresolved issues, namely financing the plan of action and governance of the Internet.
The European Union has engaged in this process with a coordinated position and considerable authority, because it can speak with one voice.
If my fellow Members adopt this resolution, our Parliament will underpin the position of the Union and signal its commitment to the success of the process.
Information and communication technology, ICT, plays an integral part in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals, which are all about the elimination of poverty.
The war on poverty focuses on material necessities but it also involves access to online services, whether these be educational, health-related, administrative or commercial.
The rise of the Internet and of mobile telephony has created new potential for development, competitiveness and growth.
Europe suffers from four dimensions of the digital divide: geographical, social, economic and cultural.
This divide is even deeper in the least-developed countries, or LDCs, which have neither an adequate infrastructure nor the means to provide mass access to these forms of technology.
The first issue to emphasise is the contribution of ICT to democracy.
It is an essential means of reducing inequality and promoting human dignity as well as of guaranteeing freedom of expression and information, pluralism of opinion and popular involvement in decision-making processes.
It is imperative that these human rights be respected in the information society.
The concern of the World Summit to ensure that a better regulatory framework, an appropriate system of governance, is created to avert the risks and aberrations that might jeopardise the security and integrity of individuals, organisations and even governments, cannot justify failure to respect these rights.
Cultural and linguistic diversity should be one of the driving forces of the progress initiated by the World Summit.
Such diversity is easier to achieve in a democratic context, and our Parliament has a duty to point this out to Tunisia, which will be hosting the summit.
The second issue is the need for a new form of partnership with the countries of the South.
These countries require confidence and the prospect of long-term stability before they can act.
Cancelling the debt of the poorest countries is a good thing as long as it does not reduce their access to funding.
Merely substituting donations for access to lending facilities would be ineffective.
The European Union did not want a new fund to be created at the United Nations for the purpose of encouraging cooperative ventures, since it would entail the mobilisation of the existing funds allocated to our own development programmes, to the framework programme for research and development and to the Competitiveness and Innovation programme.
In the same vein, I have suggested that unused development appropriations be allocated to the plan of action.
The creation of the Digital Solidarity Fund on a voluntary basis is to be welcomed, but the Fund remains a complementary instrument.
The Union should give preference to multipartite initiatives involving national governments, the private sector, local and/or regional authorities and NGOs.
People using ICT should be involved as users and players, thereby helping to ensure that ICT-based services promote the quality of life, the development of entrepreneurial activity and the production of content with due respect for local cultures and local know-how.
Multipartite ventures are an indicator of confidence and mobilisation.
Before our representatives leave for Tunis, incidentally, our Parliament will meet interested parties from civil society in order to establish a durable working relationship.
In conclusion, let me say that the key aim is the promotion of fair and sustainable development.
This is the essence of our vision of an inclusive information society.
It is for this reason that I should like the timetables for the Lisbon and i2010 strategies to be linked to the plan of action and the involvement of the European Union to be considered in terms of shared development and shared responsibility.
Our partners, like ourselves, should be assured of a voice in the system of governance and of the preservation of their sovereign decision-making powers.
Whether in the field of health care, prevention, environmental risks, waste management or conservation of resources, we are interdependent.
European growth is inconceivable without solidarity.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this report on the information society, dealing with the UN World Summit in Tunis in November, is a useful and timely initiative.
It confirms the interest you have already shown in this summit, both through the participation of several Members of Parliament in the Geneva session in DecemberÂ 2003 and through your regular debates on the information society.
The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the summit and is also devoting considerable efforts to it in close liaison with the Member States.
This is no coincidence, for the vision of the information society adopted by the international community in the UN framework is in line with European thinking, which extends beyond the technological dimension to encompass the impact of the relevant technology on society and social welfare.
I should therefore like to emphasise our concordance of views with the analysis presented by MrsÂ Trautmann and to tell you how much the Commission appreciates the work that has been done on its behalf.
Indeed, the report clearly identifies the main issues of the summit, namely the development dimension and the importance of the social component of the digital divide, the role of technology in improving essential public services, in increasing popular participation in decision-making processes and, ultimately, in developing participatory democracy.
The same applies to the subjects on the agenda, such as governance of the Internet, financing, partnerships and the follow-up to the summit.
In addition, your report rightly stresses the significance of a consistent approach on the part of the Community.
It also underlines the importance of participation by civil society and mobilisation of the private sector.
For the future, it supports the Commissionâs proposals in general and proposes a follow-up focusing on targeted initiatives in the various areas of Community competence.
In this context, I should like to inform you that, on 2Â June of this year, the Commission adopted a communication which lays the foundations of the European position for the summit, a position that the Council should set out in the form of conclusions in Luxembourg this coming Monday.
What we expect from Tunis may be summed up as follows: confirmation of the Geneva declaration on an inclusive information society respecting human rights, freedom of expression and cultural and linguistic diversity; a summit focused on action and devoting its attention to a limited number of priorities; an agreement on financing which will result in higher priority being attached to information and communication technology within the existing mechanisms and which incorporates the Digital Solidarity Fund created in Geneva.
The Internet has become an essential resource for all countries; for this reason, we should be committed to a more international form of governance of the Internet, the practicalities of which must be compatible with the responsibility of governments to their citizens.
A new model of cooperation is needed in order to translate into practice the provisions of the declaration of principles adopted at the Geneva summit relating to the crucial role of all parties involved in this governance.
As far as the follow-up to the summit is concerned, our wish is for a simple, effective, decentralised solution that makes use of existing organisations and their coordination mechanisms.
Lastly, I should like to say to the rapporteur and her collaborators that I share their concern about the human-rights situation in Tunisia.
The situation is far from satisfactory in many areas, particularly as regards freedom of expression and association.
For my part, I have taken every available opportunity to express the view that the host country of a summit must be irreproachable in its adherence to the principles approved at preceding summits.
I also attach great importance to the full participation of NGOs at the Tunis summit, and I should like to say to MrsÂ Trautmann that I shall, if at all possible, attend the hearing she is organising to consult the European NGOs prior to the summit.
In conclusion, I wish to congratulate your Assembly on this report and to assure you that the Commission will heed your recommendations and follow them up.
Let me also express my conviction that the message you are delivering will strengthen the position of the European Union in the global arena.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the report on the information society by Mrs Trautmann and congratulate her on the excellent work she has done.
With a view to the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, that will take place in Tunisia in November, and also in view of the Millennium Objectives of the United Nations and the Lisbon Strategy, the rapporteur has included all the considerations relating to information and communication technologies and the information society, from an economic point of view and also from technological, social and cultural points of view.
In the field that concerns me in particular, the cultural field, the report has incorporated the suggestions of this Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education: it states that the information society must be open to everybody and education, training and digital literacy are priority fields in terms of creating an inclusive information society which helps to overcome digital fragmentation and guarantees access to basic technologies under equal conditions, and also helps the citizens to participate in political decision-making, with a view to strengthening democracy, though always moving in the direction laid down in the Lisbon Strategy.
It also indicates that, as well as presenting risks, the information society also offers an opportunity to promote intercultural dialogue and to guarantee freedom of expression and information, cultural diversity and multilingualism.
Ladies and gentlemen, in this respect, our reflection is complete.
It is now time to turn these priorities into real actions, and in order to do so we also need a good budget.
It is pointless to carry on working and talking about priorities unless we have a budget to back them up.
Genuine political will is expressed through commitments and, as the Commission also indicated in its Communication on âi2010 â A European Information Society for growth and employmentâ, the information society is a key factor which must also be considered, given its significant impact on economic growth, employment and social cohesion.
It is therefore urgent that we organise a debate at European level, together with the governments of the Member States, and consider how we are going to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in a Europe of 25 with a budget of just 1% of Community revenue.
Unless we leave aside exclusively State interests, leave aside the focus on the âmeâ and think of âusâ, in Europe, our political will will be called seriously into question, if it has not already.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sets great store by this Houseâs active involvement in the second world summit on the information society.
After Geneva, we have now reached a second phase.
We therefore greatly appreciate Mrs Trautmannâs own-initiative report and also her way of going about things.
Although she managed to organise the dialogue between the groups in a very fruitful and sound manner, she also knows that we have some critical comments to make about the presentation of the report.
The title of the report âOn the information societyâ is very ambitious and broad indeed, but what is it about?
It is about Parliament expressing an opinion and making its contribution to the conference of 16 to 18 November 2005.
That is why we suggested she should choose less ambitious and more direct wording along the lines of âThe world summit on the information society, second phaseâ.
This would also be more in keeping with Mrs Redingâs communication.
As I said, our group greatly appreciates this discussion and active participation.
Access to the Internet, special attention to ICT and education all over the world, on-line government and truly participatory democracy are crucial.
High-level ICT is not only central to our Lisbon agenda but also, and specifically, to its implications for the developing countries.
A combination of education and development of networks and corresponding services is of major importance for developing countries. We would do well to consider what support the EU can offer in this context.
I would now like to turn to the instruments that we discussed.
The PPE-DE Group advocates a framework of independent regulatory authorities guaranteeing access, freedom of expression and information, cultural diversity and multilingualism.
We are therefore opposed to even more rules and regulations, and we support the existing current basis for on-line government.
Having also debated the free and public search programmes, we will not be backing the amendments that have been tabled concerning them.
Last week, as we just heard, Mrs Reding unfolded her plans for 2010.
She places ICT in the context of the development of economic growth and job creation, and this something that we welcome.
This is where economic growth and a social model fit together very well.
In 2010, the emphasis is on a competitive and open internal market, on increasing EU investments, information and communication technology and on promoting a universally accessible information society in order to narrow the gap between the haves and have-nots.
This is what ties in with EU policy, for the gap is still enormous.
We in the PPE-DE Group are very keen that there should be projects at global level to flesh out, and it goes without saying that this means that a financial basis is urgently needed.
It can hardly be said that the past weeks have increased confidence in this area.
That will be the subject of a follow-up debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Trautmann for her excellent report which, to a large extent, has incorporated our concerns by means of amendments.
At the same time, I would like to express our profound concern about the human rights situation in the host country, which we believe to be very critical.
I would like the Commission to take action in this regard in order to ensure the participation of civil society in the coming Summit.
Furthermore, I would like to express my perplexity at the possible and imminent extension of software patents, which could represent a very considerable obstacle to access to the Internet, access to information, above all in the countries of the South.
We find it unacceptable that, in the countries of the South, a few large multinational companies create a dependency in the field of the Internet from the outset.
Instead, we believe that the European Unionâs support and financial aid should be aimed at promoting free and open software in those countries, which require interoperative systems, as indicated in Mrs Trautmann's excellent report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank MrsÂ Trautmann for her excellent report, which addresses, , the topic of eliminating the digital divide.
It is an issue of balanced development, but above all of social equality.
With this in mind, information technology is a fundamental element for constructing a more culturally-rich and more unified society.
The information society has to be accessible to all: an element of democracy that takes account of cultural diversities and that promotes the participation of the citizens, who are involved parties and not only consumers.
The role of public investment is fundamental in order to safeguard the accessible character of information technology, for instance, in ensuring the development of free software and its adoption within public administration.
There is, moreover, the issue of governance, which Europe has to address in order to establish a control mechanism at international level.
The mandate of the ICANN is about to expire.
It is a matter of ensuring the representativeness and the legitimacy of the new organisation managing the Internet, by establishing governance with various players: governments, NGOs, private sector, and civil society, each with its own role and clear obligations.
In drafting the proposal, the fact that knowledge, as an instrument of development and of freedom, is a common asset should be reaffirmed.
Worrying signs are, however, emerging from the Council, which are at odds with this.
By means of the directive on the patenting of software, the right to free movement of knowledge is attacked, challenging the objective of the information society becoming accessible to all and thus undermining the very foundations of the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for giving me this opportunity.
The Commissioner and rapporteur have done some excellent work.
The new information and communication technologies can help promote European democracy, skills and expertise, and competitiveness.
The Unionâs legislation must, however, ensure that this is actually the case.
New communications media, such as the mobile television, will open up new opportunities for small producers.
Mobile communications are not affected by restrictions such as prime time viewing or viewing times that are too short.
In other words, everyone can in principle watch television when they like.
I would propose that the Commission should set up a programme to support small European producers of these new media; for example, the mobile television.
That way we would bring about an increase in much needed, distinctive and versatile software.
A multicultural Europe is just the right basis for that, and, consequently, as Europeans, we would find our place in these new communication technologies.
As legislators, we have a democratic and cultural duty to prevent centralisation of the sector.
That is a problem we all have in common.
The same giant companies now own not only the television, radio and press institutions but also the mobile communications technologies, and this kind of homogeneity presents us with a major challenge, because diversified communication is absolutely essential for us to develop a knowledge-based economy.
The Commission should therefore take a close look at the viability of markets and access to a diverse culture and information in different countries, different media and different content.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Paasilinna, today we are discussing the future not only of Europe, but also of the international information society.
Europe has every chance of setting an example to the rest of the world in this field, particularly since the information society plays a leading role in the Lisbon Strategy, the main objectives of which are growth and employment.
Our task must be to show people that what growth really means is how much they have in the bank at the end of each month.
We must also show them that increases in employment, or in other words in the number of people in work, mean that we can spend more on welfare benefits, whether in the case of pensions, students or universities.
The digital divide plays a key role in this respect; to take but one example, family businesses in developing countries lack the basics not only in terms of hardware and software, but above all in terms of training.
The focus of our efforts must be on promoting the role of Internet-based professional training.
The Internet is also home to a wealth of cultural and linguistic diversity â another example of which can be seen in this House, with its 20Â languages â and so it opens up a wide range of possibilities for achieving what must be our main goal, namely encouraging growth and employment throughout the world.
Health is another factor that must not be neglected, as it will be a key determinant of future welfare spending.
The provision of Internet-based information on health, prevention and awareness of the causes of disease will have a major impact on such spending, and will be most useful in the case of diseases of old age.
It is for this reason that research, development and trade are of absolutely vital importance, as are family businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises.
I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that such issues take centre stage in Tunis.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her good work, which I support entirely.
Commissioner, the Tunisia Summit must demonstrate the political will of the European Union and the Member States to promote information and communication technologies as a strategic instrument for economic and social development, and also for cooperation.
The European Unionâs leadership with regard to cooperation with developing countries undoubtedly offers those countries an opportunity to open up to the information society to the benefit of everybody.
Two issues concern me, however.
The first is the funding of the action plan.
The World Digital Solidarity Fund is clearly insufficient, given its voluntary nature, and we must therefore mobilise more financial resources, whether they be development, structural or other new resources.
I am sure that the citizens would support us in this; the last Eurobarometer confirmed this: 71% of Europeans want more emphasis and more resources to be dedicated to the information society.
And if we reach an agreement on the new financial perspectives, we in the European Union have the opportunity to take advantage of the priority, already expressed by the next Presidency of the Council, attached to promoting greater establishment and development of information and communication technologies.
Secondly, with regard to the governance of the Internet and in view of the approaching conclusion of the ICANN, a new model must be created that is based on an international organisation and in which political decisions are reserved for governments and technical tasks for the industry and the private sector, undoubtedly with a flexible operation that reconciles decision making with the participation of all the States.

That model, ladies and gentlemen, must also ensure the participation of civil society, through the creation of a discussion forum to respond to the challenges and problems raised by the development of the Internet; only in that way will our true support for the information society be credible.
Â Â  Mr President, I hope you will not think me a kill-joy at this late hour, but I would like to touch on something negative relating to the report, which I otherwise support and believe to be good.
This negative thing is a phenomenon that can be described using the increasingly familiar expression âe-apathyâ.
The Trautmann report is undoubtedly correct when it asserts that ICT development must serve to strengthen democracy and citizensâ interests, so as to make people participants and not simply consumers in the information society.
This really is our only possible goal, but we must see the obstacles too.
E-apathy is one of these obstacles.
In Hungary today, for example, only one in every four adults uses the Internet regularly.
Meanwhile, the vast majority of non-users insist that they do not need it, or are simply not interested.
This example is not unique.
The ratio is similar in the majority of the new Member States.
To a significant share of the population the advantages and opportunities provided by the Internet appear ambivalent.
In these Member States, development of the services sector and infrastructure could easily become asymmetrical as a result, since a significant portion of society, lacking the appropriate motivation, is passive or dismissive towards the implementation of costly systems.
All of this of course could also bring about asymmetry in the relationship between the old and new Member States.
It is in our common interest to avoid this and strengthen cohesion in this area too.
We must therefore do everything we can to reinforce -inclusion by ensuring more vigorous, clearer and more intelligible communication than hitherto.
And we must also give priority to dispelling engrained negative attitudes and misconceptions surrounding the new medium, alongside emphasising its positive attributes.
I am confident that the report has taken a step in this direction and so I support it, and of course I too congratulate MrsÂ Trautmann and thank her for her work.
Â Â  Nowadays, information and communication technologies most certainly rank among the main contributing factors to economic growth and sustainable development.
Alongside the fact that they increase productivity and promote inclusion in society, this transition to the age of digital communication is also a cause of exclusion from society, especially if users or citizens are insufficiently aware of the advantages, or are not capable of using our modern acquisitions.
It is therefore extremely important that we invest in the development of the information society, and at the same time in education for the use of modern technology even in the earliest stages of school education.
On the other hand, society should not exclude older people who are still afraid to use modern communication and modern media.
Many cases are known where citizens have preferred to retire or become unemployed rather than adapt to using computers.
At todayâs rapid pace we have trouble keeping up with what is new, and this will be repeated from generation to generation. There exists, therefore, the danger of elite groups emerging, owing to exclusion from the information society.
Given that we perform an increasing number of services by modern means and a declining number on paper, there is the possibility of discrimination emerging owing to a lack of knowledge and experience in this area.
For this reason, in addition to development, society must ensure the possibility of education for all strata of the population and for all age groups.
Equally important is that great attention should be paid to the security of using modern technology and communication, and that trust will grow through development and the possibility of misuse will diminish.
Institutions offering these services must advise consumers of the possibility of dangers, while at the same time giving them guarantees against misuse.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, it was developments in information technology that broke the monopoly of Communist censorship in the 1980s, and helped bring democracy to our part of Europe.
We must now go one step further.
The next challenge awaiting us is the development of an information society, in which technology and communications are used to enforce human rights standardsÂ effectively at international, national and regional levels.
While building this information society, we must focus not only on the obvious tasks of promoting and constructing basic infrastructure, but also and above all, on education.
By this I mean firstly primary education, in order to ensure that no one feels scared of technological progress, and secondly education on media content, which would allow young people to take a critical and creative approach to all forms of media.
The information society entails free and unrestricted access to technology and information, and this is why I believe that software patents would mean certain death for such a society.
Grim dictatorships, motivated by the fear of certain ideas, still find ways of blocking access to information.
There is nothing new in this.
A law has been adopted in Cuba restricting Internet access to selected businesses and government offices, and banning the sale of computers to the public.
Only 6Â 000 of the 100Â 000Â computers in Cuba are connected to international networks, and even these are kept under close control.
The Belarussian Government is also well aware of the potential role of the Internet in developing civil society and democracy, and it uses every means at its disposal to curb its growing popularity.
A new law has been drafted on the mass media. , this law provides for mandatory registration and makes it necessary for Internet-based publishers to obtain what is known as a publishing licence.
In reality, the latter will act as a powerful instrument of censorship.
A further characteristic feature of the situation in Belarus is the fact that the state is the only Internet provider, as there are no other operators in the country with access to external telecommunications services.
The Belarussian Ministry of Communications requires all Internet users to obtain authorisation for their modems at a cost of USDÂ 20, even though the average monthly income per capita is USDÂ 60.
There is no escaping the conclusion that this issue must also be a focus of our activities.
Â Â  Mr President, I must apologise to the Commissioner because, as she probably knows, I do not normally make a practice of turning up just in time to speak.
Unusually, everything has run very early tonight.
I am pleased to be here to support Mrs Trautmannâs report, particularly because I was part of the delegation that went to the first World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003 with her distinguished predecessor, Erkki Liikanen.
I was privileged to be there in the great chamber in Geneva when he made a very eloquent speech on behalf of the European Union.
I can tell colleagues from that experience that it is quite clear how respected the European Union has been and continues to be within the whole process of developing the work of the information society.
It has given a clear lead to other member states as well.
I am sure that Commissioner Reding will want to continue that important tradition, because there is much work to be done.
I want to underline two points that were emphasised to me during that time in Geneva.
The first is the importance of our research programme and spreading that research programme out to the less-developed world.
There are many computer scientists struggling with totally inadequate facilities who would really like to be on our research networks and working with our research scientists.
I know that part of the next generation of the âGeantâ programme, which the Commissioner launched last week, will address that issue.
I cannot overstate the importance of that, particularly because we want those computer scientists to develop the tools, products, services and new ideas that will help their communities, whether it is in health, education or other forms of local service provision, particularly over a very widespread area and one where communications are very light.
Secondly, there is the importance of encouraging them to have a competitive infrastructure for telecommunications, to bring those costs down, to encourage competition so they can have the same access as us to plentiful, cheap services.
If we can achieve those two things, along with the other things, it will be a tremendous advance for all those countries.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â Î€he next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Marcin Libicki, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the Lloyd's affair (O-0068/2005 â B6-0245/2005).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Libicki, has asked me to state the following on his behalf, due to his sudden departure for Poland.
Everything which is said only reflects the position of the Committee on Petitions and not that of any political group or of me personally.
The Chairman, Mr Libicki, asks the House and the committee to excuse his absence.
The debate this evening, moved by the oral question tabled on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, touches the very core that many people have in mind when they talk of a Europe of the citizens or, more specifically, of European nationality.
The right to petition, as enshrined in the Treaty, implies obligations for all the European institutions, not just Parliament.
Every citizen has the right to petition Parliament within the framework of the activities of the European Union and to expect a satisfactory response; to expect that, where there is infringement in matters which touch on the competences of the European Union, there will be reparation.
The debate on the petitions relating to the Lloyd's affair seeks an honest reply from the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties.
If a European law has not been applied correctly by a Member State for a great many years; if, indeed, incorrect application has also resulted in serious personal losses and, in certain cases, pushed people to the point at which they end their lives; if it is true that the petitioners in the Lloyd's affair in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and numerous other countries in the European Union suffered huge financial losses because the First Non-Life Insurance Directive was not applied correctly, then this matter must make all of us think about how Europe operates.
Citizens have the right to expect that, when the Council and Parliament adopt legislation, it is applied correctly in the Member States of the European Union without exception.
It has come to our attention that the petitioners in 1997 in the United Kingdom have stated that the Community Non-Life Insurance Directive was late being introduced.
On this subject, after a long interval, Parliament took exceptional measures, approving the report by Mr Roy Perry in September 2003 by 358 for, no votes against and 35 abstentions.
Long and detailed enquiries followed by the Committee on Petitions and yet, despite all this, the petitioners are still waiting for a clear answer to the questions raised in the Perry resolution, so that they can finally proceed with their case before the courts in Great Britain and seek compensation for the losses which they have sustained.
If the European Parliament needs to refer the European Commission to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, because it failed to reply to our question and because it failed to render proper account to the European Parliament, then I believe that we should do so without fear, Mr Libicki says.
The question at issue is a question of the European Commission's rendering proper account to the European Parliament and, consequently of the European Parliament's rendering proper account to the citizens, more and more of whom are filing petitions.
Is our usual legislation good enough and is it correctly applied?
Is there free movement of goods and persons and recognition of professional qualifications?
Do European citizens have rights?
That is the substance of this evening's debate.
The European Parliament is waiting for the European Commission to decide if European citizens have rights and to investigate if the United Kingdom has applied the laws on the proper regulation and control of the insurance market over the last two decades and if solvency requirements existed at that time.
Reply please, Commissioner; not you personally, of course.
Remember that your predecessor only went into action when he came under pressure, instituting infringement proceedings which were later withdrawn when the United Kingdom complied.
Reply, on behalf of your institution, before Parliament; reply above all on the question of compliance by the country in question over this specific period.
Â Â  . Mr President, the question of the regulation of Lloydâs and the application of the First Non-Life Insurance Directive in the United Kingdom has been debated before in this Chamber.
I refer to Oral Question B5-0010/2004 by Mr Perry, which was debated by Parliament on 12 February 2004, and to the answer given by the Commission on that occasion.
The Commission has always expressed the greatest sympathy for the thousands of individuals â including the petitioners â who have suffered as a result of the Lloydâs affair. The Commissionâs views and concerns relating to the pre-2000 UK legislation were set out clearly in its letter of formal notice of December 2001, which is now a public document.
The UK authorities informed the Commission that new legislation had been enacted to replace the former regime and answered further Commission questions relating to that new legislation.
The Commission then announced that it was satisfied that those aspects of the regulatory and supervisory regime for Lloydâs under examination were compatible with the requirements of the directive.
The Commission has no doubt that once it had established the compatibility of the new regime for Lloydâs it had no basis for continuing the infringement proceedings it had begun with the letter of formal notice in December 2001 in relation to the old regime.
The Court of Justiceâs jurisprudence on the purpose and conduct of infringement proceedings is quite clear.
The Commission has always stressed to complainants that any action seeking damages for alleged incompatibility under the former regime must be undertaken exclusively before the United Kingdom courts.
In order to help them in their litigation in the UK against the UK Government, the petitioners and many correspondents seem to seek a ruling from the Commission on the compatibility or incompatibility of the former Lloydâs regime. However, only the Court of Justice can give such rulings.
The Commission voiced its concerns in its 2001 letter of formal notice but this was only the first step in a long process of argument and counter-argument that might ultimately, if it had been continued, have led to a formal hearing and ruling at the Court of Justice.
The Commission is fully aware that it is a subject of great regret to many that the legal proceedings begun with our letter were not pursued to their ultimate conclusion, but it has no doubt that its decision to discontinue the proceedings was the right one and was fully in conformity with the constant jurisprudence of the Court in the matter of infringement proceedings.
I have taken note of the motion for a resolution tabled for the purpose of winding up tonightâs debate on this question.
The Commission believes that the points addressed to it in Mr Perryâs report, to which the draft resolution makes reference, have all been answered.
The Commission made its views on the UK authoritiesâ responses to the letter of formal notice public when it decided to close the infringement procedure.
As to the access to documents retained by the Commission, I stress that these are governed by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. The conditions for gaining access to these documents are set out in that regulation.
As to the third question in Mr Perryâs report about possible shortcomings or omissions in the UK regime, I reiterate that the Commission raised a number of questions in its letters of formal notice.
I stress, however, that these were only questions.
Such questions do not, in themselves, constitute an opinion or judgement.
The answers provided by the UK authorities satisfied the Commission and led it to decide that there were no grounds to pursue the infringement procedure.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I should say first of all that I come from a Lloydâs background, although I am not a Name; I never have been and I have no financial interest in any way, shape or form.
My family has been associated with Lloydâs for over 200 years in one form or another and I therefore understand the marketplace and how Lloydâs functions.
I have no specific animus against Lloydâs in any way, shape or form. Indeed, arguably, I strongly support the organisation.
But equally I support the principle of this question, which dates back â as many colleagues now know â to 1997 in terms of the petition and far longer in terms of the substance.
This is about the fact that the question tabled by Roy Perry and now by the Committee on Petitions has not been answered properly.
It is a measure of that concern that there is unanimity in the Committee on Petitions, even though there may be disagreement about the substance on the fact that this question has not been responded to properly.
That is why there is a motion for a resolution attached to give power to the President of Parliament to instruct the Committee on Legal Affairs to take legal action against the Commission to answer that question, if â as I suspect is already the case this evening â this has not happened.
The cause for concern here is that it is a failure by the Commission to respond to the Committee on Petitions â now in total as opposed to an individual Member.
The issue itself continues, as the Commissioner and Members know.
People are still being made bankrupt and their health and their lives are still often in turmoil.
This petition needs to be closed, we need answers to the question.
My colleagues and I on the Committee on Petitions cannot agree to the petition being closed until we get the proper answers to these questions tabled now and also previously by my former colleague Roy Perry.
The Commission must answer the question properly to give at least a chance to those who have suffered at the hands of Lloydâs in this sad affair the opportunity to be able to pursue their cases.
I have never been and will not be one who advises members of Lloydâs â âNamesâ â who have suffered financially to pursue a case with no expectation of success.
That way lies folly and further trouble.
However, I, along with colleagues who have investigated this matter, believe that it needs proper consideration.
That is why the question has been tabled in the terms it has.
This is no personal reflection on Commissioner McCreevy, but I am not satisfied that the Commission has given the proper answer.
Therefore, it must realise that further consequences will follow.
Â Â  .
Mr President, during the last term in office, I was a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and I followed this issue, and then, just as now, I was highly perplexed, because we are talking here about the Commissionâs legal responsibilities, in accordance with Article 232 of the Treaty, which relates to the procedure on failure to act, but, according to Article 232, in order for the European Parliament to complain about a violation of the Treaty, it must involve a violation of the Treaty as such.

Of course, this is a Directive that was not adopted by a previous British Government but which was then adopted by a subsequent government, the current government; the Commission began an infringement procedure pursuant to Article 226, the situation was changed, the Directive was incorporated and, from that point, as Commissioner McCreevy has pointed out, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it was not possible to continue proceedings before the Court, because Article 226 says: âIf the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under this Treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity ...â.
Since the State conformed to the Commissionâs opinion, we currently have no case from a legal point of view.
That is to say that I have the impression that, as Commissioner McCreevy has said, at this point, the only possibility is to bring an action before the British legal authorities, but not before the Institutions of the European Union.
In legal terms, we could say that, as things stand, neither this Parliament, nor the Commission, nor the Court of Justice of the European Union are the appropriate fora for dealing with this kind of complaint.
That, unfortunately, is how the Treaty is worded.
We could have a different Treaty, which would impose obligations on the Commission with regard to things that have happened previously, but in this case the case-law of the Court of Justice is clear and that is why I raised objections in relation to this issue and I continue to do so today.
That is to say that the Treaty does not authorise the Commission to bring a State before the Court of Justice once the State has conformed to European Union Law.
It is not a mathematical or immediate, or automatic, system, but rather the State must firstly be called upon to comply, and when it does so, the procedure comes to an end; from that point, the Commission can do nothing.
My feeling is that, at this point, both the Commissionâs previous reply and the reply that Commissioner McCreevy has just given us are entirely satisfactory.

I recommend that the people affected by the Lloyd's case turn to the British courts and take appropriate action in accordance with British Law, but I believe that there is no point in our considering this procedure at this point; it is a huge waste of time for this Parliament and we could go as far as to say that it would also mislead the people affected, because it takes them along a path that will take them nowhere.
The British courts themselves are their only chance of success; in fact I believe actions have already been brought before those courts.
This is the only form of action possible. And that is what I recommend to the people involved in this kind of complaint.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commissioner is of course new to this saga, but unfortunately for many of our constituents, both in the UK and elsewhere, this is a long-running tragedy that, as we have seen, dates back to the 1970s.
If we are honest, and I agree with Mr Medina Ortega about this, we know that whatever we do may not bring a resolution to the many personal cases of loss.
We do not want legal proceedings between our institutions for the sake of having legal proceedings, but we do want to do something that enhances the position and standing of Parliament and Europeâs institutions.
The central issue here is about how the European Union functions and, more particularly within your area, about how the internal market functions.
It is quite simple really: a directive appears not to have been fully and properly implemented over a long period of years.
Eventually the Member State comes into compliance 20 years after the event.
That just cannot be good enough for Parliament or for Europe.
In addition, our Committee on Petitions is often the first point of call.
It should be an early warning system, but sometimes, as in this case, it happens after the event.
The Commission should always be on guard to ensure that implementation takes place properly.
And if there is a query about implementation it should be prepared, given the current political climate in Europe, to give unequivocal answers.
Parliament has always argued that correspondence regarding possible enforcement proceedings between Member States and the Commission should be shared.
It is quite straightforward and I appreciate that your predecessor, Mr Bolkestein, wrote saying that there were reasons for not revealing some of the correspondence.
Surely, again in the current political climate, we have a duty to our citizens to get to the bottom of what happens in cases like this and to give them satisfactory answers.
Otherwise we have every right to expect the negative responses that we got in France and Holland.
If we cannot answer our citizensâ straightforward questions about how we implement EU law, then it is a poor show.
I hope, Commissioner, that you will be able to help us more than your predecessor could.
Â Â  The Commission should reply to Parliamentâs question as to whether the UK properly applied the Non-Life Insurance Directive between 1978 and 2001.
As this question relates to the internal market, there are no grounds to refuse to make such a reply.
In November 2003 Commissioner Bolkestein refused to give a proper answer.
The committees responsible then asked the President of Parliament to take legal action against the Commission.
A few months later it was indicated that the necessary legal requirements would not have been met.
Now again, a year later, a new resolution has been tabled.
Colleagues, we are now eight years on from what was in this case the first of many petitions.
It is almost two years since the overwhelming vote on the first resolution on the Lloydâs affair.
Thousands of citizens were driven into bankruptcy and are now, as we speak, still at risk.
Some have committed suicide.
This is the result of deliberate and systematic deception in the Lloydâs affair. When it is dealing with a petition, not the role, but the credibility of this Parliament is at stake.
If the European citizens write to us to turn to us for help, and Member States fail, a successful case before the European Court of Justice would enhance Parliamentâs role in the examination of petitions.
Commissioner, if no progress is made, I must conclude that Parliament is unable to help the European citizens who ask for its help.
In that case, I must apply other techniques in an effort to wake this House; to get justice for tens of thousands of European citizens who are terrorised by this affair.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Libickiâs question rubs salt into the wounds of the contradictions of this Europe, which is tailor-made for large financial interests, a Europe that its citizens do not want, as was at least demonstrated by those Europeans who had the opportunity to give their opinion on the matter.
From examining the documentation, both the breaches of the Commission and those of the British Government, or at least of its so-called supervisory bodies, stand out, but what also stands out is the gap between the interests of the people and the interest of a very restricted number of plutocrats and speculators.
With regard to the Lloydâs affair, what was controlled can be very easily identified, whilst, as chance would have it, who controlled it cannot.
The legitimate doubt arises that Directive 73/239/EEC on solvency was disregarded with the conscious acquiescence, not to say complicity, of the European Commission and the competent supervisory bodies of the UK Treasury.
A popular Italian proverb says: âEvery law has its loophole.â
The old saying is also true in terms of the United Kingdom and the European Commission: the fact remains, however, that the business of insurance is a gamble that Lloydâs has nearly always won and won for centuries.
There is no sympathy for those who take risks in investing and in financial speculations, because those types of entrepreneur feel no sympathy for small savers, for consumers, for the extremely high number of victims of their dangerous and unscrupulous financial games, and for those who, on the contrary, make money through the sweat of their brow, investing their physical and mental resources and drawing an income from it.
Those who gamble on probability, a gamble that clearly yields more profit than forgiveness, given that that activity has been practised for centuries, must also accept the risks; the Lloydâs affair is a symbolic example of the unfair expectations of those who always want to win just because they have large sums of money to risk, not caring less about all those, the great majority, who bet their own lives on their work.
Â Â  Mr President, I was disappointed with Commissioner McCreevyâs reply.
We need to distinguish between two issues here.
The first is the issue of those who invested in Lloydâs and whether or not the British Government is obliged to compensate them for their losses.
The Commissioner quite rightly pointed out that it is an issue that has to be pursued through the UK courts.
However, what we are specifically dealing with here is the refusal of the Commission to deal properly and in accordance with the Treaties in replying to questions from this House.
The Commissioner is explicitly obliged under the Treaties to reply to questions.
Tonight, yet again, he has refused to provide all the information that was sought as far back as 2003.
On another occasion, a previous Commissioner indicated that the UK Government was unhappy with the Commission revealing the information which was being sought by the Committee on Petitions.
Since this is a codecision issue â as the insurance directive is a codecision directive â Parliament has at least equal right to the information which is available to the Commission and the Member State.
They are not the only ones responsible for the legislation.
So I appeal to the Commissioner to avoid the ignominy of being brought before the European Court of Justice by this House for failing to comply with the Treaties.
It seems to me, Commissioner, that in any event that you may end up in court if you do not comply.
I do not know British law that well, but I suspect that if this case was in Ireland the complainants could force you to produce the information.
I think it is entirely unfair to deny this House the information to which it is entitled, and you face the real risk of being brought before the European Court of Justice if you do not provide it.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission believes it has fulfilled its duties under the Treaty.
When doubts were raised, the Commission started an investigation and issued a letter of formal notice and a supplementary letter of formal notice.
The Commission has answered questions put to it by the Parliament to the best of its ability.
My predecessor met with representatives of the Committee on Petitions and answered questions in this Chamber, as well as many written questions.
I have met with Mr Libicki to discuss this matter, and am here again this evening to answer Parliamentâs questions.
This is what accountability on the part of the Commission amounts to.
The Commission has acted by deciding to open an infringement procedure and acted again by deciding to close the case when it received a satisfactory answer from the UK authorities.
The Commission always endeavours to answer Parliamentâs questions to the best of its abilities.
In this case, however, the Commission is being asked to pronounce on whether a Member State was in conformity with Community law during a certain period in the past, and under a different legislative regime to that which is now in place.
The Commission cannot answer that question because the pre-litigation and litigation proceedings that would have established the answer were not completed.
Â Â  â I have received a motion for a resolution(1) to wind up the debate in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â Î€he next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adoption of a Council regulation on amending Regulation (ÎC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies (09812/2005 â C6-0192/2005 â 2005/0064(SYN)) (A6-0204/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Juncker, said in his speech this morning that he had brought two principles to the attention of his colleagues at last weekâs summit.
The first of these was that they should revisit their own decisions and ensure that these decisions are implemented. The second was that they should abide by the institutional rules.
It is a sad state of affairs when the members of a community must be reminded of such self-evident rules of conduct, and when appeals must be made to those in positions of responsibility to abide by them.
Unfortunately, the appeals fell on deaf ears in the case of too many Heads of State or Government.
For many years now, the euro zone finance ministers have also ignored these principles, even though they are necessary for formulating efficient, confidence-building and professional policies.
Those who infringed the Stability and Growth Pact have even set themselves up in judgment and prevented the Commission from enforcing the rights conferred upon it.
The same happened to Parliament when it considered the two draft Commission regulations on the Stability and Growth Pact.
The Commission called on the finance ministers to incorporate Parliamentâs proposals; the President-in-Office of the Council called on his colleagues to take heed of them.
During the last part-session, a majority of Members of this House voted in favour of both my reports on the two Commission regulations.
Yet, even though the majority of finance ministers, the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council agreed on the substance of our new amendments, not one of them was accepted by the Council.
Most of the national delegations would have been prepared to incorporate certain amendments, in particular those relating to total debt evolution and monitoring, but a small number of influential countries stood in the way of this happening.
Attempts are now being made to pass the buck to Parliament, by telling us that although noÂ one is going to ask us what we want, we have no power to stop anything from happening.
This is not a matter of institutional competence; it is a matter of substance.
