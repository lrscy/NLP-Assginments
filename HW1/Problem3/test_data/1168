I am very curious to know how they intend bringing about everything they have promised.
I have tremendous problems with the latest development in particular.
All the same, I do not see why we are now misusing this debate for something else.
By suddenly producing such artificial debates, we are not actually being honest with the people of the European Union either.
If you want, let us do that when we are discussing the Oostlander report, and then people will see that we are capable of discussing openly and honestly.
Mr President, for 28 years, Berlin and Germany were divided.
That is now history.
For 28 years, Nicosia and Cyprus have been divided.
Let that be history, and let it be so as soon as possible.
Turkey must respect the UN resolutions and give its full support to efforts to reach a political solution regarding Cyprus.
If the discussions fail, Cyprus must nonetheless be given the green light for membership in 2004 at the Copenhagen European Council this coming December.
It is important to make it clear to the new Islamophile Turkish Government that it must ignore the Turkish Cypriot threat of a permanent division of Cyprus if the southern part is brought into the EU before the discussions between Turkey and Greece are concluded.
I assume it is perfectly clear to the Turks that their country can never embark upon membership negotiations if the occupying troops are not withdrawn from a future EU Member State, namely Cyprus.
We are concerned here with the credibility of the EU and with the EU as a peace project.
Initiatives on the part of the new Turkish Government and the UN on the Cyprus issue must be based upon this obvious insight.
In the text produced by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I have put forward the view that Turkey's democratic development, especially when it comes to the protection of ethnic and religious minorities, must be a prerequisite of increased financial pre-accession aid from the EU.
In 1900, a quarter of Turkey's population was Christian.
A hundred years later, a thousandth of the population is Christian.
That is a tragic expression of extensive assaults upon religious freedom and religious tolerance, particularly affecting Christian Syrians and Armenians.
I have also helped tighten up the appeals made by the European Parliament to the candidate countries when it comes, for example, to combating corruption, and I have also added an economic perspective.
I should like to welcome the candidate countries to the EU.
Mr President, I speak as a Member of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee and also as shadow rapporteur on Romania.
I will try to be brief.
On the issue of Bulgaria and Romania we need a target date, a focus.
Therefore I fully support the proposed target date.
Also, during a recent visit to Malta I saw the wonderful work being done in connection with sexual orientation.
We must not leave that out of the equation when we look at the rights of minorities.
It was clear to me from the work of the Malta gay rights movement that the employment industrial relations act is not compliant with the employment framework directive, especially in relation to sexual orientation.
I welcome the positive statements on Turkey.
As regards the negative statements on Turkey, I am afraid that, sadly, we have seen racism and xenophobia rear their ugly heads.
We must apply the same terms, conditions and principles.
We cannot be selective in the application of principles.
The same principles must apply to all the candidate countries and also to the countries such as Turkey which have indicated that they wish to join the European Union.
If we turn Turkey away, I believe that will be an action that we will live to regret.
Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner, who is here today, and the President-in-Office of the Council to explain how they are going to apply the principle of equality within this enlargement process.
In my view, following the Franco-German agreement, it is necessary to stipulate that the financial impact of enlargement must not fall to the poorest areas, who are beneath the Community average and who require sustained progress.
Equally, the bill for enlargement must not fall to the richest.
We must protect the whole of the enlarged Europe from any risk of impoverishment of any part of it.
We must extend paragraph 24 of the Brok report to all areas and regions of the European Union, since enlargement must not have negative repercussions for any Community territory.
I would like to say to the candidate countries that they must bear in mind that the defence of human beings, without exceptions, without discrimination, is today the backbone of the European Union.
The exclusion of women, the exclusion of Romany minorities, are today the focus of our attention.
There is no room in Europe for exclusion, for expulsion, for marginalisation, whether collective or individual.
Europe, as from today, is entering into a new dynamic, which, since it is stronger and more powerful, must be more sensitive to its most distant and distinct elements.
Mr President, I would like to make three comments.
As far as enlargement with Turkey is concerned, it is the usual practice to have a debate.
We cannot express regret that European citizens lack an interest in Europe whilst also rejecting the debate on enlargement, enlargement which would be the furthest removed from the European Union's original plan.
At the same time, the enlargement process that is currently being undertaken includes the greatest number of countries.
We must remember that we have never enlarged by more than three countries at once.
The current enlargement process is not yet completed.
We all hope that it will be a success.
Let us complete it successfully before launching a debate on possible future enlargements.
With respect to the European Union's major neighbours, one of which - but not the only one - is Turkey, we must be capable of proposing another solution to the dilemma with which we are trying to grapple, that of accession or exclusion.
Yet, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is proposing, there is another solution, one better adapted to the problem raised.
This solution is to define a specific framework of relations including a substantial economic section and which enables us to finance a specific number of projects and infrastructures. This is how the continent of North America is organised, and no one there is proposing that Mexico or Canada should be members of the United States of America.
The Group of the European People's Party is proposing another option, which is much better adapted to the real problem.
I am sure that Parliament will be open to the feelings of the population and will ask to move forward in this direction and lay down a new framework between the European Union and its neighbouring countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the European Union this time round is truly impressive.
Ten new countries are about to join.
I should like, if I may, to turn my attention in this interesting and highly promising development to Cyprus, rather than to what are indisputably more densely populated countries far closer to home.
Cyprus, that tiny country with its long history and tragic vicissitudes over recent years, covers the far side of the Mediterranean dimension of the European Union and, by virtue of its position, can contribute a great deal to the Union's Mediterranean policy.
We all know that the political importance of Cyprus far outweighs its economic importance to the future development of the European Union.
At the same time, however, by integrating Cyprus, the European Union itself is demonstrating that it is an international entity with international credentials and this will help enormously in resolving the Cyprus problem.
The implementation of the acquis communautaire in Cyprus is the key to reconciliation and cooperation and will enable Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to live side by side in a single, federal, twin community, free, independent state which respects human rights and the ethnic origins and religious persuasions of its people.
It is the basis on which a fair, viable, workable solution can be found; the sort of solution that the UN Secretary-General's plan should bring about once it has been negotiated by the interested parties.
More importantly, the integration of Cyprus into the European Union is a test and a challenge to Turkey in its efforts to speed up the process of meeting the Community criteria, the process which will enable it too to join the European Union at a later date.
May everything go according to plan!
Mr President, after today's debate, I understand why Turkey is calling upon the forthcoming December Council to set a date for the start of the negotiations.
I support Turkey's request, for what is happening here is a farce, started by Mr Giscard d'Estaing and continuing today in this Chamber.
Here, we are not discussing whether Turkey is fulfilling the conditions it needs to fulfil in order to become a member of the Union in the near future - and we can be rigorous in demanding that it does fulfil them - we are opening a debate on whether or not Turkey is to be allowed to join the Union in the future and wondering whether a different sort of association might be appropriate.
We are going back on decisions already made and reopening the debate on the opening of a line of credit for a major country - a country which is essential to Europe and the West - which has applied to become a full member of the Union.
Personally, I support the line taken by Mr Brok in his report and his resolution, where he calls for greater pre-accession cooperation from the Commission and for the Council to adopt a position which is more in line with that expressed on occasions by Parliament, but I do not support the Ferber amendment - which I will vote against tomorrow - in that if it were to be adopted, the whole approach of the Brok report and resolution would be turned upside down and they would make no sense.
There are good reasons for what I am saying: we have a duty to be unambiguous towards a major country which practises moderate Islam, is pro the West, which could have great cultural significance on our borders and could give substance to a Union foreign and security policy.
I hope that, tomorrow, we will reject the Ferber amendment - as a member of the European People's Party I will do so - and we will thus be able to take a step in that direction.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we draw near to the close of the debate it is not easy to introduce another new aspect.
Since there is broad agreement here that we welcome this process and we are taking for granted that ten new states will soon be sending their representatives here officially, I should, however, like to raise one aspect again, that is the necessity of canvassing in all future 25 countries for this also to find acceptance with public opinion, with the citizens.
I think that is a great task that lies ahead of us and cannot only begin when the accession process is almost completed and the treaties signed.
I come from a region that in 1990 entered this European Union overnight, as it were.
I know that many citizens experienced the necessary restructuring process as a personal defeat, a downgrading that marked them out as losers.
I think we need to make clear to people in the candidate countries, too, that membership of the European Union also results in resources and means being made available to cushion the citizens and help them through the difficult process.
That will be a big task for us because after all we need majorities in the population.
If we in this Parliament are agreed, that is to be welcomed, but we must take the citizens with us in this process, which will certainly not be as easy as it sounds.
Let us work together to make it possible.
As a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to see the advisory committees more fairly and intensively involved in the next concrete discussions of the outcome of negotiations.
I know that is a great political achievement, a great political report, but the individual specialist committees must surely have something important to say about the process.
Mr President, we are heading for the unification of Europe.
This is a natural consequence of the winds of freedom having swept away the closed borders of Europe and the insurmountable antagonisms, as well as the suspicion, the Soviet system and the Communist dictatorships.
I am convinced that 2004 will go down in history as 1989 has already done.
The work of enlargement must proceed further, however.
The new Member States must be treated with respect.
The principle of subsidiarity must serve more clearly as a guide to cooperation as the EU grows.
National self-determination must be the same in the new Member States as in the old.
What we do not want the EU to interfere in where our own countries are concerned, the EU must not interfere in where the new Member States are concerned, either.
The enlargement process must not cease after 2004 and 2007.
We already know that new applications for EU membership are on the way.
At the Helsinki European Council in 1999, Turkey was recognised as a candidate country for EU membership.
Three years later, the European Parliament cannot now, as some amendments demand, try to change this.
Nothing has happened to justify such a measure, so the basic conditions governing an international, confidence-building project cannot suddenly be changed.
It would be unworthy of a generous and responsible European Parliament in this way to change the basic conditions set for Turkey.
Turkey has made great progress in order to be able to embark upon the negotiations with a view to EU membership.
There are things that remain to be done, and it is for Turkey to decide whether it wishes to continue.
I am nonetheless convinced that, in the future, a democratic Turkish society governed by the rule of law may be crucially important to a better understanding between the West and the Muslim world.
Such friends are valuable at this time.
Mr President, I absolutely agree with what Mr Arvidsson has just said with regard to Turkey.
Turkey has improved its human rights situation and its legal praxis in a way that is worthy of our respect.
I think it is very unfortunate, however, that it has been suggested that there should be a change of policy.
Our message to Ankara should remain the same as it has been the whole time, which is that EU membership is open to all European countries provided that the criteria for accession are satisfied.
With enlargement, the Internal Market, which is the EU's core mechanism, will grow larger, which will improve the EU's chances of success in the global markets.
In the pauses between the celebratory speeches, however, we have to remember that achieving a viable Internal Market required and will require, in the future too, great effort on the part of all concerned.
For that very reason, the Copenhagen criteria also include the requirement that there is competitiveness within the Internal Market.
I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Brok, that there is still a lot of work ahead of us.
Making political decisions is easier than bringing about changes in the economic structure.
The timetable for 2004 is a tight one.
It is difficult to implement economic structural reforms at times but we have to keep to the commitments that have been made.
We have to ensure in particular that the future Member States have the administrative and legal capacity for operating as part of the Internal Market.
Our job as politicians is to guarantee that the Internal Market will function successfully after enlargement.
This means that the work cannot stop with Copenhagen.
Even after accession the new Member States will have to continue with their policies of reform.
The internal reforms the applicant countries implement will nevertheless increase the prosperity and stability of their societies in the long term.
The European Parliament will also have to monitor the situation and ensure that the present Member States, the Commission and the future Member States each play their part in completing the enlargement process.
Mr President, one evening, after winning a battle, Winston Churchill declared 'it is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end, but one can say that it is the end of the beginning'.
I think that this sums up our situation perfectly.
Our friends who are joining us feel, no doubt, that they have arrived at the end of the road.
In fact, they are only at the end of the first stage along the road and tomorrow we must all set about building Europe.
They are not arriving in a ready-made world.
We must establish a political Union and both the foreign policy and defence policy must be drafted.
The institutions are due to be radically reformed within the framework of the Convention and already, those who are due to join us are taking part in the work of the Convention.
This is a Europe that we are therefore going to build together.
Do not have any preconceptions or the feeling that you are arriving in a world made by others and for others: you are arriving along with others in a world that we shall all be building together.
And I would simply like to give you what I feel is the secret of influence in Europe.
Some believe that one must be hard and strict, that one must constantly complain and protest in favour of one's national interests.
This is far from being the case.
Europe gives itself to those who support it.
This is the fundamental rule of the European Union: support it and it will serve you well!
I should like to thank Mr Bourlanges for his concluding remark which gives me a welcome opportunity now to present my few concluding observations.
First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the serious work that has gone into the reports.
They contain sound overviews, wise deliberations and a number of conclusions.
In this way, a serious basis has been laid for the massive support for enlargement that Parliament has confirmed today.
It can safely be said that there is huge support.
That has now become apparent in this Assembly in the last eight hours.
I should like to thank you for your commitment and support.
I should also like to answer a couple of the central questions put to me.
Up until the negotiations in Copenhagen - that is to say over the next three weeks - we face a huge task in concluding the negotiations with each of the 10 candidate countries.
The Presidency will conduct the negotiations in cooperation with the Commission and with complete respect for the EU rules on expenditure ceilings set in Berlin and for the conclusions adopted in Brussels.
That was what the General Affairs Council recommended to the Presidency at the meeting yesterday.
The Presidency will make active efforts on this basis and do its utmost to find compromises that are acceptable to both the new and the existing Member States.
A great willingness to compromise is required, however, together with great understanding of the other party's needs and points of view.
On the subject of the negotiating situation, it can be said that of course negotiations can take place and of course flexibility can be shown, but I think that everyone in this Chamber agrees that EU law must be respected.
The expenditure ceilings set in Berlin must be respected and the decisions taken in Brussels concerning, for example, agricultural expenditure must be respected.
Nonetheless, there is a certain room for manoeuvre, as Commissioner Verheugen too has pointed out.
To Mr Bonde, Mr Modrow and quite a few others, I should like to emphasise what Mr Rasmussen also said just before lunch, to the effect that there is no question of the fifteen Member States now going on to write a new treaty to which the 10 new countries then agree, without having had any influence on it.
Yesterday's meeting of ministers again confirmed what is stated in paragraph 23 of the Treaty of Nice, to the effect that the new countries will participate in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference with fully equal rights and with speaking and voting rights that are on a fully equal footing with those of the existing Member States.
That is the way things are. Anything else would also, of course, be objectionable, unacceptable and impossible for the politicians in the new Member States to hold referendums on.
I believe it was Mrs Myller who raised the issue of the new neighbours.
Following enlargement, we shall of course have new neighbours to the east and, yesterday, at its meeting in Brussels, the General Affairs Council adopted a longer term strategy for dealing with our new neighbours.
The Council expressed the desire to formulate an ambitious, long-term and integrated strategy in relation to each of these new neighbouring countries with a view to promoting democracy and economic reforms, sustainable development and trade and for promoting stability, prosperity etc on the other side of the new EU border.
It was emphasised that account should be taken of each country's special political and economic circumstances and that the issue as a whole should be seen in the context of the current deepening of cooperation with Russia.
There was also talk of cross-border cooperation, organised crime, illegal immigration and regional cooperation between the new neighbouring countries.
I can therefore give an assurance that thought has been given to all of this.
It was decided in conclusion that the Commission and Mr Solana should be called upon to prepare more detailed proposals as soon as possible, and the decision was rounded off with words to the effect that the candidate countries would be consulted on this work.
To Mr Alavanos and others who talked about Cyprus, I would state that, as is well known, the UN Secretary-General submitted, on 11 November, a general proposal for solving the Cyprus conflict.
This is a complex and extensive proposal covering 150 pages.
The plan submitted is designed as an overall political solution to ensure that a united Cyprus is able to join the EU.
Where accession is concerned, it is the Helsinki conclusions that continue to form the basis of the EU's position.
The EU would ideally like to see the accession of a reunited island, but a solution in those terms is not a necessary prerequisite for accession.
The Council will take a decision on Cyprus's accession, taking account of all the relevant factors.
The EU also supports the UN Secretary-General's efforts and will be able to endorse an overall solution to the conflict in accordance with the principles on which the European Union is based, that is to say with a view to Cyprus's being able, as a Member State, to speak with a single voice and to guarantee the correct application of EU law.
With regard to relations with Turkey, these will be based on the European Council's decision, also taken in Helsinki.
Turkey is a candidate country that will be treated in exactly the same way as the other candidate countries.
The Commission's report stated that fulfilment of the political criterion, which is a prerequisite for embarking upon negotiations, has still not taken place. Major progress has been made, however.
The economic criteria must be fulfilled no later than upon accession to the EU.
At the Copenhagen European Council, a decision will be made concerning the next phase of Turkey's relations with the EU, and Turkey will in that way receive exactly the same treatment as all the other candidate countries have received.
Last of all, I want to say to Mr Maaten and Mr Arvidsson that we all recognise that enlargement from 15 to 25, and subsequently to 27 or perhaps 28, Member States requires a new treaty.
Otherwise, we shall have problems. That is, of course, why the Convention is sitting and why we must have an intergovernmental conference.
It goes without saying that we are obliged to take decisions at that intergovernmental conference.
From everything I have heard, however - yesterday, too, from the Member States and the new Member States - there is an awareness of the fact that decisions must be taken so as to prevent the bottlenecks Mr Maaten talked about or, in other words, problems involving the inability to take decisions.
Mr Arvidsson is, of course, quite right that a Union with so many Member States must also concentrate on the essential issues and not spread itself too thin, for the system could become very complicated if the proximity principle and the principle of subsidiarity were not borne in mind.
With these words, Mr President, I want to express my sincere thanks for this debate of eight and a half hours which signals massive support for the great project we have under way.
We have reason to be proud of this support, and I take the liberty of saying 'we' for I was involved in starting up the project when I was still an MEP.
Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
You are right to stress the fact that it is one of the longest debates that we have ever had in Parliament.
This reflects the scale of the task which lies before us.
To wind up this debate, I shall give the floor to Mr Verheugen, who will speak on behalf of the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Council Presidency has answered all your questions so precisely, I can allow myself to be very brief.
I think this debate has been very helpful.
It has contributed to the dynamism we need in order, with the wind behind us, to reach our objective in Copenhagen.
It has also given clear pointers as to what still requires attention in the negotiations that lie ahead, and we shall endeavour to bring the pointers that have emerged from this debate into the talks.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 7.20 p.m.)
Commission annual legislative and work programme for 2003
The next item is the Commission statement on the annual legislative and work programme for 2003.
I should like to thank Minister Haarder for being here.
This is the first time that the Council has actually been present for the presentation of the legislative programme.
Mr President of Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, you told us, Mr Prodi, that we would inaugurate a new method which would allow the three institutions, in drawing up the Commission legislative and work programme for 2003, to work more closely together.
We would like to emphasise the importance of this new method.
For the first time, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have engaged in a constructive dialogue to establish a legislative programme.
We are particularly in favour of this cooperation and especially of increasing initial discussions between Parliament and the Commission.
Although this dialogue did indeed take place last spring, however, it was difficult to differentiate between this specific legislative planning exercise and what are known as regular meetings which take place throughout the year between parliamentary committees and commissioners in their respective fields of competence.
In future we will probably need greater preparation and a better structure for this dialogue and, in particular, each Commissioner will probably have to present initial guidelines for each specific legislative field.
The single document 'Annual Policy Strategy for 2003' presented by the Commission in February proved insufficient, and this situation could -appear harmful, as 2003 is a particularly important year due to enlargement.
I did note, however, Mr President, that you would like the Commission to present monthly reports to Parliament.
Having said this, we welcome the three political priorities set by the Commission and we would like to make the following comments:
On the first point, entitled 'An enlarged Europe', our primary concern is to ensure that the Community acquis is properly applied throughout the enlarged Union.
It is therefore crucial for a codified version of Community law to be available in all the languages of the new Member States.
Successful enlargement means including the environmental aspect and the objective of public health and consumer protection in all the other policies, as well as taking account - as you said yourself - of human resources, and it also means being innovative.
Lastly, it means monitoring the application of Community legislation, and we will need to help the future Member States to establish suitable structures as swiftly as possible.
With regard to the second point, entitled 'Stability and security', the terrorist threat hangs over the Union.
We therefore welcome the measures proposed in order to combat this scourge.
Combating terrorism is one factor in a broader objective, that of ensuring that the Union is safe and secure.
We also welcome the Commission's commitment to move forward in creating an area of freedom, security and justice, within which the rights of the individual will be protected, whether in terms of civil protection, food and industrial safety, transport, energy or land use planning, in order to take into consideration all the factors affecting public health and the environment.
With regard, more particularly, to establishing a European Public Prosecutor, we believe it is appropriate to await the Convention's conclusions on the subject before taking any initiatives.
Ensuring stability and security within the Union also means defining and setting up an integrated border-control system and taking coordinated practical action to combat illegal immigration.
We would also ask the Commission to present proposals in the near future on asylum and immigration policy that clearly distinguish between asylum seekers, those requesting international protection and migrant workers.
On this subject, our group is still concerned about what we perceive as a lack of resolve within the Council.
It is also important to monitor the actions of the European Union and the Member States regularly with regard to the International Criminal Court.
On the third point, entitled 'Sustainable and inclusive economy', if we want to prevent the deterioration in the economic environment from having a negative impact on employment, it would be desirable for the Commission to be able to inform us of proposals for a more flexible working market, which is essential for increasing employment opportunities.
We appreciate the Commission's firm stance over the Stability and Growth Pact, but, on the other hand, we consider it lacking in other areas.
It is regrettable that the Commission programme makes no mention of the fiscal package and that no progress has been made in the field of VAT with regard to the principle of country of origin.
In particular, we would invite the Commission to go further in considering the harmonisation of the basis for taxation, wherever this is necessary for the proper functioning of the single market, while not proposing a measure aimed solely at harmonising rates.
The European Union's fiscal policy must, in all cases, be aimed at reducing general taxation and lowering administrative costs.
Economic development is also achieved through strengthening infrastructures, in particular in the field of transport.
We would also, following the ruling of the Court of Justice of 5 November 2002, which found eight Member States guilty of concluding 'open sky' agreements with the United States, call for the European Commission to present a communication on drawing up future bilateral agreements in the field of air transport as swiftly as possible.
With regard to the Union's foreign policy, we would ask the Commission to publish a Green Paper on the new borders of the enlarged European Union, supplemented by ideas on relations with the new neighbouring States and the various partners.
It is regrettable that the Commission legislative programme makes no reference to either the creation of a Euromed free trade area, or the creation of a Euromed parliamentary assembly.
Within the context of post-Doha discussions, we would ask the Commission how it hopes to be able to integrate the commitment of Europe, no longer of fifteen, but of twenty-five States.
Lastly, trans-Atlantic dialogue must be strengthened in a spirit of sustainable and inclusive development and must of course make good the Kyoto commitments.
We are pleased that the proposal puts forward seven strategies as indicated in the Sixth Environment Action Programme, as well as proposals concerning integrated product policy and a new chemicals strategy.
In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is important to begin to reform employee status, make OLAF more independent and publish declarations of the financial interests of commissioners and directors-general on the Internet.
I am sure, Mr President, that in this way we will be able to avoid an exponential increase in measures, duplicated criteria as well as- and I shall end here - excessive transposition work, in order to ensure the best possible future for the enlargement of the Union.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting increasingly close to what we asked for at the beginning of the legislature, that is, an annual political programme presented to Parliament with the participation of the Council - and I hope that Minister Haarder's presence here is not superfluous and that he can also participate by responding to our comments, in line with visibility, transparency and democratic control.
In this context, Mr President, please allow me to refer to a phrase that is in the programme - and which I believe is an error by the 'hack' who wrote it - which states that the programme provides the Commission's input to the Council's annual working programme.
Could the President of the Commission clarify for us what this sentence means?
Because what we believe is that Parliament is not taken into account and the Commission is reduced to the role of secretariat of the Council, and we disagree entirely with this kind of approach.
I am going to focus on the three great priorities mentioned by the President and I will leave it to other Members to deal with specific aspects.
With regard to enlargement, we spoke about this yesterday.
Within the Community acquis, we attach great importance to the strengthening of the social dimension in the candidate countries, except in relation to the areas in which we believe the Commission should make more effort.
And, apart from holding discussions - the final phase of the negotiations is yet to take place - there are certain issues which we should remember.
For example, we are struck by the fact that in the report of the Court of Auditors this year it says that in the SAPAR pre-accession programme, only one million euros has been spent, which is 0.1%.
We are always discussing quantities, but we must look at how they are spent and invested.
We must debate this issue not only with the Commission, but also with our friends and, I hope very soon, neighbours, in the candidate countries.
Secondly, with regard to the economic issue, which is absolutely central, we can see that the spirit of Lisbon and Gothenburg are still alive within the Commission.
However, we must recognise that recent events have demonstrated that we are not playing a central role in terms of economic growth and, above all, there is a concern that economic governance is not being strengthened - and we will have to see what is happening in the Convention's working group.
In the long term, a monetary union which is not consolidated by an economic union and a political union is not viable; history has taught us this and we must take it very much into account in order to move forward.
A final point on the economic and social priorities.
As well as sustainable development, you, in relation to the framework directive on services of general interest, which was agreed in Barcelona, are proposing a Green Paper.
We prefer a framework directive.
With regard to stability and security, apart from the priority of terrorism, which is absolutely universal, the Swedish Presidency proposed a consideration of the demographic future of Europe.
This should be linked to the issue of immigration.
We welcome the fact - and in particular I am referring to the Members on the Right of the House - that you defend the role of legal immigration in relation to our welfare societies and our demographic future, but, in any event - and I am addressing the Council - I believe it would be very positive if there were a more active approach.
With regard to the debate on the borders of Europe, you have spoken of the spirit and soul - I believe in lay terms - for all Europeans.
Our former colleague, Mrs Palacio, Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that Europe is not a Christian club.
I welcome this comment, which I believe is absolutely correct.
In any event - also in relation to the Convention - it is important that we find formulae for qualified association.
Please allow me to comment on the elements missing from the programme.
The status of political parties is not included as a priority.
Now that the Treaty of Nice has been approved, it is essential to make rapid progress in this regard in order to consolidate a fundamental element of European democracy.
The Commission had already made a transitional proposal, even beforehand.
Secondly, we are going to vote on a resolution - I believe with a large majority in this House - relating to freedom of expression and media concentration.
In this regard, we would welcome a more dynamic attitude on the part of the Commission.
Finally, and I will end here, Mr President, there is an issue which worries us very much: the agreements of the General Affairs Council last Monday.
We have noted, from what we have been told and from leaks, that the President of the Commission is concerned to find a final date for the mandate of this Commission.
I always thought that you would be a Commission that would be operational from the day of the elections.
In any event, this is a constitutional issue.
We are opposed to the General Affairs Council, without having debated the issue with Parliament and without you having presented it, taking a unilateral decision containing many elements which clearly clash with the Treaties.
We therefore ask - and I address this to you, Mr President, so that it may be communicated to the President of Parliament - that the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on this important issue be raised by the President in Copenhagen and I would like to hear an explanation today by both the President of the Commission and the Council.
Mr President, the ELDR Group has always been quite critical in the past of the somewhat incoherent and arbitrary nature of previous annual programmes.
We have always looked for two things in this programme: firstly, a clear idea of the political direction reflected in the strategic choices taken by the European Commission, and secondly, a political debate between the institutions themselves. There has certainly been some progress on those two counts this year, compared to previous years.
We wish to thank the Commission for keeping to the format and timetable of the new arrangements and certainly thank the college for being present in such great numbers here today.
However, as President Prodi himself said, there is still some room for improvement.
The ELDR Group would like to highlight three areas where we feel there should be further improvement.
The European Commission aspires to be an EU government of sorts.
Good governments make strategic choices.
They set political priorities.
That importantly means they explain what they are not going to do as well as what they are going to do.
The concern we have is that, even in this improved document, the three priorities are so broad and open-ended that they do not really represent any meaningful political choice.
This is reflected in the annexes.
The annex covering the actions undertaken under the three priorities run to around 40 pages.
More worryingly, the annex covering the issues which fall outside the priorities runs to 50 pages.
In other words, we are faced with the prospect that the majority of the initiatives undertaken on the basis of this annual programme next year will actually fall outside the political orientation set in the annual programme altogether.
That is simply not the way to proceed.
Once again this resorts to a sort of laundry list approach to legislative initiative and we as a group would like to see a much greater display of choice and political orientation as regards what the European Commission proposes to do from one year to the next.
The second point is the level of detail provided for each proposed legislative action.
This has certainly improved compared with previous years but that was not difficult.
It is still not sufficient and I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that in the Convention there are proposals being floated to involve national parliaments in this debate in future.
This annex is almost incomprehensible to MEPs so it would be utterly incomprehensible to MPs in national parliaments.
It needs to be explained in clear, cogent, simple prose so that it is comprehensible to people living in the world that exists outside the institutions.
Finally, the third point is our strong support for the Commission's stated intention of applying impact assessments to a number of pilot initiatives. We feel impact assessments are absolutely indispensable to improve the quality of European legislation but we would like to take it a step further in two important respects.
Firstly, we do not feel that in the long run the Commission can be judge and jury on its own impact assessments - assessing its own draft proposals.
We feel this should be done independently.
Secondly, there is little point in the Commission conducting its impact assessments if parliamentary and Council amendments then escape impact assessments altogether.
Therefore we would like to see an interinstitutional approach which applies impact assessments at all points of the legislative cycle.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the three political priorities of your programme can only be assessed in light of the challenges faced by the European Union.
It should, however, and I shall say this from the start, be noted that the ultra-liberal criteria that continue to affect European integration prevent us from rising to meet these challenges.
The Commission thus proposes, and I quote, to 're-engage citizens in the European project'.
I will believe that when I see it!
The abyss is in fact deepening between European integration as it is and the peoples' expectations, as expressed in particular at the European Social Forum in Florence, where hundreds of thousands of people were united in a powerful anti-war, pro-peace demonstration.
The Union, however, continues to implement a security and defence policy based on the military option and alliance with NATO, instead of working towards conflict prevention.
Numerous discussions, debates and demonstrations in Florence called for public services to be safeguarded, so that water, health and education might become common assets.
A petition against liberalising services under the WTO, within the framework of the GATS has already been signed by 127 European and national MPs.
The Commission, on the other hand, in accordance with the Barcelona and Lisbon European Councils, is pursuing and speeding up the liberalisation and deregulation process leading to privatisation in the energy, transport, postal and other sectors. It is maintaining the restrictions on public spending under the Stability and Growth Pact, even though it has been recognised at the highest level that the Pact is not as intangible as it seems.
After Florence, French rail workers will take to the streets again on 26 November.
In Florence, young people declared themselves in favour of a fraternal, inclusive Europe that is open to the world.
The Commission programme makes fortress Europe even more impenetrable.
This effective border control, however, is entirely illusory and distances us further from the inclusive Europe you spoke of yesterday morning, Mr Prodi.
Common asylum and immigration policies must not be dependent on combating terrorism, an approach that would consider anything foreign to be potentially dangerous and criminalise all migrants or would view them as nothing more than economic resource.
On the other hand, the road to equal rights could lead to a safe, inclusive European Union.
By equal rights, I mean economic, social and political rights equally: granting foreign residents the right to vote as of the next European elections in 2004, as Commissioner Vitorino advocated before one of the Convention's working groups, would send a strong signal in this regard for a generous, fraternal Europe that is open to the world.
There is certainly an urgent need to define the future of Europe, but I do not believe we should define it in the same way as the Commission's design and project.
Must we confine ourselves to the Convention's limited ideas concerning the institutions and rhetoric on the social dimension, must we place our trust fully in the Convention, as you said, Mr Prodi? It is not enough simply to announce that citizens are to be involved.
We need to respond to their needs and hopes and fully recognise their rights, with regard to work, health, housing, education and culture, and in order to do so, we must certainly go back to the drawing board and rethink the most basic principles of the Maastricht Treaty, as it imposes a dogma of competition and a free market. We must challenge the Stability and Growth Pact and take account of the new criteria of growth, employment and training and review the responsibilities of the European Central Bank.
The ruling on liberalisation and deregulation must be promulgated, public services must be recognised in the Treaty, and not only as a derogation to competition.
Lastly, Mr Prodi, you spoke of the great hopes that exist in the South.
I share this ambition for the European Union to play a new role in the world, to prevent conflicts, to encourage peace and genuine security.
The Union should play a part in international negotiations, in particular within the WTO, and espouse concerns over genuine development in the poorest countries.
In this regard, confining ourselves to the limited Monterrey commitments or the HIPC initiative is feeble, when what we should be doing instead is cancelling all the debts of the Southern countries.
Lastly, although the Commission has stated its ambition to play a part in resolving the Middle East conflict, I would like to see more political initiatives being taken instead of just words, particularly in the spirit of Mr Patten's regular position statements.
Mr President, President Prodi has described three fundamental points of the programme and, in general, I support the overall line taken.
As representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I do, however, feel that we should be basing our assessment of this legislative programme on the agenda for sustainable development, outside as well as within the European Union.
I am afraid to say, President Prodi, that your programme is rather vague on this point, not to say slightly rhetorical.
We hope that, this time, the Commission's report on sustainable development, due to be presented at the Spring Summit, will not arrive at the last minute. Equally, we hope that, as part of the follow up to Johannesburg, it might be possible to publish the annual report on the partnership initiatives on water and energy which, as you are aware, are part of what are known as the type two agreements concluded at Johannesburg, in due time.
The legislative programme mentions the importance of the success of the CancÃºn meeting.
However, we feel that the European Parliament must be involved in the debate on what the Commission is going to do and say in CancÃºn.
We really do not want a repeat of the absolutely disgraceful situation at Johannesburg, where we were faced with a fait accompli, an agreement already concluded between the Commission - or perhaps the Commissioner responsible, for that mystery has yet to be cleared up - and the United States, that WTO rules should take precedence over international agreements in environmental matters.
This venture was partly foiled at Johannesburg, but we genuinely fear that something similar might happen at CancÃºn, without any public debate and going completely against the endeavours the Commission itself is making in the area of the environment.
As regards the external dimension of sustainable development, I would also point out that, although it is true that impact and sustainability assessments are now necessary for all international agreements - and this is a positive innovation which we very much welcome and with which we are very satisfied - it is also true that it is difficult to realise this undertaking, not least because of a certain lack of resources, as is shown by the work carried out on the agreement with Chile, work which was, I regret to say, inaccurate and rushed.
We are looking forward with great interest, Mr President, to the Commission's Green Paper on services of general interest, and it is our genuine hope that it will be possible to discuss it here in Parliament too, Chairman BarÃ³n Crespo.
Moreover, we hope that it will be possible to produce a directive on the matter as well, not least in that we fear that there might be some inconsistency - as I said just now - between what the Commission says and does in the Union and what it then proceeds to negotiate at international level, particularly within the WTO, which is now extremely powerful.
In addition, in this International Year of Mountains, President Prodi, knowing your passion for mountains, we would like to know what measures the Commission intends to adopt for the practical implementation of the Alps Convention, particularly the protocol on transport.
Another environmental issue which we feel needs attention but which I am afraid is no longer part of the programme is PVC, a material which is recognised to be highly dangerous by at least five Commission ongoing studies.
We were expecting a communication before the end of the summer but it appears that, after Commissioner Liikanen announced his position, all the work was stopped.
I am citing this example, although it may seem a minor issue, because, although it is true that we are working constructively to improve the legislative programme, it is also true that our discussions do not serve much purpose if we then lose sight of major legislative proposals, firmly supported by Parliament, which appear as part of the programme for years and then suddenly disappear.
I will end, Mr President, by expressing our deep concern at the influence of industrial lobbies on the Commission's choice of legislative instrument, which may even not be a proper legislative instrument, and I would also point out that this issue is a very specific part of the interinstitutional agreement which, together with other Members of Parliament, we are trying to conclude before the Copenhagen European Council.
Mr President, President of the Commission, I would like to start by apologising to President Prodi for the improvised nature of this speech, which will be a series of brief reflections on what I have read or heard.
Clearly, over and above the indications given in the work programme for 2003, we cannot expect the Commission to do everything immediately and, ideally, properly, in the space of just one year, but it is right that guidelines should be laid down, as has been done. I feel that, at least in general terms, these guidelines are sufficiently acceptable.
I listened to your speech, President Prodi, and I very much appreciated some of the points which you stressed with your usual enthusiasm, particularly the social considerations, which are very relevant at a time when we are discussing security, solidarity and measures which could even include a new direction for the world of work.
Therefore, if I may, I would like to call upon the Commission and the Community institutions in general to reflect either formally or informally on a number of policies which I believe are of vital importance for the future of Europe, particularly for the future of an enlarged Europe which is genuinely united as regards its fundamental principles.
Well then, yesterday, we held lengthy formal and informal discussions with many members of parliaments whose countries are aspiring, if I may use that expression, to become a full members of Europe, and, together, we discussed our desire to work towards achieving a Europe which is genuinely, essentially and, ideally, politically united.
However, in order to be politically united and cohesive, Europe needs to address issues of momentous historical importance transparently.
Mr President, I believe we need to reflect very deeply on the issue of immigration.
There can never be enough discussion of the subject of legal immigration, just as there can never be enough discussion on the integration of immigrants.
I often reflect - and I still do not know the answer - on the problem of integrating immigrants into society, and I sometimes wonder whether integration is not another, new form of oppression of cultures which are different from ours and should therefore be fully respected.
One of the speakers mentioned the subject of an interesting debate just now, which took place both in Florence and in my own town, Lecce, a town where we have to have no fear of dialogue or the presence of people who do not think in the same way as we do.
Here, too, we must listen to what is being said about globalisation, about new forms of poverty which genuinely exist, on north and south, east and west.
We must reflect still more - I reiterate - on the way we may, to some extent, be oppressing immigrant or emigrant peoples which, I imagine, would like to return to their homelands and regain their identities and their cultural roots, but which certainly do not want to go back to economic poverty.
Therefore, if we have to take economic measures, it is essential that we ensure that these do not lead to the oppression of cultures.
With regard to this, therefore, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission to the issues of immigration and employment, in order to avoid employment, rather than being a uniting factor, becoming grounds for fresh dispute between the immigrants in our States and those who need to convert their business activities.
Consider the industrial crisis in our country, President Prodi, and the resulting need to retrain the work force through substantial, genuinely incisive, large-scale training measures.
Training is also something which depends on culture, and it must be promoted if it is true that Europe wants to continue to grow, as you maintain.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Dutch delegation in the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities.
The European Commission's three main priorities are a logical choice for its work programme for 2003.
Preparation for enlargement is a top priority that is rightly seen by the European Commission as an exercise in managing the diversity of cultures, administrative traditions and economic structures.
Likewise stability and security as a second priority receive my unqualified support.
Fighting terrorism, management of the new external borders and control of illegal immigration are very important for both the current and the enlarged Union.
Now however I should like to take a closer look at the third priority: sustainable development.
While I am of course pleased that sustainable development remains a priority for the European Commission, there is more to it than that.
It is solemnly promised that special attention will be paid to the impact of new legislation on the environment.
In Annex 2 however I see that the main focus of attention is on completion of the internal market.
I am of course curious about the announcement of the inclusion of the environment in EU legislation.
I am also concerned about the status of this document. There is a great danger that it will again end up as a discussion document, resulting in fine words and intentions but not meaning anything concrete in terms of legislation.
There is certainly plenty of scope for improvement in the energy and transport fields.
I do not in fact see many initiatives in the area of environmental legislation.
Perhaps this is not injudicious in the light of the problems with the implementation and enforcement of existing environmental legislation.
It may also well be that over the next few years we shall no longer be able to develop more far-reaching legislation in a Union of 25 members.
I have often pressed for a proposal to review the Batteries Directive.
I know that work on this review has been going on for years, but reaching agreement internally is impossible.
It is high time that the proposed amendment was sent to Parliament and the Council.
I should like to hold you to the promise of March 2003.
Mr President, the Commission work programme for 2003 is better presented than in the past.
It is clearly based around important priorities and that is a point in its favour.
The form, however, is still highly ambiguous.
We are told that this programme will contribute to the Council's annual operational programme for 2003, which the Council is due to subsequently adopt in December.
But what is the exact status of the Commission's contribution?
Should the Council accept it as it is or does it have the right to amend it to introduce new priorities?
Only the latter hypothesis is coherent with the hierarchy of the institutions.
Naturally, we have no doubt that, in practice, dialogue within the institutional triangle will make it possible to iron out this problem.
It nonetheless raises an important matter of principle.
The first priority of the Commission programme is essentially to prepare for enlargement.
We cannot fail to be impressed, when reading the actions to be taken in this regard, by their sheer number, which shows the scale of the Community acquis to be implemented by the candidate countries.
Having listened to the representatives of these countries yesterday, having heard their reactions, we can clearly see that these countries are keen to enter the Union.
They want to become part of the European family and are ready to make a great deal of effort to accomplish that.
We must not, however, exhaust them with excess legislation and authority.
We must have the wisdom to let them work at their own pace and accept variable geometry to a greater extent.
The programme's second priority is entitled 'Stability and security' and this presents in particular measures relating to immigration.
Having read the list of key initiatives several times, I must say that I did find the initiative concerning integration of legal immigrants, but I am still looking for the initiative that was supposed to cover repatriation of illegal immigrants.
If it is there, it is well hidden.
This quite simply shows that the Commission still has a long way to go before realising the scale of the problem we are facing today.
On the other hand, in conclusion, we would like to convey our compliments on the paragraph entitled 'Relations with the enlarged EU's neighbours', which Mr Prodi emphasised earlier.
These relations must indeed be redefined and in this respect the Euro-Mediterranean partnership could lead to the creation of a new community, which, it must be said, would be separate from the current one.
It would be more natural for Turkey to be a part of that community rather than be part of the European Union itself.
Mr Prodi has to leave early to return to Brussels because of the weather.
Therefore we shall take Mr Prodi's response to the contributions now.
I understand Mrs Palacio is going to field the questions during the catch-the-eye session.
Mr President, it is not so much a question of time, rather that I have an appointment with Mr Erdogan in Brussels, which, as things stand, seems appropriate, given that the winner of the Turkish elections is visiting Brussels.
I am going to meet him this afternoon, and I feel this is important precisely because I believe that we need powerful, direct dialogue on these matters.
Indeed, the issues on the table are the most far-reaching, most fundamental matters, and I therefore feel it is appropriate to analyse them in some depth, as I am going to do in Brussels this afternoon, as I said.
Now, however, I want to respond to the first criticisms. I will then leave my colleagues from the Commission the task of developing the themes and exploring them in more detail.
Indeed, there are a number of issues which are absolutely essential for our future action.
Mrs GrossetÃªte mentioned our plans for the Mediterranean.
I fully agree with her.
I myself have on many occasions found myself in an awkward situation because of the way all the leaders of the Mediterranean countries criticise the Commission directly, accusing us of favouring Eastern Europe over them.
My response has been simple: the demands of history have led us to take that road, but it is our intention, firstly, to strengthen the Barcelona policy, with whose development we are still encountering major problems, and secondly, to define the new policy which I have outlined - the ring of friends sharing everything except institutions with the Union - which, this is the point, I hope the Greek and Italian Presidencies will help to boost next year, given that we are going to have two consecutive Mediterranean presidencies in the same year.
I have already discussed these matters and the Commission's desire to fulfil its responsibilities in this area with the Greeks, and I will discuss them with the Italians subsequently too, for I feel that this is an extremely important issue.
Moreover, I call upon Parliament as of now to strengthen our joint action in the field of the Mediterranean.
To return to the subject of our working methods, this is the age-old question of interinstitutional cooperation.
It is a wide-ranging issue with major political implications, on which, however, there are a whole series of operational decisions to be taken, for we cannot limit ourselves to making declarations of principle.
The Mediterranean policy will require us to take decisions affecting the budget and our whole way of working.
I therefore feel that, as far as this matter is concerned, it is imperative that we focus primarily on interinstitutional programming.
Once again, Mrs GrossetÃªte mentioned the need for each Commissioner to present a preliminary report to the Parliamentary committee concerned.
I have no objection to this.
Indeed, it could be useful, precisely because this is a new process which we need to improve.
We will assess this proposal and I am sure we will take on board the sense of it.
The only thing I want to avoid is the danger of fragmentation.
There are a number of points at which, despite the need for in-depth analysis, we need to focus on the overall picture, specifically at the stage of the preliminary proposal at the beginning of the process and again when the final decision is taken at the end of the process.
I would like these two stages to remain plenary debates.
Clearly, there will be times during the debate when technical, specific points need to be discussed - we have no objection to that - but the beginning and end of the debate are a matter for all of us, not just some of us.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, first of all, the proposal on the Commission's programme is usually determined by the relationship between the Commission and Parliament, which is extremely delicate.
I would point out that the Commission's programme for 2003 focuses on new initiatives whereas the Council's programme, with very few exceptions, deals with initiatives which have already been presented by the Commission but which have not been adopted.
In this sense, it is on our relationship with the Council that we need to focus, for we now have a backlog of issues which Parliament has already dealt with.
Of course, the Commission fully supports the European Parliament - we have been consistent in our support - ensuring that the Council involves Parliament on all the points of its programme.
Moreover, the Commission defines the political priorities for the Council, and it has already presented them to the General Affairs Council of 18 November.
In this regard, we should have a close relationship with the Greek Presidency too.
As regards the point raised by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo concerning the political parties' statute, we will present the new proposal as soon as it enters into force.
We are in full agreement with you as regards its importance, but we are just waiting for the right moment to present the proposal, which must be discussed by everybody together.
As regards the interinstitutional resolutions for 2004, I feel that what Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said is extremely important, and I fully agree with him.
The Commission has constantly drawn the presidency's attention to the need to find solutions which will not upset the smooth functioning of the institutions.
An agreement with Parliament is clearly necessary.
When it became clear that there was a sort of legislative traffic jam, the Commission immediately made it clear that there needs to be coordination between Parliament's rhythm of work and the rhythm of work of the Commission.
We immediately stressed that the new Parliament must work in tandem with the new Commission right from the start.
As I see it, these decisions are highly necessary, but we are short of time because solutions have to be found before Copenhagen.
I think we could discuss this proposal at the interinstitutional summit at the end of November/beginning of December with a view precisely to achieving an agreement before Copenhagen.
I must stress the vital importance of this matter because what we have to avoid is a scenario in which we have the new Parliament, a Commission that will only be in office for three months and then a new Commission, with all the organs changing and, as a result, a complete breakdown in some areas of the system.
We are extremely concerned about this.
I fully share Mrs Frassoni's concerns regarding sustainable development, about which Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m is going to speak later on. Commissioner Nielson is going to talk about Johannesburg and Vice-President de Palacio is going to talk about transport.
I would point out that our position at Johannesburg was very strong but also very uncomfortable.
I am not ashamed to say that the countries of the Developing World, the African countries particularly in this case - indeed, Africa is the real major problem - are tending to make less and less of a distinction between Europe, the United States and other countries.
This is something which should concern us all.
Despite the fact that, in recent years, we have been acting in a genuinely responsible manner - consider Kyoto, the Everything but Arms initiative, incisive decisions opening up our markets unilaterally, incisive decisions regarding the Kyoto Protocol, incisive decisions on many aspects of development aid, for example in Monterrey, where it was we who obtained the minimum that could be obtained as regards foreign aid, even though it really was an absolute minimum - we must not be surprised if the developing world reacts by lumping us all together without distinction.
This is a matter of great concern which requires very thorough analysis on our part.
This is the way we must approach the issue.
A further concern, expressed by Mrs Boudjenah, relates to the interpretation of peace and development issues overall, as a matter for general concern.
I agree - as I said before - with this too.
As regards matters such as the pluralism of the world and multilateralism, it is even more important that we adopt a role of absolute leadership because there is no one else who can keep these debates open, and we know how valuable they are at this time.
It must also be said, quite frankly, that these are debates which can be kept open in a credible manner if there is a financial commitment, and that is very difficult to fulfil at this time.
I therefore believe that we genuinely ought to open an in-depth political debate on this because, clearly, if we do not engage sufficient resources, we will be merely moralising to these countries rather than capable of changing the situation in the world.
I would stress: we have done a great deal and we have played an exemplary role. We must continue to do so but we must improve both the quality and quantity of our efforts.
This brings me to the last part of Mrs Poli Bortone's speech, which concerned immigration.
It is true that we need to focus on legal as well as illegal immigration, it is true that the issue of integrating immigrants is something that needs to be discussed, but, first and foremost, there is the major issue to be resolved of whether or not integration is taking place.
I have to say, however, that, for the most part, the immigrants who come to Europe are increasingly stable, increasingly willing to become integrated into the societies of our European countries, wherever they come from, and they become integrated more easily and to a greater degree in some cases than in others.
I do, in any case, believe that, for the sake of the future cohesion of our societies, we must make a huge effort to facilitate integration as a priority.
I would stress that it is an issue whose facets and characteristics vary greatly according to the country of origin and reception, but the risk of our societies becoming fragmented is a risk we cannot take.
It has been a very powerful personal experience for me to visit different communities of Italian immigrants in Germany and Belgium over the years.
Wherever I have seen that total integration has taken place, I have realised that this was the only way for them to live happy, serene lives on an equal footing with their fellow citizens.
Total integration is, in my opinion, a major objective for an open society, and it must take place in full respect for all cultures, in full respect for diversities, with a view to achieving societies which are not afflicted by conflict or tensions.
Clearly, this means that we need an immigration policy which is much more complex and much more cohesive than that we have been working on hitherto.
We now move on to the catch-the-eye procedure.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, which I have the honour of chairing, welcomes the Commission's initiative to introduce a more compact and integrated political planning procedure.
The Committee on Women's Rights had an opportunity for constructive dialogue with two Commissioners, Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou and Mr Antonio Vitorino. We had a most productive discussion, during which our opinions and positions converged on numerous points.
In the light of that positive experience, I was surprised - and I wondered why - I was unable to find a single word on gender equality in the Commission programme for 2003.
Mrs Diamantopoulou assured us at a meeting with our committee at the beginning of October that gender equality policy was a Commission priority and we have heard nothing to make us think otherwise.
As you know, the Committee on Women's Rights has the exclusive privilege of being invited once a year to a one-day meeting with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and ten Commissioners, in order to discuss the specific issue of gender equality.
2003 is an important year for the Committee on Women's Rights.
The top priority is the Convention on the future of Europe and we have invested a great deal of time and effort in order to ensure that the new Treaty promotes gender equality.
Secondly, we need the acquis communautaire on women to be applied, not just adopted by the candidate countries. ?hirdly, there is the question of gender mainstreaming and, of course, we still have a great deal to do to put our own house in order here.
In all events, I welcome the initiative to put the Commission's annual progress report on sexual equality on the agenda for the spring summit under the Greek presidency.
Another important priority is to ensure there is a balanced representation of the sexes at the 2004 European Parliament elections.
The European Parliament and the Commission should set a standard for the other institutions.
Finally, I am worried and concerned about the fact that the proposal for a new directive on combating sexual discrimination on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty keeps being postponed.
Have we any news on this?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, equal opportunities for women is a constant and permanent priority within Community action.
I do not know whether the chairman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities believes that they are not sufficiently covered in the texts.
It is possible, but I would like to say that they are present as a matter of course, because it is our obligation and that is what we all want.
With regard to some of your ideas on the question of mathematical equality in women's representation in the different bodies, I would like to say clearly that this does not appear in our programme.
In this respect, I would remind the chairman - who furthermore is Greek - of the famous myth of Procrustes.
Mr President, I would first like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for creating the right framework for the future of Basle II.
However, at the same time I would like to ask Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin what they are doing under their portfolios to ensure that Basle II is implemented without damaging the economy.
Basle II is about the creditworthiness of companies, of small and medium-sized enterprises, and about the guarantees and transparency this requires.
I believe that if we do not take precautions in good time here, we will end up with a huge problem involving ever more bankruptcies and enormous unemployment.
I would like to address my second question to Commissioner Lamy.
Mr Prodi mentioned that we want to drive forward the political democratisation of the WTO.
To what extent has provision been made in the Commission's work programme for making progress with the parliamentary assembly?
As there are a lot of requests for the floor, in order to speed things up we will hear from the Commission at the very end rather than after every contribution.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in 2003, the Commission's work programme, and even the political work of the entire Union, will be heavily dependent on the world economic environment.
For now, there is no reason to be optimistic.
According to the Commission, the indicators continue to point to an acceleration in growth at the end of 2002.
This acceleration, however, will not exceed 1%, which means, and I quote, that a rate of growth of around 3% therefore seems impossible to achieve for 2003.
The risk of a stock market crash, the impact of terrorism and the threat of war have significantly marked the world economy.
We could adopt a dogmatic stance in response to this situation, superstitiously chanting 'stability, stability'.
We could also aim for a more pragmatic economic policy by giving growth a boost.
That is what the US Government has done, injecting more than USD 100 billion into the economy in one year.
That is what the Federal Reserve has done through its policy of lowering interest rates.
For us, as socialists, stability is important.
We must fight against public debt and for a balanced budget.
The right has attacked the German Government for this, pretending to forget that right-wing governments in Portugal, Italy and in particular France, are moving ever further from the stability policy.
The socialists, however, advocate a proactive policy in favour of growth and employment, because in politics chanting has never produced results.
Now is the time to relaunch trans-European networks and use all available appropriations to foster productive investment, research and the knowledge-based economy.
It is truly scandalous to see that the Commission was incapable of using all the available appropriations in 2001.
Even though the Union budget is just 1% of the Community gross domestic product, 16% of these scant appropriations were unused, in other words, saved.
Mr President, I shall end by saying that the Union set itself an ambitious strategy at the Lisbon Summit, and we must provide ourselves with the means to fulfil that ambition.
Mr President, Commission, Council, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I intend sounding a somewhat negative note about the Commission's work programme and legislative proposals.
We have to establish that against the background of the Lisbon process, against the background of a growing demand for labour participation, against the background of requests for flexibility in the labour market and against the background of labour mobility in Europe, the Commission's programme, and in particular its legislative programme, is lacking in ambition as far as we are concerned, and that we think is a pity.
2003 threatens to be a lost year in this regard, certainly if we look at the legislation.
There are only three proposals that go in the right direction.
They are concerned with equal treatment, which has already been mentioned, the normal guidelines for employment and social security 140871.
They are not new legislative proposals, though; they are amendments.
We also note that delays are occurring in a number of areas or there is even the odd omission, as is the case with the European works council, which is not on the agenda for next year or perhaps only at the end of it.
There is also a lack of initiative in the fields of parental leave, the protection of women workers, the disabled and atypical work, and I could go on.
As a committee we have to note that on the legislative side the programme is not really satisfactory when it comes to the demands that are made by society and that are also socially based.
We have already spent some time discussing this in our committee and with our Commissioner.
We also believe that the problem does not lie with the Commissioner alone, but also and in particular with the Commission as such and with the Council.
We therefore ask the Council in particular to take steps on the occasion of the forthcoming mid-term review of the social agenda.
We must prepare this with the Commission and I hope that we can then make progress.
At the moment there is really no chance of this happening and we are disappointed to a certain extent.
But we live in hope and that is why we are asking that these steps be taken.
I wish you long life and good health, Vice-President Martin, long life and good health to all the Commissioners, long life and good health to all the Members of the European Parliament and long life and good health to the Council representative too, although I know that the Council - the 15 Heads of Government - is very concerned to learn that the European citizens are living longer.
I read in a wide range of newspapers this morning that a pill has been discovered that may well enable us to live to the age of 150.
While I was on my way to Parliament, I remembered what it was I had to ask the Commission.
While I have always been aware that Europe is now beginning to concern itself with pensions - and I have to say that last year's Commission rightly addressed the issue with particular enthusiasm, with, I believe, the support of the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Anna Diamantopoulou - even though the area is still the responsibility of the Member States, I have noticed that many governments, including, not least, the government governing me, Carlo Fatuzzo, too, are making statements which will lead the European citizens to believe that it is Europe which is going to cut their pensions, that it is Europe that is going to reduce their pension income, that it is Europe that is going to force them to tighten their belts.
However, it is they, the national governments, which have to take these decisions, and if they are going to be forced to cut pension payments, then they must make that clear openly, frankly and honestly to their citizens.
I would therefore ask you, Commission Vice-President, what the Commission intends to do to make the European citizens aware that Commissioner Diamantopoulou is not a fairy or a sorceress who is able to grant wealth to all the citizens but an evil ogre who is doing what the national governments tell her to.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to focus essentially on section 1 of the Commission communication.
The Commission has now achieved the major objectives established at the beginning of its term of office - enlargement and the reforms - but I feel that, in the final stage of its term of office, it must do more than just manage and implement what has already been achieved.
I feel that the paragraphs entitled 'Defining the future of Europe' and 'Relations with the enlarged EU's neighbours' are the key to the realisation that we need to start laying the foundations for the Union's future political outlook as of now.
After the accession we hope for of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, we must turn our gaze resolutely in three directions: towards Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans and the Mediterranean.
I welcome the openness displayed in the sentence '?the Stabilisation and Association process opens perspectives for membership'.
I therefore agree with what President Prodi said: we must develop a ring of friends stretching from Russia to Morocco, without excluding the possibility of them acceding to the Union under the same conditions as the other countries which have already become part of it.
This opens horizons for the future which will extend our project even beyond the geographical confines of our continent.
While we are preparing to launch the widest and, perhaps, most important enlargement of the Union, we need to be aware of these possibilities.
In any case, when Russia accedes to the Union - however far in the future - we will not be able to stipulate that only the part on this side of the Urals can do so, and that will bring great changes, particularly in the way the Union defines itself.
We must therefore see the Union as a ring of concentric circles which are interconnected.
This is the way for Europe to continue to keep its soul alive.
The day when Europe ceases to concern itself with the countries beyond its borders will be the day when it loses part of its basic raison d'Ãªtre.
Mr President, I have a few specific questions about development policy for the Commission.
You have said that we want faster spending because far too much remains unspent at the moment.
In practice however this is still not happening.
My specific question to you is: what new steps will you be taking to achieve this in your work programme for 2003?
You have also said that we must spend better, we want to move towards basic social spending such as education.
You have accepted a figure of 35%, you have reached an average of 28%.
What specific steps will you be taking to achieve this in your programme for 2003?
Thirdly, in Doha you took on the obligation to table proposals for the reduction of the agricultural subsidies and their conversion into rural subsidies before March 2003.
When can we expect these concrete proposals in the area of agriculture, as a supplement to the Fischler package?
Fourthly, you promised to bring forward a supplement to the regulation of the gap between structural aid and emergency aid.
This gap, the famous grey zone, is sometimes giving rise to one or two years' delay.
When can we expect to see this specific regulation?
Fifthly, and in conclusion, in the context of migration policy - and Mr Prodi also made reference to this - you said that there is a need to conclude new partnership agreements with developing countries.
The specific question is: what initiatives will you be presenting in this area in addition to the Cotonou Treaty that will actually do something about a regulated migration policy which - and let us start with North Africa and a number of the suppliers from the different regions - actually involves the relationship with the developing countries?
Mr President, we have the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe, but I should like to remind Mr Prodi, the Commission, and the other ladies and gentlemen here, that we also have Northern Europe and the Northern Dimension, and I would ask them to take this into consideration also.
At present we seem to have all our attention on enlargement, but we must fight tooth and nail to hold on to the Lisbon objectives.
Enlargement will place burdens on the EU economy, and that underlines the importance of having a competitive strategy to address that problem.
For this reason, we must also be able to implement some difficult reforms at the same time as enlargement.
We have to focus our attention on the applicant countries' ability to implement the Lisbon objectives.
In the old Member States too it is necessary to give attention to the implementation of EU legislation.
When enlargement takes place we shall particularly have to avoid distortions of competition due to the uneven implementation of directives, for example, in environmental and competition policy.
The liberalisation process must be speeded up substantially in the electricity, gas, telecommunications and transport sectors.
The situation at present is that consumers cannot count on economic growth.
Investment is being put off and the markets are still constrained.
Labour costs are high while at the same time there is considerable unemployment in Europe.
Faith in the Stability and Growth Pact is being shaken.
I would ask the Commission how it intends to integrate this ambitious timetable for enlargement with improved economic competitiveness in Europe.
Mr President, I have a question for Commissioner Diamantopoulou regarding the European employment process and the most practical difficulty to which it gives rise, namely the problem of implementing the policy in the Member States.
Most of the players in the labour markets across Europe know absolutely nothing about the European Employment Strategy.
The Commission is aware of this and has started to stress the importance of implementation, which I welcome wholeheartedly.
When I last heard Mrs Diamantopoulou speak to our committee, she said that there would also be further consideration of how to include the European Parliament and the national parliaments in the European employment process.
I think this sounds excellent.
My question now is whether the Commission has progressed any further on this issue and has clearer ideas in this regard.
If we look at each individual Member State, they all have some sort of national action plan for employment in as much as their parliaments have adopted budgets which establish which measures in the area of labour market policy have funding for the coming year.
As there cannot be two separate national action plans, the national action plan which is part of, and builds on, the guidelines in the European employment process must be coordinated with each parliament's politico-economic work on creating a national employment policy.
I therefore wonder why the Commission is not clearer on this point.
I know that telling Member States how to handle their decision-making processes is not an option, but making recommendations is obviously possible, not least within the framework of the open employment process.
With this now about to be introduced in the candidate countries, which have a weak administrative capacity, it is even more important to place the political responsibility for the employment process clearly on the political process and to emphasise that the national parliaments have a crucial responsibility for, and influence upon, this issue.
Mr President, the fight against terrorism has been, and must continue to be, one of our priorities, if not our main priority.
There has been much progress in this field and in the field of cooperation in criminal matters and we have demonstrated that when we have political will we can be effective.
I would like to ask whether you believe that now is the time, following this success in relation to cooperation in the criminal field, to carry out the necessary improvement in judicial standards in the European Union and the defence of individual rights.
And I am referring to the current Union and the enlarged Union.
I also believe - and I would like to hear the Commission's opinion on this - that there should be some coordination initiative in the police field which would put an end to these areas of confusion, which are so difficult to explain to the citizens.
I am referring to Europol and others.
I am less optimistic about immigration policy, however.
There is a phrase in the work programme which I find truly extraordinary: to consolidate the immigration and asylum policy.
I do not believe it is the fault of the European Commission, I am more than sure of that; but, to be frank, I think it would be very positive if we were to begin the immigration and asylum policy.
Mrs GrossetÃªte asked the Commission for more initiatives.
I would ask the Commission for fewer initiatives.
It has presented all the initiatives it should have presented.
We have a package of proposals which make up a coherent and reasonable immigration policy.
What we need to do is to begin to take decisions in this area.
I believe that we should not increase the range of proposals so that the Council can just select little bits of them, but we must demonstrate political will in order to make progress in global terms.
And finally I would like to welcome the proposal for integration policies and, above all, the idea of coordinating these polices with social policy.
If we believe that immigrants must enter Europe for employment purposes, we must be effective in both areas, we need an immigration policy which works, but also a labour market which works, a social policy which incorporates immigrants in order to respond to the local problems which immigration creates.
Mr President, maritime safety is one of the challenges included in the Commission's working programme for 2003.
Unfortunately, we are currently facing the terrible accident involving the Prestige off the coast of Galicia, which makes this working principle all the more evident.
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Commission, by means of its Vice-President, on its rapid reaction and its cooperation with the Spanish and Galician authorities in relation to this dramatic event.
I would also like to acknowledge the Commissioner for Transport and the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who have approved the Erika I and Erika II packages, which, had they already been applied, could perhaps have helped us to prevent an accident of this nature.
In this respect, I would like to point out that the Directive on the monitoring of traffic - yet to be transposed - in Article 20, lays down the definition of areas of refuge, which, although they are vague, would allow vessels with problems to reach them to try to resolve them.
We have examples such as the Erika, which was not authorised by the French authorities to enter the port of Saint Nazaire, or now the Prestige, not authorised to enter Galician ports, clearly due to the high ecological value of that coast.
There should be further proposals for the creation of areas of refuge out to sea, sufficiently close so that vessels with problems can reach them and sufficiently far from coasts to prevent serious ecological problems, but which allow for immediate naval rescue actions with technical resources, both aerial and marine.
And the measure, Madam Vice-President, if included in the Commission's programme, could be applied urgently without the need to wait for transposition of the directive.
Mr President, my questions also relate to environmental policy.
I would like to repeat the question from Mrs Frassoni on PVC and what has happened to the goals regarding PVC in this work programme, for they were included in both last year's programme and that of the previous year, but they have now disappeared.
This is exceedingly disturbing, as we are talking about an incredibly hazardous substance which we know exists in large quantities in our environment.
In terms of waste, no fewer than four million tonnes of PVC waste are produced every year.
Perhaps Commissioner Liikanen or Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m should answer the question of what has happened to the Commission's goals on the issue of PVC.
My second question relates to the structural funds, the common agricultural policy and EU-financed programmes and plans in general.
During 2003-2004, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), will enter into force in the Member States.
Unfortunately, SEA does not yet cover EU-financed plans and programmes, but the Commission has promised that this must happen, something for which Parliament has expressed its support.
I now want to know whether it is the case that the Commission has started to set up an internal organisation to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to implement this type of impact assessment for EU-financed plans and programmes.
My final question relates to Natura 2000.
We are still waiting for a communication from the Commission, which has been delayed a number of times.
Now it has been included in the programme, and I would therefore simply like to point out the importance of this communication actually being issued next year, preferably as soon as possible.
Mr President, the closure of Strasbourg Airport on Monday evening, which of course held us all up for quite some time, has prompted me to put a question to the Commission on the following subject.
It would be a good idea to have an overview of all the aircraft within European airspace, coordinated centrally: within Eurocontrol, for example.
Obviously it is the countries themselves that are responsible for national air traffic control systems, but would it not be appropriate to have a central overview of all the current and planned flights, whether they be civil or military, in order to improve utilisation of the airspace, reduce the number of delays and lessen the impact on the environment?
Mr President, while welcoming the programme presented to us today I must express some alarm that on page 12, under 'Key initiatives - sustainable and inclusive economy', the mountain has laboured and made a promise to produce a green paper on public services or services of economic interest.
I find this extraordinary.
This Parliament has repeatedly pointed out to the Commission and the Council over many years that there is an urgent need for a directive on a framework for services of general economic interest.
My understanding is that the spring summit instructed the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a framework for services of a general interest by the end of this year.
Yet what we have in this work programme for next year is the promise of a green paper to discuss the principles on which services of general economic interest might - might - be constructed.
At the same time, we have a promise on page 12 that measures to complete the internal market, by eliminating barriers to the provision and take-up of services by business and consumers, will proceed next year.
I do not find this acceptable.
This House and the spring summit have been ignored.
All the calls this House has made for universal services of general interest to the citizens of Europe to be guaranteed as a matter of urgency have been ignored, although this is a key part of European citizenship and of the social model we are so proud of in Europe.
I would like a clear answer from the Commission as to why it is failing to do what this Parliament has asked it to do and what it was instructed to do by the Council at the spring summit, because this is not acceptable.
Mr President, I have two questions.
The first is about securing our external borders.
I very much welcome the programme and proposals with regard to enlargement, and particularly the fact that you want to have uniform responsibilities.
The question is this: when do you think the new Schengen manual will be available?
We will have common training programmes.
When do you think this common training system will be operational?
What I would also like to request is that we should consider the compatibility of the technology being used and that we should also get Europol to carry out the proposed risk assessment as soon as possible.
When do you think the system will be operating?
My second question is about migration.
Our objective - and on this we agree - must be to create viable legal immigration mechanisms and prevent illegal immigration.
However, the problem that arises here relates in particular to the area of asylum, where, although the Commission has made proposals, final decisions remain to be made in all areas.
But we need decisions to be made quickly so that genuine refugees - who make up about 10% of applicants - can be helped swiftly and so that repatriation can be arranged for the remaining 90% that have to be rejected.
Commissioner Vitorino, how do you intend to ensure that a system of this kind can finally be made operational and that we can secure Council approval?
Mr President, I would like to thank those of the Commissioners who, out of respect for Parliament and the debate on the work programme, have been able to spend a couple of hours with us - once a year.
I admire Mrs de Palacio for answering questions across all areas of policy, including those of her colleagues who have other priorities.
What I have said amounts to praise for those of her colleagues who are actually here.
Mrs de Palacio, Commissioners, I have read the work programme very carefully.
It is better than what you have usually come up with.
In my areas of interest at least, it is more helpful.
You have integrated the concept of sustainability throughout, as we have always requested.
I really get the impression that you have done your homework, that you have understood the issues and that the external presentation at least has been very well done.
'External presentation' and 'internal behaviour' are, however, two very different things.
My queries relate in particular to internal behaviour.
Let us consider the leftovers, that is to say the things you are carrying forward from 2002. In my field, which is environmental policy, there are some areas that Mrs SchÃ¶rling and Mrs Frassoni and others have touched upon, such as policy on chemical products, PVC, the batteries directive, and various others.
If I consider why that is, I see that one of the main problem areas is that you cannot achieve any internal agreement.
You have conflicts between environmental, industrial and trade policy, and there is also often conflict between consumer protection and trade policy.
If you cannot resolve these internal conflicts, if you cannot manage to demonstrate leadership and say 'OK, the Commissioner responsible has power over the inter-service procedure', then we will always find ourselves with 'leftovers'.
That is why I am asking you, Mrs de Palacio, how you intend to resolve conflicts within the Commission in future, and whether you are willing to air these conflicts in a more open and transparent way.
We can only ever guess the reasons why no proposals are presented to us.
We learn them already from the grapevine and the rumour mill.
We mostly seek answers in Commissioner Liikanen's areas of responsibility, sometimes, often enough in fact, we seek them in Commissioner Lamy's areas, and sometimes in Commissioner Bolkestein's areas too.
I regard them as being the naughty boys.
I am not referring to poor Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and Commissioner Byrne, who always do their best but are sometimes pushed to one side.
I expect your internal behaviour to reflect the way you present things externally.
That means that you will also present the proposals that you have presented to us very quickly in future.
Mr President, I was hoping to address my questions to Mr Solbes, but I do not see him in the House, and so Mrs de Palacio or Mrs Diamantopoulou may answer instead.
I should first like to make a request: please do not abuse the adjective 'sustainable'.
It is rather like those awful restaurants where they put cream or parsley on everything and in the end ruin every dish.
'Sustainable economy', Mrs de Palacio and Mrs Diamantopoulou, means absolutely nothing.
It is just a nod towards the environmentalism of the Greens, towards the left with 'solidarity' and towards the right with 'economics'.
In short, a little semantic correctness would not go amiss.
Let us now deal with some rather more serious matters that I have noticed.
President Prodi has spoken of a single cycle of economic policy coordination - I am referring to point 2.3, b4) - and, indeed, only a single cycle is needed because the objectives laid down in the Stability Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines must coincide with those of the real economy, in other words the labour market and, above all, welfare.
You realise that the labour market and welfare are two sides of the same coin.
Well, while the labour market already has an implicit coordination process - the Luxembourg process - which has been making positive headway for six or seven years now, the same is not true for the more recent (as one might say) Laeken process for coordinating welfare action, which has yet to be put into practice.
The two systems are unbalanced: much has been done in the area of close coordination on the labour market, while everything still remains to be done as regards welfare.
My request is therefore that the two coordination processes be synchronised as fully as possible so that they then make it possible to fulfil not only Lisbon but the Stability Pact too.
Mr President, in relation to the Commission's work programme on enlargement we have, as we would expect, a very thorough and indeed a very formidable programme to achieve in the next 12 months, in which the Commission has to address a large number of areas including, in particular, monitoring the progress of the candidate countries.
Can we be assured that even when the treaties are signed there will be no winding down of DG Enlargement?
That will ensure that we have the staff to carry out the monitoring process, which is still important right up to accession.
Secondly, the focus will inevitably move on to the stability of our borders, as the Commission says in its programme, but it does not say what new steps we are actually going to take.
We talk about relations with Moldova, for example.
Moldova is very close to being defined as a failed state.
How are we actually going to deal with it and with Ukraine, with which we have still tried to have relations?
In relation to Bosnia and Kosovo, are we simply going to carry on as before, or are we going to look at enhancing our work there in order to better secure our borders?
Finally, we put emphasis on the CFSP in preparing the Commission's role in that area.
However, defence procurement and securing the future of European defence industries are important.
To that end we have previously had action plans from the Commission on how it can use its instruments to support that process.
Commissioner Liikanen keeps promising me that he will put forward a further action plan, but I see no reference to that in the annual programme.
Are we going to see an action plan on future defence industries and on defence procurement, and are we going to see the Commission using the instruments it has available?
That concludes the catch-the-eye procedure.
Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation of the Commission's legislative and work programme for the year 2003 constitutes an important stage in working relations between our two institutions.
In fact, the presentation of this programme today marks the end of an interinstitutional schedule of financial payments agreed between our two institutions in January 2002.
As this is the first exercise of its kind, it will clearly be possible to improve a number of points next time and I shall take the liberty of coming back to this matter at the end of my speech.
In February 2002, the Commission presented to Parliament the annual political strategy for the year 2003.
On the basis of this document, a true interinstitutional dialogue took place, from April to July, between the parliamentary committees and Commissioners concerned, on the scope and implementation of political priorities in each specific field of competence.
In July, within the Conference of Committee chairmen, jointly with the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, we carried out an assessment of this year's programme.
Then, in September, the Conference of Committee chairmen, also in the presence of Mrs de Palacio, drew up an inventory of the various legislative proposals that the Commission intended to introduce in its legislative and work programme for next year.
The document that Mr Prodi has just presented is therefore, to a great extent, the outcome of the dialogue which has taken place throughout the year.
Now, in order to conclude this process, Parliament is due to decide on a motion for a resolution on 5 December.
In this regard, I would inform you that the parliamentary committees decided, at the meeting which took place the day before yesterday, to prepare, each in their own field of competence, a contribution which can be included in this motion for a resolution.
Mr President, allow me to inform the European Commission, as well as Parliament, of my positive assessment of the interinstitutional schedule of financial payments which has been established for the first time.
More or less one year ago, the Commission position, as you will all recall, was practically the opposite.
The establishment of this schedule of financial payments required a great deal of effort, in particular by Parliament.
In this regard, I would like to highlight the remarkable work of our colleague Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, during negotiations with the Commission.
In fact, it was possible to establish the schedule of financial payments due to the mutual trust that has been created between our two institutions with regard to legislative programming.
Naturally, on the basis of this year's experience, the various stages will be better understood and can be implemented next year.
A true culture of planning and interinstitutional programming is currently developing between the European institutions, which is surely moving in the direction expected by our citizens.
In this regard, allow me to conclude my speech by recalling that at the time of the Seville Summit of 21 and 22 July this year, the European Council decided that the Council would establish a work programme.
I therefore hope that the resolution upon which Parliament is to vote on 5 December will also address the Council with a view to establishing its programme for the year.
I would like to end by emphasising the importance of dialogue with the Council.
I would like to thank Mr Haarder in particular, who has always been there when we needed him.
I believe it is worth emphasising, Mr Haarder, because it is good to hear congratulations, too, from time to time.
Efficient legislative programming effectively means two things.
First of all, transparency in terms of knowledge and citizens' access to the legislative work that the European Union intends to undertake in the year ahead.
Secondly, greater efficiency in carrying out legislative work, not forgetting that, thanks to better programming, Parliament, the Council and the Commission can inform the national parliaments and the citizens on legislative work and take full responsibility for it.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, Madam Vice-President, I would first like to make a few observations about the key points.
The first of these is the enlargement of Europe.
We have already heard several times that the signals indicating the direction the Commission would like to go in here are too weak.
Let us take a look at the Balkans, for example.
This region in particular now feels as if it has been rather abandoned - the finance available to it has been reduced.
That may be justified, but that is all the more reason to give stronger political signals offering these countries two alternatives: either the route to membership at a later stage, or some other option.
The Zagreb Summit is coming up.
I do not know what the Council has in mind, but I would like to know, Madam Vice-President, what the Commission intends to propose at the Zagreb Summit, at Zagreb II that is, about what should happen in the Balkan region.
Is it being specifically identified as an enlargement region once the first round of enlargement has been completed? Yes or no?
Secondly, there is the issue of stability and security.
The point I am about to make has already been made, but I think it could be made more forcefully. Our security is very closely linked to our viewing other, neighbouring regions, ranging from the Balkans to the Caucasus, as partner regions with which we have appropriate treaties and where we intend to extend cooperation against cross-border crime and illegal mass migration.
On a more positive note, let us look at energy.
I think we can agree on this, Commissioner.
You have brought forward a raft of energy policy proposals, including proposals on energy policy in relation to nuclear safety.
We are now in a position to discuss the details and I am sure that we will not always agree.
I believe, however, that it is high time we regarded a coherent energy policy strategy as being part of our external policy.
What regions do we want to link more closely with Europe, especially as regards energy security policy?
Let us consider the Caucasian region - or are we leaving it up to the Americans to act there?
The Balkans are also involved in terms of the various pipelines that need to be developed and secured there.
This combination of external policy strategy with security policy strategy and even including energy security needs to be made far stronger.
Thirdly, there is the issue of a sustainable and inclusive economy.
Here I think that what is lacking is a statement about economic policy cooperation, particularly with the European Central Bank.
The way this cooperation has been implemented in practice so far is by no means satisfactory.
I do recognise, however, that Mr Prodi's observations about increased flexibility in relation to the stability pact are not reflected in the work programme, not directly at least.
In which case I do not know why he highlighted that point, but so be it.
However, the issue of how we can cooperate with the Central Bank to assume greater responsibility in terms of economic policy, and therefore also employment policy, needs to be given greater emphasis.
On page 14 there is a paragraph about services of general interest.
I am amazed that the Commission should be saying again that we need to initiate a debate on this.
A much-needed debate is already taking place, although unfortunately not one in which the Commission has played any really significant role.
Mr Prodi's comments on this need to be taken really seriously if we are to make progress in this area, because services of general interest are an important issue not just in France but also in many of our Member States, and we need to have a clear line on this.
Lastly, I would like to make some general points about the legislative proposals.
Madam Vice-President, you know that you are our partner in the debate on alternative forms of regulation.
We in this House have a very great interest in seeing laws adopted more quickly and in applying the legislative process in a more flexible way, but to do that we need the cooperation of the Commission and the Council.
I will say something about that in a moment.
The Commission is willing to help on a great many issues.
It is perhaps a little too fearful that we want to take away its right of initiative.
We do not want to do that, nor are we able to.
Even if we did want to, we could not take it away from you.
But that does not mean you are entering into a more productive dialogue with us. And it does not mean, above all in areas where we have delegated our legislative competence, that we have a right of call-back, because we are after all surrendering some of our competence and so we want something in return.
There is one thing that I find totally incomprehensible. I am sorry to say that and have only praise for you, Mr Haarder, for sitting here for hours and listening; I really admire that.
I have in mind the very disappointing opinion adopted by the Council, by Coreper, on the issue of other forms of legislation.
It is not often you see something so restrictive and backward looking. You really cannot expect Parliament to surrender legislative competence as long as you are not willing to budge an inch yourselves!
You talked about comitology as if it were the holy of holies, as if it were our primary objective!
That really is not acceptable.
We need to have a situation in which Parliament and the Council are to some extent treated as equals.
We do not want to impinge on your rights, but please respect ours!
Mr President, this has undoubtedly been a good debate between the institutions and 2003 will be an important year against the backdrop of enlargement.
We must ensure the good functioning of the Union for our citizens present and future.
That applies very much to the process of how we legislate, how we implement legislation and how we enforce legislation.
The debate has been very wide-ranging debate as regards how we legislate in this process.
However, I could not help thinking while listening to the many detailed questions that we have heard that perhaps more of what I and my colleagues have been dealing with could have been dealt with at an earlier stage in the Committees, to give us a more strategic debate here today.
On behalf of my group, I welcome the emphasis on impact assessments and the emphasis on involvement of our citizens and transparency.
That has to be the right way forward.
I would raise some concerns about the Commission's powers of enforcement in terms of infringement proceedings as we move towards enlargement.
We must make sure that sufficient resources and measures are available in this respect.
The same goes for the Court.
The Court has to be fully resourced in order to carry out its tasks in the difficult times that lie ahead.
We have had a good debate, a good exchange, but I still am left wondering whether it has truly been the strategic debate that should have engaged all of this House and our citizens outside.
We have done well but we could still do a lot better.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I also cannot see how anyone could oppose the Commission's priorities.
Who could oppose the objectives of succeeding in enlargement, ensuring stability and security, firmly supporting the relaunch of the economy and employment, controlling globalisation and ensuring that the resulting benefits are redistributed as widely as possible taking account of Kyoto, Monterrey and Johannesburg, not forgetting a knowledge-based society, developing research with increased appropriations and better interaction between science and society.
I must, however, admit to you my concern over the deepening abyss between the stated objectives, on the one hand, and the means implemented in order to achieve them and therefore the results that will arise from them, on the other.
Moreover, in European public opinion polls, this is often what destroys the European ideal.
How can we succeed in enlargement without taking account of the diversity of the candidate countries - thereby better recognising the diversity of the current Member States - without taking sufficient account of their difficulties and needs, while at the same time we require them to succeed immediately in doing what some of the Fifteen have still not managed to do?
How can we ensure security and also combat crime while limiting ourselves to a 'Great Wall of China' or 'Berlin Wall' type strategy, in other words substantially communitarising the acceptance and immigration rules in a realistic but humane way throughout the Union?
How can we boost employment when free competition and the free market are detrimental to public services as a whole and when jobs are still considered a variable to be adjusted to benefit companies and when we attach more importance to financial, accounting and monetary concerns rather than to the economy and employment?
How, lastly, can we control globalisation when the USA dominates the world in political and military terms and when large industrial and financial groups take care of the rest - often, moreover - under the control of the USA and large world stock exchanges?
I do not know what the future holds for the Johannesburg conclusions, but I am fully aware of the way in which some have treated the Kyoto conclusions.
Before concluding, I shall ask the question that I would have liked to ask when research was mentioned: the Council has imposed a moratorium on stem cells.
What will happen at the end of 2003 if the Council does not manage to reach an agreement on the ethical issues relating to these hundreds of millions of euros in appropriations?
I repeat, I share the Commission's objectives.
I cannot believe, however, that they will be achieved more successfully in 2003 than in 2002 or 2001, unless the necessary financial and political means are provided.
The good qualities of the Commission and the Commissioners are not in question - the problem runs deeper than that.
It is the whole problem of the European and world framework, the place of social issues, human issues and citizens.
There is, in fact, a certain amount of discord among us on this point.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Caudron has just given us his shopping list of good intentions and I have no intention of repeating it.
I would just like to say that although I am happy with it, I would have preferred a more strategic debate.
I, like Mrs Wallis, think that we have to set priorities and that Europe has to decide on its place and its role in the world and in the future of the world.
This is really the main priority for me and for us.
We must start by adapting our own institutions and asking ourselves whether our own house is in order.
I would again ask for attention to be given to the place of the regions, this is becoming an important issue. So many small states will be joining the European Union, with all that entails, including their own language, their own place in the Council, in Parliament and in the Commission.
The constitutional regions, the other regions too, the regions with their own language, their own culture, even with legislative and their own implementing authorities, will continue to be deprived of all this and be left behind empty-handed.
I would ask whether they will then have to become a state to gain a respectable place in the European Union?
That is an incitement to separatism.
Secondly, we want the full integration of the countries that are going to become the European Union with us.
Should we then, however, not do more so that the populations of these countries actually become involved?
I hear the complaint for example that very many people are unable to find European Union documents available in their own language.
However, I want to focus more attention, because that was yesterday's debate, on the circles of partner countries that we have to develop.
I think that this debate about the expansion of this second circle is of fundamental importance if we wish to conduct the debate about the boundaries of the Union in a positive manner.
Personally I do not believe that Europe should extend to the borders of Iraq, Iran and Syria, but we do have to be able to offer Turkey an attractive partnership.
At the moment this is something we are really talking too little about.
Then there is our role in the world.
Peace and development currently involve more than simply the follow-up to Johannesburg.
As long as Europe is more part of the problem of poverty than part of the solution, then, Mr Nielsen, we have to place a big question mark by all the good things we undoubtedly do.
Because we know that as long as we engage in agriculture, as long as we engage in trade as we currently do, we are more part of the problem.
Mr President, if one reads the Commission's programme of legislation carefully, one suddenly happens upon a European army: the Rapid Reaction Force. This is to be established in accordance with what has been called the 'all-purpose article': the famous Article 235, now Article 308, which is unchanged in the Treaty of Nice.
This shows that there is no limit to the EU's interference in the affairs of the Member States.
With so many new countries due to join the EU next year, it would be better for us all to focus on consolidation and simplification of the existing legislation rather than continuing to build the Brussels legislative pyramid higher and higher.
This could be done as follows: the Commission should only be permitted to put forward new proposals on condition that the corresponding old legislation is deleted in the process.
All new proposals should be presented in their legal context, so that it is possible to compare proposals for new legislation with the existing legislation.
No new proposals should be presented unless they are accompanied by proposals regarding the means of consolidation of the existing legislation in the field.
This approach would make it possible to reduce the acquis communautaire from more than 85 000 pages to perhaps 25 000 pages.
Having accomplished this, we should strive to simplify binding legislation, transforming it into non-binding recommendations; regulations can be transformed into framework legislation, total harmonisation directives into minimum harmonisation directives, and uniform rules into voluntary rules.
Attempts to create a federal state with an ever increasing amount of legislation could be replaced with a decentralised confederation of states, which would allow the Member States a great deal more freedom.
This is our vision of the form the Commission's legislative programme should take.
We want a Europe of democracies based on diversity, as we believe that people will be happier if they can determine their own affairs as far as possible without interference and free from detailed rules drawn up by bureaucrats and lobbyists in Brussels.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like every year, reading the Commission's legislative programme for 2003 is enough to make your head spin, first of all because it measures the scope of the areas of intervention in the European Union.
It shows that, from reviews to reforms of the Treaties, the Member States have given up their most legitimate prerogatives to become nothing more than local municipalities of the future European super-State.
The theoretical introduction of the principle of subsidiarity that you claim to want finally to take into account after ten years by no means curbs the Union's legislative appetite.
As far as the rest is concerned, we can but approve of the legitimate objectives, such as the stated desire to study the impact of Community legislation or codify existing legislation.
We could even ask why this did not happen earlier.
The report also shows the underlying commitment to prepare the European Union for enlargement, and not only from the institutional point of view.
Beyond agricultural and financial decisions which are far from being finalised, many allegedly technical adjustments remain to be made, as well as a general review of many policies which will only take place on conclusion of the accession negotiations.
As for the objective of participating in the Middle East peace process, how can we fail to have doubts when we learn that the day before yesterday, Great Britain participated unilaterally, together with the United States of America, in an air strike - yet another - against Iraq, the very day on which the inspectors stipulated in Resolution 1441 arrived there?
I gladly admit that the Commission is not responsible for this situation.
Lastly, the document as a whole leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.
The 2003 programme reveals the importance of the international servitude of the European Union, in addition to the desire to open up the Union as a whole to immigration, which is described as a source of cultural riches and economic strength, which unfortunately is in no way confirmed by the facts.
Europe has no reason to exist if its union does not strengthen its members.
The Europe we are now building on a constitutional and legislative level sadly does not contribute to this in any way.
Mr President, I will speak very briefly to allow other colleagues to reply in relation to the areas specific to their responsibilities.
I would firstly like to say that we are pleased to be able to hold this debate, which has been preceded by work by all the Commissioners in the committees, and which, in the end, has led to a result which we can regard as positive.
In this respect, I would like to thank you, on behalf of all the Commissioners, for the input provided systematically in the debates and discussions which have taken place in the various committees in order to fine-tune our programme.
When we presented our first proposals, we received initial reactions from Parliament's relevant committees.
I am therefore grateful for the work carried out.
This has been an initial test whose result has not been homogenous in all the committees.
I hope that next year it will work perfectly in all of them.
Secondly, in relation to enlargement, I believe that President Prodi has been very clear.
There is no question that 2003 is still the main priority.
We must pursue the negotiations with the countries which are going to enter in the second wave and ensure that all the changes and adaptations which the candidates entering in 2004 have committed themselves to are being implemented and carried out.
This clearly requires considerable effort on the part of the candidate countries, and also of the Commission, in terms of cooperating with them in order to facilitate this work and rigorously verify that it is carried out.
If it is not, mechanisms will have to be implemented in order to correct the situation.
After enlargement and with the perspectives we have, what will happen?
The President has clearly pointed out that we will have to decide on issues relating to the countries of the former Yugoslavia and also that circle of countries with which we have special relations.
I believe that that will be the challenge we will have to discuss, develop and monitor.
But at the moment the priority - let us make this very clear - is what we have on the table: the 2004 countries and those countries, in principle, Bulgaria and Rumania, which should enter in 2007.
With regard to Turkey, we are in a situation of stand-by, of waiting, simply because Turkey is yet to fulfil the political requirements for entry into the Union.
In the economic field, I will say that the Commission - this is the third priority, as the President has pointed out - will continue to implement the structural modifications necessary to promote the Lisbon project.
The European Union, as the most developed knowledge-based economy, which aims for full employment, will in 2010 be the most competitive society.
That is how we are going to continue to work, and, in this respect, I would point out that, with regard to the Stability Pact, we have the framework of the Treaties, which are very clear, including the Protocol, in which figures are clearly mentioned - such as the 3% of deficit and 60% of debt - and it is true that at the Barcelona Council we have been asked to work to create greater economic coordination - which was mentioned earlier, by Mr BarÃ³n for example.
The Commissioner responsible, Mr Solbes, has given us an initial presentation with regard to the approach and the timetable, and soon the relevant specific documents will be presented.
With regard to the other aspects, I will only make a couple of brief comments on issues falling within my own competence.
There has been mention of the problems of legislation and the problem of commitology, ladies and gentlemen.
We know that, at the moment, by means of the high-level group of interinstitutional cooperation, we are negotiating certain agreements with the Council.
On this particular problem we do not have a real agreement and we are trying to find some common ground.
I believe that, in any event, there has also been progress in this field and that the progress has been made during this last year.
We must continue along this road.
I believe that the possibilities for improvement are favourable.
In this regard, I would like to say that the Commission will continue to work with Parliament and also, of course, with the Council.
In this way we will manage to find a conclusion on this issue.
With regard to resources and ambitions, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, despite everything, the results of the development and process of European Union construction clearly indicate that our ambitions are great, but that we are achieving them.
Of course, the Commission can always ask for more human resources and has done so, specifically in view of enlargement.
An agreement has been reached on the minimum necessary.
I can only say that we would have liked even more.
If anyone insists on this area, I believe we are working with minimum resources, but that we are achieving a good result.
I will end by commenting on the specific issues that fall within my competence.
There has been mention of the Single Sky and responsibility for Eurocontrol.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Single Sky does not mean that flight plans are going to be decided by the Commission.
Flight plans are still coordinated within Europe by Eurocontrol, not only for the Fifteen, but for all the members of Eurocontrol, of which there are now more than thirty.
They are different things; the Single Sky involves another series of areas which mean the harmonisation of management rules within the European Union and compatibility of inter-operative systems, management systems, integrating them into a network.
Specific execution is still in the hands of the States and global coordination in the hands of Eurocontrol.
In the other area, in Mr Ripoll's area, I would like to say that what this Prestige tragedy - which we all regret, especially the Commission - demonstrates is that we were right.
We were right to demand greater speed in the approval of measures and in the application of the measures proposed.
Unfortunately, the Council, Parliament and the final agreements did not achieve much; there were more difficulties than we expected and they have been delayed.
And since they have been delayed, regrettably, the Prestige accident has taken place.
Let us hope that the early implementation of the 'Erika I' package - I have asked the Ministers for it to enter into force before next June - and of the 'Erika II' package, in February 2004, will prevent any further accident such as that suffered by the Prestige or by the Erika three years ago.
With regard to areas of refuge, amongst the proposals in the 'Erika I' and 'Erika II' packages, there are some which call for the different countries to determine and stipulate appropriate ports for dealing with emergency situations.
Of course, Galicia is part of 'Natura 2002'.
When talking about certain things, we must bear in mind all the available information, not to mention the difficulties for some ports on that coast, which I know very well and better than certain others.
Mr President, I would ask that Mrs Diamantopoulou, Mr Nielson and Mr Vitorino may speak next, since many issues have been addressed to them.
Mr President, first of all, as there have been many references to the presence of the Commission in this very interesting debate, I would like in turn to thank those Members of Parliament who were patient enough to stay and give definitive answers to specific questions.
Mr President, in addition to the answers already given by President Prodi, I would like to call the attention of the House to the fact that as far as return policy is concerned, very intensive work is under way on the programme for return to Afghanistan, thanks to the commitment of the Danish Presidency.
In 2003 the Commission will present a directive on minimum rules on return policy, above all in order to guarantee the mutual recognition of return decisions taken by a Member State.
Such decisions should be automatically recognised and executed by the other Member States.
The Commission has recently presented a proposal for a European return programme.
That is already under discussion in the Council's specialised working groups.
When it comes to integration policy, we have put forward a proposal to create some pilot projects between 2003 and 2005 in order to promote the exchange of best practices as far as integration policy is concerned.
However, it has to be recognised that there is no explicit legal basis in the Treaty for dealing with integration policy at European level.
Therefore we need to discuss the added value of addressing integration policy in European-wide terms.
Thirdly, as far as immigration and asylum is concerned, I can reiterate that the Commission has put forward all the proposals asked of it by the Tampere European Council and the Laeken Council.
The time has now come for the Council to decide.
The only two new elements of asylum policy that we are taking into consideration are two proposals that are included in our programme for 2003.
The first one concerns resettlement policy and the second protection in the region - the possibility of asking for asylum outside the territory of the European Union.
These two proposals will follow very closely the consultations launched by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Thirdly, concerning the Seville Conclusions, I would draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has already presented to the Council the proposal on mandates for new readmission agreements with the People's Republic of China, Albania, Algeria and Turkey.
In June 2003 we are supposed to present, as set out in our programme, the report on burden sharing on external border control.
We are now preparing a report on the financial allocations for partnerships with third countries aimed at tackling illegal immigration.
The report aims to identify effective allocations of financial tools, possible shortcomings and the vulnerabilities that must be overcome in the future.
When it comes to external borders, I can confirm that the Commission intends to present a reform of the common manual on external borders in March 2003.
All the other actions asked of us in Seville, such as joint training and joint operation in the control of external borders, are already being developed by the appropriate Council working group and will be financed by the Commission's ARGO programme.
Finally, we recognise the fight against terrorism as a priority for 2003.
As far as legislative action is concerned, priority should be given to the fight against sources of financing for terrorism, and several of the proposals included in our programme address this challenge.
As Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ said, we intend to bring forward proposals concerning common procedural guarantees in criminal procedures.
We have launched a consultation and intend to build upon the results of that consultation in a green paper.
We shall therefore be bringing forward a proposal on common minimum rules on criminal procedure guarantees in the 15 Member States by the end of next year.
Mr President, I should like to respond to the more specific questions raised by Mrs Frassoni and Mr van den Burg.
To Mrs Frassoni, who talked about the outcome of the Johannesburg Summit, I will start by saying that the Commission in many ways shares the worries about the softness of some of the decisions taken there but this has been duly commented on.
As regards the question of the relationship between international agreements on the environment and the WTO framework, in Johannesburg it was a non-event and nothing new happened: nothing was added to WTO, nothing was subtracted.
Johannesburg was an attempt for the two sides to see if that balance could be changed - and it was not changed.
For that reason not everyone was happy, but there is a limit to the unhappiness.
The second question from Mrs Frassoni concerned the category II initiatives which are too weak and unclear.
I agree that the risk is that these weak initiatives do not add up to anything substantial.
The hard core of follow-up actions for the European Union to Johannesburg will be our water and energy initiatives.
These are not going to be weak or unclear.
They are already on the agenda for the spring European Council and we are already engaged with the Member States in clarifying these initiatives, which we see as big and important.
I agree with Mr van den Burg that we need more rapid disbursement, especially regarding activities covered by the EDF.
Things are moving forward and are somewhat better than they used to be, but we still have unsolved problems concerning staff and structure.
This is an ongoing battle.
We are preparing to do bigger things in the HIPIC global health fund, education for all.
All this depends on starting up the 9th EDF and I would urge Mr van den Burg when he returns to the Netherlands to make sure that the last remaining country in the convoy takes the necessary action, so that we are ready to access 9th EDF money.
As regards the agricultural profile of Europe in these global negotiations, this is back on track.
We managed in Johannesburg and we are still managing to keep alive the formulations embedded in the Doha language on this front.
We still see the external actions there as part of the necessary process of adaptation, which we in Europe have to take seriously.
This language is continually being confirmed at all the meetings.
Yesterday in the General Affairs and External Relations Council this was again the case.
We are on track.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Titley for his interest and consistency in following developments on the European defence industries.
The Commission has invested a lot in this issue.
We had a meeting of the enlarged external relations Commissioners in July at which some of the options for the Commission communication were discussed.
Since then Mr Patten's service and mine have continued to work on this.
We shall be having a further Relex Commissioners' meeting in December with the aim of defining a Commission vision of an optimum armaments policy for the European Union, ensuring that its defence-related industry is competitive and in a position to underpin the capabilities required for the ESDP.
I hope that the next time this issue comes up for discussion we shall be able to present specific documents.
The final speaker is the President-in-Office of the Council.
I am pleased that he has been present in person throughout the part-session, which demonstrates respect towards Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Haarder, a former Member of this House, will now close the debate, and I would ask you to pay careful attention to what he has to say.
Silence please!
- (DA) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a great pleasure to take part in this dialogue, which is the first of its kind.
I know this because I was sitting over there as a Member of Parliament last year when the Commission presented its legislative programme, and at that time the way of working was completely different.
Moreover, there was criticism from Parliament that we have heard nothing of today.
This is a testament to the great progress that has been made in the dialogue between the Council and Parliament, and I am happy to be present on this occasion, too, and to contribute to the dialogue for a couple of minutes, without delaying the start of the voting at 12 noon sharp.
The Presidency is very pleased with the Commission's proposals.
We have noted the priorities set by the legislative and work programme, and I can say on behalf of the Council that we support the Commission's intention to apply impact assessments to the chief legislative initiatives.
This is something that Mr Clegg mentioned, and I believe Mrs Frassoni also talked about.
In this connection, I wish to say to both Mrs Frassoni and Mr Swoboda that I too should have liked more progress to be made on the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking.
We had an excellent meeting in Brussels on 1 October, which I believe both Mrs Frassoni and Mr Swoboda attended, and I sensed that we were very close to reaching tangible agreement on a number of points.
Now, of course, time is running out, and so if we are to achieve a result by the end of the year, I would suggest that we now set ourselves some realistic goals, that we set out the points we can agree on and that we also show a degree of flexibility.
The Council can make concessions on some points, for example these alternative or weak forms of regulation that Mrs Frassoni spoke about.
I believe that we can reach agreement on that.
Then there are other matters which are more difficult, for example comitology, where it is well known that different countries have different traditions; but let us now reach agreement on as much as possible.
I am prepared to continue the dialogue, which has unfortunately been extended and interrupted.
Let us resume this dialogue, and let us ask our government officials to give us a basis for discussion in the near future.
It is now up to the Greek and Italian Presidencies, therefore, to draw up a joint work programme for the Council for the coming year.
The new work programme will be presented to the Council in December: probably on 9-10 December.
I understand that the vote on the Commission's programme here in Parliament is taking place as early as 5 December.
I am convinced that the upcoming Presidencies will pay due regard not only to the Commission work programme but also to the views on the work programme that Parliament has expressed and is going to express in the days ahead.
I also wish to thank Mr Vitorino for his words on asylum and immigration.
As I happen to be President of the Council which deals with such matters, I should like to confirm everything Mr Vitorino said.
We aim to complete new sets of rules on the reception of asylum seekers, the definition of a refugee and also the question as to which state is responsible for examining an asylum application.
I would say to Mr Titley, who called for a policy towards our new neighbours after enlargement, that, the day before yesterday, the General Affairs Council in Brussels worked out a more long-term strategy, to be implemented in cooperation with the candidate countries; a strategy that shall ensure that these new borders towards the east are cooperative borders rather than another Iron Curtain.
Finally, I wish to address Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, who raised the question as to what the situation will be as regards the Commission, which will include Commissioners from the new Member States, and how the transition will take place.
As I announced yesterday, the General Affairs Council recommended the day before yesterday at its meeting in Brussels that accession take place on 1 May, and that the brand new Commission, including Commissioners from the new Member States, take office on 1 November, so that the new Parliament has enough time to approve the new Commissioners.
In this way, in the intervening period, from 1 May to 1 November, there will be Commissioners from the new Member States who do not have a portfolio, and who therefore do not need to be approved by Parliament.
But this is all just a recommendation.
I mentioned it yesterday because it is of course only possible with the cooperation of Parliament, and it is in the spirit of this good working relationship that I mentioned the Council's thoughts.
We are completely open to Parliament's thoughts on the subject.
Thank you very much, Mr Haarder.
The motions for resolutions on these items will be voted on in Brussels on 5 December 2002.
Mr President, what I have said to the Council and to Minister Haarder is that they have decided unilaterally on a constitutional issue for the Union without consulting Parliament and without holding discussions.
President Prodi has agreed with me and has told me that he is in favour of dealing with the issue at the Interinstitutional Summit at the end of the month.
I have written to the President of Parliament and I would like to know whether the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is prepared to speak to Parliament about a unilateral decision which - as he has acknowledged - leads to absurd consequences.
Mr Haarder is nodding in agreement.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, yesterday morning we had the part-session with our colleagues from the candidate countries.
Although it was not an official meeting, it was one of the most interesting meetings ever held in this House.
I therefore think that it is a matter for regret that although there is a verbatim report of proceedings for yesterday afternoon, there is no verbatim report of the historic proceedings yesterday morning, and I simply wanted to ask if that would be rectified.
I shall pass that question on to the administration, Mr Posselt.
Colleagues, yesterday morning here in this Chamber I remarked that the coming year, in terms of the European enlargement process, will be a year of parliaments and parliamentarians.
I refer to the work we need to do, and the work that needs to be done in the parliaments of the Member States and candidate countries.
While making a success of enlargement is a key priority, we should not forget our parliamentary relations with the rest of the world.
On the contrary, we need to continue and develop relations with elected representatives from other states and not least with the US Congress.
Today, therefore, I am very happy to greet four Congressmen who are in our Distinguished Visitors' Gallery: Mr Capuano, Mr Dooley, Mr Kind and Mr Moran, we warmly welcome you to Strasbourg and wish you a successful visit.
I should also like to point out that some of the Members of Parliament from the delegations from the Accession States are in the gallery today for our important vote.
The next item is the vote.
Report (A5-0371/2002) by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on enlargement: progress report (COM(2002) 700 - C5-0474/2002 - 2002/2160(INI))
Before the vote:
Mr President, I would simply like to say that a series of significant errors have appeared in the Spanish version and I would be grateful if, before the vote on paragraphs 9, 30 and 146, you could allow me to take the floor to clear up these deficiencies.
I can assure you that we will make a systematic check of all the language versions after the vote, to make sure we render the texts compatible, but if you need to be called at a given point, please indicate.
Before the vote on paragraph 3:
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday the Council agreed to set the date of accession at 1 May at the latest.
As I see it, we should not be arguing about one month or another, and I suggest that we should make the necessary adjustments here and accept the date of 1 May.
However, to make sure that this does not put Parliament at a disadvantage when it comes to nominating the new Commission later on, we should stipulate an arrangement which will benefit Parliament now and add the following words after the date: '? and calls on the Council not to jointly nominate and confirm the new Commission with Parliament until after the European elections and to find a provisional interim solution for the accession countries'.
I believe that we should avoid Parliament having its rights encroached upon by having nominations made before the elections.
Mr President, I just want to inform you that the coordinators of all the political groups in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have adopted the decision, which will be endorsed by the committee itself, to table an oral question during the next part-session regarding the decisions that the General Affairs Council adopted on matters of sensitive institutional importance without consulting the European Parliament.
I take note of your comments.
Mr President, could you explain procedurally what happened to paragraph 3?
The original text will be part of the vote on paragraph 3.
Mr President, I believe that, with the rapporteur's agreement, we should at least change the date, because it still says 1 March here, and the additional wording needs to be discussed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
However, the date ought to be changed.
Mr President, I think Mr Swoboda's proposal is a very wise one.
Let me return to paragraph 3 with what is now a new oral amendment.
The President established that there was no objection to the oral amendment.
Before the vote on paragraph 9:
Mr President, paragraph 9 of the text in the Spanish version reads 'apliquen este problema [apply this problem]' referring to the transposition of the Community acquis.
I believe that it intended to say that this problem should be resolved as soon as possible.
