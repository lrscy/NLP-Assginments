The EPP-ED wants one Europe for all, with job opportunities for all, effective healthcare and no poverty.
An EU that can grow even stronger.
The only way to achieve that is by ensuring that the market is competitive and that trade is not impaired by antiquated legislation, unnecessary customs duties, subsidies or market controls.
Without a smoothly functioning market and strong European companies there is no money for welfare.
The internal market and competitiveness automatically create social security and are preconditions for welfare.
(HU) I would like to begin by saying how much we welcomed the clear and comprehensive debate which Mr Toubon's colleagues held with us last year prior to the preparation of this report.
I would also like to compliment Mr Toubon himself on the preparation of his report.
I myself would like to comment on paragraph 40 first, which stresses the responsibility of the Member States.
My main thought here is that the Member States do not owe it to the European Commission or the European Parliament to transpose the rules of the internal market but first and foremost to themselves and to each other, and above all to their own citizens and their own businesses.
We therefore cannot ignore the July 2007 Internal Market Scoreboard and the information it contains.
A condition for the new Member States which acceded in 2004 and 2005 was the introduction and transposition of the complete acquis communautaire.
We can see from the Scoreboard that two years after the deadline expired the record-holders for overdue transposition of directives are without exception the old Member States, which account for the four largest transposition deficits.
The ratio of failure to meet internal market obligations between individual old and new Member States is 1:2, but may occasionally be as much as 1:8, as for example between Slovenia and Italy.
A direct result of this is that those who abide by the law are losing out because of unequal treatment and discrimination.
When we talk about the future internal market, we all need to insist that businesses and countries that stick to the rules and transpose the acquis communautaire must not lose out in the ongoing development of the internal market.
I would like to thank the rapporteur.
(CS) Commissioner, 15 years ago the Member States agreed on deeper economic integration and pledged to create a single European market for the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.
In the 1990s this gave rise to a competitive environment for entrepreneurs, resulting in wider choices and lower prices for consumers.
However, since 2000 we have seen how some Member States, in particular the old ones, protect, both covertly and openly, their small national markets from competition next door and tolerate administrative and other obstacles, thus blocking the swift and total accomplishment of the single market free of barriers.
In the light of the rapid liberalisation of global trade, and seeing how hastily we Europeans are making room for goods from third countries, this is paradoxical behaviour.
Would a healthy European market not be the key to dealing with the challenges of globalisation and unemployment?
This irrational situation is caused by populism and by giving precedence to false national interests over the common interests of consumers and entrepreneurs.
I therefore welcome the Commission's Green Paper and the proposal for a review: this review will reveal how valid European legislation is evaded in a number of countries and will bring to light flaws that weaken trust in the single market.
An example of this is the grey area concerning when to apply or not to apply the country of origin principle.
If the market is supposed to function properly, we need to make progress in liberalising network services and finalise the financial services market, and to overcome myths prevailing in health and social services.
The introduction of the euro and recent directives have strengthened trade within the Union and made it more transparent.
That said, we all know that entrepreneurs suffer from the burden of increasing paperwork and that we need equal conditions for fair international competition.
We also need more modern and simpler control mechanisms.
I urge the Commission to make every effort to monitor how the existing Directives are being implemented, and to make progress in the area of mutual recognition before furthering possible harmonisation.
I realise that the globalisation of trade will require the standardisation of other products and an agreement on the European mark of origin.
I agree that the disparities in the area of corporate tax are a source of tension and will need further debate.
The European market is a process, not a dogma.
(FI) Mr President, we should not hit out at globalisation because of the harm it does, but take practical steps.
The protection of national markets is paralysing our continent, so jeopardising its economic growth, something a social Europe also relies on.
To its credit, the report stresses the importance of completing the process whereby energy and communications in particular are opened up to competition, because developed and open networks are ultimately in the interests of the consumer and a guarantee of growth.
To speed this development up we also need effective regulation mechanisms and monitoring.
One mechanism should be incorporated into the so-called cross-border client liability principle.
With that, anyone commissioning work or services would be responsible for ensuring that the activity was transparent and that the subcontractors were attending to their obligations.
This Union and this Parliament take a too ideological view when considering the various energy options.
In practice, the harmful effects of climate change are prevented by reducing emissions.
In contrast to what, for example, Mr Bulfon said just now, it is unrealistic to suppose that we will achieve real and effective results without nuclear power being part of the solution.
Our priority goal must be to reduce the use of fossil fuels.
(SK) To begin with I would like to express my appreciation to my colleague Jacques Toubon for his stimulating report, which lays an excellent and balanced foundation for the Commission's forthcoming documents.
In spite of the fact that the four fundamental freedoms were guaranteed by the Rome Treaties, there are still many obstacles to their practical application.
A review of the present situation of the internal market offers us an opportunity to back up the existing rules and revise those that are outdated.
This new approach may eliminate the chasm between the potential and the reality and will offer solutions for doing away with the barriers between the markets of the 27 Member States.
I agree with the rapporteur's view that the success of the single market rests on three pillars: the first is strengthening consumer rights and creating a favourable business environment, which is especially important for small and medium-sized enterprises.
For example, it is necessary to improve access for small and medium-sized enterprises to public procurement contracts.
Regarding the second pillar, we should eliminate any remaining barriers such as obstacles to the creation of a single payments area.
The third pillar consists of strengthening the international dimension of the EU's internal market by creating a larger transatlantic internal market.
In the context of the global economy, the EU will be prosperous only when it equals or even exceeds the innovation capabilities of its trading partners.
That is why the EU needs specific measures to increase its innovation capabilities.
The Member States must create a favourable environment for active cooperation between businesses, public sector and academia.
Channelling public and private investment into highly specialised research centres connected to universities may produce a breeding ground for the business community of tomorrow.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many members of the public might well find today's debate rather odd: after all, the internal market has been around for more than 15 years and a lot of people have become quite used to it.
Yet even after all this time, there remain some astounding shortcomings, due in certain cases to protectionist behaviour by a few Member States.
Certain things have also gone wrong over the years.
Members of the public - consumers - have less freedom of choice and the market is by no means a level playing field; it might be that for big companies, but for SMEs it most certainly is not.
We all share the view - and I hope I speak here not just for Parliament but also for the Commission and the Council - that the internal market is not an end in itself.
I should like to quote one of the great founding fathers of the Single Market, Jacques Delors, who talked about three key principles - competition, to stimulate; cooperation, to strengthen; and solidarity, to unite.
The last of the three has been somewhat obscured down the years.
For us as Social Democrats, solidarity and cohesion in the internal market are very important.
My final point is this: an effective market implies effective safeguards and consumer protection.
Only by putting these in place can we build the confidence that everyone is reminding us about.
Recent years have seen an increase in the number of products that contain hazardous substances or pose a risk: Chinese toys are merely the tip of the iceberg.
Thousands of products are the subject of complaints.
So that is where our task lies, and your task too Commissioner: we need to use our package of market-control measures to win back people's trust; we need to take action and not simply leave things as they are.
(RO) Mr President, economic and social cohesion, as well as solidarity are essential for the European Union.
The Structural Funds contribute to the development of all the European regions and are important especially for the new Member States.
We not only need an economic union with the most dynamic knowledge-based economy but also a Social Europe where everybody plays their part and in which public services are of high quality and are accessible to the almost 500 million European citizens.
We need health and education services, we need a sustainable social protection system.
Transport, energy, communications are essential for EU economic development, but one should ensure everybody has access to these services.
e-government and the financial service development are essential for the transparency and quality of public services, as they should also ensure consumer protection in the digital environment.
We hope that the restrictions imposed on Romanian and Bulgarian workers concerning the access to the Community labour market will be removed.
Thus nondiscriminatory access to the European labour market is important for ensuring equal working conditions and for avoiding social dumping.
(PL) Mr President, as one of the pillars of the European Union the internal market is subject to constant change.
Every day we see how much it actually impacts on the lives of ordinary citizens.
Deepening European integration depends directly on deepening integration between the economies of the individual Member States.
It is therefore very important for all citizens that decisive action should be taken to rid the internal market of successive barriers and obstacles to the flow of people, capital, goods and services.
The report by Mr Toubon is an accurate report which sets out the areas on which EU legislation and policy should concentrate to improve the operation of the internal market.
He draws attention to many issues which should take priority in our work and in particular to gaining the confidence of citizens, both consumers and business people, in the internal market.
I wholeheartedly support the idea contained in Mr Toubon's report that the national parliaments should be involved in the legislative work of Parliament, which will result in the EU being brought considerably closer to our citizens.
It is a very worthwhile suggestion.
Finally, I would like to add that as a former businesswoman I agree with all the recommendations in the report concerning the removal of administrative burdens on businesses.
It is only on the basis of a consistent, pro-market and liberal policy that the EU economy will be able to compete with the economies of the United States, China and India.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report whose greatest virtue is its balanced content.
I would simply say that it constitutes a kind of non-political roadmap setting out the priorities for our work on the internal market.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I have listened carefully to the discussion on the future of the single market and I would like to thank all participants for their comments.
The review of the single market is an essential part of a reference to the delivery of a Europe of tangible results with the clear focus on the citizens.
The single market is not a means to an end.
Our policies must serve the people and improve their quality of life.
All Europeans, you and I, should be able to identify with these policies.
Big challenges remain in the single market.
Some of our proposals are already on the table.
Others will soon come.
We need your support on these initiatives to bring them to a successful end.
We are rethinking the way we govern the single market, at national and EU level.
Any initiative is thoroughly prepared under the better regulation principles.
This allows us to examine all options before taking action and this may include considering self-regulation in specific areas.
We need to improve the ownership of the single market.
It belongs to our consumers, to our companies, to our workers and our civil society.
It belongs to national, regional and local authorities.
We need to facilitate the cooperation between Member States on a daily basis.
I would like once again to thank the rapporteur and am looking forward to receiving further comments from Parliament in the coming months.
The debate is closed.
The vote on this item will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - This own-initiative report is an excellent opportunity to feed into the current review of the single market.
It is therefore the occasion for our Parliament to stress the benefits consequent to a genuinely completed single market.
More specifically, while highlighting the challenges faced by the single market, the report brings forward concrete recommendations.
Among these recommendations we particularly support the emphasis given on the importance of tackling climate change through sustainable development actions; the necessity to substantially increase consumer confidence in cross-border purchases; the underlined competitiveness, growth and employment potential of innovation and SMEs; the encouragement of genuine free movement of workers throughout the Union and, more generally, the removal of all obstacles for the completion of an integrated and efficient single market.
Of course, these recommendations need to be transposed into single market directives so that they will be thoroughly implemented by the Member States.
In order to achieve effective completion of the single market rules, the Union must give itself the necessary enforcement tools for encouraging cooperation between national administrations, setting up information contact points for businesses and citizens, improving the efficiency of the complaints procedure, and undertaking actions through the relevant courts when necessary.
in writing. - The single market is still the core achievement of the EU. However, it is far from complete.
There are deficiencies with respect to all four freedoms.
Also, we are seeing crumbling stakeholder confidence in the achievements of the single market. These are largely taken for granted.
As regards movement of goods, 25% are still subject to various national technical barriers.
Hopefully the Commission's policy package from January 2007 will swiftly be translated in targeted measures for resolving the remaining obstacles.
As regards people, uncertainty persists over some basic principles, notably in the transferability of social rights.
I am happy that this political minefield is being gradually negotiated in the field of, for instance, pensions and access to cross-border healthcare.
As for capital and services, big changes are afoot.
The status quo, for example as regards the lack of a common corporate tax base, distorts investment decisions in the single market and disadvantages SMEs.
Even as the EU rolls up its sleeves for future challenges by way of the Reform Treaty, a political impetus for completing the single market is needed.
This should aim to remove ambiguities in the business environment, clarify the applicable regulatory regime and seek to reduce administrative burdens.
in writing. - I broadly welcome the rapporteur's report and agree that the development of the single market has delivered a range of benefits for Europe's citizens, notably by providing consumers with a wider choice and lower prices, creating a dynamic business environment and enabling the free exchange of goods, services and ideas. This in turn has facilitated European integration across a range of areas and continues to underpin the EU's ability to achieve its broad objectives.
However, I have reservations about particular elements of this report:
I do not agree that the introduction of a common consolidated tax base is either necessary or desirable, as suggested in this report.
I believe that such a proposal, were it to be tabled by the Commission, would be a first step towards tax harmonisation, which I would find unacceptable.
I believe that Member States are best placed to determine the nature and scope of their respective tax systems.
Finally, I believe that the report's reference to nuclear power as an essential part of the EU's energy mix is misplaced and I will not be supporting this element of the report.
Statute of the European Private Company, Company Law (debate)
The next item is the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the Commission on the state of play in the legislative proceedings on the 'Statute of the European Private Company' and of the 'Fourteenth Company Law Directive' - B6-0137/0000).
author. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on this question is very important both institutionally and politically, bearing in mind that it is of considerable political and institutional significance.
I should like to say very clearly, and I take responsibility for my words, that the European Commission has seriously failed the European Parliament since it has failed to follow up Parliament's formal requests and has failed to present proposals for legislation on European Private Companies and relocations of head offices of capital companies.
A proposal for legislation on the statute of the company was formally requested in February 2007, on the basis of Article 192 of the Treaty and - as I would like to stress, and I would ask the Commissioner to listen because this is a very important oral question, Mr President, to which an answer must be given - after a thorough debate, together with a hearing with qualified and representative experts who showed us how necessary such an instrument was and how useful it would be in fostering small enterprises keen to operate effectively in the internal market.
It was the Commission's duty, Commissioner, immediately to launch the procedure for adopting the legislative proposal, starting with an impact assessment.
The Commission already had, moreover, a feasibility study from December 2005, but did nothing and instead took its time until in July it launched a consultation on the need - here again no more than a hypothetical discussion - for a European Private Company, as though Parliament, as the elected representative of the Union as a whole, could not legitimately base its request on a substantive legislative act.
I shall not look in detail at the European legislation, as Klaus Lehne, one of the Committee's main experts and a leader in this field, will shortly talk about the legal aspects of the question.
I should like to look at the problem in greater depth and remind the Commissioner, so that he can give due consideration to everything that I say, of the relationship that exists between the institutions and on which the necessary cooperation between the Commission and Parliament has to be based.
In my opinion, Commissioner, you personally have done Parliament a discourtesy, you have snubbed Parliament.
You have ignored Parliament's requests adopted on the basis of Article 192 and in particular the interinstitutional agreement 'Better Regulation', and there have been many failures to act - I have been Chairman of that committee and I am very well aware how many questions are pending - even though the Commission had formally undertaken not only to take account of requests but also to provide rapid and appropriate answers to Parliament's committees.
That has not been the case at all!
The failure to comply with those obligations brings up the Commission's accountability, which I have no difficulty in defining as legal, to the European Parliament.
At the conference on company law organised by the German Presidency, Mr Lehne rightly said that the European Commission could be brought before the Court for Justice for failure to fulfil its obligations.
Parliament, and I say this very clearly, should be aware that the Commission, on its Internet site, has already confirmed that the consultations held in 1997 and 2002 showed a high-level and specific demand from economic operators.
The Commission therefore knows how important this issue is and is aware that it has a duty and an obligation to reply to Parliament's requests.
Not only has it failed to approve the proposal for legislation, but at the Berlin conference the Commissioner went as far as to say that further discussion of the usefulness of the proposal was necessary.
That has left us very perplexed because we now need to consider - as the Commissioner says - whether the European Parliament still has a chance effectively to demonstrate the validity of that proposal for legislation.
A directive in this field - I am concluding - would certainly provide a sound legal basis for companies' freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
We are awaiting a detailed proposal from the Commissioner which means not just going along with the various lobbies, from England, from the United Kingdom and Ireland, I think, but addressing an adverse situation.
It is not the interests of individual countries that have to be served, Commissioner, as you are well aware, but the interests of Europeans!
Parliament is not a lobby and we are actually and tangibly expressing that requirement and that necessity!
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the oral question tabled by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, gives me the opportunity to provide you with an update on where the Commission stands regarding the 14th Company Law Directive and the European Private Company (EPC).
As you are aware, and as part of our 'better regulation' approach, a public consultation on the EPC statute was launched on 20 July by the Directorate-General for the Internal Market and Services.
This consultation aims at gathering stakeholders' views on the need for such a statute and its possible content.
I know that the European Parliament would like the Commission to accelerate the process.
However, we need to do the necessary preparatory work. An essential part of this is to consult stakeholders on different possible regulatory options - that is, a more uniform but less flexible statute, or a statute which gives a lot of freedom to users but results in a variety of EPC structures across the European Union.
We need to hear stakeholders' opinions on which option is the most attractive for companies.
That is what better regulation is about.
The feasibility study at the end of 2005 offered a rather general assessment of the current situation, but does not provide a clear answer as to the best policy option and the possible elements of the EPC statute.
That is why we need a more in-depth analysis.
The study will, of course, provide good background material for our work.
We have also benefited from the European Parliament's report on the EPC statute and its recommendations on the possible content of such a statute.
Concerning the proposal for a 14th Company Law Directive, the preparatory work on this issue has not been conclusive.
Our better regulation and impact policy requires us to demonstrate that an initiative has clear economic benefit before embarking upon it.
I should be in a position shortly to make a more definitive statement on this issue in regard to the value added of such a proposal.
We need to reflect further before making such a proposal, which, frankly, risks being controversial.
As Members know, I am not afraid of being controversial, but I need to be convinced that the potential benefits for the European Union of such an initiative merit a legislative proposal.
This is not about procrastination but about the belief that, to produce good quality work, the preparatory work must be carried out properly.
Within the next couple of months I will inform Members of how I intend to proceed on these important issues.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must say I am pleased that Commissioner McCreevy, in his answer to this oral question, did not reject the European Parliament's suggestions.
Over the past few years, there have been so many hearings and consultations about the European Private Company that I cannot understand why we need to have a third, a fourth, a fifth and perhaps even a sixth or however many more.
The matter is closed.
We had an initial proposal in the Commission's action plan.
That was approved, in the revised action plan, by the majority of stakeholders.
The hearings in Parliament produced an unequivocal message.
Parliament's decisions could not have been clearer, and on that basis I cannot accept any further delays.
Experts are generally agreed that there is a gap in the law in the Directive on the cross-border transfer of registered seat.
The European Union offers freedom of movement of capital - that is, the option of moving one's property or capital to a different location - but if I own a business, I do not currently have that option because I cannot decide freely where to base my business, or where to transfer it to, within the European Union.
That is very clearly a gap in the law.
The Commission, in its annual legislative programme, announced its intention of closing the gap.
Currently we have a situation where the European Court of Justice is developing its own case-law in this area and tending towards Wild West-style deregulation, for the simple reason that the legislature is inert; it is doing nothing to address the areas where we lack harmonisation.
It is high time that the legislature acted, instead of handing all responsibility over to the Court of Justice.
One final point: the European Commission's monopoly on initiative does not exist in a vacuum.
Like any monopoly, it has to be seen in a context and, in this case, the context follows from the Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreements.
According to those texts, both the Council and the European Parliament have an indirect right of initiative.
The Commission, in the Interinstitutional Agreements, has undertaken to respond to their proposals.
That being so, I wish to make it very clear that if the Commission fails to deliver a substantive response on this issue within the stipulated time limit, I shall propose to the Committee on Legal Affairs that we take proceedings against it in the European Court for failure to act.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner's remarks, particularly as commitment to better regulation involves clear team work of regulators and those people affected working together to develop a piece of legislation.
I also welcome that he is clear that there have to be economic objectives and that has to reflect market needs.
Looking through the Commission's own summary of this consultation on company law, I notice that less than half the respondents call for the adoption of a European private company statute.
That seems to be slightly at odds with some of the statements we have heard so far, so perhaps he could clarify exactly what those responses were.
I also notice that most people wanted a codification and consolidation of existing company law, rather than anything going further.
Clearly, he has got quite a difficult balancing act.
What I want to know is: to what extent have we identified so far a clear need for legislation at a European level, as opposed to a domestic one?
I suspect that, in some cases, the pressure is coming from those who have very complex domestic laws and who want a European law to simplify matters.
However, the problem is we have a European law on top of domestic laws and we often find it makes life much more complicated.
Surely, the whole object of this exercise is simplification and clarification.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, when I last spoke on this issue in February, I drew to the Commissioner's attention the fact that I did not like all the recommendations in Parliament's report, such as the size of the capital, because I felt that would make any statute along those lines discriminatory in favour of larger companies.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that in the Commissioner's latest consultation, he is urging responses by SMEs.
However, we all need to be proactive in seeking those, with emphasis on the small rather than the medium.
I shall certainly be doing this within my region and I am pleased to say that there are other bodies within the UK doing likewise, so I welcome efforts to establish the relevance to small companies.
This is particularly the case when it is information from smaller companies that is frequently lacking, while, at the same time, we readily acknowledge that it is just those companies that do not have the means to deal with the different laws and regulations and, therefore, in theory at least it is those who we want to benefit most from the statute.
As I see it, this House has made some proposals that would render the statute unlikely to find favour with those very smaller companies, so there is a problem.
My message is to keep it simple otherwise, for small companies at least, it would just be a fig leaf for no change.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the competitiveness of companies and the efficiency of the internal market also require appropriate and up-to-date legal statutes for companies.
Some progress has been made in the case of large undertakings, with the adoption of the regulation on the European Private Company Statute on 8 October 2001.
In 2004, the European Commission opened up a discussion on a new form of European company, designed more specifically for small and medium-sized undertakings: the European Private Company.
That initiative was very warmly welcomed by all those who had been awaiting it for the past 30 years - yes, 30 years.
The results of the feasibility study on the Statute by the Commission were presented in December 2005.
It clearly showed that the vast majority of the economic operators interviewed wanted such a statute, for two main reasons. Firstly, the introduction of a European statute would have the advantage of removing obstacles to the establishment and mobility of SMEs in the European Union.
Secondly, it would enable a European label to be created for SMEs, particularly those in the new Member States.
For SMEs, the European Private Company seems an effective way of accessing the European market.
Its adoption would also indirectly contribute to the evolution and harmonisation of national law, which, in turn, encourages the development and integration of the European economy.
This new statute would meet the need to simplify the legal instruments available to companies and make them more effective.
It is my belief that many small and medium-sized undertakings would gain from such a statute, which would, obviously, remain optional.
The European Private Company plan is strongly supported in economic circles in virtually all the Member States.
That is certainly the case in France and Germany.
Parliament has approved the own-initiative report by Mr Lehne, whose conclusions I support, but at the moment no progress is being made.
That is why I am supporting the questions to the Commission from Mr Gargani, on behalf of JURI.
It is important to know what are the fundamental problems that have caused the Commission to delay its work on this issue.
(ES) Mr President, I share the point of view expressed by President Gargani and Mr Lehne on the need to press forward with European Union rules on company registered offices and the Statute of the European Private Company.
Mr McCreevy has told us in his reply that there are some problems, that there has been a delay, that consultations have been launched on one of the proposals and that for the other no point of view has apparently been defined as yet.
So we are faced with the familiar issue of the adoption of Community legislation and the improvement of Community rules.
Mr Lehne has made it clear that the atmosphere here is one of cooperation between the institutions: Parliament is not on one side and the Commission on the other.
Parliament hopes that the Commission can present initiatives soon because the Commission's power of initiative is part of the framework for cooperation with the other institutions.
Commissioner McCreevy has spoken about difficulties with regard to the Member States but it is still not clear to us as a result of this debate where the objections lie, and whether they come from the private sector proper or essentially from the Member States.
Which States are opposed to Community rules of this type being adopted?
Are we talking of solely private opposition?
As Mr McCreevy will have another opportunity to speak I hope he will be able to offer some further clarification as to where the difficulties lie, whether in the private sector or essentially with the Member States.
Member of the Commission. - I wish to thank all Members for their comments.
I am afraid I cannot agree with Mr Gargani when he said that the Commission has not done anything and that it ignored Parliament.
When we discussed Parliament's resolution on 1 February 2007 in Brussels, I undertook to answer Parliament in detail and I have every intention of living up to that commitment.
I also noted the request from a number of Members, during our debate on 1 February, not to ignore preparatory work.
Consultation on the EPC was duly launched in July.
There is some support amongst stakeholders for a European Private Company.
But it would be wrong to assume that there is consensus on its possible content, as both Mr Titley and Mrs Bowles have illustrated.
Jumping to a conclusion risks parking the proposal on the shelf before it even gets started.
The debate is closed.
Risk of closure of Gdansk shipyard (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the risk of closure of the Gdansk shipyard.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am dealing with this file on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Kroes, the Competition Commissioner.
The Commission is not seeking the closure of Gdansk shipyard.
Gdansk shipyard has played a crucial part in European history and in the struggle for freedom and a reunited Europe.
We would like to see the yard undertaking a genuine far-reaching restructuring so as to become a successful company capable of competing on its own merits in the EU and world shipbuilding markets.
In the last decades, the shipbuilding industry has restructured all around Europe.
The Commission is well aware that for many yards and regions this has been a difficult process.
Many shipyards were closed and the shipbuilding capacity had to be reduced.
Wherever national State aid has been used for this restructuring, the Commission has had to exercise its responsibility under the Treaty to ensure that the level playing field among shipbuilders in the European Union was not distorted.
The Commission now has the same responsibility concerning its intervention in the Gdansk case.
The conditions under which State aid for ailing companies is compatible with the Treaty are clearly set out in the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulties.
The proper restructuring of Gdansk shipyard has been postponed for many years; public money has not been used to create viable jobs, but to keep alive a company that would under normal market conditions have ceased to exist.
The Commission's goals here are three-fold.
First, to ensure that the restructuring of Gdansk shipyard leads to its own long-term viability.
It could possibly mean scaling down its activities, but would eventually lead to the emergence of a smaller but more efficient shipyard capable of standing on its own feet.
Second, to limit the distortion of the level playing field and any harm to European competitors caused by State intervention, the yard's production capacity has to be reduced.
Also, a significant contribution to the restructuring plan must be made from own resources, including the sale of assets that are not essential to the shipyard's survival, or from external financing at market conditions.
Third, to ensure equal treatment.
Shipyards in other countries as well as other Polish shipyards, have had to reduce considerably their capacity.
Gdansk shipyard cannot be an exception.
Structural funds and other EU assistance have been used by other Member States to tackle the difficult transition period and to support the affected regions.
We have repeatedly reminded the Polish authorities of this possibility.
The Commission has been, and will remain, in close and constructive dialogue with the Polish authorities to seek a way forward in which the conditions for compatibility of the State aid are met and the State aid can be approved.
That process is ongoing.
Gdansk shipyard deserves a viable future by developing a new and sustainable position in the competitive shipbuilding industry of the EU.
on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (PL) Mr President, as the MEP for GdaÅsk I feel I have a two-fold responsibility: firstly, for the fate of 3 000 jobs and an establishment which has symbolic status in Poland, and, secondly, for ensuring that together we comply with the principles of rational economy on which the European Community is based and which has brought prosperity to millions of Europe's inhabitants.
I therefore believe that today's debate will not be a political demonstration.
There is too much politics surrounding the GdaÅsk shipyard.
To date it has been over-exploited politically.
I trust that this will be a step towards finding the best possible solutions.
I also believe that such intentions have motivated the radical left in Parliament, which has called for this debate, but I would point out that they are not idealists seeking a system of social happiness, but practitioners of real socialism, referred to in Poland as "post-Communistsâ, who twice shut down the GdaÅsk shipyard as an act of political revenge, thereby undermining its economic credibility and creating one of the sources of today's problems.
I was a witness to and a modest participant in the collective elation in August 1980 which gave birth to Solidarity, subsequently a movement of 10 million people.
I know that there are among the 3 000 employees of the present shipyard people who at that time risked their lives in the name of human dignity, human rights and other values enshrined among the standards of the European Union.
They did so with courage but also prudence, and without resorting to violence.
Consequently, that approach, which did not involve the use of violence - an instrument of terror - may serve as a guide for us in the twenty-first century.
I would, of course, like the major centres of workers, the shipyards, the mines and the steelworks which formed the mainstay of Solidarity, to lend the shipyard's cause infinitely greater support than isolated dissenting voices abroad, and I would like these centres to now become examples of economic success in the free market.
However, this will be very difficult, even impossible in the short term, as we can see from the experience of major centres of heavy industry in western Europe, which have taken entire decades to turn around economically.
This is the case in particular in the shipbuilding sector, which is faced with competition from the Far East, Korea, China and Vietnam, where low labour costs and, above all, a range of overt and covert forms of State intervention are decisive.
I would like the European Commission too to be aware of the complexity of the situation, because if it is not taken into account frustration will build up and a political populism will take root in our country.
I can understand the frustration of the shipyard workers who have a sense of what they are due historically and who, as they say, are confronted with soulless bureaucracy.
There is also frustration on the part of the European Commission which is dealing with an exceptionally spirited and recalcitrant establishment which would give many an authority a bloody nose.
I know that the workers at this shipyard should not be punished for the rather inappropriate, or simply clumsy, way these things have been handled by the present government.
I also know that the basis for agreement must be a long-term vision and not hastily drafted plans.
That long-term vision means an investor who will equip the shipyard with modern technology to replace the obsolete slipways currently at issue.
And I believe that today's debate is a step in precisely that direction.
on behalf of the PSE group. - (PL) Mr President, it is appropriate that we are having a debate on the GdaÅsk Shipyard.
There are two significant facts here: the first is that it is the anniversary of the signing of the Szczecin agreement of 30 August 1980 and the GdaÅsk agreement of 31 August 1980, and the second very significant fact is the present financial situation of the GdaÅsk Shipyard.
The GdaÅsk Shipyard is a symbol of the historical changes in Poland and also of the major changes that have occurred in Europe and internationally.
Here is where it began.
It is also the GdaÅsk Shipyard that the leaders of the free world came to in the 1980s to encourage perseverance in the fight.
It is here too that people fought for human rights, freedom of expression, free trade unions, human dignity and development along the lines of the then European Economic Community.
It is therefore a living monument of which we should be proud, but it is also a shipyard - perhaps it is now primarily an undertaking producing ships.
The shipyard workers reminded us of this fact a week ago in Brussels.
They did not speak about historical dues but about economic matters, about their lives and their jobs.
Shipbuilding is a global industry.
Ships can easily be bought in Asia and do not necessarily have to be bought in Europe.
In view of what has just been said, Commissioner, in decisions concerning competitiveness we should not concentrate solely on so-called 'fair competition' within the EU.
We need a global approach, that is to say we need to view the shipbuilding industry in the European Union within the global competitive environment and then consider all the conditions surrounding the operation of shipyards within the European Union, including the GdaÅsk and Szczecin Shipyards.
The EU market rules are acceptable and accepted as a principle, but the way in which they are implemented and the relevant timetable must be realistic, and in particular must be addressed at individual entities.
Therefore, there may be certain doubts about privatisation as a means to an end - that is to say privatisation as an end which must be achieved by a certain date.
I therefore call on the Polish Government to work closely with the Commission, and on the shipyard management to manage this undertaking efficiently.
on behalf of the ALDE group. - (PL) Mr President, first of all I would like to say how pleased I am that the European Parliament is considering this matter today and how much I welcome this initiative.
I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for his statement today and to say that it is very important that we think of the European Union as a community.
On entering the European Parliament building we pass a statue, a sculpture, which states L'Europe a un coeur - Europe has a heart.
Translated into political language, it denotes the strength of the European social model.
It is 27 years ago that the GdaÅsk Shipyard workers launched their fight against the Communist system and for bread and freedom.
They wanted to restore the purpose of human labour and to liberate the economy from the State monopoly.
This historic shipyard is now faced with the dramatic European Commission recommendation that its production be reduced by two-thirds and that two slipways be closed in any event.
We consider that in this situation the following steps must be taken.
First, limit closure of the slipways to one and thus restore the shipyard's chances of profitability.
Second, allow time to streamline the shipyard management, since the current management leaves much to be desired (so that it becomes profitable and 3 000 workers do not lose their jobs).
Third, remember that the GdaÅsk Shipyard stands as a major European memorial and testimony to the fact that social solidarity is one of the founding values of the European Union.
However, the European institutions cannot ignore this decision.
The pragmatism of our actions must go hand in hand with an understanding that we are building a Union for people and thanks to people.
Europe's strength depends on our ability to be innovative and competitive but also sensitive to the fate of those who are weaker and less fortunate.
In my view, that is also the sense of the liberal message of freedom.
I would also like to mention a particular memory that I have: that of generations of Europeans in all countries of the European Union who wore the Solidarity badge on their lapels with pride and with hope.
There are such people in this Chamber.
Thus, they are the generation that is building European unity and should be aware of the historical significance of the GdaÅsk Shipyard.
on behalf of the UEN group. - (PL) Mr President, I accompanied workers from the shipyard during their talks with Commissioner Kroes and Commissioner Å pidla.
I was also with them when they appeared before the European Commission and appealed to Europe to help them.
The GdaÅsk Shipyard is now emerging from its financial woes and beginning to operate at a profit.
It would be a great mistake if major financial restrictions were now to prevent it from making a profit and achieving success through the efforts of the people working there and us as a whole.
I would also like to emphasise the historical aspect.
We would not now be here as 27 countries in a united Europe, a Europe free of the threat of nuclear war, had it not been for Solidarity which was born in the GdaÅsk Shipyard.
This is something that everyone needs to remember, including the politicians sitting here.
I would also like to point out that all those who have spoken on this matter so far and, I think, those who will do so later are completely unanimous in their views on this matter, regardless of their political differences.
This must be taken into account.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I welcome the fact that my colleagues in the Conference of Group Presidents have agreed to my proposal to ask the Commission to make a statement to us before any decision is taken on the future of the Gdansk shipyards.
The Directorate-General for Competition did not need this new case to illustrate its thinking.
It has already attracted so much protest that many observers who can hardly be suspected of anti-liberalism have themselves regarded it as dogmatic for some time.
In this instance, a restructuring plan is only seen as convincing if it provides for 1 000 workers to be laid off.
There are plenty of previous examples of companies in difficulties being told to axe hundreds of jobs, failing which they will have to pay back the aid they need to survive.
In the present case, tell us what shipyard operates without subsidies.
I do not think there is any question that the award of subsidies has to be subject to conditions.
But the problem is that those conditions always involve heavy sacrifices for the workers.
In that respect, although the successive Competition Commissioners I have known are not usually noted for their soul-searching and social fibre is clearly not one of their attributes, this time the leading directorate-general of the Commission has gone even further by showing that it is as indifferent to political issues as to social problems.
By threatening the very existence of this place that is so emblematic of Poland, is the Commission considering the political implications of the message it is sending the people of this new Member State, barely three years after its accession?
That is apparently the least of the worries of the guardians of free and undistorted competition.
They think there is a time to celebrate the key role of the Gdansk shipyard workers in the freedom struggle - a historic role, as Mr McCreevy said - and another time to impose the iron laws of the free market on them.
There is still time to stop this irresponsible action.
The first step, in my view, is to start substantive talks with the Polish trade unions, indeed with the European Federation of Metalworkers.
What is needed is to clarify the real amount of aid paid to these shipyards and, above all, to find a solution that avoids job losses.
Apart from that, this new case, which highlights to the point of absurdity the narrowness of the criteria now applied in the name of preventing distortions of competition, reinforces the view of my group that, before any final decision is taken on the future European treaty, it is vital to have a thorough, public and wide-ranging debate on the aims of the Union and whether these are consistent with the policies put into operation.
The story of the Gdansk shipyards is a reminder that a political structure that proves unable to face up to its own contradictions and progress beyond them is doomed.
That lesson is still just as relevant today and some European leaders would do well to reflect on it.
on behalf of the IND/DEM group. - (PL) Mr President, the closure of two of the three slipways at GdaÅsk Shipyard proposed by the European Commission and the possibility of having to reimburse State aid is a great mistake.
It fails to take account of several factors, including previous actions detrimental to the shipyard on the part of political wreckers and dishonest businessmen eager to get their hands on property and land in the city centre.
The dishonest privatisation of the shipyard is currently the subject of legal proceedings.
The Commission has no reliable knowledge about this.
Restructuring of the shipyard has already been carried out, thousands of workers have been laid off, and seven of the ten slipways have been closed down.
At present the shipyard is achieving positive financial results.
The closure of two slipways would destroy that gain and that achievement.
The enormous State aid that shipyards have received in the old Member States has bypassed the GdaÅsk Shipyard.
This does not create a level playing field for competition and also takes no account of the differences in the methods used to calculate the profitability of shipyards.
This blow to the GdaÅsk Shipyard also weakens the shipbuilding industry of the European Union as a whole.
I would remind you that the EU's share of international shipbuilding is three times smaller than that of South Korea alone, which subsidises its shipbuilding industry.
This demonstrates the Commission's lack of concern about the EU's long-term economic interests.
The Commission's intentions are contrary to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
The GdaÅsk shipworkers fought for solidarity, which does not involve the brutal elimination of competitors.
Solidarity is not an empty slogan or compassion but responsibility and fairness and facing up to the truth.
Is the European Union capable of such values today?
(PL) Mr President, the GdaÅsk Shipyard has particular significance for Poland.
It is not only a work establishment but also a political symbol.
In Communist times an attempt was made to destroy it.
The political engagement of the workforce and the support of the entire nation meant that the then authorities were unable to shut it down.
The workforce is conscious of the particular significance of the Shipyard and is responding to threats as they did then - by means of protest.
It would be terrible if an establishment which defended itself against Communist power should collapse under pressure from European Union directives.
It is absolutely essential that the establishment remains a shipyard and that it forms part of the shipbuilding industry and no other.
The reduction in the number of slipways from three to one, proposed by the Commission, would deprive it of its long-term profitability as a shipbuilder.
It needs at least two slipways in order to continue operating profitably as a shipyard.
Poland complies with the financial rules in force, but we know that shipbuilding is not such a sensitive sector of the EU economy that aid for the GdaÅsk Shipyard might distort competition.
The Commission must take account of the special character of the GdaÅsk Shipyard and give it special treatment.
As a symbol of the fight for independence from Communist power, the GdaÅsk Shipyard must remain a shipyard.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the GdaÅsk Shipyard is a great European symbol, the place where in August 1988 Polish workers led by Lech WaÅÄsa began a strike for freedom and justice.
The shipyard became a symbol of the fight for trade union, political and civil rights for the workers' movement throughout the world.
I would like to underline the importance of the initiative by Mr Wurtz which has made it possible to hold a debate on the risk of the collapse of the GdaÅsk Shipyard in the European Parliament today.
I first spoke out in defence of the GdaÅsk Shipyard while still an activist in underground 'Solidarity' in November 1998, when the government of MieczysÅaw Rakowski placed the shipyard into liquidation on the pretext of poor economic results.
Unfortunately, the GdaÅsk Shipyard also became a symbol of the decline of heavy industry and the defencelessness of workers and trade unions in the face of that process, a model example of everything that is defined as 'casino capitalism'.
Little remains of the proud shipyard that was the birthplace of 'Solidarity'.
After 1989 the Solidarity government was unconcerned by the fate of the shipyard.
The establishment became a place of market speculation, on the one hand, and demagogy and populism, on the other.
Following entry into the European Union Polish shipyards received State aid.
The GdaÅsk Shipyard started to restructure and is demonstrating that it can operate profitably.
The current demands by the European Commission for the closure of two of the three slipways used by the shipyard to build ships will make it unprofitable and result in unemployment and tragedy for many workers' families.
In the European Parliament, on the twenty-seventh anniversary of the signing of the August agreements, I would urge prudence in this case.
Commissioner, let us consider a wise compromise which would reconcile the principles of the Single Market, which the Commission upholds, with the interests of three thousand shipyard workers.
Let us save the GdaÅsk Shipyard!
(PL) Mr President, when it talks about the GdaÅsk Shipyard the Commission forgets, in all its pragmatism, a matter much more important than money, namely history.
Had it not been for the Shipyard, neither I nor many other Members from Central and Eastern Europe would be here today.
Had it not been for the changes initiated at the Shipyard the whole of Europe would look very different today - a Europe built on values such as democracy, freedom, equality and respect for human rights, the fight for which is symbolised by the GdaÅsk Shipyard.
It was the strikes at that shipyard that began the dismantling of Communism.
To find a symbol of the European Union we need look no further than the place where we are and remember that in the name of post-war reconciliation between two nations we are able to spend over EUR 200 million a year on the monthly move to Strasbourg.
Why not also give financial support to the GdaÅsk Shipyard, which symbolises the end of the Cold War and the liberation of the whole of Central and Eastern Europe from the yoke of Communism?
I therefore make this appeal: let us not allow the Shipyard to collapse, let us not destroy the birthplace of 'Solidarity', and let us not measure the historical value of the Shipyard in euros.
Mr President, Commissioner, you have yourself recognised the very important political symbolism of the GdaÅsk shipyards and all that they evoke.
But, of course, the shipyards are more than simply that symbolism.
They are the cornerstone of a whole regional economy, directly and indirectly providing thousands of jobs.
The closure or the running-down of the GdaÅsk shipyard could devastate the whole regional economy, destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
Commissioner, you have spoken about the importance of competition, the importance of the free market.
I would like to hear you speak about the importance of those jobs.
I would like to see you recognise the strategic importance of this shipyard for Poland - and, indeed, of this industry for the European Union as a whole.
I think this controversy lays bare, once again, rules on state aid and exactly where EU policy is directed.
I think it would be ironic and almost tragic if the demise of GdaÅsk and all that it symbolises was due to the heavy hand of EU policy, which is wedded to the dynamic of competition, the market economy - to the exclusion of all else, it seems to me.
(PL) Mr President, no one denies that the rules of the Single Market and competition are the driving force behind the European economy which guarantees its swift development.
Work establishments which do not face up to this challenge will have difficulties, including liquidation, and it is obvious that the employees of those establishments will protest.
However, last week's protest by Polish shipyard workers must be viewed differently.
They did not come to Brussels to complain in order to arouse sympathy or ask for money.
They wanted to protest against a decision which they considered to be another death sentence on their shipyard, and will put at least a thousand workers on the street.
So what is the issue as far as they are concerned?
To the shipyard workers who were in Brussels the issue is one of a level playing field and ensuring that the Commission decision is based on reliable, verified information, because reality shows that the shipyard is getting off the ground and that it finally has a chance of being a profitable undertaking.
EU law has allowed additional aid in similar situations.
We have examples set out in the Treaty when the eastern German LÃ€nder benefited from such aid.
I also want to emphasise that it was not a protest by the Polish government. Those protesting were citizens of the European Union - shipyard workers with a right to do so, who organised themselves and came to draw our attention to the fact that something wrong is happening.
We should welcome that fact because that is how we build a civic society.
And one final thing: their presence in Brussels also demonstrates the fact that they have enormous trust in the European Union and that trust is expressed by Polish society as a whole.
Neither we nor the European Union should fail to live up to that trust.
(PL) Mr President, last week a delegation of Polish shipyard workers came to Brussels to protest against the Commission's decision to close down two slipways, which would result in mass lay-offs.
The shipyard workers believe that the Commission's approach to their workplace is too rigorous and unfair.
After discussions with Commissioner Kroes and Commissioner Å pidla the shipyard workers returned to Poland with high hopes.
The Commission should, as announced, undertake a further thorough review of the shipyard's situation.
I would like to add that since Poland acceded to the European Union about a million people have left my country looking for work abroad, and this figure is continuing to increase.
If the European Commission sticks to its decision it will result in unavoidable redundancies for thousands of workers at the shipyard, who, at the present time, have been managing to hold their own in the competitive EU market.
There are some concerns about the partiality of the Commission and its support for another shipyard lobby.
I am sure it would be possible to find a satisfactory solution for both sides in the maze of often-contradictory regulations.
I would therefore like to add my name to the call to change the decision against the shipyard and to treat the GdaÅsk Shipyard not just as an ordinary shipbuilding works, but also as a national and European symbol.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, may I just emphasise that the Commission understands the historic significance of the GdaÅsk shipyard and the sensitivity of the case.
We all agree on the objective that the GdaÅsk shipyard should be restructured to make it a viable yard.
This is the process that the Commission wants to encourage.
However, the Commission has the responsibility to do so while ensuring a level playing field in the European shipbuilding market and consistency in the treatment of companies under restructuring.
I would hope that the ongoing discussions between the Polish authorities and the Commission can lead to a satisfactory outcome.
The debate is closed.

Announcement by the President
Colleagues, as you can see, two new information screens have been installed in the Chamber.
They are larger and offer many more possibilities than the screens which have been replaced.
This is the first step in an ongoing project to improve the quality and the presentation of information concerning proceedings in the plenary, both for Members and the public.
In particular, after each roll-call vote, a graphic overview of the Chamber will be briefly displayed, showing voting patterns across the House.
This new feature, familiar in many national parliaments, merely reflects information which is in any case published in detail in the 'Results of Votes' annex to the Minutes of the proceedings.
However, further to a decision by Parliament's Bureau yesterday evening, the Conference of Presidents, in their sublime wisdom, will decide on Thursday if the group chairs wish to make use of this aspect of the system on a permanent basis in the future.
In the mean time, political groups were consulted this morning and agreed to permit the use of this graphic display on an experimental basis at our voting session this morning.

(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had asked to speak on an issue connected with our work schedule: the fact that the new school year has coincided for some years, and will unfortunately coincide again next year, with our plenary poses major family problems for our Members and for many of our officials.
In my view, this is a question that Parliament should debate, because the well-being of our children, who should be taken to school by their parents, is a matter that it behoves this Parliament to address.
(Applause)

(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
in writing. - (PT) We have here an initiative from the Republic of Finland, the aim of which is to adapt the rules on analysis files to the legislation in force.
In fact, the 2003 Protocol which entered into force in April this year modifies Title III of the Europol Convention and, particularly, the part relating to the creation of analysis files and the collection, processing, use and deletion of the personal data contained in such files.
This means that the implementing rules that were adopted will have to be amended accordingly.
This is therefore a measure which, though temporary, is necessary and appropriate.
In fact, the measure will be in force for a limited period, as all previous legislation will be repealed when the Council Decision establishing a European Police Office enters into force.
(DE) Mr President, I voted for this resolution but there is one point that I should like to highlight - the reference to the creation of a European protection force.
We have a tendency, here in the European Parliament, to react to specific events by calling immediately for the creation of a new institution or the establishment of a new position.
In this case, the point must be clearly made, once again, that responsibility for dealing with natural disasters simply cannot and should not be taken out of the Member States' hands: on the contrary, it is primarily their responsibility, and it lies within their authority, to take preventive measures and to ensure that fire services have the best possible equipment and training so that they can combat disasters effectively.
In exceptional cases only, in the event of extreme catastrophe, there will of course also be recourse to support and solidarity from the European Union, which will be asked to step in.
The primary responsibility, however, must remain with the Member States.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on natural disasters because it has been demonstrated yet again that Europe is not invulnerable in these extreme situations and that it needs the solidarity of the EU.
One thing must be clear, however: greatly improved coordination is needed and the situation should not be allowed to arise where EU Member States need additional assistance from third countries because we are not in a position to provide the necessary help ourselves.
The challenge for the Member States is to develop better organised aid structures, particularly where volunteers are used, for example by providing the best possible training and equipment for fire brigades.
The disposal of dead pets and wild animals is a major problem that needs to be tackled as soon as possible, both to prevent the risk of outbreaks of disease and also to reduce environmental damage.
(DE) Mr President, I too voted for the resolution, although it is my opinion that these dreadful forest fires should not be allowed to cause further bloating of the EU institutions.
As I see it, neither a European civil protection agency nor a European disaster intervention force will be capable of affording effective protection against natural disasters in the European Union.
They are more likely to produce increased red tape and increased costs.
What we need to do, therefore, is to improve international cooperation in order to be prepared for future natural disasters, and we need to maintain our fire services and also our woods and forests sufficiently well so that future disasters simply do not occur on this scale.
Mr President, I have to say that in my own Group's voting list this resolution on natural disasters is described as forest fires, but the natural disasters in Europe over the summer were actually wider than that and I wish to raise the issue in my own region of the worst floods in over a century.
A third of a million people were without drinking water for more than a week.
4 000 homes were severely damaged and tens of thousands forced to evacuate at a total cost of EUR 150 million.
I am hoping that my government will apply for assistance from the European Commission to enable the county and the towns in my region and elsewhere in Britain to actually get some recompense for the costs that are inevitably going to fall on very narrow sections of the population.
The title of the motion for a resolution is 'natural disasters' and it has been corrected.
Mr President, I just want to echo what Mr Ford said about the natural disasters in the UK.
People may not be aware, but 40 000 residential properties were flooded.
Nine hundred schools have been affected.
Mainline railway lines are still closed.
Agricultural land has been affected, including 75% of the pea crop in the UK.
In my own region of Yorkshire and the Humber, many thousands of people were affected and many are still unable to return to their properties.
What we want from the Commission, given that the UK Government has now applied for solidarity funding, is a rapid response to that application, but at the same time we need all the EU institutions to make climate change a top priority.
When we have a major piece of legislation coming through this House in the next few months, I hope that colleagues will bear in mind the natural disasters of this summer and make sure that we make our contribution to tackling the long-term issue of climate change, and I hope there will be no more of these natural disasters on the scale we have seen this summer.
Mr President, I too want to support the application for funds from the European Commission.
My region, the South-East of England region, suffered equally badly, especially in Oxfordshire and parts of Berkshire, and my colleague Mr Hannan and I have made an application to the European Commission for emergency funds.
The reason I am standing up now is to ask the Commission to expedite the funding of relief and the restoration to normality of my region, the South-East of England.
in writing. - (FR) In voting for the resolution on the natural disasters that have occurred this summer, I wanted to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and those living in the devastated regions.
This is also a message of thanks to all the professionals, volunteers and local authorities that helped to fight the fires and rescue the flood victims.
I believe that there is now an urgent need to put emergency Community aid measures, especially financial measures, in place to help regenerate the regions where there has been severe damage.
We also need to restore the productive potential of the areas affected, try to encourage the creation of more jobs and take appropriate steps to offset the social costs arising from the loss of jobs and other sources of revenue.
I am still concerned at the increasing number of disasters caused by extreme weather conditions, which experts believe are largely due to the climate change that is causing global warming.
I therefore urge the Commission to take steps to guarantee compliance with the Kyoto commitments and their repercussions.
in writing. - While supporting and voting for the Joint Motion for a Resolution on Natural Disasters, British Conservatives have misgivings about the creation of a "European force" (paragraph 9) since we believe that both prevention and rapid reaction capabilities should be concentrated on the resources of the Member States.
in writing. - (PT) We consider this resolution to be a good one and we propose to vote for it, but we must draw attention to the absence of any important proposals (despite several references to previous EP resolutions) and the insistence on others about which we have major doubts.
Thus, we must insist on the need to review the Solidarity Fund regulation to cover regional disasters, create mechanisms to support the people affected and assist reforestation, with due attention to the prevention of major disasters caused by climate change.
There should be a public agricultural insurance scheme, financed by the European Union, to guarantee farmers a minimum income in situations of public emergency such as droughts, fires and floods.
It is essential to opt for a policy of prevention to address the problem of natural disasters particularly affecting the Mediterranean area, and to introduce radical changes in the CAP to combat the decline in small and medium-sized farms and family farms by encouraging agricultural production, biodiversity and occupation of the land.
We have doubts about the Community civil protection mechanism because it may turn out to be yet another way of removing important aspects of national sovereignty, such as the management of natural resources, particularly forest and woodland.
in writing. - (PL) For some years now we have been opening the autumn session of Parliament with discussions of the tragic consequences of natural disasters that affect Europe in the summer.
Droughts, heat waves, floods and fires are devastating Europe.
When we add to this the industrial catastrophes caused by forces of nature, then we see a picture of Europe whose citizens stand helplessly before the destructive power of nature.
Over 60 people died this year in the fires in Greece, many families lost everything they owned, and thousands of hectares of forests and olive-groves went up in smoke.
This is a truly tragic picture.
I know what such a tragedy means.
My own country has been affected by floods and we have had many victims of tragic mining accidents.
For this reason I would like to offer my sympathy and European solidarity to the families and loved ones of the victims of the Greek disaster as well as to the inhabitants of regions affected by the fires.
At the same time, I do not think that Europe can afford to be passive in the face of such events.
This does not just mean EU financial assistance that will make it possible to rebuild the regions affected by disasters.
First of all, we must prepare a more effective prevention and early warning mechanism within the EU, which, even if it does not make it possible to avoid disasters, would certainly have an impact on reducing their effects.
Even though the protection of the population against disasters is the responsibility of every State, we should think about a more effective monitoring of national crisis control policies, and perhaps even about a joint rapid reaction force in the event of such disasters.
in writing. - (PT) I should like to express our deepest sorrow for the victims of the serious forest fires in the spring - particularly in Greece - and our solidarity with their families and with all those affected.
Deeds, not words, are needed now.
The EU must activate the necessary financial instruments and means to meet the material needs of the people affected and to promote the social, economic and environmental recovery of the regions involved.
In the light of the points raised so far, I recall some of the proposals which we presented in 2003 and 2005 and which remain as relevant as ever:
Maintain the eligibility of regional disasters for aid under the Solidarity Fund;
Recognise natural disasters specifically affecting the Mediterranean area where more than 90% of forest fires and drought are recorded;
Create a Community programme for the protection of forest and woodland against fire;
Examine the possibility of creating an agricultural disaster fund;
Pay special attention to the least-favoured regions in the event of natural disasters.
Lastly, I should like to point out that if the funds allocated to ever-increasing military appropriations were spent instead on preventing and combating natural disasters and on recovery in the areas affected, the incidence and consequences of such disasters would be significantly reduced.
in writing. - (FR) At the end of August, Greece experienced its worst natural disaster ever.
The first partial toll of the huge fires that swept through large areas of the Peloponnese was 63 dead, over 40 000 head of cattle burnt to death, 250 000 olive trees burnt and hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest gone up in smoke.
The three days of national mourning announced by the Prime Minister, Kostas Karamanlis, cannot cover up for the total failure of the State to protect its citizens and come to the aid of villagers surrounded by flames, in a country where scorching summers and fire risks are a common occurrence.
Everywhere there was evidence not just of undermanning and equipment shortages, but also of the failure to plan ahead and to coordinate operations.
Like the previous PASOK governments, the New Democracy government did nothing to prevent the scale and horror of the fires.
With a total lack of scruple and for purely political reasons, the Prime Minister announced, even as the fires were breaking out all over Greece, that the general elections would take place as planned.
In support of the Greeks who have suffered as victims of their politicians, let us hope that in future irresponsible governments will be replaced by responsible governments.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the summer's natural disasters and particularly welcome the existence of the EU's Solidarity Fund, which is available to help Member States deal with the aftermath of such disasters.
It is a useful expression of solidarity that genuinely helps EU countries and citizens in moments of great need.
in writing. - (IT) The terrible fires which struck Greece and southern Italy in particular this summer, leaving victims in their wake and destroying thousands of hectares of woodland and agricultural land, again highlight the urgent need for better coordination of rapid reaction measures by Member States' civil protection forces.
To that end, it is now clear that a European Civil Protection Agency needs to be set up to coordinate and manage measures to eradicate or prevent the causes of disasters.
That Agency - which the writer has proposed that the Commission set up on a number of occasions, on the basis of the positive experience of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency - would not just be responsible for combating the devastating fires that cause enormous damage every year in the Mediterranean countries, but would also take swift action to tackle the emergencies following on from all kinds of disasters brought about by natural events, such as the floods from which Bulgaria has recently suffered, or man-made events.
It has to be stressed that disasters may be supranational in nature, and Europe should not just rely solely on the generosity of volunteers or on the competences and resources of the particular State that has been affected, but should have enough human and financial resources and appropriate equipment to enable swift action to be taken.
in writing. - (PT) For the sake of consistency, in view of what we have said in the past and what we expect from the European Solidarity Fund, I shall clearly be voting for this resolution.
But this vote is not just about consistency.
European integration, among countless other advantages, has the advantage of scale and the economies of scale that come with solidarity.
Without in any way diminishing the responsibilities of Member States and their governments, it is possible and desirable through an effort of solidarity at European level to face the disasters that are caused by nature and its increasing unpredictability rather than by any mistakes in the management of the land.
However, while insisting on this point, we cannot leave the human factor out of account, when a criminal starts a fire or when a plan for the land opens the way for such disasters or exacerbates their consequences.
I therefore believe it is time to review many of our policies, particularly in the area of forest and woodland management and rural development but not only in that area: we also need to look at our environmental measures, so as to prevent Man from becoming even more destructive than the destructive force of Nature.
in writing. - (FR) Over 60 dead and 184 000 hectares of land gone up in smoke: that is the toll of the fires that swept through Greece at the end of August.
Europe was not a passive observer.
Solidarity came fully into play through the 'European rapid reaction instrument' that we voted for last March, a joint civil protection system in which 30 States make resources such as Canadairs, tankers and qualified personnel ('green berets') available to countries suffering man-made or natural disasters.
I am not fanatical about the systematic transfer of competences to Europe, but I do believe that a Community civil protection system is worthwhile, because natural disasters know no borders.
I have said so several times in this House, especially at the time of the disastrous fires in Portugal in 2003.
The European Union urgently needs to demonstrate its benefits.
It must serve as a model, so that there is solidarity between all the citizens of Europe, and not just in this particular disaster.
in writing. - (FR) The catastrophic storm in December 1999, floods in Central Europe in 2002, fires in Portugal and Spain in 2004, and now fires in Greece in which people have lost their lives, and also in Romania and Bulgaria: each time there is a strong emotional response, each time Europe sympathises, each time the Commission promises to improve its solidarity and its aid mechanisms.
Right here, on 18 January 2000 in fact, I called for the creation of a public safety Eurocorps, and the idea was taken up by Commissioner Barnier in his May 2006 report.
Right here in this Parliament, we have called in vain for the renewal of the 1992 regulation under which funding would be provided for fire-prevention equipment such as firebreaks, access roads and monitoring systems.
Now we must not wait for the next disaster, for more victims. Let us put the Barnier proposal into practice.
There is a military Eurocorps.
Surely Europe can set up a public safety Eurocorps for itself, to protect its citizens against natural and accidental risks?
Then we should ask Member States to draw up plans to prevent forest fires and help them, encourage them, to finance these through a specific financing instrument similar to that in the old 1992 regulation.
When we are facing climate change, it is in the interests of the whole of Europe to introduce ambitious prevention policies.
(SK) As far as the regions are concerned, given that their role in the legislative process means that they are often directly responsible for implementing and enforcing EU law, the efforts to achieve better regulation are extremely important.
Bodies at different levels of national and local government, economic and social partners, representatives of civil society and non-governmental organisations must - as far as possible - participate actively in the consultation process on European law-making.
Equally important is their role in the assessing the influence and effect of this legislation on the Member States.
This will increase the quality, clarity and transparency of the regulations being prepared, while taking account of local and regional conditions and differences.
In this way we will also prevent wrong interpretations as well as delays in the transposition and implementation of legislation.
(SK) Within the scope of my parliamentary mandate I come across citizens' complaints that during the transposition of EU legislation some Member States impose on them obligations that go beyond the requirements of the laws in question.
The citizens are afflicted by needless administrative burdens that make them antipathetic towards the EU legislation that is being adopted.
I voted in favour of the report on better regulation in the European Union, which incorporated my amendments, as it presents a great opportunity to approach European legislation from a new angle.
European laws are drafted with the aim of simplifying the lives of EU citizens and are not meant to burden them; that is why they have to be drafted in a simple and intelligible way, with the emphasis on quality not quantity.
At the same time, if the relevant parties at all levels are informed about the transposition of EU legislation efficiently and in time, this will ensure that the citizens have greater confidence in the European project.
in writing. - I voted for this report on better regulation in the EU.
I strongly support regulation being done in a least-cost and most efficient way, to help the development of a more competitive European economy and deliver better social, environmental and economic outcomes at the same time.
in writing. - British Conservatives believe it is unfortunate that paragraph three appears vague in seeming to support "any" initiative in the enforcement of Community law.
British Conservatives support the enforcement of Community law but wish to analyse and consider any initiative proposed by the Commission.
Otherwise, we believe that this report is an excellent exposition.
in writing. - I voted for this report on how EU law- and regulation-making can best be done.
More effective and streamlined regulatory and legal frameworks will deliver EU-wide improvements in social and economic outcomes, generate more jobs and improve our quality of life.
in writing. - (PT) The report states that simplifying the legislative environment to ensure the clarity, efficacy and quality of legislation is an essential prerequisite for attaining the objective of better law-making which, in turn, is a priority for the European Union.
In the meantime, it states that some 500 new legislative initiatives (200 of which in 2007 alone) have been included in a separate rolling programme specifically dedicated to codifications, showing the bureaucratic complexity of the European Union.
It also notes that the simplification being promoted at European level should be accompanied by appropriate simplification at national level to ensure that the advantages of Community simplification are not undermined by national rules or technical barriers.
However, a distinction must be made between purely bureaucratic matters and cases where rights may be called into question.
We agree with the proposal that the Commission once and for all adopt recasting as a standard legislative technique so that, for each initiative, the text can be available in its entirety, also where there are specific amendments, providing a clear indication of the new parts and those which are unchanged, thereby increasing the legibility and transparency of Community legislation.
in writing. - I voted for this resolution on better regulation.
As a socialist, I have no difficulty in putting further burdens on industry to protect health and safety, the environment or raise the minimum wage.
Yet I want value for money.
The End of Vehicle Life Directive that came into force some years ago was estimated by the British Cabinet Office to have cost the economy GBP 400 million (EUR 590 million) while providing environmental and social benefits at a level of GBP 100 million (EUR 150 million) per annum.
If these figures are anything like accurate, this directive was a political and environmental failure.
We want costs to industry (and society) where there is a large multiplier as to benefits with costs of GBP 100 million providing EUR 500 million in benefits.
Implementing the recommendations for in future cost benefit analysis of proposed legislation will do exactly that.
in writing. - (SV) We believe that traditional legislation and the open method of coordination can live side-by-side and that both are still needed.
We do not therefore share the view that the open method of coordination must be used only in exceptional cases.
It should also continue to be used when harmonisation is not desirable or practicable.
We do, however, share the view that the European Parliament should participate more fully when the open method of coordination is used.
in writing. - British Conservatives support the broad thrust of the Medina Ortega report, which sets clear boundaries on the promotion and use of Community law.
Concerning paragraph 18, we wish to make it clear that Conservatives do not support closer European integration but share the view that there is a current mistrust relating to the EU institutions which these proposals may help to alleviate.
in writing. - (PT) We agree with the rapporteur that the notion of non-binding legal instruments (soft law instruments) based on common practice is ambiguous and pernicious and should not be used in any documents of the Community institutions, although we disagree with other points in the report.
Such soft law instruments, which can legitimately be used as interpretative or preparatory tools for binding legislative acts, should neither be treated as legislation nor be given any norm-setting effectiveness, and it is for each country to decide on their use, in particular where they cast light on the interpretation of national measures adopted to implement them or where they are designed to supplement binding Community provisions.
Clearly, so-called non-binding legal instruments cannot be a substitute for legal acts and instruments, which are available to ensure the continuity of the legislative process.
The Commission must therefore give special consideration to the effect of soft law on consumers and their possible means of redress before proposing any measure involving soft law instruments.
in writing. - (CS) This report is very important in the context of improving and simplifying the Community's legal environment.
I would particularly like to stress its importance with regard to the need to strengthen the European Parliament's role in the legislative process and its importance in terms of eliminating the democratic deficit.
I also fully support the desire to establish methods of consultation with the European Parliament on the adoption of so-called non-binding legal acts, especially since these acts are fairly common: they often earn attributes such as 'unclear' and 'inefficient', and their excessive use may be a manifestation of exceeding the scope of the Commission's.
In addition, the public may identify the image of European 'superbureaucracy' with these acts.
Although the report recommends that soft law should not be used in official Community documents and that the distinction between dura lex and mollis lex should not be recognised, I do not consider this to be a relevant issue.
The difference between binding and non-binding acts of the Community is a matter of fact and this recommendation does not change either the reality of their existence or their essence.
In addition, the fact that the soft rules of secondary Community law are not legally binding does not mean that they have no legal value.
Think, for example, of their importance in the interpretation of legal acts.
Furthermore, if a Community body does not issue a recommendation or does not express an opinion in cases where it is obliged to do so, it can be accused of being passive.
However, this last comment is a technical one and does not detract from the report as a whole.
(PL) Mr President, today we approved a report in which we carried out a review of the functioning of the European Union's common market.
The common market, which consists of the free movement of persons, services, capital and goods, has encouraged significant economic growth, increased employment and improved competitiveness in the European economy.
However, to improve its functioning, existing barriers and unnecessary regulation should be abolished.
It is still the case, unfortunately, that some countries restrict the movement of workers from the new Member States.
It is also important to inform our citizens, investors and businessmen about the benefits and opportunities presented by the common internal market.
A unified market, without boundaries or restrictions, is the fundamental pillar of the European Union.
The common market brings our whole community closer together and binds us together, introducing transparent principles for competition and encouraging the growth of entrepreneurship.
The common market must, however, take into account social cohesion, employment issues, protection for the environment and for the consumer.
A particularly important issue are measures to reduce the administrative burden in the European Union.
Mr President, paragraph 16 of the Toubon report regrets that insufficient emphasis was placed on the potential contribution of nuclear power.
My vote against this phrase is on the assumption that it was referring to nuclear fission, with which I and many others have a problem in terms of the disposal of radioactive waste and the legacy of decommissioning.
Any emphasis on the potential contribution from nuclear fusion, however, while still some way in the future, would deserve support.
Paragraph 32 refers to harmonisation in the area of taxation, amongst others, and also urges the Commission to push ahead with its proposals concerning a common consolidated corporate tax base.
The Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group is firmly opposed to any harmonisation of direct taxation, including corporate taxation, and we will continue to reject any proposals which weaken that position.
So, despite many excellent points in the Toubon report, my colleagues and I had to abstain.
in writing. - (SV) We consider that the report has a well-balanced view of the internal market and in particular welcome the provisions on the social and environmental impact assessments which must form the basis of new policy initiatives.
We do not, however, share the view on the contribution of nuclear power and believe that the report is unclear on tax matters.
For example, we are uncertain about the initiatives that the Commission must take as regards excise duties and VAT and point out that tax levels fall within the competence of the Member States.
We are also uncertain about which trade defence measures are referred to in the report.
Even though we had wished to see stronger provisions on social clauses, we have voted in favour of the report as a whole because we welcome the review and the broad thrust of the report.
in writing. - The first 10 years of the internal market added EUR 877 billion to the EU economy. It helped to create 2.5 million jobs.
These facts speak for themselves that the single market is working.
As a trading nation, Ireland can only benefit from a fully functioning single market.
Ensuring competitiveness is a vital element in the policy mix of a fully functioning single market.
I do not accept that the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) will not hamper EU competitiveness as proposed in the Toubon report.
The CCCTB is the backdoor to tax harmonisation.
It is vital that Member Sates have the flexibility to use taxation in different ways and at different rates to achieve their social and economic objectives - tax harmonisation would prevent this.
The Toubon report contains many favourable points with regard to the knowledge society for a sustainable EU, for an EU open to the world and for a well-regulated EU.
However, I abstained on the final vote because I firmly believe that the EU is best served by promoting tax competition, not tax harmonisation.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against the report on the Single Market Review: tackling barriers and inefficiencies through better implementation and enforcement.
I do not agree with the approach by the rapporteur, Mr Toubon, in which opening up to competition in the Single Market would not be subject to any limits or social regulation.
I also voted against the further liberalisation of the postal service advocated in the report and I am sorry that the amendments on social and fiscal harmonisation were rejected.
Furthermore, I deplore the new reference to the introduction of an unrestricted transatlantic single market and stress that priority should be given to safeguarding and promoting the European social model.
In my opinion, completion of the Single Market should be regulated by guarantees of social protection for the citizens of Europe, which is not proposed in the Toubon report, the only European Parliament contribution to the Single Market Review.
in writing. - (FR) The French Socialists have voted in favour of the Toubon report on the Single Market Review and its adaptation to the twenty-first century, since it refers to important aspects that are sometimes ignored when discussing the completion of the Single Market.
Thus social and territorial cohesion and up-to-date services of general interest go hand in hand with the completion of the Single Market. We have, nonetheless, voted against paragraph 24 on the liberalisation of postal services.
The report also lays emphasis on consumer protection, which is closely linked to the completion of the European Single Market and has to be guaranteed.
Lastly, the environmental aspect has to be included in the requirements for the internal market, which is an asset for the European Union provided that those general principles are observed.
One important point in the report is SMEs and facilitating their access to the European internal market as a whole, in view of the vital role that they and the craft industries play in European employment and innovation.
I particularly support the determination expressed by the rapporteur to take active and effective steps against counterfeiting, which is a real plague on the European economy.
in writing. - (PT) This report has a very strong neoliberal bias, showing once again that the European Parliament is bent on ever more liberalisation, more returns on capital for business and financial groups that are already recording profits of 35% or more.
So, after a eulogy on the great benefits that the Single Market delivers (to big business and financial groups), we are told that there are still protectionist attitudes and that it is essential to combat them and to move forward in other areas, such as financial services, tax policy, transport, postal services and energy, which are not yet fully liberalised and integrated.
By distorting reality, they seek to mask the real effects of the Single Market, such as the increase in costs, the reduction in services and the quality of services, the job losses, to name but a few.
This report is an attempt to encourage further liberalisation of public services, further transfers of political power from national to transnational level, and further attacks on consumers' and workers' rights, and we must therefore vote against it.
in writing. - (SV) The June List shares the rapporteur's general position, that the internal market is one of the EU's greatest success stories and that it must be further developed and improved.
We are opposed, however, to many of the specific proposals made in the report.
We strongly oppose the provisions on tax harmonisation, the welcome given to the euro, and the need for the Member States to liberalise postal services, which are a public service to be regulated first and foremost by each Member State.
Lastly, we agree that the legal situation as regards services of general interest is unclear.
We have chosen to vote against Amendment 12/rev tabled by the PPE-DE and Amendment 4 tabled by the PSE, however, because the long-term result of the provision made in those amendments will be that further power is transferred to the European Court of Justice.
On the basis of the above arguments, we have chosen to vote against the report in the final vote.
in writing. - British Conservatives have been at the forefront of the campaign to create a fully functioning and effective single market.
We welcome the Toubon report and its emphatic support for continued action in making the single market dynamic, outward-looking and flexible, while at the same time ensuring that it delivers real benefits for citizens.
In that context, British Conservatives have argued that tax policy must remain under the complete control of EU Member States, and that 'one size fits all' policies at EU level threaten the economic dynamism and global competitiveness that are so critical to Europe's future.
We have therefore voted against calls for a common consolidated corporate tax base.
in writing. - (SV) Even though the report includes some positive provisions I have chosen to vote against it.
Aside from the provisions on nuclear power which I cannot support, the report criticises excise duties and minimum harmonisation in consumer affairs, which could in future have negative repercussions for both Swedish alcohol policy and consumer protection.
I welcome the review but wanted to see stronger provisions on social clauses and I believe that the report is not as balanced as it should have been.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by Mr Toubon on the Single Market Review and I support the positive approach of the rapporteur to one of the most important pillars of the European Union.
The four freedoms that make up the Single Market - the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital - must be further encouraged and developed to ensure that everyone benefits fully from the advantages of the Single Market.
As regards the free movement of services, I think it is a great pity that more emphasis has not been placed on the importance of the country of origin principle, which has already been severely undermined by the services directive, in the achievement of a real Single Market and in the creation of jobs.
I also believe that observance of the country of origin principle for VAT on distance selling and e-commerce is the only viable basis for a coherent and transparent tax framework to allow the free movement of goods.
In my view, tax competition is in no way an obstacle to the completion of the Single Market; on the contrary, it encourages economic operators to defend their freedoms in regard to free movement within the Single Market.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report on the Single Market Review which the Commission is working on.
In particular I welcome the focus on improving regulation throughout the Union, and the focus on providing legal certainty for services of general interest.
The Danish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Schaldemose, Mr JÃžrgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against paragraph 18, which concerns the Commission's review of the consumer acquis.
The delegation believes that minimum harmonisation is necessary whilst such great disparities remain in the level of consumer protection in the Member States.
The delegation also disagrees with paragraph 26, which states that the present VAT and excise duty systems are a barrier to the completion of the Single Market.
The delegation believes that the wording, among other things, conflicts with the Danish system of excise duties.
However, the delegation wishes to emphasise its support for better implementation of the Single Market.
in writing. - I wish to explain that I cannot support paragraph 32 of the report, which calls for broad tax harmonisation, or the harmonisation of corporate taxes, nor recital O, which criticises these Member States that guard their prerogatives in regard to tax issues.
Member States must be free to determine their own taxation policy as part of national fiscal policy.
In regard to paragraph 40, part 2, I will vote in favour of this because I have concerns that on a number of issues Member States use EU legislation to 'gold plate' their own national laws, and then blame the EU for any subsequent criticism that may come their way.
I will also vote for paragraph 16, part 2, which states insufficient attention has been given to nuclear energy as a tool with which to tackle climate change in a balanced way and would hope that as a result a discussion could start based on facts and not on fears with regard to the role that nuclear energy can bring to climate change as part of a well balanced energy policy.
in writing. - I voted against this report because amendments favouring tax harmonisation were passed and included in the report.
I am resolutely opposed to any measure favouring harmonisation of taxes across the EU.
There is a constant attempt to slip these measures in as amendments, and even in the body of reports, and I will oppose them at every opportunity.
The Commission should be more forthright about its intentions on this subject coming up to the referendum on the Reform Treaty.

Formal sitting - Portugal
Welcome to the European Parliament, Mr Cavaco Silva.
It is a great pleasure for the European Parliament to receive the President of the Portuguese Republic.
(DE) Mr President, colleagues, it is a great pleasure for me and for all of us to welcome the President of the Republic of Portugal, Mr AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva, to the European Parliament today.
Mr President, during your 10 years as Prime Minister of Portugal, you consolidated the country's democratic institutions and successfully promoted its economic development.
As a forward-thinking European, you guided Portugal with a sure hand on the road to European Union membership.
I see that the President of the European Commission, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso, is here too, and of course I should also point out that Portugal has recently taken over the Presidency of the Union.
You too, Mr Barroso, are warmly welcome today.
It is 10 years since a President of the Portuguese Republic last addressed the European Parliament.
Since then we have come a long way together.
You are here today in the Parliament in Strasbourg, as President of Portugal, to mark your country's third EU Presidency.
Portugal's three Presidencies can best be summed up as 'ambitious on the Community's behalf', for on each occasion Portugal has tackled vital contemporary issues - the Lisbon Strategy, for example, or the EU's relations with Africa and with South America.
This Presidency is no exception.
On Portugal's agenda this time are the successful conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference and adoption of the Reform Treaty; the strengthening of foreign and security policy and, in particular, the development of closer relations with Latin America, Africa and the Mediterranean region; further action on climate change; and realisation of the Lisbon Strategy.
The discoveries that were made in all quarters of the globe by the navigators who sailed from Lisbon in the 14th century were effectively the first step towards globalisation.
That opening to the world and the culture of tolerance that your country has developed down the centuries constitute particularly valuable experience in the context of today's globalisation, and they are thus an advantage to us in European Union.
Portugal's efforts to develop relations with Latin America and to pursue contacts with South America, through its special relationship with Brazil, very much reflect our own view.
Your culture of tolerance and your global outlook represent an opportunity in today's world.
Under this Presidency, your country will be able to build on the work of the 14th-century explorers with the same courage that they had and the same persistence.
We wish you much luck and success in your task.
(Applause)
President of the Portuguese Republic. - (PT) Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen,
I should like to express my thanks to the President of the European Parliament for his kind words and my deep appreciation for the invitation to be here today.
It is an honour for me to have this opportunity to address you all, representatives of the peoples of Europe and members of this great European institution, the European Parliament.
I am well aware of the decisive role this Parliament has played in the successful process of European integration.
I have not forgotten the intense and fruitful collaboration with this institution in 1992 when, as prime minister, I led the first Portuguese Presidency of the Council whose motto, you may remember, was Towards European Union.
The European Parliament's contribution was fundamental to the establishment of a strong internal market and to the progress of the project for European Union born of Maastricht.
Now, for the third time, my country holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
And, once again, we face great challenges.
Challenges that call for convergence in the political will of the Member States and the European institutions.
More than ever before, it is essential to concentrate our collective energies and determination on what is really needed to make Europe stronger and more cohesive.
This is ultimately what the citizens of Europe expect of their leaders.
The Portuguese Presidency will do everything in its power to establish the convergence that is indispensable to progress in the construction of Europe.
I trust, in particular, that we shall have the frank and open collaboration with the European Parliament that we had during the previous Portuguese Presidencies.
One of the Presidency's priorities is to conclude the Reform Treaty based on the agreement reached at the June European Council.
An agreement which I regard as a very important step, one which I hope will enable us to move on from a period marked by a certain erosion of the process of European construction.
I therefore call for a concerted effort to ensure that the new Treaty is concluded during the Portuguese Presidency.
Once the negotiations are over and that chapter is closed, the European Union must concentrate with increased consistency and renewed confidence on the challenges that are of concern to the citizens of Europe: economic growth, employment, security, the environment, energy, and globalisation.
This is the agenda on which Europe is required to act, for our own and also for future generations.
It seems to me, therefore, that this is a good moment to stress the value of solidarity as a fundamental pillar in the construction of Europe.
Solidarity which is, in fact, a sine qua non for the future of European construction, on a par with the other truly fundamental principle, subsidiarity.
A solidarity that is tangible, practical, translated into policies and joint action, not a rhetorical, Ã  la carte solidarity.
I take the liberty of recalling at this point the 1950 Schuman Declaration, and I quote, that Europe...will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.
We must continue to be guided by these words in our efforts to build a stronger and more cohesive Europe.
Loss of the idea of belonging to a Union based firmly on solidarity is one of the major risks of European integration.
To be a true Union, it is essential to retain the sense of Community that was, not without reason, the original name given to the construction of Europe.
One of the concrete achievements which created de facto solidarity was the concept of economic and social cohesion established in the Single European Act of 1986, in connection with which I had the honour to participate in the negotiations and which I signed in my capacity as Prime Minister of Portugal.
The extraordinary progress of European integration in the past 20 years would not have been possible without economic and social cohesion policies.
They contributed to political cohesion, to economic growth, to employment, to territorial cohesion, to equal opportunities and to strengthening Europe's standing in the world.
There are now fresh reasons for renewed interest in the principle of cohesion.
I am thinking of increasing globalisation, migration on a vast scale, and demographic developments leading to the social and economic imbalances associated with an aging population.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
The three aspects of sustainable development are well known: social, economic, environmental.
This is a central objective of European integration, reaffirmed on various occasions and enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy.
I should like on this occasion to concentrate on the social aspect and more particularly on the subject of poverty and social exclusion.
In addition to the principle of solidarity there is an ethical and moral concept of progress, without which the founding values of the European idea would fade away, values such as the enduring quest for peace, the affirmation of freedom and human rights, the spirit of community, the insistence on equity and social justice, the assertion of the dignity of labour and the attempt to instil a more extensive and more liberating sense of civic responsibility.
The unequivocal identification of the battle against poverty and social exclusion as a European objective confers on all of us a responsibility for finding new solutions for increasingly complex and persistent problems.
The Social Agenda, combined with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, sets out the ambitious and difficult challenge we face.
I note, in this connection, that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the creation of the European Social Fund and the 10th anniversary of the European Employment Strategy.
It is also the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
As President of the Portuguese Republic, I have chosen the subject of social inclusion as one of my priorities for action.
During the first year of my term in office, I promoted the Road to Inclusion to mobilise the Portuguese people and alert them to the urgent need to address the indicators of persistent poverty, unequal distribution of income and exclusion that still affect thousands of citizens.
I am now more convinced than ever of the need to meet this challenge with flexible and innovative solutions: more responsibility for non-governmental organisations and citizens in general, more coordination of State action and civil society initiatives, recognition that policies for the redistribution of income do not preclude, on the contrary they require, the creation of more and better opportunities for all to share in the aims of wealth creation, personal achievement and sustainable development.
Portugal still has a long way to go by European standards.
But it is also true that Europe as a whole is still a long way from the objectives of social cohesion which it seeks to achieve and which it cannot abandon.
It is a fact that the uneven levels of prosperity in the Union disclosed by economic and social indicators in recent decades have been accompanied by a considerable approximation to the European average among the less developed Member States.
The economic convergence of States must not, however, be confused with the convergence of social groups within those States, a process subject to the imperatives of equity and social justice.
From this point of view, it must be acknowledged that very little progress has been made.
In the five years from 2001 to 2005, the poverty line in the Union countries as a whole remained static at 16%.
We are talking about some 75 million Europeans whose disposable income is less than 60% of the average income in their own countries.
Taking this figure in conjunction with the recorded trends in the unequal distribution of income, it becomes apparent that the situation is even less encouraging.
In 2005, in the European Union of 25, the income of the richest 20% of the population was five times that of the poorest 20%.
In 2000, it was four and a half times as much.
A more detailed examination of these indicators shows that the social groups most at risk of poverty are the old, the unemployed - especially the long-term unemployed - people living alone and single-parent families.
Other groups, for their part, are subject to disturbing and increasing social risks because of their potential for exclusion.
I am speaking of children, people with disabilities, immigrants and ethnic minorities.
The EU Council itself recognises in its 2007 Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion that, and I quote, children have a higher-than-average risk of poverty in most Member States.
In some, almost every third child is at risk.
Living in a lone-parent or jobless household further compounds the risk.
This is a serious situation, which we cannot afford to ignore.
How can the European Union, which faces the risk of an aging population and endemic demographic recession, fail to value its most important asset, its children and young people?
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
I wonder whether we may not have reached a point where traditional social protection policies cease to be effective.
Social security and protection policies played a decisive role in the economic revival after the Second World War and in moulding modern European societies.
What came to be known as the welfare state has left a legacy to which the Union itself owes its origins.
Building on the success of the eminently redistributive policies inspired by the idea of the welfare state, Europe has constructed an elaborate pattern of social protection which, despite the many differences between the various States, is known generally as the European social model.
With all its limitations and defects, the fact remains that this social model is now an inherent part of the European identity.
Nevertheless, if we are to defend it, we must accept that the social model will have to change in order to meet the new challenges and adapt to the new world of globalisation and the information and knowledge society.
The predominantly redistributive national policies are finding it increasingly difficult to produce any perceptible results in the social field.
The efficacy and sustainability of these policies are increasingly questionable.
It is essential, in planning future social policies, to focus on the idea of the welfare society, in which all of us, as citizens, have more responsibility and show more solidarity.
Of course, social progress depends on economic growth.
But unsustainable and unacceptable economic growth is socially destructive.
Unemployment is the main cause of poverty in most countries in the European Union.
We need more and better economic growth and that means more and better employment opportunities.
Easing participation in the labour market, according due weight and dignity to every individual contributing to the production of wealth and prosperity, in a process described as active inclusion, these represent the best protection a citizen can have against poverty and social exclusion.
The goal announced in the Lisbon Strategy to raise the employment rate in the Union to 70% is a social imperative that must be borne in mind, though it looks as though it will be difficult to reach that goal by 2010.
Another way of protecting citizens is to help them to acquire qualifications, help to equip them with education and training to face the new technological, environmental and cultural challenges.
It is therefore essential for Member States to give top priority to the common aim of improving levels of education and training in the younger generation and instilling the habit of life-long learning.
This will undoubtedly give them a competitive edge in future societies based on information and knowledge.
We have designated 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.
That is the year when we shall be called to account and required to show how far we have maintained the ambitions that inspired us in Lisbon in 2000.
Those ambitions include, and I quote, investing in human resources and combating social exclusion.
The aim of combating poverty and exclusion is not confined to the geographical boundaries of the European Union.
The foreign dimension of the principle of solidarity is primarily a reflection of the humanitarian values on which the European project is based.
The traditions that prevent development in the poorer countries are now combined with the problems arising from globalisation, so the campaign against poverty and under-development must become a global campaign.
That is the only way it can succeed.
The European Union has added responsibilities in this area and it has a wealth of knowledge and experience that give it a special role.
It must take the lead in the global agenda.
And it is in this context that I would draw your attention to Africa, a continent that is close to Europe and not only in geographical terms, a continent that we would do well to consider and treat as a priority partner.
The Union may find there is a heavy strategic price to pay for European inertia vis-Ã -vis Africa.
In this connection, I attach special importance to the forthcoming EU-Africa summit which will take place during the Portuguese Presidency.
It is time to talk with Africa and stop just talking about Africa and its problems.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,
I feel I cannot end this speech without touching on two subjects which I believe are absolutely decisive for the future of the Union.
First, energy and the environment.
These will undoubtedly be key sectors in the 21st century, and developments in these sectors will determine the new geopolitical shape of the world.
Energy and the environment are of vital common interest and must be regarded as new driving forces in European integration.
Here too we must build a strong 'de facto solidarity'.
Economic efficiency, security and quality of life in the European Union depend largely on the success of energy and environmental policies.
In this connection, I must express once again my appreciation for the strategic vision and determination shown by the European Commission and its President, without which we could not have achieved the excellent results in this area that we did during the German Presidency.
Second, there is a question on all our minds.
What is the European Union's role on the international stage and its contribution to the construction of a new world order?
I believe it is absolutely crucial to the sustainability of the process of European integration to ensure that Europe is a central and influential player in the global, multilateral and multipolar world that is emerging.
A player with a firm, consistent and cohesive voice.
A player who is respected and who respects others.
A player who can defend the principles and values on which its economic and social model are founded.
I note, in this connection, that Portugal was among the countries which led the first wave of economic globalisation in history, and it is well aware that the future of Europe depends largely on its ability to become a credible and influential player on the international stage.
In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say once again how much the extraordinary course of European integration owes to the European Parliament, an institution which has always taken the lead in defending the values and principles that forged the identity of Europe and formed the fabric of 'de facto solidarity' our founders bequeathed to us.
I am sure that here, in this chamber, the necessary vision, will and energy will be found to pursue this admirable aim of uniting the peoples of Europe and strengthening Europe's position in the world.
(Standing ovation)
(DE) Mr President, that your words have been received with approval and warmth is obvious from the applause.
You spoke out for solidarity and a sense of community and those qualities underpin what we are about here in the European Union.
Only through solidarity, a sense of community and practical action will we achieve our aims.
Yours is not an empty rhetoric for you have shown in the course of your political life that you are committed to Europe and capable of taking practical action on its behalf.
Speaking for the European Parliament, I should like to assure you that we as MEPs will do all we can to support the Portuguese Presidency, so that when the Heads of State and Government meet in October we may achieve a successful outcome on the Reform Treaty.
I would also make a point of extending our gratitude and recognition to Foreign Minister LuÃ­s Amado, Secretary of State Manuel Lobo Antunes and Ambassador Ãlvaro MendonÃ§a e Moura and all their colleagues, whose task it is to convey, through the process of discussions, the expression of our political will.
To them I say: 'We are with you.'
I thank you Mr President, on behalf of the European Parliament, for your impressive words to us and I wish Portugal every success in the interests of this Europe that we share.
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Cavaco Silva.
(Applause)

Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget - Budget 2008
(DE) The next item on the agenda is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for 2008.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour to present, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, the draft general budget of the European Communities for the financial year 2008, adopted by the Council on 13 July 2007.
I should like, first of all, to record the excellent and constructive atmosphere that prevailed during the meetings preceding the first reading of the 2008 budget by the Council.
The conciliation meeting produced a significant result, namely agreement on five joint statements on important subjects, providing a good basis for future work.
In this respect, I am convinced that the excellent cooperation between the two branches of the budgetary authority, with the valuable assistance of the Commission, augurs a positive outcome.
I can assure you that the Council is keen to continue the constructive dialogue on the budget in order to reach a satisfactory agreement on a good Community budget for 2008.
In March 2007 we celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Treaties of Rome and reaffirmed our common values and objectives.
In the dynamic project that is the European Union, the European Union budget like the single currency is one of the most tangible expressions of what it means, for the European citizen and taxpayer, to be European.
The European Union budget must therefore be drawn up in the light of the challenges we face together.
There are various challenges but I will, if I may, draw attention to some which I consider to be more important.
First, the challenge of eliminating the barriers to entrepreneurship in order to create a dynamic European economy based on the Lisbon Strategy.
Another challenge is to create a trans-European transport network to bring us closer to one another and consolidate the internal European market.
The challenge of an information society shows the importance of human resources and social inclusion.
The European Union will derive greater strength from the enlightened participation of its citizens in this project, unique in modern history.
The latest challenge, affecting some regions in particular - the challenge of climate change - must be met by developing renewable sources of energy and by more efficient and socially responsible use of natural resources.
All these challenges arise in the context of the globalisation of the world economy, which presents a serious challenge for our old continent of Europe, a challenge we must meet at an economic and social level with policies that will increase the productivity of the European economy and strengthen social cohesion.
This is what all Europeans expect of our government.
We must all redouble our efforts to ensure that our budgets represent an effective and efficient response to the political priorities.
It is therefore necessary for us to reduce the administrative burdens, concerns shared by the Council and the European Parliament, and for the Commission to speed up the process of approving operational programmes and projects so as to avoid delays in execution.
More rapid approval must not, however, call into question the principles of good budgetary management.
It is true that we need greater flexibility but not at the cost of abandoning the efficient and responsible use of the European taxpayers' money.
Before presenting the draft budget for 2008 in more detail, I should like to record the guiding principles behind the Council's decision.
The essential elements, in brief, were appropriate funding for the various European Union priorities; a carefully controlled increase in payment appropriations; compliance with the current ceilings of the financial framework leaving, where necessary, sufficient margins below the ceilings for the various headings and sub-headings; and lastly financial discipline and good budgetary management.
I will, if I may, mention just one detail.
In order to complete its analysis of the preliminary draft budget, the Council employed a combination of budgetary tools which proved to be extremely useful and which were developed in the context of budgeting for objectives and activities.
Among them, I should like to draw attention to the activity planning forms, where the Council considers, after examining a number of them in depth, that the overall quality of the process has improved significantly and hopes that this budgetary approach will be developed further in the future.
The draft budget for 2008 amounts to EUR 128 000 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 119 000 million in payment appropriations.
As regards commitments, I should remind you that the Council considers it essential that these reach an appropriate overall level in the 2008 budget, with due regard to the capacities for absorption.
As you know, we consider that overestimating payment appropriations is not a solution for unpaid commitments, the Reste Ã  liquider.
One of our guiding principles was therefore to assess the needs - real and clearly defined needs - and this resulted in an increase in payments of 3.4% compared with the 2007 budget.
As regards sub-heading 1a - Competitiveness for growth and employment - the Council intends to provide for appropriate funding of priorities connected with the Lisbon Strategy, having left a significant margin to cover the European Union priorities defined in the conclusions of the June European Council, as well as other so far unforeseen needs.
Although the Council intends to limit increases under this sub-heading in comparison with the 2007 budget, I should point out that the Council will continue to provide for a very significant increase in the Research budget, i.e. 7.75% in commitments and 45% in payments, in the light of the rate of execution in previous years and the capacities for absorption.
This increase reflects the great importance that the Council attaches to efficient implementation of the Lisbon Strategy which, as I have already mentioned, is an essential element in the economic development of the European Union.
As regards sub-heading 1b - Cohesion for growth and employment - the Council intends to accept the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget.
With regard to the payment appropriations, I should like to emphasise that the proposed increase has been maintained at an even more significant level, i.e. 6.2%, taking into account the capacities for absorption and past experience with the completion of old programmes and the execution of new ones.
As regards heading 2 - Preservation and management of natural resources - the appropriations proposed by the Council were based on earlier results and past experience has shown that, despite being applied horizontally, these appropriations are generally speaking always very close to the figures for the final execution.
I should like to expand on some considerations concerning the approval of operational programmes and projects in the areas of rural development and the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013.
This was the subject of a joint statement which we approved at our conciliation meeting and I can assure you that the Council attaches the greatest political importance to ensuring that all operational programmes and projects are executed as rapidly as possible and in an appropriate manner.
As to headings 3a and 3b - Citizenship, freedom, security and justice - the Council intends to make only one slight adjustment to the commitment and payment appropriations in accordance with the capacities for absorption and the prior rate of execution.
As regards heading 4 - The EU as a global partner - the Council intends to include some priorities with a political bearing in its draft budget.
I refer to Palestine, for which an increase of EUR 80 million is proposed, in reserve, and Kosovo, for which an increase of EUR 180 million is proposed, likewise in reserve.
We are still in the first stage of the budgetary process and I am sure we shall have further opportunities to give more precise figures in this connection.
At the present stage, the Council intends, so far as it is concerned, to accept the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget proposed in the preliminary draft budget as representing a provisional minimum.
However, it is highly probable that the amount proposed for the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget will prove to be insufficient in the light of developments in the international situation.
I think we all understand what is at stake.
I should like to end my explanatory statement with a few words about heading 5 - Administration.
The Council's approach is based on horizontal criteria such as increased efficiency and, at the same time, on the specific nature of each institution, especially in terms of the provision of new posts in connection with enlargement.
For its own section of the budget, the Council intends to provide an increase of only 0.2%, which seems to me to represent a clear political signal.
A detailed analysis of the budgets of the decentralised agencies was also carried out.
A method based on horizontal criteria was used both on subsidies and with regard to the number of new posts to be approved.
I also take this opportunity to say a few words about the need to ensure sound financial management of the European Union institutions.
In this connection, the Council is delighted with the joint statements which we approved at the conciliation meeting and which raise questions such as decentralised agencies, executive agencies, assigned revenues and recruitment in connection with the latest enlargements.
We all know that this is only the first step in the budgetary process, but I have every confidence that together we shall be able to explore all the possibilities in order to reach a final agreement and produce a satisfactory budget at the end of the year.
Our principal objective is to have at our disposal in due course a budget for 2008 that will be adequate for the purpose of the Union's political priorities but that is not excessively large, because that would signify acquiescence in a probable failure to execute it effectively and efficiently.
We must bear in mind not only that this budget will affect the well-being of each and every citizen of the Union but also that it is the taxpayers of each and every Member State who foot the bill.
Hence the need to strike the right balance.
I am sure that the three institutions represented here today will make every effort to do so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your kind attention.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the European Parliament has now to deliberate upon the Council's proposal for next year's budget.
Right at the start I wish to thank the country holding the presidency, Portugal, for its excellent and transparent cooperation.
It has worked splendidly in collaboration with the European Parliament and its Committee on Budgets, in particular.
The debate has gone extremely smoothly.
Although the Council's proposal gives cause for comment, the work of the Presidency gives us good reason to assume that we will achieve an excellent end result.
The Council's budget proposal is a frugal one.
Compared to the preliminary draft budget, commitment appropriations have been cut by EUR 717 million, with the margin for the multiannual financial framework at EUR 3.9 billion.
Payment appropriations have come in for an even bigger cut, having been reduced by EUR 2.1 billion, meaning they are a good EUR 10.3 billion under the financial framework, which is to say just 95% of the EU's GNI.
When we recall how, after long and hard talks, the financial framework was adopted only a year ago, we have to regard the level of payment appropriations, and these especially, as unrealistically low.
It is regrettable that budget headings 1a (competitiveness for growth and employment) and 1b (cohesion for growth and employment) should have been made the target of particularly drastic cuts.
In the first case payment appropriations have been reduced by more than EUR 500 million and in the second by EUR 498 million.
Both of these headings concern a key priority of the European Union, the Lisbon Strategy, one now made weaker by a cut of more than a billion euros.
There are also fundamental problems for the budget in connection with heading 1.
Last year the European Parliament warned the Council that financing for the European Galileo navigation system was too inadequate.
Now there is a shortfall of EUR 2.4 billion, because the private sector did not get involved.
Under its resolution, the European Parliament is supporting a project using Community funds coming out of the Union's budget.
This is the simplest procedure, the least bureaucratic and the most democratic.
Such a huge sum of money, EUR 400 million a year, is nevertheless impossible to find, given the current financial framework, and so we need a joint decision by Parliament and the Council.
We can rescue this important European project, but it will have to be done in the context of this budget procedure.
Another problem is the European Institute of Technology, the EIT.
If we do want to set it up it will have to be financed sustainably.
It cannot be based on hopes and assumptions, but needs realistic decisions.
The idea that the EIT would almost certainly receive cash out of EU programmes based on free competition is just a dream.
What if it were to come true, though?
That is why we need realistic solutions.
There is a special problem concerning next year's budget, and that relates to the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and rural development funds.
Only a few of the Structural Funds' Operational Programmes have been approved.
Just 20% of the 335 Programmes under the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund have been approved, but the figure for the European Social Fund is just less than 10%.
Most worrying is the situation concerning the Rural Development Fund, where just two of the 96 Programmes have been approved.
In June the European Parliament and the Council adopted a declaration which focuses attention on this, and they promised to monitor the Commission's actions here.
Parliament for its own part promises to enforce this declaration.
Finally, I want to emphasise the importance of good management.
The European Parliament wants to promote activity-based management and budgeting.
We, together with the Council, passed a declaration which stresses the importance of a cost-benefit analysis and accountability when new agencies are being set up.
We need to insist on this.
The theme of next year's budget is the Budget for Results.
The purpose is to emphasise the notion that it is the appropriations that need to be used to achieve the desired results.
Management is not the main issue here: it is results.
I firmly believe that we, along with the Council and the Commission, will succeed in establishing such a budget for next year.
Thank you very much, Mr Virrankoski, and thank you too for observing the speaking time so scrupulously.
It would seem that the Finns have everything well under control here.
Representatives from smaller countries such as Finland, just like those from larger states, are capable of exerting great influence.
Our other rapporteur is also a Finn: you have the floor, Mr ItÃ€lÃ€.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the most important principles to be observed when Parliament and other institutions were drafting next year's budget were thrift and budgetary discipline.
We have to set an example to the taxpayer, the ordinary European citizen, and show that we can also take responsibility for economic matters.
This is the only way we can win the trust of the people.
Parliament's new Secretary-General has put forward a new proposal for Parliament's 2008 budget, and I would like to congratulate him, since it is extremely good and well-balanced.
It will help us find a compromise when taking the final decision.
I should mention two things concerning the proposal.
Firstly, the Secretary-General's proposal is still below 20% of heading 5, i.e. the increase does not use up the whole 20%.
The other important matter is that he has been able to place a lot of existing employees in new posts, whereas all the posts should have been made vacant.
We nevertheless have to remember what this process in Parliament is like generally.
We have already adopted certain principles here a few times this year.
One is that Parliament's budget is a taxpayer's budget, and that we would try to keep to the 2007 expenditure levels where new projects are concerned.
We are not so very far off this target, and I believe that all the projects proposed can be carried out when we determine the precise sums in accordance with budgetary discipline.
I wish to raise another matter concerning Parliament's budget, and that has to do with information policy.
Various projects have been set up with a view to the forthcoming elections, such as the Web TV, and the most important thing of all is for MEPs and the political groups to be closely involved in all aspects of Parliament's information policy.
So the groups and Members must keep themselves in the picture and not leave the administration in charge of information policy: people want to know why an individual member or group votes a certain way or puts forward given proposals.
People want to know the political background, and we should therefore be involved.
I hope that the idea about inviting the small, local media along, as now agreed, goes through to the final version.
One way to get close to the people is for us to invite along the small, local media, which do not have the funds themselves to come here to Parliament.
This obviously has to happen through our Members.
I would like to come back again to the other institutions.
The Council has proposed a 2% cut across the board for all institutions.
As rapporteur, I have to say this is difficult to accept, as the institutions differ greatly from one another.
Some are small, some large, and they vary in the sort of work they do.
Let me take as an example the Court of Auditors, which I visited yesterday.
They have been very economical and have complied with budgetary discipline for many years now.
They have posted a surplus for everything, they have not wasted money, and their expenditure consists of salaries and fixed costs, and nothing else.
This 2% cut would be completely out of the question for the Court of Auditors.
The whole scheme would fall apart if we were to go with it.
I hope we will reach agreement on the idea of going over possible areas where savings can be made for each individual institution.
In principle I agree with the Council that everyone needs to exercise thrift and areas where savings can be made have to be found, but I am not in favour of a universal 2% policy.
Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentleman, what we are discussing today is the second year's implementation of the agreed Financial Perspective; we are discussing implementation of multiannual programmes with European added value as determined in codecision; and we are discussing additional commitments to reform by all three institutions.
I should like to assure the Council Presidency that a promising start was made, in terms of basic agreements, with the tripartite dialogue and the conciliation procedure on 13 July.
The five statements to which you referred, particularly concerning how we deal with the decentralised agencies, are a move in the right direction and one on which I hope we can build.
I should also like to tell you, Commissioner, that your initiative for a two-stage presentation on implementation of the budget is another important step in the interests of efficient budgetary policy on the part of both the Commission and the European Parliament.
Obviously, what we have to do now, in this budgetary procedure on the basis of the Council's draft, is to ensure budget discipline and to safeguard commitments already entered into, but of course we also have to adjust the foreseeable and anticipated figures.
In that regard, I do not understand what the Council has said in its additional statement in relation to the sub-headings on growth and employment (1a) and on agricultural policy and market-related expenditure - namely that if the amounts are insufficient, the Commission must be asked to submit an amending budget.
Heading 4, foreign policy, has to be highlighted yet again as chronically under-financed.
I must point out, too, that in the negotiations on the Financial Perspective we flagged up these shortfalls right from the outset.
So we shall work to ensure that agreed programmes are properly implemented in terms of both commitments and payments.
At the same time - and let me make this quite clear - we shall not accept any shelving of our political priorities either in the current budgetary procedure, Commissioner, or indeed through major global transfers at the end of a budget year.
I want to say explicitly that the statement on implementation of the Structural Funds and rural development was important for us, and we would ask the Commission to submit a progress report as soon as possible because the Member States and the regions quite rightly expect to see the programmes in question here implemented without delay.
Taken overall, the statements concerning the decentralised agencies, advocating improved cost-benefit analysis, make for greater transparency and greater clarity about the staff actually employed there - whether permanently or temporarily - and they constitute a qualitative step forward which, in conjunction with the Commission's so-called 'screening report' on establishment plans, amounts to positive progress and must be further developed, studied and more thoroughly pursued.
