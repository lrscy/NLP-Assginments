I emphasise that they have to add value to the process.
Mr Liikanen's portfolio is a very broad one already.
I do not want to see him diverting a lot of resources into something that is primarily a competence of Member States and should remain so.
In that connection, I do not want to see us use the ideas about tourism - and certainly, as Mrs Torres Marques has said, it employs a lot of people - to call for centralising measures, for new tax centralising measures or for new measures that might engage regions directly instead of Member States.
We should clearly be discussing tourism issues but we should be quite clear about where the responsibility lies.
We should say to the Commission: add value, look for solutions but do not add to your Treaty competences.
Mr President, despite the tragic events of 11 September, the tourism industry is alive and well. In fact, it is even enjoying a phase of permanent expansion at European and global level.
As an economic sector, the tourism industry accounts for 5% of jobs in the European Union.
The lion's share of the activities and of employment is generated by some 2 million small and medium-sized businesses, together making up some 8 million people.
Furthermore, this employment is spread across different service sectors, such as transport and the hotel trade.
Small and medium-sized businesses are therefore clearly the driving force behind, and platform for, European tourism.
This is why the proposed actions must be coupled with actions in the framework of the multi-annual programme for small and medium-sized businesses.
To the question whether Community tourism policy should be developed for the tourism industry, the answer remains negative, at least for the time being.
This does not detract from the fact that tourism policy must be coordinated more effectively and better managed.
Tourism policy often gives a fragmented and chaotic impression.
This is why actions in the field of harmonisation of information, the establishment of harmonised labels and networking must be strongly encouraged.
In addition, the Commission's initiative to establish an annual, European tourism forum at which the sector itself can set its priorities, receives our full support.
In short, closer cooperation between all parties involved in order to make tourism more competitive and sustainable, appears to be a priority.
Mr President, I completely agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Torres Marques, and with Mr De Clercq that, despite the crisis at international level and its repercussions on Europe, the tourism sector is the most promising of all sectors when it comes to creating new jobs.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believes that we need to use this advantage every way we can, at both European and national level.
To start with, the Member States should include specific commitments on employment in the tourist industry in their national employment action plans.
These actions should basically concentrate on vocational training, improving working conditions and applying policies to protect workers in seasonal, temporary and insecure jobs.
If these policies are to be effective, however, they need to be based on a proper study of the market and its present and future requirements.
There is already a lack of manpower in certain professions in the tourist industry, which is why our committee is calling on the European Commission to draft a study into the requirements of the market in collaboration with the Member States and within the context of a tourism policy at national and regional level.
It is also calling on the European Commission, in cooperation with Cedefop, to propose control standards for personnel training and to generate the required synergy between learning and professional experience.
If full use is to be made of the potential of tourism, these policies all need to be accompanied by support for manpower mobility at both national and European level.
Tourism is a sector which is admirably suited to this sort of mobility policy.
We also believe that we should make use of the potential for job creation and should strengthen employment among women, starting with various measures to help reconcile family life and work in the tourist industry and encourage entrepreneurship among women.
Our committee also stresses the need to emphasise social tourism and calls on the European Commission to produce a communication on the various forms of social tourism and its importance in developing a European conscience among our European citizens and reviving the regions of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every year, around 200 million Europeans leave their place of normal residence to become tourists for a while, usually in other countries of the Union.
As Mrs Torres Marques rightly states, Europe remains the main tourist destination for third countries, despite facing increasingly stiff competition.
Nevertheless, the Treaties provide no specific legal base for a Community policy on tourism, despite the fact that our Parliament has been calling for such a policy for a considerable amount of time in order to give the Community major scope for intervention whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity.
Since the Treaties do not provide for such a measure, the European Union must contribute to improving and encouraging cooperation in this sector in order to harness the enormous potential of tourism.
I welcome the efforts of the Commission, whose communication proposes an operational framework for European tourism as well as a range of measures and actions to be implemented by the various players involved.
The Commission highlights the complexity of this sector due to its diversity and its wide-ranging nature, which gives it little visibility at political level, a situation that does not properly reflect its true economic and social importance.
The Commission has, however, shown a lack of ambition: its proposal does not raise hopes that a real boost will be forthcoming because it fails to envisage a genuine strategic framework for monitoring an industry with enormous potential but which is experiencing little growth.
I agree with all of the recommendations contained in Mrs Torres Marques's excellent report, not least making tourism an issue to be considered by the Convention on the future of Europe and I do not think that a joint action runs counter to national actions to promote tourism.
Employment in the tourism industry is often highly seasonal and precarious, which is an obstacle to achieving sustainable development in this field.
I therefore call on the Commission to draw up at the earliest opportunity proposals to include the restaurant sector, and possibly other as yet ineligible tourist services, on the list of sectors of activity entitled to a permanent reduction in the VAT rate, so as to boost employment and modernisation in the industries concerned and better equip European tourism to deal with international competition.
Furthermore, know-how in the field of management and technology must be acquired and spread in order to encourage new methods of production and to promote a form of tourism that responds as well as possible to changes in the market.
Tourism is also a crucial element for the economic development of certain regions of the Union whose development is lagging behind, and for the outermost regions in particular, the tourist industry is the leading source of income and contributes significantly to their efforts to ensure the convergence of their economies towards the Community's average rate of development.
Tourism whose development is handled with prudence over the long term must provide local economies with a source of sustainable income and employment and must also contribute towards safeguarding and enhancing the landscape, cultural, historical and environmental features of the regions of the Union.
Lastly, I wish to stress the crucial role that the European Union must play in encouraging new forms of tourism in new places, not least by helping continental Europeans to discover the wonders of Europe's outermost destinations.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Torres Marques, not only for her work on this report, but also for her dedication to the tourism cause in this Parliament, which goes back some years now.
I believe we are faced with a contradiction - a contradiction that emerges clearly as Mr Harbour speaks on behalf of Mr Bradbourn, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in this field of tourism.
I believe we need EU competence in the field of tourism, not only to enable tourism to develop in terms of staff and standards and give us a coherent and coordinated tourism policy, but also - and I thought the Conservative Group would have really taken this to their bosom - because the present scenario is holding back profit generation and the opportunities to make money in that sector.
Tourism contributes 5% of the EU's GDP.
It employs thousands of people in the Member States and yet we have no EU competence.
We are faced at this moment with numerous - I do not know how many exactly - tourism policies reflecting national, regional and even local priorities that differ from each other.
It appears that we have a tourism ship that is sailing the seas with nobody on the bridge to direct it or to control it.
That is not the fault of the Commission or this Parliament.
The fault lies squarely with the Member State governments.
Even within national boundaries, tourism suffers from this effect of other interests - parochial interests.
We really need to take the opportunity presented by Mrs Torres Marques to get to grips with this problem and to produce for the European Union a coherent tourism policy that will work and be of benefit to the people of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Torres Marques, for the thorough preparatory work she has done with regard to this important matter.
She has listened to her colleagues and drawn up an excellent report.
Tourism is the industry of the future, and, as has been said here, Europe is still the world's largest tourist destination.
As a growth industry it can also create jobs in regions where it would be very hard to do so otherwise.
It is important that Europe's competitiveness and its appeal in the tourist sector are increased through better coordination of different areas of policy, and more cooperation and networking.
It is especially important to promote sustainable tourism and improve conditions for the growth of environmental and cultural tourism.
I would also like to stress how important it is that all regions and citizens of the European Union keep up with developments in the information technology field and that broadband networks should extend to all companies in the tourist industry.
Our group would nevertheless like to emphasise the importance of the principle of subsidiarity with regard to the tourist industry and therefore supports the notion of limited action within the framework of the EU.
For this reason, we oppose the proposal that the tourist sector should have a clear legal basis and its own budget heading.
In my opinion a reduction in VAT in the tourist industry is justified, but many members of our group take a wary view of matters of taxation, as they are largely the business of the Member States.
Regarding amendments, we support most of those tabled by Mr van Dam and Mr Bradbourn.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Torres Marques on her magnificent work.
Today, tourism is one of the most important sectors in the European Union and the absolute number one objective in certain regions in which tourism provides the majority of their gross domestic product and it is essential to the development and cohesion of these regions that they themselves also have significant common policies in other fields.
The lack of a legislative basis which would make this sector more operative and remove it from the field of unanimous decision-making within the Council will give impetus to this sector, which is in the hands of the large tour operators and completely outside the control of this House.
We therefore need decisions to be taken by qualified majority voting for tourism in the European Union.
The necessary action to protect the consumer must not lead us to forget the protection of the interests of the countries and regions for which tourism is a product, which is also necessary.
The impact of tourism on regional planning, the impact on the environment, the traditional agriculture sector, employment, transport and its essential infrastructures, as well as relations with other non-Community States which are providers and receivers of tourism, in which that tourism generates wealth and employment, make the adoption of an operative decision urgent.
The creation of a system of quality and efficiency indicators for tourism and the integrated management of the coastal areas within the field of policies at local, regional and national level must appear in a directive and not in a mere recommendation.
An in-depth analysis should be made of the impact of fiscal transport measures on tourism and the environmental impact of tourism and, finally, the Convention and the Council should work in this direction.
We therefore also need a common umbrella, a common policy and also common promotion for tourism in the European Union.
Mr President, this report is a one-sided report predicated on the need to develop the tourist product in the European Union, combat the decline in tourism in Europe and strengthen the common European tourism policy.
In keeping with what is now the Union's standard approach, the report also ties tourism to the Procrustean bed of the laws of the market and competition in order to accommodate the interests of big business in the tourist sector, thereby dealing a mortal blow to small and medium-sized - and especially small - businesses in the industry.
In our view, a tourism policy should be based first and foremost on protecting and safeguarding the rights of workers in the tourist industry who, because of the seasonal nature of the industry, have terrible trouble securing insurance and health and safety rights and are the first to suffer at the whim of their employers.
We feel that tourism should aim to satisfy the needs of the workers and the working classes in general for rest and recreation, which are vital if they are to maintain their strength.
Consequently, it must be made into a universal right of the people, not a means for the big businesses ravaging the sector to suck in excessive profits.
In this sense, tourism should play a positive role in wider communications, in getting to know other nations, customs, mores and cultures, in helping to develop friendly relations between nations and in promoting popular culture and history and a healthy and creative synergy between tourism and the environment.
Mr President, the Commission communication and the European Parliament report on tourism clearly demonstrate how far European competences can be extended, with no regard for subsidiarity whatsoever.
My starting point is the fact that the Treaty does not provide for Community competences in the field of tourism, since the matter is only mentioned once, in Article 2, which cannot be used as a legal base.
This position is in keeping with common sense: the tourists who visit a region are attracted by its specific local characteristics and this is why, in the Member States, responsibility for tourism is held at local or regional, sometimes national level.
Although international cooperation may sometimes appear desirable, there must be flexibility between public and private partners, and cooperation should not have to be bound up in the administrative straightjacket of the Community system.
The European Parliament and the Commission clearly do not see matters in this light.
They want to incorporate tourism into Community policies and create a framework programme with an appropriate budgetary line - see paragraph 12 of the draft resolution - with Community administrative resources - see paragraph 44 - and even, it could be said, a sort of planning.
What are their reasons for this?
Tourism is important for growth.
It can be a tool for development and can create jobs. It is already indirectly affected, to a greater or lesser degree, by several Community policies.
The report now before us even adds that with the attacks of 11 September having indirect consequences for tourism, a European tourism policy has become necessary in order to respond to the shock that was inflicted.
These arguments are interesting but none of them is central to deciding whether such a policy should be implemented at Community level.
In fact, Article 5 of the EC Treaty lays down only one criterion.
Will the action that is planned be implemented more effectively if it is managed from Brussels?
The argument on this point that the report puts forward is very weak, even non-existent.
The opinion delivered by our Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, contains a revealing phrase.
Having rightly noted that it is hard to see what a Community tourism policy would cover, it adds, and I quote: 'Nevertheless, there is no doubt that common needs do exist and we must identify them?.
In other words, something is needed - but no one knows what this might be.
To conclude, this report clearly shows that the Commission and the European Parliament are capable of proving that everything and anything falls within their competence.
If they had their way, this approach would apply ad infinitum.
This is why it is crucial that at the next intergovernmental conference, genuine supervision of subsidiarity, in other words, supervision from outside the Community institutions is put in place.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Torres Marques has done an excellent job; I think, on balance, there are three messages which come out of this report.
The first is that, at some point, we have to move from words to deeds.
I have attended more debates like this than I care to remember here in the European Parliament and at some point they start to sound like empty liturgies.
So we really do need to move from discussion to deed, to measures, to implementing what we keep talking about.
The second is that obviously we should welcome the European Commission's communications on tourism, but we also need to say to Commissioner Liikanen that they are not enough.
You start with these communications, Commissioner, but you do not see them through to the end.
Various directorates, not just yours, have passed general measures on tourism, the internal market, the Structural Funds and the environment.
These measures need to be coordinated, even though there is no common policy, if the European Union is to produce the best possible tourism policy.
The third point I want to comment on is the famous legal basis for tourism.
There is a legal basis for industry, but there is no legal basis for tourism which, in a few years' time, will be the most important sector in industry.
Despite the fact that, by definition, tourism goes beyond borders and is by definition an activity which is beyond a single Member State's control.
We therefore need a legal basis which will not be a substitute for national policy but, on the contrary, will help us adopt a policy with added value at European level and, in the final analysis, will help Europe stand up to international competition.
That is why we need to make sure when the Treaties are revised at the next intergovernmental conference that we have the legal basis which the European Parliament advocated at the last Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago the Greek Minister of Health decided to shut down all the schools in Greece because of an outbreak of a viral infection.
The schools were only shut for two days and the number of new cases quickly petered out.
And yet, this had an instant and severe impact on Greek tourism, with numerous bookings cancelled, exacerbating the crisis sparked by the events of 11 September.
Needless to say, this reaction was unwarranted because the ministry had acted in a purely preventive manner, demonstrating gravitas and a sense of responsibility in allaying tourists' fears.
However, the hype created by certain mass media and a few loose cannon resulted in cancellations and disappointment for those who make a living out of tourism in Greece.
What else could the Minister of Health have done, however?
Should he have thought first of the financial consequences or of the potential risk, albeit tiny, to the health of Greeks and visitors alike?
If you were the minister, Commissioner, what would you have done?
The same, I imagine.
You would have put health first.
But nor are the businesses and people who make a living out of tourism at fault and they are right to call for proper action, to call for the protective umbrella of the European Union.
When they work and serve a sector which contributes as much as tourism does to the balanced development of the regions of the Union and, in the final analysis, to European integration itself, a sector which is as susceptible and sensitive as tourism is to every sort of crisis, then these businesses, these workers, these European citizens rightly and reasonably feel that it should not be abandoned to its own fate.
We need to be able to take measures to moderate these unfortunate repercussions, we need to be able to finance suitable action from the Structural Funds, we need to make special provision in the budget for funding to improve tourism, with everything that means and implies.
Clearly we need to incorporate the tourist parameter into all Community decision-making procedures and Mrs Torres Marques' excellent report paves the way for just that.
Mr President, as a Member of this House elected by one of the outermost regions - Madeira - and since it is impossible in the time allocated to address all of the issues that this report raises, and which the rapporteur, Mrs Torres Marques, whom I shall take this opportunity to congratulate on her excellent work, has dealt with quite thoroughly, I wish to focus my speech on three points that directly concern the outermost regions.
Firstly, I should like to emphasise the importance of tourism in boosting the economic activity of the outermost regions, and as a means of combating underdevelopment.
This sector is the main activity in these regions in terms of the wealth it creates and makes a major contribution to the task of bringing these areas closer to the more developed regions of the European Union.
It is, therefore, crucial to recognise the value of the role played by tourism and the potential for economic development that it represents.
We must not, however, forget that these regions cannot remain dependent on tourism alone, an activity of whose vulnerability we are all aware.
We must, therefore, support work on economic diversification by making use of the opportunities provided in Article 299(2).
Secondly, I should like to highlight the need to develop efficient and sustainable transport infrastructures, with the aim of making access to the remote and island regions easier.
The increase in tourist flows and the consequent development of the sector depend on measures that improve accessibility, which, combined with a proper policy of promoting and making the best use of environmental, historical and cultural resources, could be an instrument of crucial importance to the development of these regions.
Thirdly, I would highlight the special fragility and environmental wealth of territories such as the outermost regions, which are on the one hand a determining factor and tourist attraction, but which on the other require sustainable tourism.
Unless this happens, the very development of the economy and the tourism of these regions will, in the medium term, be irremediably compromised.
Commissioner, I would be very grateful if you would be able to lift us out of an absurd situation in which we are in danger of remaining despite many years of debate, including our debate today.
Mrs Torres Marques' excellent report - in which, moreover, she was willing to include contributions from her fellow Members - which she supports with figures, gives such a good account that there is no need for us to go over the ground again, describing how the tourism sector is not just a sector which is vital, extremely important for the European Union today but also one of the crucial sectors for its future, both in purely economic terms and indirectly, because of its potential to contribute to environmental policies, social policies and policies for promoting peace and awareness between the people of different areas.
That said, we are now stuck in the absurd situation where, although we acknowledge the value and strategic importance of the sector, we are unable to come up with any policy with a European dimension to help it face its new challenges.
The challenges are those that have been mentioned by the Members: there was September 11 and, on a more general note, we are faced with the question of the competitiveness of the tourism sector, whose dimensions have changed; there is a problem of training; there is a problem of environmental sustainability.
We need tourism to help us but it needs our assistance too to bring about environmental conversion with a view to achieving sustainability.
It is true, Commissioner, that you cannot do much at the moment because of the constraints of the Treaties, but maybe you could speed up policy coordination and even join us in calling - as we are doing - for the forthcoming Convention to develop such instruments, legal instruments which will make it possible to create a sectoral policy that will help us face the challenges of the future.
Mr President, last November the Commission addressed two documents to the European Parliament and the other institutions: one about the economic perspectives of European tourism after the events of 11 September, and the other, a Communication on 'Working together for the future of European Tourism?.
On 19 February the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, under the chairmanship of Mr Caveri, organised a public hearing on the future of European tourism, which was attended by the Commission and the Council.
I would like to thank Mr Caveri and the rapporteur, Mrs Torres Marques, for their active contribution, as well as the members of the committee for all their work and for the report tabled today.
Various other committees gave their opinion.
I should like to thank Mr Harbour, Mr De Clercq and Mr GraÃ§a Moura for their contributions.
The Commission in general can go along with the draft report.
There are a limited number of issues that need particular attention and on which I would like to make some comments: first, the question of a stronger legal basis in the EC Treaty.
In our view, the Treaty of the European Community, in particular Article 3.1(u) and Article 157, establishes a sufficient basis for the actions proposed in the Commission's Communication.
After the ratification of the Nice Treaty, a qualified majority will be sufficient for supporting measures in the context of Article 157 of the Treaty to increase the competitiveness of European industry and, therefore, of tourism enterprises.
Secondly, the need for a better promotion of Europe as a tourism destination.
The Commission agrees with the Parliament report that more should be done to promote Europe as a safe and attractive set of tourist destinations.
The Commission is regularly requested to examine this issue as well, and it agrees with the wording of the report and of the draft Council resolution that will be formally adopted on 21 May, in which it is emphasised that: "with a view to contributing to the improvement of the global image of the European Union in the world, consideration could be given to analysing the present image as well as to discussing the possibilities of improving it, for instance through the new information and communication technologies, through benchmarking of best practices or through the coordination of certain combined promotional activities by tourism authorities and/or industry, while ensuring that competition among Member States is not distorted".
Thirdly, as far as the opening of the Tourism Consultative Committee to the public is concerned, on the one hand, the Commission has already opened - and will keep open - several of the committee meetings to include the participation of industry and other stakeholders representatives.
However, the Consultative Committee on Tourism is a body established by a Council Decision in 1986.
Members of this committee are designated by Member States, and the Commission chairs the meetings.
It is true that in this Council Decision there is no basis for this and it will be difficult - unanimity is needed - to amend it, in order to open it to the public.
On the other hand, the annual forum meetings, which will start in December, will be open to the public.
Finally, I would like to mention that the informal ministerial meeting organised by the Spanish presidency in Santander on 4 May was followed the day after by a seminar attended by major public and private stakeholders.
The event showed that the proposed actions in our Communication are in line with the priorities of Member States and of the other stakeholders.
It is very encouraging to note the attention the European Parliament continues to give to tourism and that it agrees largely with us.
This will facilitate our work in attaining the objectives described in the Communication, and in implementing these and other actions which could promote sustainable and competitive tourism in Europe.
In conclusion, although many of you favour a more ambitious approach, I consider that this process has been particularly successful.
The merit of the Communication is that, for the first time for nearly ten years, it has attracted strong support from all Community Institutions for tourism-related activities.
The recent meeting of tourism ministers at Santander has shown that we are truly engaged in working together for the future of European tourism.
The next important step in this cooperative approach in EU tourism issues will be the first European Tourism Forum that the Commission is organising with the industry and other stakeholders on 10 December this year, to which all the European private and public stakeholders, including representatives of the European Parliament, will be invited.
I thank you for this very constructive debate.
I am sure that much work remains to be done to convince the European public and decision-makers of the vital role of tourism for employment and growth perspectives in our continent.
I also agree with those who said that the number of people employed in tourism makes it a core employment sector.
Secondly, even though today the average figures are still around 7-8% of GDP, we have countries where tourism accounts for up to 12% of GDP, which shows its importance.
Tourism deserves our attention, and we must coordinate different policies as well as possible to promote the future prospects of European tourism.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0127/2002) by Mr Ojeda Sanz, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 1999/311/EC adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (Tempus III) (2000-2006) (COM(2002) 47 - C5-0096/2002 - 2002/0037(CNS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the staff for their excellent work and assistance in drawing up this report, and also those responsible in the Commission for their willingness to help on this matter and, above all, I would like to show my appreciation for the impressive desire for dialogue shown by my fellow members in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has enabled us to draw up this report with several important proposals that have been reached by consensus.
The Tempus programme - or, in this specific case, the extension of the scope of the Tempus programme proposed by the Council - should be seen as part of a strategy seeking to bolster dialogue and understanding between the peoples and cultures of the European Union and the Mediterranean.
Some people have been asking why we need to extend an existing programme when we could set up a new one.
This is a good question, which is easy to answer.
If we extend a tried and tested programme, and we manage to avoid the usual problems inherent in getting a new programme off the ground, we can draw on the experience and know-how of Tempus, incorporating the improvements that have been made to it over time and which will no doubt encourage rapid diversification in the range of university studies available as well as cooperation between Euro-Mediterranean partners.
As you are all aware, the Tempus programme takes its inspiration from the chain of events that have taken place since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989.
This programme was set up in 1990 to meet the need to reform higher education in the Central and Eastern European countries while also encouraging Europe-wide mobility in university studies.
The programme was financed by the PHARE budgetary framework. In 1993 it was extended to include the New Independent States such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation, amongst others.
The second phase of this trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education affected a total of thirteen partner countries for a four-year period and since 1997 the Central and Eastern European countries preparing for accession have gradually been abandoning the Tempus programme to take part in Socrates, the Community's general education programme.
However, the Council decision was amended to extend the life of Tempus II for a further two years.
This decision laid down that the Commission should undertake an assessment to consider the programming of Tempus.
The Commission is now proposing to open up Tempus III to the Mediterranean partners in order to meet the needs in that region for cooperation in the sphere of higher education.
The Tempus programme will thus encompass the following partners: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, and Lebanon.
The purpose of cooperation in the sphere of education is to strengthen the organisational machinery that will enable universities to continue their cooperation beyond the life and scope of the assistance granted under cooperation programmes. In this way we shall place the EC institutions and institutions in partner countries and territories in a better position to develop and consolidate partnerships that could in turn generate a multiplier effect beyond the participating institutions and have a lasting impact on education systems, which is basically what we are dealing with.
In addition, and this is important, by widening the range of participants beyond the traditional academic community to secure the involvement of political leaders and civil society in general, we shall be encouraging a kind of cooperation in higher education that could play a key role in changing attitudes by affording an opportunity for the young generations to compare their respective values and national cultures.
The intention is to combine purely academic matters with moves to strengthen the working of civil society in Mediterranean partner countries and to help promote better understanding of the different cultures and respect for human rights and minorities in these countries.
Various assessments have shown that the Tempus programme is perceived as an invaluable means of fostering mutual understanding. That is the goal on which participants must focus when they plan their activities.
These are the main amendments to the Tempus programme for Mediterranean partners that we fully support in this report.
There are no significant amendments to the rest of the programme.
Therefore, I would emphasise the main objectives of the Tempus programme as follows: to pave the way for the development of higher education, to respond more effectively to the socio-economic and cultural needs of the eligible countries, and to promote cross-cultural understanding, rapprochement, and the development of flourishing, free civil societies.
These aims are to be achieved by means of Joint European Projects (JEPs), which constitute the most important inter-university cooperation arrangements under the Tempus programme.
As well as JEPs, the programme provides grants to teachers and researchers, amongst others, for a variety of complementary activities designed to further the overall objectives of the programme.
In this report our intention was to highlight the need for the Tempus programme to be extended much further than the university community, so that this, which will of course continue to be its central pivot, will contribute to the transformation of civil society.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have already heard what we are to gain from the new Tempus programme and from its extension, which is thoroughly to be welcomed, both as regards the countries taking part and also the target groups.
Great challenges and great opportunities are united here; I believe that the programme needs to have its funding increased in order to meet them.
There are also particular considerations to be borne in mind when extending Tempus III to the partner countries around the Mediterranean, specifically in matters concerning policies on women and the opportunities open to them.
In the countries south of the Mediterranean, there are still very few women who have received higher or university education, especially in rural areas.
The reform and development of higher education structures associated with Tempus III is primarily, or among other things, to be seen as an opportunity for women.
In Jordan, which along with Malta and Cyprus, sets an example in the Mediterranean region, the proportion of women in higher education is already over 50%, but that on the teaching staff of universities and colleges, and in decision-making positions in them is still very small, making the picture there similar to that in the European Union as far as the presence of women in leading positions in universities and colleges is concerned.
One very ambitious objective is to highlight common cultural values through cooperation in higher education.
Respect for other cultural values is of course very much worth striving for.
It is further enriched by the fact that political decision-makers - and let me say, with reference to the error in the German translation, that 'political decision-makers' is the expression to use rather than 'political representatives' - are being included here as a second grouping with academic and civil society.
I really would like to underline that, as it is very often said that it is political decision-makers that should have co-decision in these matters, and that is why the translation error needs to be corrected.
It would also be encouraging if a 'think tank' could be created, consisting of members of NGOs, educators, administrators, and academics together with citizens from the participating countries.
The involvement of the widest possible range of fora is intended to create a local dimension in addition to the supranational and national ones, in order to make it possible to consider citizens' needs at an earlier stage.
I believe that the most important thing is that we can get many problems out of the way through our ability to regain, over and over again, the sympathy of our fellow-citizens.
Mr President, first of all, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ojeda Sanz, on the excellent work that he has performed, together with all his colleagues.
This report is evidence of Parliament's firm support for the Commission's proposal to extend the Tempus programme to the MEDA partners and is in line with the policy of supporting closer cooperation with this region that was adopted in the conclusions of the Euro-Mediterranean ministerial conference held in Barcelona and the recent conference in Valencia.
The extension of the Tempus programme to the MEDA partners also forms part of our ongoing cooperation in the field of higher education, between the Community and other regions of the world. This cooperation, which I undertook to strengthen, is all the more necessary since we are facing an increase in various forms of radicalism and intolerance, which points to a lack of dialogue and understanding between cultures.
And as Mrs Prets stated so well, equal treatment for men and women is obviously part of such a dialogue.
Article 5 of the decision on Tempus III also provides for equal opportunities.
We have further strengthened this approach in the new text.
The current proposal therefore aims to extend the programme to the following Mediterranean partners: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon.
As the rapporteur quite rightly said, the Commission has only amended the decision on Tempus where this was essential for technical reasons. The only amendments of substance that have been added are: a specific objective alluding to developing democratic civil societies, the possibility of including researchers in order to build bridges with research and the duration of the Tempus III programme has been extended to 31 December 2006, in order to bring it into line with that of programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo.
The Commission shares the desire of Parliament and the Council to adopt the decision in the shortest possible timeframe.
This is why the Commission, although it supports the spirit of Parliament's amendments, is unable to accept them: such a modification, Mr President, would delay the proposal's adoption.
I would, however, like to reassure the rapporteur that I will take into account Parliament's wishes and amendments when the programme is implemented.
I think that this is what is most important.
The programme will be implemented within the framework of existing actions according to the specific needs of each partner. We will therefore launch a dialogue with the appropriate authorities as soon as the decision is adopted.
I know that the authorities of the MEDA partners are eagerly awaiting the Commission's next steps.
Do not make them wait any longer than is necessary and let us put into practice this policy that everyone wants.
I would like to thank you for your support and I would ask Parliament, when it sends a parliamentary delegation to one of these new Tempus countries, to stress our new university cooperation policy.
I am sure that the positive effects of this will be felt in both the short- and long-term.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0126/2002) by Mrs GrÃ¶ner, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Commission White Paper on a new impetus for European Youth (COM(2001) 681 - C5-0110/2002 - 2002/2050(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to thank all those who have contributed to this White Paper giving European youth policy a new impetus, and in the production of which a unique consultation process has involved thousands of young Europeans.
Parliament, too, has made its own important contribution in a public hearing which attracted a great deal of attention.
Whilst emphasising that the main responsibility for young people lies with the Member States, we support the proposed new forms of cooperation (a) by means of open coordination, which, though, in our view needs to be given tangible form by an interinstitutional agreement, and (b) in the form of mainstreaming, that is to say, the taking into account of young people's interests in other policy areas.
Anyone, though, who listened attentively to the young people, heard them speak not only about such issues as education, lifelong learning, mobility, employment, social integration, anti-racism and the combating of xenophobia, but also about other important issues such as equality of opportunity for young women and young men, immigration, addiction to alcohol and other drugs as being important areas calling for action in Europe.
Our committee expects of the Convention that it will come up with proposals as to how young people can be actively involved in the construction of a democratic Europe, as Europe still seems to them to be a long way away.
I, as rapporteur, believe it to be necessary to expand the chapter on young people in the Treaty on European Union and to further raise the profile of children and youth policy in the Commission as well, especially in view of the outcome of the World Summit for Children in New York.
European youth organisations, especially the European Youth Forum, made a substantial contribution to the gestation of the White Paper, in which we now call on all actors, ranging from researchers to municipalities by way of the national representatives, to develop new forms of participation which should also be for young people outside youth organisations.
Conceivable options range from youth parliaments and conventions to competitions in schools and sport clubs.
The political parties also have a great responsibility and should involve young people to a greater degree, encouraging them to take up political office.
That will become very important in view of the elections to be held in 2004.
We support the greater promotion of voluntary work for young people, but this is a kind of informal education and should be given recognition as such; legal and social protection for young people also needs to be improved.
The motion for a resolution contains an array of further proposals, for example for making better use, for young people's purposes, of the Community programmes or indeed the Structural Funds.
In order to do that, they will have to have better data with which to work.
The Pisa survey in the educational field has shown how a youth report to be drawn up every three years, with comparable statistics and indicators from the Member States and the candidate countries, can serve as a significant basis for a broadly-based debate and for further political decisions, but there is a need for other coordinated measures as well, for example - as the catastrophe in Erfurt shows - to prevent violence.
An Internet portal is not a sufficient discussion forum for the purposes of informing young people, as there are marked geographical and gender-specific, as well as social, differences in the way the Internet is used.
My proposal is for innovative material to be developed in the language young people use and for the European Union's youth work to be presented to the wider public in a week of activities every year.
But, ladies and gentlemen, nothing is any good unless it results in action.
The White Paper on youth policy can only be a first step, a first and important step set in motion by the Commission in order to establish contact with many young people and with actors.
Such a thing cannot be had for free.
There must now be measures that cannot be financed out of the Youth Programme, 99% of which is exhausted, and so these good proposals cannot be realised.
The Council of Ministers now has to take a quick decision on this at the end of this month.
We need a green light for the White Paper.
Then we must act together to swiftly implement further proposals, including some on the Budget, for I was at many of these European and also national conferences and spoke with the young people, and I can tell you that nothing could be more devastating to our work with young people and to their view of us than for their high hopes not to be fulfilled and for no measures now to result.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by means of the White Paper 'A new impetus for European Youth', the Commission has presented us with a comprehensive outline of the European Union's youth policy for the future.
Although a step in the right direction, it is a concept capable of further development.
During consultations with the Commission, European youth associations clearly expressed the view that this White Paper should give a higher profile to gender-specific issues.
I incorporated this concern in my opinion for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and put it forward emphatically.
Equal opportunities and the gender issue do not only affect us adults - quite the opposite, in fact.
It is precisely in schools and in youth work that choices are made about the self-evidently equal rights of girls and boys, of women and men.
European youth policy, too, must attach great value to this.
I welcome the report's proposals for greater participation by young people at every political level, for better provision of information of specific relevance to them, for the promotion of voluntary service by young people and for the highlighting of their interests in the Convention and in discussions on the constitution.
However constructive the proposals may be, though, we must not lose sight of the principle of subsidiarity.
Youth policy is primarily a task for the nations, regions and municipalities, but it is Europe that can create the framework for it.
I take a very critical view of the open coordination that is proposed in connection with this, which, in the form proposed, comes across as incapable of definition and diminishing the role of Parliament.
The family, too, is a focal point in life as it is really lived by Europe's young people, something of which the White Paper and the report take insufficient account.
The family, too, is a youth policy, and must be protected and reinforced.
I see the White Paper, taken as a whole, as having a good approach and as giving Europe's future youth policy some impetus, but we must take dialogue with the younger generation further and invest a great deal of commitment in pushing for what results from it to be implemented.
Only then will this initial impetus become the forward-moving process that Europe's young people have every right to expect.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, very briefly, to discuss the process by which the White Paper came into being and to enumerate a number of facts that illustrate why a White Paper on youth policy is absolutely necessary.
We all know that 75 million of Europe's citizens - in which I include those of the enlarged Europe - are young people between the ages of 15 and 25, but the falling birth-rate and simultaneously rising life expectancy mean that our society is getting older.
The proportion of the EU's overall population between the ages of 65 and 90 will rise from 16% to 21% between 2000 and 2020, whilst that of 14 to 24-year-olds will be as low as 11%.
This disparity in numbers between young and older people will bring about considerable change to relationships at various levels.
We need to find answers within our own society in order to meet these challenges.
We too are called to take measures to accompany and support young people above all, in order to avoid social tensions and also adverse effects on our education systems and the labour market.
After all, the present system of European cooperation on youth issues has been stretched to its fullest extent and can no longer cope with the problems that have to be tackled.
We all know that investment in the young means investing in something that will make up the wealth of our society both today and in the future.
As my lady predecessor on the floor said, youth policy falls mainly within the competence of the Member States.
The new White Paper on youth policy is meant to point the way towards a new kind of European cooperation in the youth sphere.
It is indeed the case that the White Paper is as yet far from ideal, but it does need to be implemented as a matter of urgency in order to increase young people's involvement in the integration of Europe and in shaping our future.
The White Paper is a logical step for a forward-looking youth policy.
I would like at this point to thank Commissioner Reding for her initiative in the past, but above all for her commitment and for the way she got to grips with the task of listening to young people and involving them directly.
I see that as the right step on the right road, as youth policy, policy for young people, cannot be made without young people; it must be made with them.
Even if the White Paper is not yet perfect, it is, as I have said, a step in the right direction.
On behalf of my group, I ask you to support it when we vote tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the concerns, desires and worries of young people must be taken seriously, and so I welcome Mrs GrÃ¶ner's report on the Commission's White Paper for Europe's young people.
It is proposed that greater account should be taken of young people's needs when framing measures in different policy areas in the European Union.
We must give young people the opportunity to demonstrate active commitment by getting involved in public life.
In Germany, the Pisa survey came up with some sobering results.
It is for that reason that I advocate a reform of schools policy which would have to incorporate the aspirations of students and young people.
I do think that young people's participation in public life is especially important.
Today, young people are involving themselves less and less in traditionally structured organisations such as political parties and trade unions.
This is seen especially in the extent to which young people take part in elections at national and European level.
It is young people in particular whom we must encourage to stand as candidates at local, national and European level, and we must actively support them in doing so.
I urge that young people's votes and opinions on political matters should not be shrugged off as an irrelevance.
I find it particularly regrettable that the Commission White Paper devotes too little space to the gender angle, an aspect that I believe cannot be excluded from consideration.
Young women must be promoted in every respect, as women still do not have the same opportunities as men in the labour market.
Top jobs are mainly held by men.
The unemployment rate is higher in Europe for women and women earn on average less than their male colleagues.
I commit myself to women getting the same opportunities as men in the labour market.
I am glad that the fight against racism is given an important place in the White Paper.
This is especially important in view of the way in which people are discriminated against on the basis of their different skin colour or of their belonging to an ethnic or religious minority.
We have to encourage young people to reach out to other cultures, which I am convinced leads to each enriching the other.
Dialogue promotes mutual understanding among peoples in the cause of peace.
I am committed to people in Europe not only living alongside each other, but, above all, being able to live with each other.
Our willingness to reach out to those who are different or foreign gains us a view of the world that is cosmopolitan and tolerant.
Youth policy must be accorded a particular value at national and European level, and this means that schemes for young people need to be appropriately financially resourced.
I consider it particularly important that Community programmes should give adequate support to projects that benefit young people.
Our European home must not be built without taking into account the concerns of young people, and so I urge that their conceptions of Europe's future should have an influence on the Convention.
If we ignore young people's interests, our European home will rest on unsteady foundations, for the young of today are tomorrow's future!
Mr President, I should like to start by offering the Commissioner my warmest congratulations on her initiative on a European Union study into the specific challenges facing its youth of today, on consultations with young people and on a new cooperation strategy which views young people as the basic resource and source of strength for progress and development in the European Union.
The White Paper really does give all us politicians, at both European and national level, the opportunity to take stock of our responsibility in the light of this objective.
If we are honest with ourselves, then we have to admit that we have neither the frame of mind nor the practices needed for our young people to prepare to become proactive citizens in their national and local societies and tomorrow's responsible European citizens.
It is true that continuing unemployment and the social problems which come with it, often poor standards of education and teaching and insecurity about the future disappoint and alienate youth from the rest of society.
At the same time, however, as studies have shown, they want new social relations and new forms of intervention.
The rapporteur has taken the right approach here, for which she has our warmest thanks.
At the same time, few countries have the structures or institutional framework needed to allow young people to play a specific and fundamental role in society.
The Member States of the European Union have differing experiences in this area as a result of differing administrative and regional structures and political traditions and promoting best practices will be one hundred per cent beneficial here.
But at European level, Commissioner, we should be giving the youth of Europe a better chance to get acquainted, cooperate, support each other and prepare their common future.
Despite the range of European student exchange programmes, for example, there are huge discrepancies between education systems.
When it comes to recognising diplomas, there are universities which prefer to throw up obstacles to students from other Member States of the European Union than to accept them and bring them into contact with their own student circles.
Be daring in your initiatives, Commissioner, the European Parliament is right behind you.
Mr President, young people are the most sensitive group in society and it is therefore only to be expected that crises in the capitalist system will hit them first.
Exactly what does a capitalist society have to offer its youth?
A society in which everything can be bought and sold.
More to the point, what does the policy of the European Union have to offer?
An education system which is incapable of passing on basic knowledge, which replaces education with training and which excludes a significant proportion of young people on the basis of class criteria.
Non-existent job prospects or, at best, one paltry part-time job after another with long periods of unemployment in between, no social insurance, easy prey for profit-greedy big business.
Individualisation and competition instead of collective action and fighting for demands.
The sub-culture of television, the sport of hooligans, the fool's paradise of drugs.
And when our young people dare to protest, in my country they are more often than not dragged off to court.
The Commission's White Paper does indeed identify some of the problems, but it fails to analyse the causes or offer any solutions.
It is mainly interested in assimilating young people, in pushing them in directions which cause no ructions in the system but which leave young people with no way out.
It promotes the empty European ideal, participation in institutions of the system which young people's experience and intuition have taught them to shun.
It even promotes so-called voluntary service as the highest form of social solidarity and entrepreneurship as the antidote to unemployment.
It underestimates the serious problem of drugs, on which it takes an almost neutral stance.
Clearly it is an attempt to acquit the system and persuade us that there is a way out within it.
As far as the Communist Party of Greece is concerned, there is no way out for the young without disputing the foundations of the class system.
It is only by fighting for a society that respects people that young people will be able to acquire the wherewithal to make their way in the world.
Mr President, the White Paper which was proposed by the Commission last November is the response to the challenge that I set in November 1999, to the Council of Ministers for Youth and to all those who are responsible for young people in our Member States. The challenge is, ultimately, to listen to young people and to avoid developing policies for young people without their input.
This appears to be an innovative approach, and yet it is only logical!
It is perhaps surprising that it took so long for common sense to set in and for us to started to listen to young people and treat them as active partners in shaping all future policies.
I would like to thank the European Parliament, and especially the rapporteur, Mrs GrÃ¶ner, for the unwavering support provided since the very launch of the new policy.
This work has been patient, persistent and, I believe, as do the young people in our Member States as well, it has shown that the European Parliament is on the side of young people, and rightly so.
The White Paper has given a new impetus to youth policy.
However, as Parliament has made very clear, a new impetus is all well and good but we still need concrete measures.
The ball is now in the Council's court.
The forthcoming Council of Ministers meeting on 30 May will enable us to determine the will of the Member States to push forward this matter whilst observing the subsidiarity principle, which is respected by the Commission in this policy.
The proposed new framework of cooperation is based, on the one hand, on applying the open method of coordination in the field of youth policy and, on the other hand, on taking greater account of young people in the various European policies, over and above those of the youth programme.
And I am pleased that Parliament supports this two-fold approach, that it is making proposals - which I have listened to and made a note of - and I would also like to assure Parliament of my personal commitment to involving it as much as possible in this new approach.
I am aware of the structural shortcomings of the open method of coordination, but it is also the best method currently available to us.
All I can say to you, therefore, is this: let us move forward along this path.
I will involve Parliament and I also insist that Parliament declare itself competent whenever youth policy is discussed, whether in areas for which I am responsible or in areas which are the responsibility of other commissioners.
Mr President, as you know, the White Paper is proposing nine priorities.
These priorities were identified during consultations with young people.
I am slightly wary of further increasing the number of priorities, because my political experience tells me that if we overload our agenda, it will become increasingly difficult to control things.
I am therefore rather more inclined to say this: it is better to have fewer priorities and to achieve them.
However, it is a pleasure for me to accept Parliament's invitation to provide a regular progress report.
I shall focus on the progress achieved in European cooperation rather than on the situation of young people: I think that this is what is important, namely to see where we are going and what progress we are making each year.
Your proposal to hold an information week on the activities of young people is an excellent idea.
I shall undertake to organise this and, you are right, we must, in particular, do more to improve awareness of the youth programme.
Lastly, I fully support the proposal to take into account the situation of young women in all the aspects which concern young people, not only here in Europe, but also in the relations that we have with third countries.
We discussed doing this as part of the Tempus project, where we really must improve the integration of women.
In the same vein, for the EuroMed Youth programme, I urged the ministers of the North African countries to give young women the opportunity to participate in the young people's exchange programme.
As I said, Mr President, the next milestone in the process of translating the policies proposed in the White Paper into concrete measures will be 30 May, the meeting of the Ministers for Youth.
I firmly believe that the arrangements for the future cooperation for young people, as well as the major priorities, can be decided at this meeting.
Mr President, I am extremely pleased to note that everyone is helping to give a new impetus to youth policy.
I would like, to move things forward rather than to bring a close to the subject, to thank the European Parliament: you have been an enormous help to us, and I also know that you will continue to help young people, so thank you again, and let us work together in developing our youth policy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0132/2002) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the European Year of Education through Sport 2004 (COM(2001) 584 - C5-0497/2001 - 2001/0244(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I recall how, in my last report on sport, in 1996, I called for the designation of a Year of Sport.
Now we have one, but it took until Viviane Reding's appointment as a Commissioner for us to get it.
That is a fine thing all the same, and I am grateful, but when I consider the title we have given this year, everything in me tenses up - it really is nonsense!
Why do we have to tie ourselves in knots when talking about sport?
I wanted a Year of Sport, and now we have a Year of Education through Sport.
We all know why we are going around in circles; it is because sport should not actually be an issue, although it is one, not only as regards football but everywhere!
At every hour of every day, everyone is talking about sport.
It is only in the European Union that it is not meant to have a part to play.
Why do we have to engage in such contortions?
Sport has always crossed national boundaries.
Here in Europe, it is by means of a common agency that we are combating the reprehensible practice of doping in sport.
So there is sport in Europe.
With the TV directive, we are also concerning ourselves with sports rights.
So there is sport in Europe.
It actually surpasses my understanding why the EU governments are still balking at it, and that is why I hope that, the next time you assemble together, you will have learned something from the Year of Education through Sport and will make of it a real European-level task which will not, of course, be proceeded with outside the bounds of subsidiarity.
We adopted this Commission proposal with a very great deal of goodwill.
Indeed, we had hardly any problems with it, but Parliament does, of course, table amendments.
We went along with the proposal as regards finance.
I told myself, of course, that I had done the decent thing by not asking for more money, and then the Council went and said it was still too much!
I will bear that in mind for the next time, when I will again make demands, and then perhaps we will even get more than what you have proposed.
Thus we have been very successful in some programmes.
I actually wanted it to be an overnight success, but - alas - that was not the case.
Things seem to have settled down in the meantime, though.
We have not done as the Commission said in every respect.
In one area, we stated that we would under no circumstances be willing to spend more money this year on research and investigations.
We stated that all the money allocated for this year must also be spent on tangible schemes either in this year or as an interim payment.
We made an exception to this for evaluation.
There is bound to be one after a year of this sort, but this one is not in the part we want to try and delete.
We hope, of course, that the Commission will support us in this.
We tabled amendments to enhance and promote the contribution made by unpaid work to informal education, to promote the spread of 'best practice' and to create an on-line database.
We want to support networks to spread the education role of sport, and we have shed light on the major problem of the many competitive sportsmen and sportswomen who are unable to gain educational qualifications, because they reached the peak of their performance during their schooldays and then, to some extent, neglected their performance at school.
This European Year is an important one, happening across Europe in the year of the Summer Olympic Games in Athens, and measures will be implemented at Community and national level to promote long-term cooperation between education providers and sports associations and to better integrate sporting practice and sporting values into teaching.
As the whole business struck me as a bit too dry, I took the liberty of devising a climax for this sporting year, and my fellow members of the committee went along with me.
Let us, I said, have an athletics competition between school teams right across Europe in 2003, at the end of which the competition's winners will be invited to Olympia in 2004, where the Olympic flame is lit.
I thought this was a brilliant idea.
Our world lives on images, great images, and these images also depict actions.
I must say that I would actually have liked our dear Commissioner to be a bit more supportive in putting this to the Council.
The Council is against it.
Now, all I want to say is that it does not cost much more, and there will, indeed, probably be no additional expense whatever, as we still have money in reserve.
Of course, we do not always have to tell the Council that, but we do have money.
We can do it, and we should be able to afford it.
I really cannot understand why they do not want us to!
We will certainly succeed in carrying off the vote for first reading without difficulty.
I wish the Council would get a move on, as we had to, and get its common position out by 31 May.
I can include my colleagues on the committee in promising that we are willing to take it into committee as quickly as possible, and, if necessary, to use a trilogue to ensure that we do not have to resort to a conciliation procedure.
I think though that the Council still has to take a few steps in our direction on that point.
I would be very grateful if the Commission could help them in that direction.
Again, many thanks for presenting this, Mrs Reding.
We are grateful that it has at last arrived!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2004 will be the European Year of Education through Sport.
Sport has been since time immemorial a favoured, successful and effective means of influencing, in a fundamentally positive way, educational policy and the educational values that underlie our life together in society.
The promotion of sport and the partnership between sporting and educational facilities has a positive effect on teamwork, tolerance, solidarity, the campaign against drugs and violence, and on fair and healthy competition without recourse to doping.
These are values that need to be rediscovered and promoted.
This makes the choice of 2004 as the European Year of Education through Sport, and against the backdrop of the Olympic Games and Paralympics in Athens and the European football tournament in Portugal, very much to be welcomed.
The Commission is proposing a total of EUR 11.5 million to finance it, EUR 3.5 million of which are to be paid towards operational expenditure in 2003, the year when preparations for it get underway, and EUR 8 million in 2004.
The proposed financial framework must be compatible with the upper limit laid down in the Financial Perspective and must not be allowed to result in cutbacks in other areas.
For reasons of efficiency and for the avoidance of unnecessary administrative costs, a coordinating body should be provided for in each Member State.
There is, in my view, no need for a formal requirement to consult a group of as yet unspecified experts who would decide on the financing or cofinancing of individual measures.
Administration and evaluation of the programme should remain a public matter, that is, one for the Commission.
The decision on the European Year of Sport is the right one, but it is continuity that brings success.
This splendid scheme thoroughly deserves to be continuously developed, signifying as it does an investment in our young people growing up to be healthy and able to contribute to the integration of a healthy and united Europe.
This investment in our future will pay dividends, for our young people are our future!
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work and also the Commission on having been able to overcome the obstacles it always faces so that this Parliament can address issues relating to sport.
I would like to emphasise two points on the reasons why I think this report is so important.
Firstly, I think that we should not forget that sport is a great educational tool.
People have always talked about the qualities of sport - that it teaches us to value striving to succeed, or that it brings people together, for example. A million things I do not intend repeating right now.
However, what I do want to say - and if I may be so bold I would like to say I have some experience in this field - is that young people, especially children, do not usually, or would find it difficult, to forget what they have learnt through playing whilst practising sport.
Sport has a great educational role in a wide range of fields, especially in areas such as the environment. This is just one of the many areas that can benefit from education through sport.
The second point I would like to emphasise is that we should not forget that we are living in a Europe in which differences based on race and culture are growing every day, and that we all have to make an effort to integrate into the European Union.
Sport plays a fundamental role in this integration.
This would be difficult to achieve with any tool other than sport, and any attempt to do so would entail enormous costs.
I hope that 2004, European Year of Education through Sport, will be the driving force we all need to be able to ensure the inclusion in the Treaty of an article that makes specific reference to sport, and for this programme to be the starting point, and only the starting point, of what sport can achieve in the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say, by way of introduction, that I regret that it is so late in the day that we are dealing with topics of interest to young people.
The galleries are empty.
All day long, there are young people sitting in the galleries and now their issues are being discussed there is, unfortunately, nobody there.
Perhaps we can change that in the future, when proximity to our citizens might mean that people understood what goes on in this House.
Despite that, I rejoice at the initiative that has been set in motion, and I would like to thank you too, Commissioner, for the way sport has been brought more into the field of vision of European policy and perhaps getting more attention.
I am convinced that sport merits such attention, playing as it does a very large number of roles in society, for example, enhancing communication skills and social skills, personality development, preventing ill health and more of the same besides. Sport is a very important factor in social and economic policy.
As an initiative, the Year of Sport or of Education through Sport is a very good first step, and one that needs to be followed by many more.
Despite that, there is one criticism that I would like to address, one on which I agree with Mrs Pack.
The title of 'Year of Education through Sport' is intended to restrict the events to schools.
I cannot go along with that, believing as I do that clubs and organisations have to be involved in the activities and supported in doing so.
Education through Sport does not only happen in schools, but mainly in clubs and in an immense number of sporting organisations.
The Year of Education through Sport must also, I believe, make an impression on clubs and acknowledge the work they do.
I also expect there to be much discussion in this House of the values that sport embodies, about what, for example, fair play is, about the nature of amateur and professional sport, about what is meant by training and care for young sportsmen and sportswomen and a good deal else.
Discussion must range far and wide.
If we leave an area out, it will only be half a job and we will have wasted an opportunity.
The European Year of Languages was, I think, a very good example.
It involved both the schools and every sort of educational organisation, making it possible to spark many initiatives and get many new schemes moving.
We should take it as our example.
It worked, and the same thing can also - must also - work in sport.
Sport is movement!
You should not be restricting movement, but encouraging it.
That calls for scope for development and also for financial guarantees.
Over the centuries, sport has played an important role in our lives.
Maybe this is overrating it a little.
Who does not remember the sports days at school when we were young, in which everyone had to take part, whether they were sporty or not?
They gave us a good feeling afterwards, a feeling of solidarity, and that is actually what we want to work on together this year.
I therefore welcome the proposal to pronounce 2004 European Year of Education through Sport as an excellent initiative, and I should like to thank Mrs Pack for the thoroughness with which she has studied the proposal.
I agree with her that the title sounds a little contrived.
My personal opinion is that the title is formally correct of course, for sport does not have its own legal basis.
A number of Member States were opposed to it, and in this way, a compromise can be struck after all.
In my view, it also emphasises precisely the educational side of sport, something which I very much applaud.
Nevertheless, I should like to make a few observations with regard to this plan.
Sport at school is an excellent way of teaching children all kinds of human values, such as fair play, team spirit and tolerance; sport can even play a role in creating solidarity and understanding for your fellow human beings, and this is more than ever essential.
You will understand where I am coming from, but sport helps in the fight against xenophobia and vandalism, certainly if the children in school teams are able to take part in competitions between schools, and at regional, national and also European level, as Mrs Pack suggests.
A fine concept, whereby the European idea is spread.
The objections my group has in this connection pertain to the idea that such competitions should be organised and funded by the Commission.
The Commission does not have the budget for competitions of this kind, and in my view, it is not up to the Commission to organise these.
I take the view that this would sooner be a role for national Olympic committees.
Another point I should like to make is the fact that this initiative should not be restricted to one year.
Sound initiatives should be followed up.
I am confident, however, that Mrs Reding is already thinking along those lines and will unquestionably work on this.
Mr President, the European Year of Education through Sport will provide an excellent opportunity for promoting the social importance of sport within our society and will be a very powerful tool for promoting integration.
One third of Europe's citizens pursue a physical activity on a regular basis, making sport one of the most significant social phenomena in Europe in the 20th century.
Sport is an excellent way to engage people in their communities.
It can contribute to education and lifelong learning, as well as promoting qualities of leadership, citizenship and teamwork.
The Year of Education through Sport should concentrate on the social inclusion aspect of sport.
However, for this to become a reality, we need to provide better facilities within deprived communities.
What I am deeply concerned about is the lack of group leaders and volunteers to run sports projects, especially in the more depressed regions.
What will be in the programme to address this?
Also it is important that projects chosen should provide a firm foundation on which to build.
The momentum provided during 2004 must carry on beyond 2004 - it should not stop there.
It should become an established part of projects within our communities.
The involvement of local and regional authorities also during the year will be crucial to its eventual success, as they are in a unique position to ensure that the widest possible access to local community action is achieved.
Sport is not only a form of entertainment for the spectator. It also has a strong social dimension and it is this social dimension that should be one of the main themes during the year.
All sports should be included, not just the mainstream sports - and we need to emphasise this throughout the programme.
It is also important to link projects started under the European Year of Disability in 2003 with sporting projects for the disabled in 2004.
No one should be excluded.
I thank the rapporteur for an excellent initiative and look forward to participating in the development of the projects throughout the year.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Pack for her persistent efforts.
To start work on a dossier in 1995 or 1996 and to still be working on it today could really be called fighting for a cause.
That is my first point and I would like to thank you for having shown such commitment.
My second point is that I am a member of two parliamentary committees, namely the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, both of which have the rather sad or dubious privilege of working long hours on a regular basis.
If I may, this evening, I would like to bring together these two concerns and discuss both equal opportunities and sport.
This is the purpose of my amendment, which I would like to come back to, as I think that this is a very important point.
In its decision, the Commission is, in actual fact, highlighting discrimination alone.
Yet, I do not feel that this aspect, which Mrs Pack has also emphasised in a recital, is sufficient.
I think that sport, for girls and for women, is a factor which encourages identification and emancipation and that we must, therefore, give it the importance that it deserves.
I would remind you that the subject of equal opportunities in sport was highlighted during the Beijing +5 Conference held in New York in June 2000, and that Article 26 of the Helsinki report of September 2000 also mentions this issue. Furthermore, the IOC organised a conference on 'Women and Sport' in Paris in the year 2000 and the French Minister for Sports placed the issue of 'women and sport' on the agenda back in 1997; the success of this initiative speaks for itself.
Thanks to this initiative, the media now gives coverage of sporting competitions for women.
I think that we must take all of this on board.
I know, Commissioner, that you intend to organise a symposium on 'women and sport' in the near future and this is something I welcome.
I think that we must stress this point in the report.
In the Mediterranean countries, for example, in Iran or in Algeria, women achieve emancipation through sport.
Sport is therefore an important factor in emancipation.
In France and in other countries of the Union, young immigrants manage to achieve emancipation, perhaps not through the right of vote and citizenship, but through their bodies and sport.
Sport is therefore an extremely important social link, which is something the previous speaker pointed out.
I would, therefore, like us to stress this point.
As a final point, I would like to mention that there is a problem with one of my amendments because the French word mixitÃ© has been translated into English as 'mixed-sex sport'.
In actual fact, I did not mean mixed-sex sport; I meant diversity in sport; women's sport must be encouraged at school and at competition level.
I have brought this translation problem to light, but I did not notice it until it was too late, and I hope that Mrs Pack will take this into account.
Well, we know that the Olympic Games are approaching.
We know that from one Olympic Games to another, the role that women play in sport is increasingly important.
I would hope that this role is even more important in Athens than it was in Sydney and I know that I am not the only one who is hoping for this.
Education obviously serves as a basis for what may come later, namely performance and competition.
I hope, Mrs Reding, that these considerations regarding women and sport will be of interest to you.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on this report, which was adopted unanimously in committee.
Indeed, we would like to take this opportunity to stress how important the initiatives and displays linked to the European Year of Education Through Sport will be, taking place as they will be in 2004, the year when the European Championship, the Athens Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games will all be held as well.
It will also be an important year in terms of the Winter Olympics, which will be held subsequently in 2006 in Turin.
A year or so ago, Commissioner Reding announced this event here in Strasbourg, stressing precisely the wider impact of sport, a dimension which is not just linked to its purely economic role but also - and, I would add, in particular - contains social and cultural added value for European society as a whole.
However, there are still great disparities in the world of sport and we must therefore focus in particular on the small sports clubs and support their efforts in training young people.
You will also remember, Commissioner, the meeting I had with you on football transfers in Europe, on which occasion I suggested creating a European Sports Agency.
I feel that this is still a very relevant project, although it must first be included in the Community Treaties on the basis of the declaration on the specific characteristics of sport made by the Fifteen at Nice in December 2000.
Indeed, I feel that such a body would aid the dissemination and promotion of healthy sporting activity and a European-level sporting culture while, at the same time, encouraging cooperation between sporting bodies to combat violence, discrimination, racism and even doping.
The European Year of Education Through Sport will therefore be an extremely important event and we are ready to give it our full attention.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Pack for her report, and the Commission for the efforts it is making to remove obstacles to strengthening and promoting sport.
I believe that if we want the European Year of Education through Sport - 2004 - to be a success, we must work hard to ensure that it does not end up as just another action that is set up by the EU but which never actually reaches the citizens.
In this regard, and so that this action does not go unnoticed, I think we need to make use of all the institutions at local, regional and national level that have been working for a long time to promote the educational value of sport.
These institutions should contribute to this action in a coordinated fashion, contributing synergies, which is the most important thing.
The promotion, dissemination and study of all sciences related to physical activity and sport is the best weapon we have to educate people against intolerance and xenophobia and to support social integration.
Mr President, I wish to thank my colleague, Mrs Pack, for her work in preparing this report.
For years now she has done some really excellent work to promote sport and physical education.
It is excellent that the Commission has set out to organise a Year of Sport. It was about time.
It is regrettable that sport has no legal basis in Community legislation.
There must be a separate Article devoted to sport, or at least it should have a clear mention in the article that deals with culture.
This would not mean that the sports world would be deprived of its influence but that sports organisations would themselves be able to influence the decisions that apply to them.
Young people who go in for sport must be included in the EU's various exchange programmes.
The current practice, whereby sports-related projects get hidden away under other articles in the budget, is ridiculous.
It is always better to call things by their right name.
Unquestionably, sport is also of educational importance, as the report mentions.
For this reason I hope that the status of sport in the school curriculum will be seriously reconsidered.
In many Member States schools organise important voluntary activities after the official school day has ended.
Resources for these afternoon activities must also be significantly increased.
Clubs that organise voluntary activities in the afternoon often do valuable work.
Physical activity in the afternoon enables children to satisfy their natural need and desire for exercise.
At the same time they are being offered something meaningful to do and social problems and exclusion are being prevented.
Thanks to the clubs children do not need to spend long hours alone in the afternoon while their parents work longer days than before, there being no let-up in the labour shortage that is beginning to emerge.
Mr President, when I say that it is a pleasure to speak to you today about the European Year of Education through Sport, I mean this sincerely, because I truly believe that we are nearing our goal and that we have finally made a good start to a process that will lead us to great and important things for our societies, but also, and above all, for the young people in these societies.
There are very few fortunate coincidences in politics but I am very pleased that Mrs Doris Pack is rapporteur today, because it was she who came up with the idea back in 1996. Mrs Pack, was lange wÃ€hrt, wird endlich gut.
[It was worth it in the end.]
Let us hope so!
When I became Commissioner, I immediately took up this idea and placed the project on the agenda.
I know that it is not the European year of sport that you had wanted.
You are also aware, however, and you have also acknowledged this, that the Community has no specific responsibilities in this area.
However, this should not prevent us, as the Nice European Council urged us to do, from using the values that sport encourages to strengthen and improve existing Community policies and actions.
In my view, the European Year of Education through Sport is of political, practical and symbolic importance.
It is of political importance, as it demonstrates that the Commission is interested in fully harnessing the educational and social values of sport.
It is of practical importance as EUR 11.5 million will be released to finance Community, national, regional and local projects and this money will be added to the appropriations that our partners have earmarked for this event, which means that, in 2004, further, ample resources will support the educational dimension of sport.
And do not forget that the European Year of Languages was a great success.
Why was it successful?
Because it was taken up by the people, the citizens and by private associations.
It enabled us to make progress.
It stimulated a debate, and society itself took charge of it.
So, ladies and gentlemen, often, all that is needed is a boost of this kind to bring about change.
Lastly, it is of symbolic importance, because 2004 is an Olympic year.
Yet, the Olympic Games are scheduled for the beginning of the century along with other events such as the European, intercontinental and world championships.
The European Year will take place throughout the Union, and I think that the eyes of the whole Union will be on this event and it will be a wonderful opportunity to promote the social, educational and cultural values of sport, whilst reminding us of the roots of the Games when sport was not simply a business, but was a festival of culture and education.
I knew, Mr President, that I would find an ally in the European Parliament.
Not simply because the idea was conceived here, in Parliament, but also because the Commission has always had the firm support of Members to place the ideas and values of sport on the education agenda.
It was a pleasure to read Mrs Pack's report and I did so with interest. Not only does Mrs Pack support our proposal, but she also improves it in a number of areas.
Some aspects of the report will however merit particular attention and will provoke some reservations within the Commission.
They are not fundamental problems; rather, they are reservations that have been inspired by legal concerns, or quite simply because we believe that certain ideas that have been expressed exceed the framework of the legislative provision.
First of all, Amendment No 7, which designates three specific sporting events in addition to the Olympic Games in Athens.
I think this is tantamount to inviting speculation regarding the hierarchy of different types of sports and levels of competition in terms of media coverage and public interest.
Since any list of this kind is highly contestable and most certainly incomplete, I think that it would be preferable not to list any of them and include all of them.
Secondly, Amendment No 22 and Amendments Nos 29 and 38 which refer to it cannot, unfortunately, be accepted by the Commission.
It is not that I do not think the idea of organising inter-school competitions, of encouraging partnerships between academic organisations and sporting organisations, of benefiting from the symbolic and media impact of the flame is not both excellent and feasible - very much the opposite in fact - but the Commission itself has no authority to organise projects of this type.
It has no competence in this area, I reiterate the autonomy of the sporting movement, on the one hand, and the autonomy of the Member States in organising studies, on the other hand.
We cannot therefore impose such partnerships from above.
Having said this, I myself believe that carrying out this type of project is extremely important as is the great symbolic value of the Olympic flame and truce, for example.
Not only do I want to ensure that the text of the decision makes such projects possible but I also want to do everything possible, Mrs Pack, so that our partners, both schools and the Olympic committees, take the initiative as part of this European Year.
In addition, I have good reason to be optimistic: look at the sport/school political action launched in 2001-2002!
This was a pilot project launched by the European Olympic Committees and the Ministers for Education in the three pilot countries: the Netherlands, France and Italy, with the support of the European Commission.
This test has already shown that yes, such projects are possible, that we can forge ahead and that we can find partners who wish to support this action.
On this basis, ladies and gentlemen, with your help, I think that, during the European Year of Education through Sport, we will find many associations, many bodies, many volunteers who are willing to help us.
This is also one of the key objectives of this European Year, namely to encourage the educational institutions to work in partnership with sporting organisations.
Formal training and non-formal education must be combined.
Sport encourages values, such as teamwork, solidarity, respect for rules, respect for one's opponent, thinking of others, so many elements which will be on the agenda during this European Year.
The year 2004 is an Olympic year. It is a year that will be marked by other prestigious events and sport and sportsmen and women will be making headlines practically every day.
We must use the impact generated by the media to prove that, as well as sports played at a highly competitive level, which receive generous financial assistance, there is also considerable work being done by civil society, in particular based on the voluntary sector which we must support and encourage.
It is this educational and social dimension in which the Community is interested.
We must also thoroughly prepare this year: so many things must be done in advance, for instance work, contacts and scheduling all need to be arranged.
That is why I hope, Mr President, that Parliament will make every effort to reach a political agreement with the Council as soon as possible, in order to adopt a common position before the end of the Spanish Presidency, which is what the Presidency really wants.
I think that this would be in everyone's interest.
It would certainly benefit the idea that, back in 1996, Mrs Pack proposed and desired; in other words, to place sport and its social and educational dimension in the limelight for the good of Europe, for the good of our societies.
Thank you for your help.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 9.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
?he Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, my comment refers to the point of order I made yesterday, which has been wrongly recorded in the Minutes.
The Minutes say that I protested about the recent change to the Criminal Code in Slovakia.
In fact an amendment has been tabled in an attempt to change the code; it has not been changed already and I would be obliged if this could be corrected.
Rest assured, Mr Alyssandrakis, the correction you request will be made.
Mr President, I asked for the floor yesterday, but my request was refused due to a lack of time.
What I wanted to say was that even though, according to the information available, the possibility of an imminent attack by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip cannot be discounted, never mind the carnage that will unleash, even though the ruling Likud party in Israel is open in its opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state and has passed a resolution to that effect and 13 Palestinian fighters have been expelled from their homeland as terrorists at Sharon's insistence, the Council has still not reached a decision and I have no idea which countries the Council will finally decide should accept these fighters.

My question is this: what will the status of these thirteen fighters be, wherever they end up, and is there any possibility of their being returned at Israel's request, which would, of course, be criminal.
Also, does the European Union intend to continue to aid and abet the regime in Israel, in blatant disregard of the European Parliament's resolution that the partnership with Israel should be suspended, and does it intend to continue funding and arming this criminal regime?
Thank you for your intervention, Mr Korakas but for the moment, as you know, we are discussing the Minutes and the order of business.
There is a whole debate on the Middle East on the agenda.
The questions which you have just put relate to the debate on the Middle East scheduled for tomorrow.
Mr President, as far as I know, given how times are allocated, I shall not have a chance to speak.
If you wish to arrange for us to be given even just a minute to restate these questions, then gladly.
Mr Korakas, I have no wish to get involved in a detailed discussion of how speaking times are allocated.
You know full well that there are rules which apply.
What I would point out is that the questions you have put are material questions which relate to the debate on the Middle East, not the order of business or the Minutes, which is what we are discussing now.
(The Minutes were approved)
The next item is the vote on the request for a topical and urgent debate on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks [COM(2002) 108 - C5-0135/2002 - 2002/0053(CNS)]
Mr President, regarding this request from the Council in respect of a Commission proposal for a Council regulation establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks, I would like to say that I have consulted with the rapporteur, and I call on the House to reject this request.
Deep-sea stocks are fished stocks caught in waters beyond the main fishing grounds of continental shelves.
They are distributed on the continental slopes or around sea mounts.
These species are slow growing and they are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation.
Since fisheries for these species have developed in recent years, it is necessary to establish a management system to ensure that their exploitation is sustainable.
The scientific advice that we have received indicates that the most appropriate conservation measures for these species would be based on effort limitation and, in certain cases, on reduction.
This proposal introduces elements of a system for the management of fishing effort directed at these deep-sea species.
It also includes elements for the collection of data and support of scientific assessment and appropriate management.
Under this proposal, fishing effort will be limited to recent levels and improved data will be made available for scientific assessment.
The Commission intends to propose further elements of an effort management system, as required by scientific advice in due course.
The proposal is complemented by a separate Commission proposal to restrict catches by means of quota management.
This is an urgent and important matter, but it is one on which, until now, no Community action has been taken.
It therefore requires very careful consideration by our Fisheries Committee.
The Council's request for urgency was received on the 3 May, while our first exchange of views on this is only scheduled for 22 May.
Given the lack of action by the Commission to date, I do not think it seems unreasonable to allow a few months for parliamentary scrutiny.
It also seems to me bizarre that the Council should request urgency in this matter when our understanding is that the President-in-Office of the Council has himself been involved in attempts to derail the timetable of publication of the CFPE reform proposals.
Therefore, I call on the House to vote against this request for urgent procedure.
Thank you, Mr Stevenson, for your contribution against the motion.
No one appears to wish to argue in favour of the motion.
I therefore put the motion to the vote.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
Mr President, I actually wanted just to say on the record that there are an increasing number of cases here in Brussels of bagsnatchers smashing in the side windows of cars and women drivers getting injured in the process.
I would like to ask that this be noted and consideration given to the possibility of doing something about this.
Thank you, Mr RÃŒbig, for your comments, which have been noted.
You will be pleased to hear that the Bureau is taking a very serious look at the question of security in general.
The next item is the report (A5-0146/2002) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the appointment of Mr Lucas Papademos as Vice-President of the European Central Bank.
Mr President, I propose that Parliament should confirm Mr Lukas Papademos's appointment as Vice-President of the European Central Bank, in accordance with the committee's unanimous vote.
Confirmation of the proposed candidate is not merely a matter of course.
It results from a hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and therefore has to do with monetary policy being transparent.
Experts may well know the President of the Central Bank, but Europe's citizens do not, yet they must be able to trust the Vice-President.
As a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, he will have a part in decisions on the euro zone's monetary policy which will affect growth and employment and thus people's lives.
After all, it is money that must serve people, not the other way round.
Decisions on monetary policy are the work of man, which means that they primarily call for personal integrity and character, skills, great experience of the economy and monetary affairs, and also a willingness to be candid.
The hearing emphasised the importance of these qualifications.
The new Vice-President is the first new member of the first Executive Board, which was so successful in preparing and introducing the euro.
What underlines the independence of the members of the Executive Board is that re-election to it is not permitted, and so this is renewed proof of personal independence.
The European Central Bank's independence - which I must re-emphasise today - is truly a constituent element in European Monetary Union.
At the end of the day, policy on money and currency is not neutral.
No institutions in a democracy can be infallible or function under the cloak of darkness; rather, democracy and integration policy make the transparency of decisions and of the reasons behind them inseparable from the European Central Bank's role.
Such transparency is, by the way, not only in the interests of European democracy, but also in the interests of the European Central Bank, which is thereby - and as recent years have clearly demonstrated - made more credible, more legitimate and more trustworthy.
It is in the popular interest and in the interest of the market that we want to build up this authority.
After all, as the renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter once said, a people's monetary affairs reflect everything that that people desires, endures, and is.
It is Parliament's view that the European Central Bank is far more transparent than previous national central banks in Europe and that, that being the case, we have undergone a kind of cultural revolution in the countries of the euro zone.
Parliament's dialogue with the European Central Bank on monetary affairs has made a real contribution to this.
This is not, in the final analysis, just about the publication of monthly, quarterly or annual reports, but also, in fact, about a monetary dialogue to question not only decisions on monetary policy but also the background to them.
We who are in Europe's Parliament, though, must continue to insist on these publications being followed by the publication of brief Minutes and of the voting record.
The US Federal Reserve has just decided to announce, on the same day that decisions on monetary policy are taken, how the individual members of its Board of Governors voted on them, so that everyone can know who voted for what.
For Parliament, the publication of the voting record without names would be every bit as adequate as publishing the arguments for or against a particular decision, as what is important for us to know is that they have not only, in fact, given consideration to price stability, the primary objective of monetary policy, but also to its secondary objective, namely the European Union's support for growth and employment.
It is interesting to note that an American study emphasises that, in the USA, the way Federal Reserve Board members vote is determined not only by the problems posed by the risk of inflation, but also by the problem of unemployment.
It would be reassuring to learn that members of the Board of the European Central Bank were influenced by this in view of it being the secondary task of monetary policy, as I have said, to support growth and employment, and in view of it having hitherto been unclear to Parliament how the European Central Bank defines the achievement of this second objective.
This very year, it will be crucial to achieve clarity on this point, because the faltering recovery in Europe should not be halted by decisions on monetary policy.
It became very clear, in Mr Papademos' vice-presidential nomination hearing, how important the interpretation of these objectives in Article 105 of the Treaty establishing the European Community is to him, and so I would again like to reiterate our support for his appointment, the legitimacy of which should be underlined by this confirmation procedure, even if it lacks significance in law.
Anything else would require reform of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is due to the imminent departure of the French Vice-President, Mr Noyer, that we are today debating the nomination of Mr Lukas Papademos.
On behalf of my group - and, I believe, on behalf of the whole House - I would like most warmly to thank the departing Vice-President for the excellent work he has done, as also exemplified by constant dialogue with Parliament and the favourable reception he gave to our arguments and proposals.
As its chairman has already said, the nomination of Lukas Papademos is supported unanimously by the committee.
There are, of course, reasons for this; his life, with a career in academic research and teaching, as well as a role as Governor and Vice-President of the Bank of Greece foreordain Lukas Papademos for this position.
If I may refer only to his two positions in Greece, he made, as Vice-President of Greece's central bank, a substantial contribution to the complete liberalisation of capital markets.
Apart from that, it was he who, as that bank's Governor, took Greece completely into the euro zone.
Let me also say that the hearing established beyond doubt that the new Vice-President of the ECB sees no contradiction between price stability on the one hand and growth and employment on the other; on the contrary, price stability is for him a precondition for the creation of growth and employment.
He therefore sees no reason to amend the treaty by which the ECB was set up.
Price stability is the task, cause and objective of the European Central Bank's policy.
I thank him for his proposals for greater transparency in announcing the European Central Bank's decisions in order to strengthen public confidence in the euro, and for his clear commitment to the European Central Bank's independence and to rejecting political interventions.
Together with the Council, we have made the right decision.
We wish him every success.
Thank you, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0153/2002) by Mr Caudron, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting the Sixth Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities, contributing to the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation (2002-2006).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 14 November 2001, Parliament adopted, by a very broad majority, my report on the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) for research, technological development and demonstration activities.
We retained the structure, the principles and the philosophy of Commissioner Busquin's plan and enhanced these aspects with contributions by citizens from the research community so as to better respond to the aspirations of the European people.
On 10 December 2001, the Research Council responded, in an extraordinary manner, to many of our requests and proposals.
Since then, we have continued to work together to clarify some points and to further improve the framework programme in close collaboration with Commissioner Busquin and his staff as well as the Council Presidency and Mr MarimÃ³n SuÃ±ol.
Everyone has made an effort, everyone has listened to and tried to understand each other; to work around others' limitations and to seek compromise.
On 23 April 2002, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy adopted 90 amendments, 30 of which will be included in the specific programmes.
We requested further clarification on the instruments for the implementation of the programme, on the aid to SMEs and on micro enterprises.
We emphasised research, sustainable development and the reduction of external environmental costs.
We reiterated our commitment to basic research.
Lastly, we stressed the importance of research in the fields of health and combating major diseases, whilst bearing in mind everything which affects human and social research.
Before and after these votes, several informal and formal three-way meetings enabled us to reconcile the various points of view.
The administrative and technical teams of the three institutions, the MEPs concerned and their assistants have worked tirelessly.
And on 7 May, during a lengthy and particularly productive three-way meeting, we reached agreements involving 34 compromise amendments that the Committee on Industry approved last night, almost unanimously, thus giving me the go-ahead, as rapporteur, to substitute them for the amendments adopted on 23 April.
On the more delicate subject of ethical considerations, a broad agreement was reached, enabling the Commission to confirm the limits that must not be exceeded in this area, which means the Council can take these into account and that everything can be included in the specific programmes.
Commissioner Busquin is expected to confirm this later.
We are now on the verge of finally adopting the FP6, as the Council has already given us its written approval of the 34 compromise amendments that you are to vote on tomorrow.
I would like to conclude by once again thanking the Belgian Presidency which enabled us to adopt a very positive common position on 10 December 2001.
I would again like to thank Commissioner Busquin and his staff, who have been open to our views, shown understanding and respect for Parliament and proposed imaginative solutions.
I would also like to thank Chairman Westendorp and the entire secretariat of the Committee on Industry, the administrators and secretariats of the political groups and my assistant, GaÃ«lle Le Bouler.
I extend my warm thanks to my colleagues who have worked with me on this matter for a year and a half, the shadow rapporteurs, the coordinators, the draftsmen, which include Mr van Velzen, Mr PiÃ©trasanta, Mr Alyssandrakis, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and also Mrs McNally.
I would thank in particular, the Spanish Presidency and Mr MarimÃ³n SuÃ±ol who have been open to our views and given a great deal of their time, something which is particularly deserving of our gratitude and praise.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have almost come to an end, with what will no doubt be my last major European report, after 13 years as an MEP.
I left the French Socialist Party six months ago, and will be standing in the legislative elections in France, as a candidate of the 'Forum Gauche Citoyenne' [Forum of the Citizens' Left], up against a Socialist Party candidate.
Either I will be elected and will leave the House, or I will be defeated and the Socialist Party will inevitably dismiss me from the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
Whatever happens, my life will be completely transformed and that is why I am pleased to close this chapter of my political life, having contributed to the creation of an excellent European research programme which, with a budget of EUR 17.5 billion, is the third largest European policy.
Today, 14 May 2002, I would like to express my genuine pride, and to praise Europe's scientific community with which I have worked closely and to thank once again all my colleagues and their counterparts who have helped and supported me over the last year and a half.
Mr President, I should like to start by making an unusual statement.
I should personally like to let the Commissioner know that our thoughts are with him in the difficult times he is currently facing on account of his wife's illness.
The PPE-DE Group wholeheartedly and fully endorses the compromises that have been made.
A number of my colleagues, for reasons of their own, will be tabling an amendment on the paragraph on ethics, the so-called 32 signatures procedure.
I welcome the fact that our colleagues use this right to demonstrate that, in their view, the paragraph on ethics has not gone far enough.
Quite honestly, I also hope that the Council and the Commission will seize the opportunity to come closer together in the near future, and closer to Parliament, and hold discussions with each other about ethical issues.
The ethical issues have not been solved by the Sixth Framework Programme - we know that there is a significant level of divergence between the Member States - but in my view it is most definitely worthwhile for us to continue to exchange ideas with each other on this score.
I should like to thank Mr Caudron for his excellent, open and communicative style of cooperation.
I should also like to thank our chairman, Mr Westendorp, for his sterling advice and support.
I should also like to extend my intense gratitude to the Commissioner, his cabinet and the members of the Commission for their extremely positive attitude and I should also like to thank the Council in particular.
The Belgian Presidency was first-rate, but the Spanish Presidency is a fine example of how it is possible for the Council and Parliament to work together, and I believe that it is thanks to the Council that we have managed it.
Except, of course, that the budget has made a distinct shift towards us.
Needless to say, as an MEP, you always want more, but ultimately you have to accept the compromise.
Personally, I am delighted that in the area of cancer research we have managed to set an example of how you can allocate both National and European funds and how you can develop far greater strength in cancer research by combining two funds.
I am extremely pleased about that.
I also welcome the fact that the relationship between the framework programme and the specific programme has gained in strength and coherence, and I would also thank the Council for its efforts in this area.
All in all, I am of the opinion that the long journey we have undertaken to ultimately achieve this result has been very worthwhile.
We can, however, also tell the scientific world that Parliament, the Council and the Commission have joined forces in order to produce the best possible result that we could possibly manage at the time, and in my view this is a great success today, not only for the Commissioner, but for us all.
Mr President, I should like to add my congratulations to those already expressed to the rapporteur, to the Spanish presidency and to Commissioner Busquin who has been exemplary in his patience, understanding and respect for Parliament's opinions.
Clever people all over Europe are waiting to hear what we decide this week, because next year they will be able to use their brains on our behalf.
We will give them the money to do work which will help our economy and our society.
There is a strong correlation between research effort and economic success, and the European Union at least is giving an example and showing that it understands that connection.
We have been able to reach a very wide consensus in Parliament across political and national boundaries on the Sixth Framework Programme.
We are coming up with a programme which highlights key areas for research but at the same time expresses the wishes of the citizens of Europe for scourges like cancer and other illnesses and for environmental dangers to be combated with intelligence.
This is one part of the European research area.
Member States must do the rest.
It is their responsibility.
The European Union is doing its part.
Thank you to those who have enabled more money to be spent on the important area of science and society which includes a detailed examination of ethics.
We in the PSE Group will not support amendments on ethics, but we appreciate the declaration which has been brought forward.
At the end of a long process, may I thank once again our excellent rapporteur who has worked in a remarkable way, our shadows and everyone else involved.
Clever people of Europe, the money is on its way!
I am delighted to endorse the views of my fellow MEPs, and I should like to thank everyone who has helped establish this framework programme.
At the moment, there is no real European Research Area.
One of the key conditions for bringing this about is a well-oiled, fast communication infrastructure.
This is why the liberal group has always set such great store by the progress made in the Geant project.
After all, effective, rapid communication is essential in order to enable researchers to work together.
I am therefore pleased that under pressure from Parliament, firstly the budget for Geant was increased, and secondly the management structure was considerably improved by means of sound agreements within the European Commission.
Another important prerequisite for cooperation and the transfer of knowledge is the mobility of researchers.
I should like to draw the attention to this aspect once again.
Many of our top people - and this is echoed throughout the world of research - sometimes spend time in America to learn about new developments.
However, sound pre-conditions to guarantee the return of these researchers are lacking in Europe, so that sometimes they prefer to stay in America.
This is a brain drain, and we need these brains in order to turn Europe into the world's most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy.
My last point concerns ethics.
A great deal has been said on this topic over the past few months, and I should like to say something about the attitude of a number of fellow MEPs who are attempting to thwart innovations in the field of biomedical research.
The liberal group is also acutely aware of the ethical dilemmas posed by the ever faster evolving technological possibilities.
A balanced, well-thought-out approach is what is required.
But how can we ever become this competitive economy if we nip each and every innovation in the bud in the name of moral standards and even attempt to impose views on other Member States?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you that we in the liberal group are pleased with the current wording, as laid down in the common position on ethics.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to extend our thanks to Mr Caudron, our rapporteur, as well as to our shadow rapporteurs.
Mr Caudron was very willing to listen to our views and it was a pleasure for us to work with him in drawing up the Sixth Framework Programme.
As far as the Council is concerned, I must also thank the Belgian Presidency, represented by Mr de Donnea, who worked hard to include the proposals that Parliament, in particular, desired, and I would also thank the current Spanish Presidency.
The fact remains, however, that the person who most influenced the Sixth Framework Programme was undoubtedly Commissioner Busquin.
I would like to pay tribute to him and thank him, because he was always very open to our proposals. He considered them in a professional and sensitive manner.
I would like to give him my sincere thanks for his contribution to the Sixth Framework Programme to establish the European Research Area - it was his idea - and the new instruments, such as integrated networks, networks of excellence, integrated projects and the stairway to excellence.
We shall, of course, discuss the various themes.
There is the difficult issue of ethics which I do not wish to tackle, as this is an area of concern for us.
There appears to be a majority of Green Members in favour of rejecting the amendment on ethics.
We are concerned by this serious issue and we must be aware that European scientists as well as the public look to us when we take decisions in this area.
I recognise that the question of the use of embryos for research purposes is a very personal question, that there are Members in each group who are in favour and against their use. It is no secret that there are different opinions, even within our group.
However, we must bear in mind that Parliament, at first reading, adopted an amendment whose aim was to restrict research activities in this highly sensitive area.
It seems likely, at the current time, that Parliament will accept the Council's proposal not to deal with ethics in detail in the Framework Programme and if we accept the Council's proposal, we are essentially recognising that ethical issues must be dealt with by the experts, by scientists, by the Commission, and not by ourselves, the politicians.
There may be good reasons for accepting the compromise and it is up to each of us to decide if it is better to avoid conciliation or to find a satisfactory solution to ethical issues.
All I can say to you now is that when we meet the members of our groups to discuss the issue of ethics, we must not forget that the public believes that these are political issues for which we, as politicians, are responsible: we cannot delegate this responsibility.
We have further reasons to welcome this Framework Programme: the theme of sustainable development has been included for the first time and has been given a substantial budget, more than EUR 2.2 billion; research into energy, within the framework of renewable energy, is on a par with research into nuclear energy; sustainable transport and research into urban and rural ecosystems, with, in particular, an 'ecosite' concept, are new themes which were accepted.
We are also pleased with the appropriations which were added for international relations, particularly for the science/society theme.
It is now up to us to optimise the Sixth Framework Programme through these very specific programmes which will be developed, as the Commission promised, and on which we shall report back very soon.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for the tremendous effort he has put into this report.
I should also like to thank Commissioner Busquin, the President-in-Office, Mr MarimÃ³n, all the shadow rapporteurs in the political groups, the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Mr Westendorp, and all the secretarial staff involved in this procedure for the excellent cooperation which has marked it from the outset.
Having studied the outcome, I must say that it is a significant improvement on the original text and, as such, our group will support it.
However, there are certain points which I should like to raise regarding the procedure for applying the framework programme and any subsequent programmes.
Although the framework programme successfully identifies a whole range of leading-edge subjects for modern research, its orientation is, in my view, excessively narrow, with little room for all the research sectors which deserve support to benefit from funding.
Because, objectively-speaking, the framework programme points the way for research by the Member States, I worry that this unilateral orientation may become the rule.
?he second point which concerns us is where the money will end up.
What worries me is that a large slice of the funding will go to industry, with a tiny sliver for universities, research institutes or small research groups, irrespective of the standard of work carried out.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is huge research potential in all the Member States of the European Union.
If we manage to tap into and fund it and apply the results obtained, we shall have done a very great service to the generations to come.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, of course our group broadly supports the Sixth Framework Programme and the objective that is being formalised here of more financial resources for European research policy.
We are aware of the enormous importance of this programme for scientific research in the Union and that this is a crucial step in establishing the European research area.
The reason for my speaking, however, if only for a minute, is once again to draw attention to the ethical issues that cannot be ignored.
Our group feels that the wording of Article 3 is unsatisfactory.
Hence our insistence on tabling Amendment No 89, which presents a solution that is, in our opinion, correct: the principle of legislative unanimity.
This ethical question is extremely sensitive and we must trust the decisions that the various Member States take at the highest level on this issue.
To this extent, we feel that European research funds must only be used for those objectives and in accordance with those methods and means that are not deemed to be illegal in any Member State.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are, by voting on the report on the Sixth Framework Programme, laying the foundation for projects to be supported to the tune of a total EUR 17.5 billion, which is a considerable amount of money.
What was made clear, as early as first reading, by the incredible number of amendments, is just to what an extent views differ in this House on what form the Framework Programme should take.
Diametrically opposed positions are appearing now at second reading when it comes to the definition of basic ethical principles.
Opinions differ to too great a degree for there to be ready compromise, in the Community of Fifteen, on the boundaries of stem cell research.
We will certainly be concerning ourselves more in future with questions of bioethics.
I have my own difficulties with the use of embryos for research.
Most of all, I cannot approve of European research funds being used to promote something which, in many of the fifteen Member States, is illegal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see both light and shade in the outcome of the legislative process, which is now drawing to its close, on the Caudron report and on the Sixth Framework Programme.
A whole range of proposals made by Parliament have been taken up in the Common Position and in the Commission proposal, and there is a certain amount that we have achieved.
What I would mention as being particularly positive is that child illnesses and their treatment now have a place in European research policy.
There was, unfortunately, resistance to that at first, but that resistance was successfully overcome.
I see it as particularly important that priority one not only includes genetic engineering, with all the opportunities it offers us, but also medical research in general.
For these improvements I wish to thank all parties involved - the Commission, Commissioner Busquin, Mr Caudron, the rapporteur; the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr van Velzen, and also the Spanish Presidency.
I see, however, the compromise we have now achieved as having one great and grave defect, in that no clear rules have been enacted on how to deal with ethically sensitive areas of research.
Parliament has difficulties with this, of course, but we adopted an amendment at first reading which could at least show Europe the way ahead.
Even though I do not give it my wholehearted support, it is a compromise that has taken form there.
It is unfortunate that the Council has wriggled out of its responsibilities by not setting down any clear rules in this area.
Legal uncertainty now makes this a difficult situation for all concerned.
The Commission will not have an easy time of it with this text, which incorporates no mandate that might, for example, support research with human embryos, although the possibility of this is not clearly excluded either.
This will lead to disagreements, and that is another reason why we, in Europe, should carry on working towards a compromise.
I am prepared to join in working on a compromise even if it means disregarding my personal conviction in favour of tight restriction.
Co-funding will be impossible for as long as a compromise of that sort is not reached.
Subsidiarity cannot mean that we may well have no common rules, and that everyone does as he pleases, but all share in paying for it.
That is why this issue demands that amendments be tabled and resolutions adopted.
Mr President, Commissioner, there are times when we can feel particularly happy to belong to a particular institution and this is one of those times.
The three institutions have worked well, in a way that the European citizens would want legitimately constituted institutions to work.
They have done so both effectively and speedily, thanks to Commissioner Busquin and the Belgian Presidency, who, with difficulty, were finally able to reach an agreement on the financial package, which, as you will all remember, five years ago was the bone of contention that caused delay in the adoption of the Fifth Framework Programme.
This will not happen again.
Thanks also to the Spanish Presidency, which has been particularly sensitive to Parliament's needs, and thanks, above all, to all the rapporteurs, Mr Caudron and the shadow rapporteurs, who have worked professionally and in Europe's interests.
This is, therefore, one of those times when one can feel truly happy and content at being a representative of this institution.
The work is not finished.
There undoubtedly remains a whole range of unknown factors - ethics, for example.
We have total respect for all of those who feel differently to us.
However, I would like to suggest that you will see for yourselves how, through the Council proposal for a common position and the Commission statement with regard to specific programmes, your concerns are being taken into consideration.
Above all, we shall ensure that this issue allows for the adoption of a framework programme in which the European Scientific Community has placed its hopes.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Caudron and Commissioner Busquin for their hard work in difficult circumstances.
In particular, I welcome the funding for sustainability and renewable energy in this programme.
With regard to ethical dilemmas in biotechnology, we need to take these, and the efforts to respond to ethical concerns in funding EU research very seriously.
In particular: the patenting of the human genome; human cloning in its various forms; the manipulation and modification of the human germ line - which is a particular concern - and the creation and use of human embryos in research.
Our citizens are very concerned and our policies and funding should match their concerns.
I have some animal welfare concerns also, in particular developing validation of alternative methods for animal testing and hastening the replacement of animal-based toxicity testing with regard to chemicals policy.
With regard to funding for health, I have welcomed the modifications here and would thank Mr Caudron for his concern, because human genome research cannot be the only strand of health research funded by the EU.
It looked as if that might happen, so I welcome the funding for health and complementary medicine.
Finally, I know that the Euratom programme is not part of the EC programme and is not subject to codecision, but I would welcome an assurance from the Commissioner that the Commission will reflect European Parliament concerns in its activities, and in particular our amendments to the Euratom programme.
Mr President, Commissioner Busquin, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I would like to pay a glowing tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, for bringing the second reading of an extremely difficult subject to a successful conclusion. As Chairman Westendorp quite rightly said, we can be proud that the report was submitted in the form in which it was adopted by the competent committee.
After a temporary committee of enquiry, which tried - unsuccessfully - to clear the way, was disbanded, Parliament then adopted a position with the Caudron report. This position is, of course, a compromise, but I believe it is very important for our countries, for research, for the future of millions of people who now believe that stem-cell research can offer the possibility of life in reality, not just in fantasy, which has been discussed extensively in recent years and in recent months even within Parliament.
This compromise, which states, in particular, that the framework programme could finance research on 'supernumerary' early stage - that is, up to 14 days - human embryos, in order to discover stem cells capable of treating diseases that are currently incurable, is a crucial but irreversible step forward.
I appeal to the Commission to do everything possible so that the compromise, which, of course, excludes all manipulation of human cloning for reproductive purposes, and which, at long last, represents a significant step forward for research, can provide a glimmer of hope for millions of European citizens.
We must not disappoint them.
We must adopt the Caudron report in its current form.
Mr President, as author of last year's report on the future of the biotechnology industries, I can only welcome most warmly the high priority given to the life sciences in the Sixth Framework Research Programme and strongly supported in Mr Caudron's excellent report.
On the health side, there are great prospects for breakthrough cures for some of mankind's most dreaded afflictions: cancers, heart disease, diabetes and cystic fibrosis, all the neurological diseases - such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, motor-neurone, spinal and brain injuries.
Genetic intervention could eliminate hereditary disasters such as haemophilia and Huntington's Corea which overshadow some families so tragically.
On the crop side, the potential is no less exciting, even if this suffers from a campaign of denial from certain shameless vested interests.
Hundreds of thousands have died and continue to die from smoking and road accidents, but no one has ever died from genetically modified crops or foods.
So much potential good is available to us in reduced applications of herbicides and pesticides, in reduced energy consumption and CO2 releases, and in better quality and higher yields.
This is before considering the potential in the developing world for feeding the starving, growing crops in drought-ridden and saline soils, rectifying vitamin deficiencies and so preventing disease for millions.
I call on the Commission and the Member State governments to brace their backbones and stand up robustly for what they know is for the good of mankind.
Our scientific community, our researchers - not least in my Scottish constituency which leads in these vital areas - deserve our whole-hearted support, not only in passing Mr Caudron's report overwhelmingly, but in backing the simplified and legally certain procedure for approving biopharmaceutical products; for approving genetically modified crops and foods for trials and commercialisation; and for protecting intellectual property rights with an economical and effective community patent.
Approving the Sixth Framework Research Programme is only the beginning.
We must follow up with the practical steps which will fully realise the potential of biotechnology.
Mr President, this is a great piece of work, and I would like to thank Mr Caudron most warmly, as well as Mr Busquin, who has left his mark on this programme with new ideas.
I wish him great success in implementing this programme.
It will not be easy to manage and implement such a large programme, with not only the fifteen Member States, but also other states taking part in it.
We wish you good luck on the way ahead, in any case.
I note with great satisfaction that two issues which I have put forward again and again have been included, the first of these being research into improved methods of clearing away anti-personnel mines.
I would ask the Commission to keep these efforts under one roof if at all possible.
The second is the issue of disarmament, a contribution towards the abolition of nuclear, bacteriological and chemical weapons, a technical contribution to their destruction.
Open today's newspapers and you read about how the two former superpowers are disposing of the heritage of the Cold War, that is, they want to disarm on a really massive scale.
If the European Union were to join them in this, that would be a noble endeavour.
We have achieved a compromise on the ethics issue.
The Commission has issued a statement which corresponds in essence to what Parliament resolved at first reading.
I would ask that we bring forward discourse on the finality of science, and also on ethics in Europe.
The actual problem is not with the Council, Parliament, or the Commission, but with different publicly-expressed opinions.
Playing a part in bringing forward the broadest possible public debate on the purpose, content, and finality of science and technology in Europe would be important and should become fundamental as the Sixth Framework Programme progresses.
In saying this, I would like to give you an assurance that Parliament is interested in this.
Being myself a co-founder of STOA, I am aware of the importance of the task of technological assessment, and hope that we will work well with the Commission.
Mr President, I cannot do other than congratulate Mr Caudron and lament the fact that this will be the last of the major reports he has drawn up in the European Parliament.
His work on this report is indeed remarkable and it opens up great horizons in many areas of research.
I continue to hold a resolute position with regard to bioethical issues, on which I have to say - to you, Commissioner, and to my fellow Members - that I have nothing but doubts.
I have been working on these issues for two years and I have nothing but doubts and only one certainty, which is the sacrosanct value of human dignity.
I suppose I believe in the institutions which are shaping the future, and the European Parliament is certainly a point of reference and not just for Europe.
We must realise that something unforeseen is happening which radically changes the rules of the game.
We must therefore assess the results of the increasingly rapid innovation, we must reflect on the way biotechnologies are advancing and what impact they could have on the very nature of the human race.
Biochemistry is only the beginning: in a future which is becoming increasingly imminent, we will have to adopt positions on the possibility of parents being able to alter the DNA of their embryos in order to provide their offspring with increasingly good genes.
We will have to deal with the selection - for the purposes of genetic improvement - of dozens of embryos produced for that purpose.
Cloning techniques will soon make it possible for individuals to produce copies of themselves, creating genetically identical twins which are capable of self-replicating, giving rise to a form of genetic immortality.
It is an inherent part of the nature of each of us to fight against death, pain and suffering, and science is interpreting this instinct perfectly.
The possibility appears to be attractive at first sight, but do we really realise how radically our existence might change?
Is the possibility of genetic improvement techniques being used by dominant classes to perpetuate their genetic superiority over weaker social classes really so far off?
I followed the long, anguished decision-making process on the Sixth Framework Programme closely; I witnessed a kind of resignation on the part of the Member States at their failure to come to an agreement on ethics.
Aware of the difficulties of my colleagues themselves, I persisted with my amendment in order to send out a clear, consistent message.
When I see companies springing up on the Internet offering to provide us with clones of ourselves at a high price, I realise that there is no limit to how bad things can get, but I also find in this a great incentive to persevere in the battle from which many - understandably disillusioned - people have already withdrawn.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to echo the thanks that have been extended to the rapporteur and to the European Commissioner, Mr Philippe Busquin.
Thanks to the efficient work of both, we have been able to reach a decisive stage today which proves that a democratic relationship between the European Parliament and the Commission is possible and which, I hope, will send a clear message to the scientific community as to the responsibilities that the European Parliament is able to shoulder.
We in this House often debate acts that are of fundamental importance to European integration.
The Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development activities will be one of the cornerstones of this integration.
If science did not occupy its rightful place, what would become of society? If knowledge and research were not progressive, what would become of our nations?
In affirming the European desire to create an area of research and innovation, we are rejecting tendencies to look to the past and attitudes that oppose change.
Philosophical considerations aside, the Sixth Framework Programme also underlines Europe's clear and firm commitment to be at the forefront of technological developments, to be innovative, competitive, dynamic and to build our future.
The proof of this is the numerous, practical aspects that the FP6 contains, such as human/social research, principles of integrating the issues of the environment, sustainable development, improved mobility, equal opportunities, the role of universities, education and openness to the world.
The coordination during both the Belgian and the Spanish Presidencies, between the various bodies of the European Union, has also been remarkable.
We must also emphasise the ongoing dialogue with the scientific community, the prospects of a network being set up and the increasing concern of the European Parliament and the Commission to keep in touch with the genuine needs, the genuine requirements of the people.
The Europe that we want to see becoming a daily reality is a Europe of research serving its people and its researchers.
Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Caudron, for his work in preparing this report.
He has done some excellent work in a very difficult situation, as the programme has been tossed around among the institutions.
The ethics of research are an important and controversial issue and everyone's opinion must be heard.
Now at long last we must decide on the Sixth Framework Programme, an enormous funding framework providing finance for supranational and transnational European research projects.
It is necessary to invest in European research, but after this Member States will be able to decide what sort of research they will be financing out of their own budgets in terms of ethical values.
The preparation of the Sixth Framework Programme is a prime example of inefficiency and bureaucracy, for which the framework programmes have been criticised for years now.
It can take many man-years to find projects, prepare them and produce the various reports.
All bureaucracy of this sort is depriving actual research of resources.
The programme's structure must be as light as possible so that we obtain the best forces possible for research and rapidly achieve results to serve industry, thereby increasing European competitiveness in accordance with the conclusions of Lisbon.
The gap between the United States of America and us is growing all the time.
Controversial questions such as the use of cannabis for medical purposes can play no part in this programme.
The Sixth Framework Programme must address and emphasise the importance of research developments in those areas in which real European added value can be achieved.
Despite all the decisions and effects, it is important that we now take decisions on the Sixth Framework Programme and that it is allowed to commence on time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, second reading by the European Parliament is a crucial stage in the adoption of the framework programme under the co-decision procedure.
I would like to stress that, during this procedure, cooperation between the three institutions was particularly productive.
I would like to thank Parliament and the Council for their commitment.
In particular, I would like to give sincere thanks not only to the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, but also to the shadow rapporteurs, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Mr PiÃ©trasanta and Mr Alyssandrakis, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp and all the members of this committee and those who contributed to this process.
I would also like to pay tribute to the Spanish Presidency and to Minister Marimon SuÃ±ol for the extremely efficient way in which they handled this important and delicate stage of the adoption process.
I would also like to reiterate the importance of the swift adoption of the framework programme and its launch in January 2003 for Europe's researchers and its scientific community.
On behalf of the Commission, I can approve all the compromise amendments adopted by the Committee on Industry.
The rapporteur, Mr Caudron, explained to you the main areas where compromise amendments were proposed by the Committee on Industry and the way in which the Council indicated that it could take them into account, following a series of informal three-way meetings.
Today, I shall simply expand slightly on each of these points, and where necessary, give you some details which you do not yet have.
The first point is the technical amendments which were adopted en bloc by the Committee on Industry on 23 April, and which are to be incorporated in the specific programmes.
The Commission undertakes to incorporate them in the specific programmes subject to the following statement being included in the Council's Minutes: 'The Commission considers that the content of the amendments voted 'en bloc' by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 23 April 2002 in relation to the second reading of the Sixth Framework Programme, is broadly acceptable and can, subject to the appropriate editorial changes, be incorporated into the specific programme decisions implementing the Sixth Framework Programme and, as appropriate, in the Rules for Participation of Undertakings, research centres and universities for the implementation of the Framework Programme'.
The Council intends to make a statement along the same lines.
My second point relates to the issue of instruments for the implementation and participation of SMEs.
The formula agreed by the three institutions emphasises the need to ensure a smooth transition from the current framework programmes to the new one, taking into account Parliament's concerns.
It is also clearly stated that special measures will be taken to stimulate and facilitate the participation of small- and medium-sized businesses as well as that of research bodies of the candidate countries in the measures undertaken in the priority thematic areas.
The next point relates to health.
In line with Parliament's wishes, the aspects of research on health were both strengthened and better identified, particularly as far as the European dimension of research and the communication of the results of this research to patients.
This is particularly the case for cancer research, which, as has been explained, is now the subject of a specific measure, which has been granted considerable resources.
Electronic networks for research is an additional point.
Parliament expressed its concern to see activities carried out on this theme within the framework of infrastructure support activities, which would be implemented in conjunction with those carried out in the priority thematic areas concerned.
In order to clear up any ambiguity on this point, it was agreed at the trialogue that the Commission would include the following statement in the Council's Minutes: 'The Commission states that the resources allocated to the activities on high speed electronic networks, notably GEANT and GRID - an amount of up to EUR 300 million, comprising up to EUR 100 million in Thematic Priority 2 'Information Society Technologies? and up to EUR 200 million in 'Research infrastructures? - will be managed in an integrated way.'
Moving onto the budget, the sense of responsibility with which the three institutions treated this subject can also be seen by the swift agreement which was reached on the overall amount.
However, significant concessions were made regarding budgetary allocation, in the direction that Parliament wanted.
In addition to the increase of resources granted to health research, I feel that the increase for specific aspects of international cooperation, as well as the science/society theme, correctly reflect the attention that Parliament devotes to these issues.
As far as international cooperation is concerned and in line with Parliament's wishes, additional emphasis was placed on the specific measures to support international cooperation with the developing countries, the Mediterranean countries, Russia and the new independent states.
The various methods of support for international cooperation in the framework programme have also been clarified.
My final point concerns ethical considerations.
This is such an incredibly sensitive issue. As you know, it was very difficult to find a solution on this point which reconciles both the wishes and the limitations of the three institutions.
I reiterate that, in no way, of course, do I wish to introduce harmonisation of rules for ethics at European level.
The Commission simply wishes to push forward European research, whilst respecting the prerogatives of each Member State and their parliament. There is no surprise there, in an area which is highly characterised by cultural and philosophical diversity and where the approach has always been and will always be the respect for opinion, values and sensitivities, within the boundaries of universally acknowledged principles.
It is nonetheless necessary to clarify the conditions in which research undertaken in the fields of science and technologies of the living being might be carried out within the specific framework of Community programmes.
In order to do this, and I think that this is an important step, the Commission has included the following statement in the Council's Minutes: 'In accordance with the opinion of the European Parliament concerning the proposal on the Sixth Framework Programme and taking into account the opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, the Commission believes that research in the following areas must not be financed by the framework programme: research activity aiming at human cloning for reproductive purposes, research activity resulting in the modification of the genetic heritage of human beings, which could make such changes hereditary, research activity to create embryos solely for research purposes or to supply stem cells, including somatic cell nuclear transfer.'
Of course, there is also the question of animal experiments, which must be replaced by alternative methods as far as possible, bearing in mind that the suffering of animals must be avoided or kept to an absolute minimum.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, within a very short space of time, thanks to exemplary collaboration - and I once again extend my heartfelt thanks to all those who played a part in this - we have made considerable progress.
Once the vote has been confirmed by the House, which I hope it will be, and once consensus has been achieved, we will still have some work to do.
The decision on the framework programme is only the first component of a mechanism which also comprises the rules for participation, which were also adopted under the co-decision procedure, as well as the specific programmes.
In order for Parliament and the Council to adopt the framework programme and its instruments for implementation in June, in accordance with the objectives that we have in mind, the three institutions must continue the close collaboration that was successfully engaged at the beginning of the procedure.
We worked very closely and in a very productive manner with the rapporteur for the rules on participation, namely Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, as well as with the rapporteurs for the specific programmes, Mr van Velzen, Mr Alyssandrakis, Mr PiÃ©trasanta, Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Zorba.
We must continue with these efforts.
The Commission certainly intends to continue to do everything in its power to encourage inter-institutional dialogue.
For the first time in the history of Community research, we are in a position to adopt the framework programme in a timely fashion, rather than at the very last minute, so that it can be launched and implemented in the best possible conditions.
We must seize this opportunity and we must give ourselves the means to take full advantage of this possibility.
This is what both researchers and European citizens will thank us for.
- (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week we have reached a crucial point in the discussion process aimed at the approval of the Sixth Framework Programme, a process that was started under the Swedish Presidency, continued under the Belgian Presidency and taken up by the Spanish Presidency.
Parliament has played a very important role in this process, through the Caudron report at the first reading of the Framework Programme.
We took many aspects from this first reading for our common position, because the issues and concerns that were aired in Parliament were the very issues and concerns that came to light in the Council and which also surfaced in other discussion groups.
I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the rapporteur, Mr Caudron, and the shadow rapporteurs Mr van Velzen, Mr PiÃ©trasanta and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, whose cooperation has really enabled us to get to the heart of the matter.
I am convinced that the programme that emerges from this process - and I am confident that tomorrow we will adopt a definitive programme - will be a significant improvement on the first programme we were presented with and a sign, therefore, of the mature and cooperative approach the various institutions have taken to the common position relating to the first reading, but even more with regard to the stimulating process that has taken place under our Presidency.
I believe that the positions of Parliament and the Council are now much closer, and this has been achieved through the desire to respond to scientists' and companies' request that we should implement this important instrument, and respond to the mandate we were given at the Barcelona Council that we pull out all the stops to approve the Sixth Framework Programme under our Presidency, and, also - as I said - because the concerns have been very much shared concerns.
The specific aspects relating to content have been more fully developed, such as research issues in health sciences, the question of a greater contribution by the GEANT network, scientific and social issues, research and support on environmental issues, for example. For this reason I would say that, in terms of content, we are now offering a framework programme that is much better defined and will serve as the key element in another great initiative that goes much further than the framework programme, which is the development of the European Area of Research and Innovation.
The Barcelona Council, taking up the commitment made in Lisbon, made a very ambitious commitment which was that, in the year 2010, Europe should reach a level of spending on investment in research and development of 3% of Gross Domestic Product, with a substantial participation, of two thirds, from enterprises in the private sector and from the private sector as a whole.
However, the figures are not the most important factor, but rather that we must recognise that Europe must change direction and take a qualitative and quantitative leap in order to achieve this objective of being highly competitive in the knowledge-based society.
The Sixth Framework Programme is an essential component of this.
However, with the satisfactory development of the Sixth Framework Programme we shall also develop other initiatives, such as better coordination of national programmes, a task we have promoted during our Presidency.
Therefore, particularly in this process, it appears crucial to us to respond effectively to the expectations of the scientific community and companies and reserve, as has been done, active participation for small- and medium-sized companies.
For this reason, I thank you once again for your work and I am sure that the other aspects, such as participation rules for specific programmes - will be formalised once the framework programme has been defined.
For our part, the Council has totally supported the Presidency's initiatives - which we are very pleased about - in the series of discussions we have held.
The Council takes particular note of the Commission's vision and supports the Presidency in including all the amendments that have been tabled en masse, as far as possible, finding the appropriate formulae from within the specific programmes.
The Council totally supports the entire fruitful discussion process we have held.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the Commission's presentation of the preliminary draft budget for the financial year 2003.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 30 April, the Commission decided on the preliminary draft of the Budget for 2003.
I am glad to be able to present the rough outline of it to you today.
Let me start by setting out in general terms the 2003 Budget's basic figures, which we had the opportunity of briefly discussing in the Committee on Budgets yesterday evening.
