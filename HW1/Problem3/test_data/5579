It is much easier to make irresponsible pronouncements about preventive strikes or merely to try and consolidate authoritarian powers.
The President of Russia should be trying to assuage the mutual hatreds of the different peoples within Russia.
These hatreds were bred by tsarism and continued by Stalinism, and have yet to be resolved.
Quite recently, militiamen in Moscow beat up an ex-astronaut, purely because he had a Chechen-sounding surname.
It is important for President Putin to show proper concern for every citizen of his country â not only Russians, but other peoples too, and for his immense power to be deployed to create peace and harmony.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, who have known the cruelties of terrorism for more than a generation, I wish to convey my heartfelt sympathy to the parents and people of Beslan.
The horrendous terror to which they have been subjected is unspeakable.
Terrorism is wrong wherever it occurs.
There is no justification or room for equivocation.
Be it the IRA fire-bombing a packed hotel outside Belfast and incinerating a dozen innocent people, al-Qa'ida attacking the twin towers, or Chechen extremists in Beslan butchering innocent children, the strategy is the same â maximum impact through maximum carnage in the hope of extracting maximum political concession.
Our experience in Northern Ireland should demonstrate that there is nothing honourable, enlightened or desirable about pandering to terrorism or finding excuses for it â it is evil in all its forms.
Across Europe and the world, it behoves us all to stand resolutely against it and its despicable apologists.
Â Â  Mr President, the image of children running away from an explosion, only to be shot in the back, is too repugnant for words.
Above all, our feelings of sympathy are for the victims, those left behind and the whole of Russian society.
Different though our opinions may be about a conflict such as that in Chechnya, there can never be any justification for atrocities of this kind, nor should anyone attempt to find one.
We as politicians owe it to the public to make every effort to prevent this from happening again.
It is ever more frequently apparent that terror knows no boundaries and is a threat to every open society.
In addressing this terror, we in the European Union will therefore, more than ever, need to join forces with countries such as the United States and Russia, while, within the Union too, we have an awful lot to learn in this area of cooperation.
Many plans have been forged under the guidance of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr de Vries, during this and the previous presidency, but it is just as important to monitor the implementation of plans that have already been adopted.
In the extra Justice and Home Affairs Council in the wake of the attacks in New York of September 2001, it was agreed that, from now on, all relevant information about terrorist threats would be exchanged within the EU.
A few days before the attacks in Madrid, it transpired that this exchange is still very inadequate.
We can no longer afford this.
Have fine words meanwhile been translated into action?
In fact, the need for identical implementation also applies to terrorist organisations that have been included on the European list.
Indeed, in our Union, which lacks internal borders, these organisations are banned in some countries, but not in many others.
The discussion about an effective and identical implementation of the plans should be held at a higher level, and it would be useful if the coordinator, Mr de Vries, were to send his progress reports directly to this House too.
After all, we show no real understanding for, and sympathy with, the victims of New York, Madrid and Beslan, unless ambitious words are turned into concrete action.
Â Â  â Mr President, we should express our deepest condolences to the victims of Beslan and their relatives.
These people need our help: communities across Russia as well as Beslan and its surrounding regions.
There is nothing more barbarous or mindless than the intentional killing of defenceless mothers and children.
We cannot be impartial faced with terrorism of this sort.
It threatens the rule of law, democracy, civil rights, the basis of our society.
The whole world has realised that things have now gone too far.
I headed a parliamentary delegation to Chechnya last year.
Parliament stressed that the conflict in Chechnya could not be resolved by military means.
The Russian Government stated that it would act accordingly.
Terrorism cannot be fought in ways that curtail democracy, civil rights and equality.
The background to terrorism involves social policy, and the remedy for it likewise involves social policy.
It will not come about through the use of weapons or the continued centralisation of power.
In Europe, we can see that Russiaâs policy on Chechnya has failed.
It is difficult to see how a continued centralisation of power in the Kremlin would help us understand this policy.
Up till now, we have supported the policy to promote stability and democracy under Putinâs leadership, and hopefully it will not now come about that, as a result of these tragic events, we start to rethink and alter our policy on Russia, because now Russia itself is also a victim.
Hopefully we will find, together with the Russian leadership, ways in which Russia could act in accordance with its own public proclamations, and which we could therefore support wholeheartedly.
This is a matter of joint concern.
Â Â  â Mr President, although it is the total horror, the complete and utter condemnation of the mad events in Beslan, that unites us all, I would urge you not to narrow the facts in Beslan and Chechnya down to a simplistic analysis of the fight against international terrorism.
There is a great deal more going on.
In Chechnya, a messy war is being fought.
Just read the reports by Amnesty International, or the report by our committee, of which I too was a member and to which Mr Paasilinna referred, or just look at what is happening in Chechnya.
A military solution is not possible.
What we need to establish is dialogue, a dialogue that should involve all parties, all parties within Chechnya, not only the clan around Mr Kadirov, but all clans in Chechnya, a dialogue including the rebels.
Mrs Thatcher once stated that she would never talk with terrorists, and yet it is thanks to Mr John Hume that the British and Irish Governments sat around the negotiating table, along with the IRA and the Protestant terrorist gangs.
This proved to be the solution for peace in Ireland, and this is also the solution for peace in Chechnya.
They should enter into talks with all parties, and Europe should play an important role in this, just as the United States did in Northern Ireland.
We must try to unite the parties and try to persuade them to work together.
That is what the Chechens are asking us, because the Chechens essentially want peace.
Â Â  Mr President, words fail me in the face of the tragedy that has befallen children and adults in Ossetia, but words must be found.
Words must be found and action taken to avoid further need for tears.
There is no such thing as good or bad terrorism, as all kinds of terrorism are bad.
There is no such thing as terrorism in the name of God, as every kind of terrorism is the work of the devil.
That said, the film on Chechnya we have been watching for years is not a black and white film, with a good sheriff pitted against the bad guys.
In this film the sheriff has also shot people in the back in the past, as in Chechnya there really are two kinds of terrorism.
There is the kind currently being discussed at length, both in this House and elsewhere, and there is the other kind noÂ one talks about, namely state terrorism.
The fact that the EU is putting forward its views on this issue is to be welcomed.
These views should be those of the entire EU, and this fact should be noted by Russia, which in the past has preferred to talk with selected Member States such as Germany and France, as demonstrated by the recent summit in Sochi.
If we act together, Mr President, as a single EU, it will be easier for us to exert influence on Russia and to fight for human rights, both in Chechnya and elsewhere.
Â Â  â Mr President, a particularly painful tragedy took place in North Ossetia, where the brutality on one side met with a lack of responsibility on the other.
It is reminiscent of the tragedy in the Moscow theatre and brings many things to mind.
Today when the Russian authorities declare that they will fight terrorism anywhere, that may seem new and positive, perhaps it opens the door to combined efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan, to stop acts of terror in Quatar and elsewhere.
When the Russian authorities condemn double standards, there springs the hope that Russian terrorists will also be persecuted, for example those who on the night of 31 July 1991 killed seven Lithuanian border guards in cold blood.
The criminals are known; members of a unit of the terrorist 'Black Berets', they live in Russia protected and supported by its authorities, who refuse to cooperate with Vilnius in the pursuit of justice.
While talking so much about the war on terrorism, Russia's leaders have shown more than one example of double standards and hypocrisy.
The European Union could urge them to change this behaviour.
Here is a quote, an excerpt from the shadow cabinet's statement at the beginning of the Beslan crisis. Quote: 'We categorically condemn this act of terrorism and unite with the United Nations Security Council in encouraging the release of the hostages.
At the same time we deeply regret that the United Nations Security Council has never condemned and has not expressed sympathy for the deaths of 42 000 Chechen children, killed in Chechnya as a result of the Russian authorities' orders'.
Unquote. At that moment the children of Beslan were suffering, but were still alive.
The 42 000 other children were no longer alive, were no longer suffering.
For them that anachronistic colonial war was long over.
When will it end however?
Those who say, 'first victory, then peace', are wrong.
That is a dead end.
It is time for a different way of thinking â peace is victory.
Peace, which would save thousands of lives, which would mean that children no longer die because of the stupidity and brutality of adults, cannot be shameful.
General de Gaulle did not disgrace France when he ended the Algerian War.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, one can scarcely find words to express the fury, grief and shame evoked by the terrorist attack in Beslan.
The escalation of terror, in terms of its nature and degree, frightens us all and causes us grave concern.
What frightens and concerns me, though, and many others among us, is the red line that connects Bushâs policy of preventive war in Iraq, via Sharonâs stubborn belief that violence can be countered only with violence, with Putinâs actions, which tend in that direction, the belief being that force can be dealt with only by force, with more force making authority necessary, which in turn makes authoritarian structures inevitable.
I am grateful to all the speakers, to the Foreign Minister and to the Commissioner, for highlighting the alternative way, the one I would call European, which, far from bowing down before terrorism and yielding to it, involves combating its causes as well.
To its partners, including Russia, Europe must make this way clear and unmistakeable.
Terrorism must be fought, but its causes must also be done away with.
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday evening we joined in honouring the memory of the victims of Beslan with a minuteâs silence.
From todayâs speeches, we can see various conceptual approaches to evaluating what happened.
Let me briefly explain my own judgment.
If we are to reject the proposition that âthe end justifies the meansâ, then we must not exploit the situation that violent means have brought about in order to raise the question of our cherished aims.
Otherwise, the terrorists will conclude that the events they stage bring results.
The issue of a peopleâs right to self-determination, which should be respected as far as possible, must not be raised in connection with acts of terror.
What is more, one would want to see the European Union adopt not double standards, but single standards towards events in Iraq, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia and other countries.
Sunni terrorism, Chechen terrorism and Kurdish terrorism do not have a separate existence.
This is all violent conduct based on exactly the same principles, and should be condemned, regardless of its perpetrator, its origin or the territory on which it is committed.
Â Â  Mr President, too often after a terrorist atrocity blame focuses on the authorities concerned.
We have heard something of that this morning.
Since the Beslan tragedy we have heard blame being put on the Russian authorities, either because of their own actions in Chechnya or because of their sheer technical incompetence in terms of handling a terrorist situation. But we should not be distracted from the simple observation that the only people really responsible for terrorism, for the horrors of Beslan, are the perpetrators â the terrorists themselves.
No cause, whether it is the separation or autonomy of Chechnya, no injury, even brutal acts by Russian security forces â nothing justifies the mass murder of children and their mothers.
Sadly, the Beslan attack will not be the last.
What is to be done?
We do not have just a humane interest in the security and stability of Russia and her increasingly important southern reaches, but a selfish interest as well.
We all want to see security and stability in the Caucasus and an end to the spiral of terrorism where we see endemic banditry and distorted nationalisms now fed by Islamic extremism.
This is a dangerous mixture that threatens us all.
The Russian authorities should not be too proud to seek assistance, which is needed on several levels.
In terms of counter-terrorism that expertise does not rest within the EU as such.
I do not entirely dismiss all EU actions in relation to terrorism.
Closer cooperation between our police and security services is important.
Controls of terrorist finance need joint efforts, but too much effort is focused on empowering the EU and extending its competence into new areas.
I do not share Mr Bot's enthusiasm for the European arrest warrant, for example.
Expertise rests in countries such as the United Kingdom and Spain.
Certainly, Russia should be calling on that sort of expertise.
The inability of the Russian authorities to deal with the Beslan situation reveals many worrying and enduring problems that seem to be deeply embedded in the Russian state.
If the EU has anything to offer, it should be a single-minded condemnation of terrorism, together with humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.
Russia has to recognise who her real friends are.
Â Â  â Mr President, the world was, once more, obliged to stand and watch helplessly while one of the most tragic hostage dramas in history was played out.
The attack on Beslan immerses us in absolute horror, in the denial of humanity, into the age of barbarism, and we cannot help but feel sickened at the sight of parents put to death in front of their children, or at the sight of children being used as human shields at windows.
The place itself is symbolic: a school, representing learning, that knowledge that makes possible the fight against obscurantism, against stupidity and savagery.
That which makes us human, the barbarians have smashed; how can you deprive a child of water, of food, of sleep, and still be part of humanity?
At the European level, though, we absolutely have to build up our capacities.
The ambitious goals set after the Tampere Summit in order to establish a European approach to terrorism, have not been achieved.
To be sure, as you have emphasised, progress has been made, particularly in the creation of the international arrest warrant, but the process has been held back by the Member Statesâ lack of political will to make European decisions truly effective.
We have to build up our fighting capacity if we are to counter this, the curse of the new century.
Having said that, what can we say about State barbarism?
It is not acceptable that violence should be answered with violence.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, MrsÂ Flautre just said that the primary issue had to be the nature of Russian information policy, what was manipulative about it, how it was that journalists were kept away from the scene, and so on. There, Mrs Flautre, I have to tell you that you are wrong.
That is not the first question that must be raised, but what is, is our compassion for the victims, and so it was a mistake on the part of the Dutch Presidency of the Council to start by demanding reports from the scene on information policy and everything else, rather than making it an absolute priority to express concern at the dimensions terror was taking on.
On that I really do want to contradict you in the strongest terms.
My second point is that, if you analyse what is going on there now, we have every reason to criticise Putinâs policy on Chechnya in recent years, but the underlying character of this attack has nothing to do with Chechnya.
These are not ordinary Chechens ...
It is not ordinary Chechens who blow a school sky-high and kill children in this way, for to say that denies the Chechens their moral character.
Let me tell you, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, that those who commit these deeds are Ossetians, Ingushetians, and international terrorists, and that is why one has to make a very clear distinction between this and what is going on in Chechnya.
We need other solutions for a policy on Chechnya, but we cannot equate these bandits and criminals, who band together and have Islamic connections throughout the world, with the people of Chechnya, and so this is where we need more subtle answers, rather than ChancellorÂ Schroeder or President Chirac to approve these fake elections.
What we need instead is ...
What we need instead, my dear Mr Cohn-Bendit, in the face of such a web of international terrorism, is clear answers, for this terrorism menaces the whole of the free world, it menaces us and it menaces the United States too.
Â Â  Mr President, it is worth reminding ourselves that we use the word 'terrorist' to describe one who seeks to cause terror, and truly do those responsible for the Beslan siege define that word â terror, horror, shock.
All victims of terrorism are innocent: people on a commuter train, in a theatre, an office block or a nightclub.
But children in a school are the most innocent victims of all.
The survival of children, like seven-year-old Aida Sidakova â who we saw on our television screens returning to what we thought was her death â is a symbol of the hope that our human spirit craves in the face of such an unspeakable act of evil.
Beslan must not be exploited for political ends, whether in the Kremlin or here in the European Union.
I agree that there should be justice, but there should be no recriminations, no reprisals, no revenge, and, as all the institutions of Europe affirm in unanimity in this debate, no dilution of respect for human rights.
Last week I accompanied my own daughter to her first day of school.
It was a nerve-wracking experience for both of us.
I cannot imagine the ordeal suffered by those children.
As parents and fellow human beings, let us mourn those who died and express our absolute solidarity with their families: their suffering is our suffering.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, âIt was our principles that lead us to confront terrorism with determination and without concessions, because it represents the greatest denial of individual freedoms, since it is an attack on the very foundations of democratic co-existence, because we must defend ourselves against those whose fundamental aim is our destruction.â
I have borrowed these words from a victim of terrorism who spoke them last week in Berlin before a sensitive and committed audience.
I would like my first comment, Mr President, to be one of solidarity with the victims of Beslan, and it is with emotion that I express my compassion and share in the grief.
There is no justification for terror, no possible cause can justify it.
Killing, murdering children, murdering mothers and fathers of children, killing childrenâs teachers is the most extreme expression of the most miserable of human behaviour.
The victims were tortured for 52 hours and then murdered.
Those are the undeniable facts.
Shamil Basayev, who planned and authorised the attack, is not a leader of the Chechen independence movement, he is a murderer of children, an inhuman terrorist who has littered Russian soil with innocent bodies.
This is the truth and is undeniably the fatal consequence of indiscriminate terrorism.
So I would like to express my total and determined condemnation of this event which degrades the human condition in the extreme.
We are seeing an unprecedented increase in the spiral of terror.
I would like to express my support for the Russian authorities in their quest to arrest and prosecute the people responsible for this horrific attack quickly, and I can assure you all that my emotions are not purely rhetorical.
I have visited Chechnya and Ingushetia; I have visited the Chechen refugee camps; I have spoken to Kalamanov on two occasions; I understand the complexity of the political problem and I am aware of the human rights violations of the parties concerned; I also know what Politkovskaya has said.
I have seen terrorism from close quarters in my own country, from less than five centimetres away, and I can state with democratic conviction that these savages cannot be given any advantage.
They take advantage of our doubts and turn parts of our debates into their own arguments whenever it suits them.
I would call for the democratic capacity to identify the problem properly and combat it with determination and without reservations.
I call on you to restart the debate on Europol, to revise United Nations Security Council Resolution 1333 and to make the European Agency for the Management of External Borders operational.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first speaker noted that it is easy to take the floor when you agree with the previous speakers.
Having listened to what you have brought here today, I can certainly vouch for that, and I am also grateful to you for the support that many of you expressed for the programme as I unfolded it.
I was also moved by the image that Commissioner Patten conjured up, that if we enter into the fight against terrorism, in a way we have one hand tied behind our backs.
I should like to say, though, that that means two things, namely that we should strengthen the hand that we have left over, but, at the same time, that we also have a mouth, with which we can step up the dialogue.
In my view, as I said initially, this is about two things.
On the one hand, we must protect ourselves in the fight against terrorism, but on the other hand, it is crucial that we join forces.
I think that we should keep these two elements very much in the forefront of our minds.
I have outlined the way in which we want to reinforce our cooperation.
First of all, we must focus on cooperation within the European Union, because I believe that if we succeed in this, if we make it clear â as I have tried to make it clear to you â that among the twenty-five of us, we can organise cooperation more effectively in a different way, namely by stepping up our efforts to pool information, by adapting our legislation, by cutting off funding for terrorism, then I think we can also create a precedent in that way, one which we can use in our contacts with the rest of the world.
As has been stated several times before, it is a worldwide fight, but a worldwide fight also requires a worldwide response.
It is also in that context that the European Union is active.
I have mentioned a few measures.
I have told you that we are in the process of reinforcing and intensifying our contacts with developing world countries.
For example, let me mention the forthcoming ASEM Summit, where we, along with the Asian world, will be discussing this topic.
How can we fight terrorism jointly?
What are the means at our disposal?
How can we pool our information more effectively?
I noticed during my recent trips to Asia how great a concern there is about this in the Asian world too now that attacks have also taken place there, that people over there are increasingly prepared to work together in the spirit in which we would like to.
It has also been stated that it is important for us to work more closely with the United States and with Russia.
I have tried to explain to you in my introduction in what way we are trying to achieve this.
This is a constant concern to us, both in respect of the United States and Russia, and I would like to eliminate a misconception here once again, which was re-emphasised by Mrs Flautre, when she stated that I took something back of what I had said earlier.
I do not believe that to be the case.
I have spoken out clearly in our dealings with Russia, and I stated, and I am reading out the English: âwe will use the regular dialogue that we have with Russia to discuss how to proceedâ.
It is important for the dialogue to be in place, but at the same time for us to clarify our values.
I should like to return to the image of the hand that is tied behind our backs, which leads me to conclude that we should be more emphatic in spelling out our values and the reasons why we fight terrorism.
We do so with the aim of honouring our own democracy, our own belief in human rights, of respecting minorities, and in saying this I am also referring to Chechnya, and we must do this together, we require everyoneâs support for this.
I can only reiterate my thanks for the support you have expressed today.
I can also state that in the coming months, the presidency will be actively committed to vigorously pursuing the programme I have unfolded and which, in my view, is somewhat extensive and covers many areas, but we will need everyoneâs help in realising it.
I was pleased to hear today that that help will be forthcoming.
As is customary, the presidency will report on everything that has happened and what we have done at the end of this term, at the end of the presidency.
In saying that, I am also responding to MrÂ Wiersmaâs question.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  . â The cold-blooded massacre of a thousand children in a Christian school in Ossetia is an outrage.
Even so, it is to be feared that such an atrocity will be repeated, and not only in Russia.
The attack committed in Spain on 11 March was a demonstration in blood that none of our countries is safe from Islamic terrorism.
This is all the more the case as this terrorism is encouraged by certain commentators, who attribute responsibility for this massacre to Russiaâs policy in the Caucasus: âIf Russia did not defend the integrity of its territory, the terrorists would leave it aloneâ.
Such, in essence, is the reasoning of these sophists, who can always find extenuating circumstances for the assassins and reasons to find fault with their victims.
The same is true of the young thugs who set the areas in which they live ablaze when the police commit the impropriety of entering them to ensure that decent people can live in safety.
Today, if we want to put a stop to these horrors, it is necessary, before all else, to name the guilty party: Islam, which, like Communism, seeks to use terrorism as a means of imposing a totalitarian system.
In the face of such an adversary, our countries must put aside their differences of opinion and of direction, and unite in defending the values of Western civilisation which they have in common.
Â Â  , . â We express our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of Beslan.
At the same time, we express our deep concern about future developments in the area in relation to USA and EU plans and the manifest copying of their strategy by the Russian Government in the areas of internal and external security, especially their adoption of the doctrine of preventive war.
It is perfectly obvious that the recent tragedy in Beslan and the inauspicious predictions are yet another result of the break-up of the USSR and the fall of socialism.
The imperialists engaged in internecine competition, which are responsible for the acute risk of destabilisation in the area and the widespread clashes, have their eye on the Caucasus region, through which the oil routes pass.
The concerns expressed by the US and EU imperialists are particularly hypocritical.
The 'political solution' which they propose and the so-called internationalisation of the problem aim to turn the area into a Kosovo-type protectorate.
Only the grass-roots fight by the people of Russia seeking to overturn the current situation will create the preconditions to a fair and peaceful solution to the problems.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission Statements on the situation in Iraq.
Â Â  . Mr President, Iraq is an issue by which we Europeans have for some time been deeply affected, and, moreover, divided.
Although the developments in Iraq have given us cause for concern, it is of the utmost importance that the European Union should support the Iraqi people in the coming months, and that we should not abandon, but should, in fact, keep providing them with support.
Although the ongoing violence is causing us concern, the past few months have also created space for a coherent and unified stand on the part of the EU in its support for Iraq.
In a moment, I will talk about the kind of support the EU could possibly offer, but first, I hope you will allow me to give a brief retrospective of what has gone before.
June, in particular, was an important month for the long-term future of Iraq and the Iraqi people.
First, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1546 on 8 June, and on 28 June, Iraqâs temporary occupation came to an end and sovereignty was restored.
The coming into office of Mr Allawiâs interim government marked a key turning point in the history of Iraq.
The new resolution also restored unity in the international community and, moreover, made it possible for the UN to again become involved in Iraq, which is an important step, certainly in view the elections to be held in January 2005.
Just as important is the way in which the developments in June made it possible for the differences of perception, which there had been up until that point with regard to certain areas of Iraq policy within the EU, to be bridged.
This became evident in the conclusions of the first general Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers under the Dutch Presidency in July.
This Council ratified the European Union Medium Term Strategyproduced by Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, as well as the Communication by the Commission with regard to Iraq, entitled âThe EU and Iraq â A framework for Engagementâ.
These documents offer a clear framework for the EUâs involvement in general and also in respect of a number of details.
As I have already stated, these conclusions also contain very specific action points.
For example, it was agreed that the EU will be providing active cooperation to the UN in Iraq, and will be starting a dialogue with the Iraqi authorities to find out in what other way the EU can support Iraq.
In order to examine this in more detail, an exploratory mission has meanwhile been to visit Iraq.
I will return to their findings in a moment.
It is in any case obvious that the objective of EU involvement is to aid in the reconstruction of Iraq and of the countryâs internal political process.
In that connection, the National Conference deserves a mention.
Despite the major difficulties during the preparations, this meeting can be considered a success.
All layers of Iraqi society were represented, including many women.
Eventually, it appeared possible to reach agreement about the delegates who will be seated on the National Council.
The formation of this Council is an important step on the way to elections.
Unfortunately, this good news is also laced with a great deal of bad news.
The abductions and killings of foreign citizens, including EU citizens, are a poignant example of this.
Our thoughts are with the victims and their relatives.
However, we should not overlook the fact that very many Iraqis have also become the victim of violence, in most cases those very Iraqis who have taken on responsibility in the reconstruction of that country.
In addition, the many attacks on oil pipelines constitute a serious threat to the recovery of Iraqâs economy.
The constant violence is not only threatening society and the Iraqi economy, but also the political process in Iraq.
The situation in Fallujah is very alarming and over the past few months, what happened in Najaf and in Baghdad showed that violence is also bubbling away under the surface in the Shiite parts ofIraq and can explode at any time.
In that connection, we welcome the agreement that was recently concluded in Najaf.
Partly thanks to the courageous efforts on the part of Ayatollah Al-Sistani, the restoration of order and safety in Najaf under the leadership of the Iraqi Interim Government is in sight.
Let us hope that this is a step in the direction of better relations in Iraq and improved conditions of safety.
After all, it is clear that the sectarian violence is not in the interest of the ordinary Iraqi citizens who, as a result of terror, see their country lapsing into unnecessary delays in its construction.
Needless to say, the security situation is a determining factor in the extent to which the EU can offer effective help in the reconstruction of Iraq.
Clearly, this situation is currently not good.
Nevertheless, the Netherlands Presidency has adopted the conclusions by the July General Affairs Council and as a result of this, there is already greater EU involvement in Iraqâs political process.
Accordingly, I myself visited Iraq in August to underline the EUâs support for Iraqâs economic, social and political reconstruction.
To this end, I had meetings with the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister.
I also talked to representatives of the United Nations in Iraq.
All the Iraqi people I spoke to underlined the importance they attach to the EU having a clear and visible role in Iraq.
In that connection, they called for the opening of a Commission office in Baghdad.
On behalf of the EU, I have also expressed our concern about the reintroduction of capital punishment in Iraq.
Mr Allawi, who recently visited Iraqâs neighbouring countries, emphasised the importance of stability in Iraq for the region as a whole.
My response to that was that the EU would be very happy to lend a hand to secure regional security and stability.
I also told them that the EU would very much appreciate an invitation to take part in the next conference of neighbouring countries.
Even now, the EU is regularly reminding Iraqâs neighbouring countries of their responsibilities.
During my visit, the UN representatives indicated that EU support for their activities is vitally important, certainly where the election process is concerned.
In Iraq, I also instituted the EU Exploratory Mission, which has now returned.
Delegates of the presidency, the Commission and the Council Secretariat looked into the possibilities of concrete EU involvement in the framework of civil crisis management in the areas of police, the rule of law, public administration and elections.
The mission did not only have talks with the Iraqi authorities, but also with representatives of the United Nations, the United States, NATO, the Multinational Force and the Election Committee.
The upshot of the mission was that the following activities are under consideration. If you will allow me, I will briefly outline those areas:
First of all, police training.
Secondly, in the area of rule of law and human rights: training of judges and prosecutors, technical assistance in the establishment of the Iraqi Special Tribunal; forensic expertise and assistance in exhuming victims from mass graves; assistance in setting up a national centre for human rights and democracy; education in the legal field.
Thirdly, civil administration; increasing capacity in various ministries and in the prison system.
Fourthly, elections: assistance with, and monitoring of, elections.
Fifthly, the development of weapons export control legislation, demobilisation programmes for militias and support for the ownership committee.
All in all, there are plenty of areas where the EU can become active.
It is important in this respect that the activities that it undertakes should meet real Iraqi needs, and should add value and be complementary to any activities that may already be going on.
In addition, the synergy between the EU instruments and activities needs to be monitored effectively.
Also, the political, budgetary and technical aspects will all need to be weighed in order for the activities to be planned well, and the EU should therefore also be certain that it can actually deliver.
What is of importance now is for a fact-finding mission to visit Iraq and to give a more definite picture of the possibilities for EU action.
The Council Secretariat will start planning a mission of this kind in consultation with the Commission and the presidency.
I would also like to briefly mention the importance of the UN presence in Iraq, which, as I indicated, certainly with a view to the elections, is considerable.
For the UN to function properly, it is crucial that there should be sufficient protection.
Resolution 1546 provides for this.
The UN Secretary General has asked the EU governments for a financial contribution to the second protective ring, the so-called UN Protection Force.
Apparently, the Member States set great store by the EU making a contribution to this.
The presidency is currently working hard to ensure that this EU contribution will actually be made.
To that end, the Member States are asked for a contribution and it is also examined to what extent a contribution from the CFSP budget is possible.
Finally, I can report to you that I have invited Prime Minister Allawi to attend the European Council on 5Â November.
I am counting on us having a concrete offer of support for the reconstruction of his country ready by then.
Â Â  . It is almost exactly five years since I appeared in this Parliament for my confirmation hearings as a Commissioner.
Since then I have been fortunate to take part in literally scores of debates â more, I am told, than any other Commissioner: such is Parliamentâs interest in external relations.
I would like to thank Parliament and its Members for the courtesy that I have invariably been shown.
I have enjoyed coming here.
It is important, in my view, to try to establish democratic roots for foreign policy.
It is not an area of public policy to be left to the diplomatic experts, whose record is at best somewhat patchy.
Anyway, as I ride off into the sunset, I should like to record my appreciation for Parliamentâs role in developing, not by leaps and bounds but â perhaps inevitably â by lurches and shuffles, Europeâs common external relations policy.
The worst shambles to have overwhelmed us in the last five years has, of course, been the row over Iraq.
I do not want to go back over old arguments.
If we needed reminding that you cannot have a common policy if the larger Member States are deeply divided, then here was the evidence.
Other evidence also speaks eloquently for itself.
As someone once said, 'stuff happens'.
Is the world today safer than before the overthrow of the appalling Saddam?
Is global terrorism in retreat?
Are we closer to building bridges between Islam and the West?
Is the worldâs only superpower more widely respected?
Have the citizens in our democracies been treated in a way that will encourage them to give governments the benefit of the doubt next time they are told that force needs to be used pre-emptively to deal with an imminent threat?
I simply pose the questions.
Honourable Members will have their own answers.
But here we are: Saddam overthrown, violence raging across much of the liberated land, the regime changed, with an interim government preparing the way for democratic elections.
Whatever our past criticisms, we are all now up to our ears in this endeavour.
If Iraq goes badly, we all suffer.
So we have to try to work together to hold the democratic project in one piece.
What are we pledged to do as a Union, leaving aside the contribution of individual Member States?
We have already pledged, and are working hard to deploy, EUR 200Â million this year.
I very much hope that we will be able to secure agreement for a further EUR 200Â million for next year.
We are developing a good record in disbursing this assistance, having paid more than EUR 200Â million into the United Nations and World Bank trust funds over the course of the past year.
We are working well with the United Nations and the World Bank, helping to ensure that our resources are disbursed quickly and well.
We have focused our assistance this year on three areas: on essential public servicesÂ â health, education, water and sanitation; on poverty alleviation and the development of livelihoods; and on governance and civil society.
I would not pretend, however, that all is well.
How could I?
The hazardous security climateÂ â evident not least in the appalling series of kidnappings, most recently of humanitarian workers dedicated to the well-being of Iraqis, and evident also in yesterdayâs appalling atrocity in Baghdad â obviously limits the pace of disbursement, as does the fact that we are working with an interim government that is still feeling its way in public administration.
That is life â at least in Iraq â and we will continue to do our utmost within the constraints of the situation on the ground.
What I can say, firmly, is that I am convinced that our decision to take the multilateral, trust fund route was absolutely the right one.
A comparison of our disbursement rate with that of other bilateral donors, including the largest donor of all, only confirms this.
When we proposed to Parliament committing EUR 200Â million to the reconstruction of Iraq, bringing to over EUR 300Â million the amount we will spend in 2003-2004, some honourable Members argued that we were being parsimonious.
They argued that we should do more: they suggested that we should spend at least EUR 500Â million, though they were coy about telling us where the extra money should come from.
This morning I was interested to read a report by the BBC from Washington: 'The US Administration wants to reallocate billions of reconstruction dollars for Iraq and spend them instead on security and other short-term needs.
US officials say this new strategy has emerged after months of review.'
The report goes on: 'The shift is also being interpreted by critics as proof that grand long-term plans to reshape the economy just were not realistic.
They also charge that the intensity and level of violent resistance was severely underestimated.'
I think we were right in our judgment about the amount of money that we could sensibly put into Iraq, and I think Parliament was wise to support that judgment.
In the coming months, we will continue to implement the proposals set out in our communication of 9Â June, which has received widespread endorsement.
In particular, we will focus on the essential issue of support to the electoral process.
Once the Independent Electoral Commission and the United Nations have identified exactly what they need, we stand ready to help â as I shall explain to the Iraqi President when I meet him later today.
But I should be clear that, under the current circumstances, we cannot and will not propose a conventional election observation mission â that would be simply impossible, as honourable Members in this Chamber who themselves have taken a lead in election observation missions will know.
But we will seek ways to ensure that we play our full part in assisting free and fair elections in Iraq.
In the longer term, we will need to consider how best the Commission can be represented on the ground.
Opening a delegation would obviously be difficult, expensive and potentially dangerous.
But we are prepared to consider that route, if it is clear that it would add to our effectiveness in helping the Iraqi people.
So let me be blunt: we will work for a better future in Iraq whatever the bitterness of past disputes.
There is, though, one other general point that I would like to make, triggered by these reflections on Iraq.
I hope that the House will be generous to me in allowing me to stray a little on what is, almost certainly, my last outing in this mother of parliaments.
When, just over two years ago, some of us expressed concerns that the United States was abandoning the sort of multilateralism which had characterised its foreign and security policy since the Second World War, we were strongly criticised.
America, we were assured, still wished to work with allies, provided they shared Washingtonâs view of how to cope with a dangerous world, and by and large kept any reservations to themselves.
Some allies did indeed accompany America to Baghdad, a venture not yet blessed â as we have noted â with the easy and benign consequences that were famously predicted and promised.
Liberation rapidly turned into an occupation â or what was seen as an occupation â bitterly resisted, with atrocity after atrocity.
Democracy failed to roll out like an oriental carpet across the thankless deserts of the Middle East.
Above all, peace in Jerusalem and Palestine was not accomplished by victory in Baghdad.
So, partly because American neo-conservative unilateralism had clearly failed to establish an empire of peace, liberty and democracy, we have been more recently advised that allies and multilateralism were back in fashion in Washington.
Even the United Nations was deemed to have its uses. the State Department.
All done and dusted then?
Sighs of relief all round?
Can we now look forward to the restoration of that old-fashioned notion that allies have to be led not bossed, and that multilateral institutions have their important uses, even for the worldâs only super-power â that, Machiavelli, there is much to be said for being admired and not just feared?
The rhetoric of the present United States election campaign inevitably raises a few questions.
I do not seek to take sides.
America elects its President and its Congress.
The rest of the world looks on.
We in Europe should work as well as we can with whoever wins.
We are not partisans in the process, whatever our private opinions.
Moreover, I am not so naÃ¯ve as to confuse campaign rhetoric with a Platonic dialogue.
I have, after all, been a party chairman myself.
But campaign rhetoric reflects something and what is reflected here is pretty unsettling.
If you want to get a cheap cheer from certain quarters in America, it seems that all you have to do is to bash the United Nations, or the French, or the very idea that allies are entitled to have their own opinions.
Multilateralists, we are told, want to outsource American foreign and security policy to a bunch of garlic chewing, cheese eating wimps.
The opinions of mankind, which the founding fathers of the United States thought their country should note and respect, are to be treated with contempt unless, I suppose, they faithfully reflect the agenda of the American Enterprise Institute and FoxÂ TV.
What are we to make of all this?
First, multilateralism is, above all, in the best interests of the United States, a point which previous Administrations would not have questioned and most political leaders would have subscribed to for the past 60 years.
Second, surely the national interest of the superpower is to put its traditional allies on the spot, not challenging their right to consultation, but probing what they have to say and how they intend to turn their rhetoric about cooperation into effective, not effete, multilateralism.
How, to take one obvious point, do we intend to go about not just draining the swamps in which terrorism breeds â to borrow the clichÃ© â but also shooting some of the crocodiles?
Further, how and when will we in Europe countenance the use of force to support the international rule of law?
That is a question which we in Europe regularly duck.
If the political culture of American exceptionalism excludes the notion of working with and talking to foreigners, if unpopularity overseas is taken as a mark of distinction, a source of pride, too many Europeans will make the mirror-image mistake of thinking that sniping at America is the same as having a European foreign and security policy.
What I worry about most is that on either side of the Atlantic we will bring out the worst in our traditional partners.
The world deserves better than testosterone on one side and superciliousness on the other.
American and European citizens deserve better, too.
After all, they face the same dangers and the same challenges.
I want a Europe which is a super-partner not a super-sniper â a super-partner of a respected global leader.
Any alternative to that offers only the prospect of a more perilous and more querulous future.
Â Â  Mr President, apart from the stabilisation, rehabilitation, reconstruction and democratisation of Iraq, tasks which I believe, Mr President, should not be the sole responsibility of the United States but of the whole of the international democratic community, I believe that there is currently an immediate priority which must not be put off â which the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has not mentioned explicitly â and that is the release of the kidnapped French journalists, MrÂ Malbrunot and Mr Chesnot, and their Syrian chauffeur, as well as the Italian aid workers, MissÂ Torreta and Miss Pari.
It worries us, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have said that the Council interprets these events simply as sad news and that you said yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs that the Council has decided that the best thing was to do nothing, proof, I believe, of the impotence of the European Union.
It also worries us, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council of Ministers has decided at first reading not to mobilise the flexibility instrument to fund the priority of Iraq, against the proposals of the Commission and this Parliament.
I hope that this is a tactical position on the part of the Council which will be corrected at second reading.
Technicalities apart, Mr President, yesterday was another day of tragedy in Baghdad with dozens of people killed.
I believe that the previous debate this morning demonstrates clearly that we must not and cannot remain indifferent to the phenomenon of terrorism, that terrorism affects us all equally and that we must all respond equally.
We must therefore be completely united in the face of terrorism.
The best way for this Parliament to respond to the phenomenon of terrorism is to be united in the resolution we are going to approve tomorrow on Iraq.
I believe that the best contribution â apart from the proposals in the Commission's draft initiative, aimed at guaranteeing peace, understanding, reconciliation and harmony in Iraq, with a view to the elections to take place in January â is to be united.
I would like to end, Mr President, by acknowledging, on behalf of my political group, Mr Patten â I attended MrÂ Patten's hearing as coordinator for my group when he was appointed Commissioner â and thank him for always being available and for his constantly positive and constructive attitude towards this Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we discuss the prospects for Iraq, we see before us the images coming out of that country.
They are images of war, a war that seems never-ending, a conflict that leaves no room for easy optimism.
At the same time we anguish over the hostages, that odious form of violence and blackmail.
The international community has to be united to save those people, who are journalists and volunteers, as well as citizens of Iraq and of other countries.
We here should put out an appeal to the Arab and Islamic world to isolate terrorism and reduce the consensus around that kind of violence.
At the same time, I believe we should appeal to the provisional Iraqi Government and to the international coalition forces to allow the efforts to obtain the release of the hostages to proceed unhindered, that is, to suspend their military operations and bombings, which cause so many civilian victims in the Iraqi towns and certainly do not help to create a suitable climate for negotiations that may save the captivesâ lives.
Looking beyond the tragic hostage crisis, we have turned our attention in the speeches by the representatives of the Council and the Commission to Iraqâs current situation and prospects.
It is clear that to get out of this terrible crisis there needs to be political change both within Iraq and, in a more general sense, in the fight against terrorism, as has also emerged from this morningâs debate.
The war and the military occupation of Iraq have proved to be a tragic mistake.
Instead of containing terror, they have made it stronger and more dangerous; they have spread hatred of the West throughout the Islamic world and are in danger of embroiling the world in a clash of civilisations, which is the most fertile soil for fundamentalism.
From Iraq to Chechnya and Palestine, the mindset of war, brutal repression and the denial of human rights and the rights of peoples has helped terrorism.
It is now time to take a different road.
This does not mean giving up the use of force, but re-establishing the primacy of politics and international law.
We are not criticising the US conservatives for having fought against terrorism.
On the contrary, we criticise them for having conducted the fight in the wrong way, adding to the insecurity in the world.
What is needed is a return to multilateralism and a recognition that restoring peace in Iraq will probably require very clear and brave decisions.
For example, the presence of US armed forces in the country is unlikely to help to restore peace, since it is evident that those who wanted the war and carried it out are attracting terrorism through their presence there, rather than bringing calm.
It has to be realised that these forces must be withdrawn at the time of the elections and replaced under UN authority with forces from countries not involved in the conflict.
In every area of activity there is a need to return to politics, multilateralism and international law.
That is the feeling in Europe, and that is the feeling in this Parliament.
We need strong institutions that are able to turn this feeling into coherent political action and not just into an appeal.
Lastly, I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for his work and also for his words this morning which, in a fine speech if nothing else, reflected the prevailing feeling of the people of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of my Group I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his willingness over the past five years to engage in debate with this House wearing a tie with a very light tinge of blue.
I am pleased that he is enjoying the political freedom which my party helped him to find and we wish him every success in his future endeavours.
There are many in this Chamber and outwith who still focus on a reckoning for responsibility for the war in Iraq.
Whatever form that reckoning might take, Liberals and Democrats insist that we must not allow it to come between Europe and its urgent responsibility to that battered country.
When your friend's house is burning down, you do not stop to argue over who dropped the match.
With the oppressive brace of dictatorship ripped away, Iraq has burst like a broken dam.
If we do not control the flood, it threatens to sweep across the region, engulfing Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
It will drown the hopes of democracy in the Middle East.
Everything else in Iraq depends on stopping the killing.
Iraq is a vacuum, and in Falluja, Talafar and Baghdad, violence and the unacceptable terror of hostage-taking has rushed in to fill the space emptied by the fall of Saddam Hussein.
Yet too often, the coalition forces and the struggling Iraqi Government have met violence with blundering violence.
Helicopter gunships and heavy-handed military tactics in crowded urban streets can only feed the resentment and the disorder that recruits for militancy.
Iraq needs international help: a deep and wide commitment that cannot afford to countenance failure.
Under the auspices of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 the international community must offer every assistance to the interim government, and then to its sovereign successor.
I welcome the commitment our diplomatic expert, Mr Bot, has expressed here today.
Liberals and Democrats believe that the European Union has experience to offer in everything from restoring Iraq's devastated infrastructure to advising on the drafting of its new constitution.
That is why we have backed the Commission's call for a further EURÂ 200Â million to be made available in humanitarian assistance.
But Iraq needs more than money.
If the cycle of violence can be broken, Europe can help train policemen, judges and teachers.
Europe can help rebuild civil society in Iraq through support for non-governmental organisations, trade unions and political parties.
The European Union can play a key role in supporting and securing the elections to the Transitional Iraqi National Assembly in January of next year.
In a country where almost every citizen relies on government aid, we can help find the rice and the wheat flour that stand between Iraq and starvation, and the soap that guards against devastated public sanitation.
We believe that Europe must help Iraq take steps away from authoritarianism.
The new Iraq must be built on stable democratic institutions.
Iraq presents us with a challenge.
Only stable, democratic government offers the chance to remake the Middle East, and that may require our commitment for a generation.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten most warmly for his clear statement at the end.
Commissioner, you have made it clear that our debate today is not just about Iraq, but must also consider an overall political approach.
It has become apparent that Europeâs essential interest must lie, above all, in finding a peaceful solution for Iraq, and not only for Iraq, but also for the region as a whole.
We have to develop a coherent policy for Iraq, Iran, Syria, and, of course, for Israel and Palestine.
Any solution will be difficult, but, as we progress towards one, we should make use of this debate for clarification and analysis, even though we do not yet know what the definite answers will be.
As far as Iraq is concerned, we have seen unbounded violence over the past months, with pre-emptive strikes on the part of the allies; Guantanamo; Abu Ghraib with all the dreadful attempts to justify torture; fearful terrorist attacks; the execution of innocent hostages; and hostages held right up to the present day.
In this context, let me mention another report that has shocked me today, the report of a secret service according to which Syria is alleged to have tested chemical weapons on Sudanese.
All these acts of untrammelled force we condemn as a matter of fundamental conviction; not only that, we combat them, and have recorded our condemnation of them in the European Constitution.
So where do we stand today?
Following yesterdayâs cruel attack, which left many â over sixty â people dead, a look at the press may reflect the differences and the bewilderment in the political world.
âGet out of Iraq!â, says the ; says that the âUSA must wage war to the endâ; the reports that âIraq is falling apart before its occupiersâ eyesâ, and that âBush has announced that the money intended for security purposes is to be used now, instead of for securing the peopleâs water supplyâ.
Where do our responsibilities lie, and where do we go from here?
Despite all our differences, we must, I believe, try to join together in establishing political responsibility.
I think we must become credible, for without credibility we will have no popular support and the United Nations will not be strengthened.
That involves condemning what we have to condemn, and doing everything possible to prepare, by all democratic means, for free elections as soon as possible, so that the people of Iraq may be sovereign once more.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear that the primary objective of all of us here is to do everything possible to save all the hostages â French, Italian and Iraqi alike â because all lives are equally valuable.
To achieve this, however, generic words and statements are not enough.
Who in Europe does not want the hostages freed?
I wonder, however, how we can dare to rightly ask for people to respect human rights and to save the hostagesâ lives when the armies of countries sitting in this Chamber then continue to drop bombs and kill civilians.
We take up the NGOâs plea and call for the bombing to stop.
Terrorism and war are mirror images and feed off each other.
They are the real enemies of pacifism and of the solidarity that is working in Iraq to build a new society.
We do not know who has carried out these kidnappings, but we do know there are various interests that want the NGOs to leave Iraq and not witness the violations of rights that are happening everywhere.
I did not hear the Council make any condemnation of the war, a pre-emptive war that has trampled on centuries of human rights.
We demand the immediate withdrawal of the troops and announce that, if our amendments against the war and for the withdrawal of the troops are not accepted, we shall vote against the draft resolution to be tabled tomorrow.
We remain in tune with the major movements and with public opinion, which is standing firm against the war and against terrorism with no ifs or buts.
Â Â  Mr President, constructive Iraqi voices deserve a hearing from us.
That was the case during the days of Saddam Husseinâs reign of terror, and it is just as true now that the future of Mesopotamia is directly at issue.
At present, those deeply concerned Iraqi voices are urging the EU Member States, above all, to have a constructive presence in their country and region.
In practical terms, they are asking for a clear, firm stand on the part of all EU Members against the sustained involvement of Iraqâs neighbouring countries in the insidiously-growing terrorism on Iraqi territory, failing which, the EU itself will eventually be called upon to foot the bill.
In addition, these Iraqi voices are asking for a regional and local start to be made, as a matter of urgency, on that countryâs reconstruction.
Opportunities to do that are presenting themselves in the north and south of Iraq.
The EU Member States should not let those opportunities slip.
If this local and regional reconstruction is successful, the people in the terrorist hotbeds can decide for themselves what will benefit them the most.
Which brings me, finally, to Iraqâs future political structure.
Iraqâs neighbours are showing themselves very wary of a federal solution for maintaining that countryâs territorial integrity.
This is another excellent opportunity for Europe to display commitment to national and regional stability.
I hope, and expect, that this commitment will also be evident at the transatlantic level under the Dutch Presidency, because we will thereby be looking after Mesopotamiaâs future.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while we acknowledge its good intentions, we regret that Europe is essentially inadequate when confronted with the tragic events of the international crisis, the rise of terrorism and the situation in Iraq.
Commissioner, if there is too much of the United States in international relations, it is because Europe is indeed impotent.
We as Europeans would like to already have the Constitution, which we have taken so long to approve, because we would like to already have a European Foreign Minister who could be out in Iraq right now to perform his office with genuine authority and also to negotiate the release of the French and Italian hostages.
I should like here to remember the two young Italian women, Simona Pari and Simona Torretta.
Such terrorism, for which a human life counts for nothing, which kills and rapes innocent children, which kidnaps peace workers or civilians and holds the governments and peoples of Europe to ransom, can only receive our most severe and unconditional condemnation.
Through its work of destabilisation, such terrorism is probably also aiming at somehow delaying or preventing the holding of elections in Iraq, an outcome that would be thoroughly unacceptable.
In conclusion, to all those who are in Iraq, to the soldiers on peace-keeping missions, to the NGOs, which with admirable perseverance have chosen to stay and carry on their work of aiding the civilian population, to the victimsâ families and, at this moment, if I may, especially to the families of the hostages â to all of them I believe the whole Chamber here in Strasbourg should raise its voice loud and clear in solidarity and fellow feeling.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like the vast majority of Polish people, I was and am opposed to the war in Iraq.
I was also, like all of us in this House, opposed to Saddam Hussein.
This is why I am entitled to say that Iraq should no longer divide Europe, and that the EU should act jointly to find a baseline consensus and put this consensus forward.
This does not mean an artificial agreement or a fictitious unity. It means an understanding between the nations and governments of Europe, both those who supported intervention in Iraq and those who were opposed to intervention, and it means an understanding based on a concrete goal.
This goal, which may not be very effective and may not solve all problems, but which is extremely concrete, would be to hold local elections as soon as possible, starting in Najaf and Karbala, for example.
The building of democracy in Iraq must begin with the foundations, not the roof.
These foundations are local elections and the establishment of regional authorities that have power and not merely rifles.
The roof will be national elections, and this is the only appropriate order.
We must be aware that local elections are a necessary medicine, but that they have side effects, and that they may result in the division of Iraq into Sunnite, Shiite and Kurdish zones of influence.
This cannot be denied, but it is preferable to a situation in which everyone is permanently at war with everyone else.
Finally, the European Union mission should be in Baghdad, not in Amman, which is a long way from the Iraqi capital.
Let us not leave Baghdad to the US, as shirking responsibility is not a course of action that befits the EU.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, without stability in the region, society will not be reconstructed, there will be no security for investments, and without that no really peaceful development will be possible.
We all know that this can be achieved only if the Iraqi people see their government as possessing an authority and legitimacy other than that lent to it by American unilateralism.
That is why elections have such a major part to play, that is why the United Nations have a part to play, and that is why I was so shocked by Kofi Annanâs comment yesterday to the effect that âthe UN can become fully involved again, can go in again, only if security is established.â
The whole thing is cyclical: if the UN does not go in, there can be no security, but if it does not go in because there is no security, that demonstrates the international communityâs general helplessness in the face of the situation.
I see this as a reason why we must make it clear that there can be no justification for terrorism and that we will always oppose terrorism, which is, in this case, engaged in by minorities in Iraq, and that we have to support the majority population.
At the same time, though, we have to do this through dialogue, so that terrorism does not prove to be a Hydra, with several new heads growing every time we cut one off, and we must not create breeding grounds for it.
I see this as a reason for us in the European Union to do what we can.
By that I mean political change, support, including in the areas that the EURÂ 200 million is intended to deal with, the organisation of aid, the initiation of dialogue, the building of structures out of which sustainable development can grow.
This is not just about Iraq, it is about the stability of the entire region, which will determine whether there is to be a âclash of civilisationsâ, and whether we can prevent the great war between the cultures.
There have been quite a few mistakes, and they have already brought us much, much closer to one.
Finally, I want to extend warm thanks to Commissioner Patten for his cooperation over the past years; perhaps there will be another opportunity for me to do so.
Today, he has again made it clear that we in the West can succeed with our policies if they are combined with moral integrity.
I get the feeling that our moral integrity is running low as a result of Guantanamo and much else, because of torture and all the things that are going on there.
If we do not manage to have moral integrity, we will not have the credibility that is required if we are to shape this process in a reasonable way.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I heard the President-in-Office of the Council speak to us of good and bad news, and I felt that he dwelled too much on the good news at the expense of the bad.
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for having, with his customary subtlety and frankness, invited us to cross the somewhat simplistic gulfs between Atlanticism and anti-Americanism, between unilateralism and multilateralism.
That is indeed what we must do.
Today, though, nearly two years after the onset of this crisis, we have to say that we are facing failure, as none of the aims that were set have been fulfilled, and I am not talking about weapons of mass destruction.
There is no evidence of the region being stable, democracy has not proved infectious, Iraq is not a safe place, and the fight against terrorism has got nowhere.
On the contrary, I would even say that military action on its own has led, in Iraq, to a growth in terrorism of all kinds.
All of that is worthy of condemnation and of serious thought.
We can take no pleasure in this failure, on the contrary: we have to act, to learn our lessons and try to be effective tomorrow.
Today, though, what should galvanise us, what should be a priority for this House, is of course the issue of the hostages taken in Iraq â Italians, French, in short, Europeans â along with those accompanying them, whether Iraqis or Syrians.
We must move to liberate these hostages, for liberty is a precious good, and because it is not just any professions that are under attack; these are journalists, humanitarian activists, workers for NGOs, in short, people who take risks.
As Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra said, I believe that it is for all their sakes that this House must speak out today, on the basis of the principles of unity and solidarity, in favour of these hostages being released.
At the same time, this will not mean that we will have finished with Iraq; we have to ask ourselves other questions if we are to be able to take the different political road to which Mr D'Alema referred.
I will limit myself to setting out a few of them.
We must therefore call for a change in the nature of the multinational forces.
I believe it is now time to put this force, for all practical purposes, under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
All of us, together, must concern ourselves with the democratic process.
We know that elections are planned for early 2005, but, right now, it has to be said that they are not guaranteed and it is absolutely vital that they should be held under free and fair conditions.
Finally, I believe that it is now time to call an international conference in support of the political transition and to facilitate the restructuring of Iraq.
Finally â and this will be the last I shall say at this stage â I believe that we must be more insistent than we have been, more perhaps than the Council has been, on respect for human rights by all the parties on the ground.
Commissioner Patten said it, as did Mr D'Alema, and it is indeed the case that we are confronted by intolerable images of war depicting an utterly hopeless confrontation.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to get back to Iraq.
We have to consider what is happening now in the aftermath of the conflict.
Let me repeat, however, that the priority is for the whole of this House to get behind the efforts to free the hostages, and I call upon all of us, on every side, to accept a resolution to that end, which will proclaim that we speak with one voice.
Â Â  Mr President, the present joint draft resolution is both totally harmless and absolutely obvious, so a cynic might argue that we might as well do without it.
As a pragmatic and experienced politician, I take the view that this draft resolution illustrates in abundance that our European Parliament and its groups experience the same difficulties as the Commission and the Council in getting to grips with the situation in Iraq.
Like the government in my country, I was myself a firm opponent of the invasion in Iraq.
In previous capacities, I too have tried to persuade the United States that the invasion of Iraq is one thing, but the establishment of democracy there is something else entirely.
I have also stated that invading a country is easy for them, but leaving a country is far more difficult and dangerous.
I too take the view that the world today is a much more dangerous place than before the war in Iraq started.
The question then arises, though, as to what we in the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Council of Ministers and the European Commission are doing about this much more dangerous place.
Do we wash our hands of the whole situation, because we did not want it?
Are we hoping â or, if we are religious, praying â that everything will perhaps sort itself out miraculously?
Or are we taking refuge in the hopeless prospect of the war of civilisations predicted for so long by many, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean â sometimes appearing to want it to happen?
We are all facing the very difficult task of leaving all of this behind us and of reaching unanimity about the future of Iraq, the Middle East and the world as a whole.
Naturally, all hostages, of whatever nationality and whatever they are doing there, must be released immediately, and it goes without saying that we must all commit ourselves to this objective.
I would like to conclude by addressing a few words to Commissioner Patten.
Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to tell him what a great honour and privilege it has been to work with him.
I would like to ask him, as he rides off into the sunset, not to sing the song 'I am a poor, lonesome cowboy', but to seize the opportunity to put in the occasional mean tango!
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent dramatic events involving hostages â all hostages, Italian, French and Iraqi, for whose unconditional release we are once again appealing here â highlight the extreme gravity of the situation that has been developing in Iraq.
The allied military commanders themselves now openly admit that part of Iraqi territory is outside their control.
The military solution is thus revealing just how inadequate it is to solve the problem of terrorism and to ensure Iraqâs transition to democracy.
In order to lay the bases for a new democratic order, it is not enough to set up an interim provisional government, which is actually a US puppet government and is therefore not recognised by the local population.
There is only one way to stabilise the situation in Iraq, and that is to withdraw the troops immediately.
It is not a case of giving in or not to the blackmail of terrorist groups, but rather a case of sending out concrete signs of a change in strategy, whereby the withdrawal of the occupying troops is seen as a precondition for sending in a UN contingent composed of forces from countries not involved in the war.
The Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war has proved to be tragically wrong and unable to curb terrorism, which has instead spread further precisely in the areas of conflict.
A worldview based on the exclusive political and economic supremacy of a single country is not sustainable.
Europe can and must put across an independent and unified foreign policy proposal; it can and must play an ever-greater role in resolving crisis situations such as the one in Iraq.
We need to make room again for diplomacy and politics.
International organisations need to be present to guarantee free elections, elections free of any political or economic pressures from the occupation forces.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Member States, the Anglo-Saxon coalitionâs invasion of Iraq solved nothing; on the contrary, it made the Iraqisâ living conditions worse and, above all, it enabled militant Islam to spread throughout the Arab world, giving it a new base and new legitimacy.
What we see there, of course, is no more than the application of the USAâs imperial strategy, which aims to consign the world to an immense conflict of civilisations, one in which the civilised world will be gathered around Washington.
It is equally evident that what claims to be the European âUnionâ â a term I put in quotation marks â with its six doomed draft resolutions, none of which â this was last year, as you will recallâ obtained anything like a majority, and with its immense jumble of useless and derisory pieties, has remained silent, with a passivity defying belief in the face of a war and a strategy that pits civilisations against each other, with the EU itself the first victim.
France alone, flanked by Germany â which was, truth to tell, hesitant â and by Russia, which was lamentably weakened, was in the midst of the flurry of trans-Atlantic grovelling, yet again saved the European ideal.
She did so with such clear emphasis that the world increasingly saw in her a sign of resistance to the empire. Indeed, let it be added, the American opposition see her as a symbol of the freedom of peoples, the basic condition for all true democracy.
We now have the choice between two sorts of resistance: the Islamic resistance that the Americans â who will, one day, be obliged to clear off, just as they did out of Vietnam â certainly intend to leave behind them, and the national, or secular, resistance.
Europe, the Europe of the Euro-enthusiasts, is certainly incapable of choosing, but it is certain that, in the face of militant Islam, it is on a victory by the national resistance that Mediterranean cooperation â so necessary, yet, alas, so unlikely â depends.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to put an end to hypocrisy.
We are witnessing the geopolitical interests of the United States perpetuating themselves in Iraq.
Ever since the Second World War, history has been punctuated by unilateral pre-emptive interventions by the great powers.
A subjugated Europe has never been willing or able to stand up to the aggressiveness of the victors at Yalta.
The role of the United Nations has been just as ineffective, for any UN resolutions that the great powers have found indigestible have been systematically ignored or sidestepped.
Interim President Ghazi al Yawar has cancelled his visit to the European Parliament.
It is worth wondering who wanted or elected him to be president.
To hold him up as a representative of the Iraqi people is an insult to our intelligence and to that of the people we represent.
We have to get out of the conflict in Iraq and remove any excuse for the occupation which, far from ensuring security, peace and justice for the Iraqi people, has led to fighting and shameful acts, costs the public purse a fortune, damages interests and increases resentment, endangering the security, peace and prosperity of the peoples of Europe.
Mr Bot, these should be the objectives of the Council, the Commission, the governments and the Institutions of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the situation in Iraq remains precarious, with the deaths yesterday of 47 innocent Iraqis at the hands of a fanatic suicide bomber â mainly unemployed men seeking work as policemen and willing to try to re-establish law and order in their country and enable free elections to be held next January.
Whether one agrees with the justification for the war or not, everyone now must sympathise with the long-suffering Iraqi people, who yearn for stability in their country.
Everyone here must condemn the perpetuation of indiscriminate attacks against the new sovereign government of Dr Allawi and the multinational peacekeeping forces and the barbaric kidnapping and murdering of hostages, solely on the basis of being non-Muslim, or cooperating in rebuilding the country, such as the Italian aid workers.
Clearly, with hindsight, mistakes have been made in underestimating the scale of resistance, but withdrawing all the coalition troops would only worsen matters.
MrÂ D'Alema's request would, in my view, be surrendering to terrorism.
Syria and Iran have also been extremely unhelpful in allowing Islamist fighters to infiltrate Iraq from their territories.
I welcome Commissioner Patten's allocation of EURÂ 300Â million in 2003-04 to rebuild Iraq.
His characteristic eloquence will be sadly missed on all sides of this House.
I call upon Member States who oppose the war â such as France and Germany â to put this behind them now and support new Nato initiatives to build up security in Iraq.
After all, we all share a common interest in fighting international terrorism.
By kidnapping two French journalists, Islamic terrorists have not respected French neutrality, instead blaming France for defending its understandable and much cherished secularism by its banning of the veil in its schools.
I pray now for the release of all hostages.
No stone should left unturned to achieve this objective.
Â Â  â Mr President, what brings us here today, with confusion in every group, is anguish at the fate of the hostages, and I ask you what the European Union can do to defend those who belong to it?
The French journalists and the two young Italian aid workers who were taken hostage are all innocent in this war, and they risk paying for their commitment to a free Iraq with their lives.
Quite apart from the victims, we must not forget that the whole of the Iraqi people have been held hostage and that each new bloodbath brings fresh chaos.
The confusions are beyond number and I shall mention only two of them.
As the violence spirals, we are becoming unable to distinguish between victim and executioner, confusing resistance fighters with terrorists, the unfortunate fate of soldiers killed in action with that of civilian victims of what we euphemistically describe as excessive force.
To be sure, those who kill hostages are unscrupulous criminals, but the origins of the tragedy and violence that are rife in Iraq are to be found elsewhere and nothing can excuse such things as the random missile strike on the Bradley tank last Sunday at a time when the wounded soldiers had been evacuated.
These strikes killed children, civilians, and a Palestinian journalist.
One day, international law will demand that justice be done.
Let me turn to the second confusion.
Islam has many faces; we often see it in the darkest light, but the extraordinary outcome of the siege of Najaf and the courage of French Muslims in committing themselves to the release of the hostages show us that moderate Islam can play a part in bringing peace.
This is something we will have to remember in other contexts.
We live in the â perhaps illusory â hope that, in 2005, free elections will be held and a government enjoying popular legitimacy will be formed.
We ask the Commission and the Council to do everything possible to fulfil this hope.
As Mr D'Alema said, the Iraq war has been a tragic mistake, and we cannot make history anew, but â and I say this to Mr Tannock â there is a point at which we must be able to recognise our own mistakes if we are to be able to rectify them.
Â Â  Mr President, the civil war in Iraq has inevitably meant that in recent months the media have focused almost exclusively on security.
However, behind the headlines there is another agenda already in operation, and that is where the European Union should be involved.
This is an absolute priority: the building of a peaceful society.
Capacityâbuilding, the fight against corruption, strengthening the fight against organised crime and bringing in human rights and the rule of law â these words are familiar to us.
They are weapons of dialogue that we use every day of the week in turning postâCommunist states into Member States of the European Union or wider Europe neighbours, away from totalitarianism and tyranny and towards democracy.
Iraq is in just that condition today.
The Iraqis are just like us: they share the same desire for freedom and for a settled society.
Beneath the veil, behind the tribal dress, beyond the cultural differences of East and West, Iraq and Iraqis have the same high hopes of the essential freedoms and the rule of law that we Europeans and Americans enjoy.
They look to us to help institute those freedoms and the fundamental freedom of human rights.
The European Union should focus now on building that agenda with Iraq.
It is a possibility.
It is happening now, away from the guns, bombs and rockets, and that is what we should be involved in.
I ask you to remember that under Saddam Hussein Iraqis had no such freedoms, no access to human rights.
That is the reason why, even now, today, with bombs and rockets, with the difficulties of security, the majority of Iraqis prefer to be without the previous regime and in the situation they are in now.
We should help Iraq build a peaceful society.
Â Â  â Mr President, the war in Iraq drags on, and Allied troops continue to kill civilians as they bombard cities on a daily basis.
In terms of day-to-day life there, Iraq is very much a society at war, with battles, raids, hostage taking and the vicious circle of violence.
It is, in essence, the war of aggression waged on Iraq that lies behind the present calamitous situation, which is getting worse from day to day.
On the assumption that the interpreter got it right, MrÂ Bot said that âthe occupation was brought to an endâ, which is obviously nonsense.
We call for the occupation to really be brought to an end, which means the withdrawal of the occupying forces.
What is NATO doing?
What is the European Union doing?
NATOâs involvement in Iraq is ongoing; will NATO troops be going there once NATO has trained the Iraqi security forces?
It is obvious that the EU does not want to be left out; in contravention of international law, it seeks to push through an open market economy system in Iraq, and more and more private security firms from EU Member States are getting involved in the war.
We are now thinking in terms of an EU force under the UNâs mandate.
That is something to which we must say ânoâ; it must not be allowed to happen.
We must not allow the EU to be involved in the war in Iraq or to support the occupation.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the EUâs declaration on Iraq.
The very idea of issuing such a declaration ties in with the general belief that the European Union has something resembling a foreign policy.
There is no such thing as European public opinion, and there can therefore be no EU foreign policy.
The Iraq issue is the best possible example of this.
Each of the Member States has its own foreign policy and its own opinion on Iraq.
Within each Member State it is also possible to observe a diversity of opinion on foreign policy, but each state has its own government authorised by the voters to conduct foreign policy.
The European Union has not been authorised in this way.
What, therefore, is the point of a declaration on Iraq?
It is an attempt to impose upon us all the belief that this House has a mandate to conduct foreign policy.
This is not true, as we do not have such a mandate.
The European Union may provide humanitarian aid both in the case of Iraq and in the case of many other conflicts taking place throughout the world, and it may also offer its services as mediator and negotiator, provided that all sides in the conflict want the EU to do so.
Political proposals would, however, be out of place, as we do not have the authority to conduct a common foreign policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the debate on Iraq has, so far, often been about how long it is taking to normalise the situation there, and there has been a lot of criticism from different quarters about developments in Iraq.
Questions such as âAre things better now?â have been heard, and people wonder whether the military presence really is leading to peace.
To those who wonder whether that is the case, I can put a question: have you ever stood in the thick of a raging war and really wished that some outside force â the United States, the EU or NATO â would come and intervene in your country?
That is something I myself have done, and I also have a definite answer to that question: yes, a military presence can lead to peace.
In the European Parliament, I represent Sweden, but I was born and brought up in the Balkans, a part of Europe that has seen many wars and a great deal of suffering.
I have experienced war in Bosnia, and I know that it is extremely easy to start a war and extremely difficult to bring it to an end.
It is still more difficult, and takes a still longer period of time, to re-build a country, and that much longer again to get people to begin to trust each other once more.
I have a feeling that those who now criticise the process in Iraq have never even been near a war.
That also makes me think of the saying, âThose who are well fed do not understand those who are hungry.â
It is so easy to see obstacles and problems and identify what might be done better and more quickly, but the fact is that many of the current problems in Iraq are an old legacy from Saddam Husseinâs dictatorship.
The fact too is that todayâs Iraq without Saddam is a better Iraq.
We must ensure that we are involved and make our contribution so that the Iraq of tomorrow is a still better Iraq.
Where the Balkans are concerned, the surrounding world has realised and accepted that it takes a long time to re-build a country, both literally and figuratively, but there is extremely limited understanding of the fact that development towards peace and democracy in Iraq will take time.
Now, the EU must rally around our values of freedom and, united, actively support the forces that wish to build a new Iraq, a sovereign and democratic country that takes its place in the international community.
Â Â  Mr President, unlike the naive and sometimes cynical voices that have been heard in this House, the Commission, through its representatives, has presented a rational assessment of the situation in Iraq.
It must be recognised that state and institution building is taking place.
It must also be recognised that violence is escalating, and that this violence is being used as an instrument of political pressure both in Iraq and against countries that decided to participate militarily and politically in the rebuilding of an Iraqi state.
This is a turning point, and either Iraq will win through with the support of the international community, or major destabilisation will occur.
There is a chance of success, but this requires determination and a correct assessment of the situation.
I would like to pay tribute to the soldiers and civilians risking their lives in Iraq.
They are there in the interests of the Iraqi population and are protecting the lives of those people.
I would also like to say that in taking this risk upon themselves, they are acting primarily on behalf of the Iraqi people.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ President, Commissioner Patten.
It is not the first time we are talking about Iraq in this House, and that is only natural since the events in Iraq dominate the international news.
The reports of terrible violence and of terrorism directed against women, children and civilians â mainly Iraqis of course, but also foreign journalists, aid workers, business people and military personnel â are alarming.
The kidnappings are absolutely abominable, and it is good that we in this House are, in any case, one hundred per cent in agreement about our demand that those kidnapped should be released and that the violence must cease.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe naturally condemns all types of violence and calls upon the Iraqi authority to ensure that legal proceedings are taken against the people responsible.
In this context, we would also regret the fact that the death penalty has been reintroduced.
In common with many other countries in many other parts of the world, we are split on the Iraq issue, and this has meant that we have only been able to agree upon a fairly watered down resolution.
I nonetheless hope that we can put the past behind us and look forwards.
The whole world has a responsibility for supporting the Iraqi people and developments towards a democratic and sovereign Iraq able to take its place in the international community.
We in the EU can offer support in many ways in cooperation with the UN and international bodies.
We have a role to play when it comes to supporting the election, the economy, the construction of a civil society and the devising of a democratic constitution.
In the future, a UN-led multinational force must accept responsibility for security in Iraq, and this is an area in which the EU and its neighbouring countries can play an important role.
Naturally, the ultimate responsibility lies with the Iraqi people, but we all have a responsibility for ensuring that this process succeeds, both for the sake of Iraq and in the interests of stability throughout the region.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have serious doubts as to whether the actions of the European Parliament can influence the situation in Iraq.
In any case, what is happening demonstrates the splits within the European Union and the lack of a foreign policy, in that 12 countries are present, 12 more are absent and one has withdrawn.
It should also be noted that there is a lack of a common feeling of being European.
In fact, every time there are killings or kidnappings, nobody asks whether European citizens were involved, but the Italians ask if there were any Italians, the Spanish if there were any Spaniards, the Greeks if there were any Greeks, the French if there were any French people, and so on. This observation is highly significant for those who at all costs want Europe to have a role, because such division will not allow it to have one.
Lastly, with regard to the institutional situation, I believe that the principle of the self-determination of peoples should be fully applied to the minorities in Iraq.
The autonomy or independence of the Kurds or of the other peoples living in Iraq should be decided neither by a foreign power nor by representatives of the old or new regimes.
Â Â  âThe debate is adjourned at this point for the vote and will continue immediately after it.
Â Â  We now come to the vote(1).
That concludes the voting.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of setting up a temporary committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013, because it strikes me as crucial that we monitor this process very carefully, and gather and coordinate points of view on the different items of the budget that Parliament will evaluate through its various parliamentary committees.
Parliamentâs political priorities in these negotiations must be in line with the structure of the new financial perspective.
I feel that it is crucial that Parliamentâs final position should be incorporated into the Councilâs common position, so that the negotiations can begin in a climate of mutual understanding of the European Projectâs orientation in the near future.
I feel that this process must make use of internal coherence comprising all of the institutionsâ assets and that all efforts must be channelled not only into the negotiations themselves, but, most importantly, into placing greater value on the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, and on an energetic economic and social cohesion policy that will continue to enable convergence in levels of well-being among the peoples of the various Member States.
Â Â  . Although we voted in favour of setting up a temporary committee on political priorities and budgetary means of the future financial perspective 2007-2013, there are two questions that we would like to see resolved.
Firstly, the committeeâs work must not be allowed to replace, reduce or subordinate the parallel work, in accordance with procedure, that will take place in the other parliamentary committees.
This committee must bring added value, in close cooperation and in discussion with the various parliamentary committees, and must not be a motive for blocking or watering down.
It is obvious, as far as we are concerned, that opinions on the regulations of the different funds proposed, specifically at the levels of cohesion, social affairs and the productive economy, must be developed in the relevant parliamentary committees.
Secondly, different political and nationality groups must be guaranteed representation.
We therefore welcome the fact that an agreement has been reached to increase the size of this committee to 50 members, provided that this representation is guaranteed.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of Parliament setting up this temporary committee on policy challenges and budgetary means of the European Union.
I sincerely hope that the guidance of the group chairmen and of the Conference of Presidents was passed on, as they consider that this historical moment and its practical implications for a Europe of over 450Â million citizens justifies this particular committee.
This methodology must enable the views of the different committees concerned to be gathered, considered and coordinated, thereby contributing to a more precise definition of Parliamentâs political priorities, which will be reflected in the future financial perspectives.
This must not serve to weaken positions already taken by Parliament, clearly opposed to reducing EU resources or abandoning, or simply weakening, the aims and policies of cohesion.
This is not a matter, in my view, of setting a new starting point.
On the contrary, this temporary committee must at least adopt the Commissionâs proposal on the financial perspectives and must seek to set more ambitious targets as regards the EUâs budgetary resources.
It must also move more quickly in its cohesion aims.
This is the challenge in these times of an enlarged Union and the new constitutional Treaty.
Â Â  We believe that the European Unionâs policy on fisheries agreements must be reviewed.
Over-exploitation of fishing waters forces people into ever-greater poverty and robs the marine environment of a vital link in the food chain.
It would be better if those countries with which the EU signs fisheries agreements were instead given assistance so that they themselves could develop their own fisheries.
We do not accept AmendmentÂ NoÂ 7 by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, whereby the Commission would be given an independent source of income.
We believe that, if the EU concludes a fisheries agreement with a third country, the total amount of the financial compensation for this third country must be funded by those EU Member States whose fishing vessels exploit the relevant opportunities under the agreement.
Those Member States might then each themselves decide whether they, in turn, are to fund this expenditure by imposing taxes upon their respective fishing vessels.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mr Morillon on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining, for the period 3 December 2003 to 2Â December 2007, the fishing opportunities and the financial compensation provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of Mauritius on fishing in the waters of Mauritius, because I feel that it is crucial to coordinate the protection of the EUâs interests in the area of fishing with the management of maritime resources and with the development of the populations that depend on fishing.
The EU must make an accurate assessment of the sustainability of fishing agreements with third countries, given that specific measures have taken on greater importance in the correct implementation of Community actions aimed at developing local communities, especially coastal communities that rely on traditional fishing.
Community tuna shipowners will also be protected, through measures imposing greater control over fishing activities aimed at combating illegal fishing.
Those measures will make a contribution towards ensuring responsible fishing in the Indian Ocean.
Â Â  . It has become vitally important to safeguard fishing opportunities for Community fleets, in particular the Portuguese fleet, in third-country exclusive economic zones, not only from the point of view of economics and of safeguarding jobs, but also the survival of countless regions that depend on fishing in the EU, in particular the outermost regions.
Much of the Portuguese distant water fishing fleet has been disappearing owing to the fact that opportunities have been decreasing and the cost of licences increasing, and that the common fisheries policy rewards those who scrap boats and is set to stop giving aid for repairing fleets â in this respect Portugal has been an âexemplary pupilâ.
This also leads us to feel that the amendments aimed at passing on the costs to the tuna shipowners do not make sense.
These agreements, which are commercial in nature, may also contribute towards the sustainable management of fishing resources and towards the development of local fishing communities.
The current Fisheries Protocol, which runs until 2Â December 2007, will enable the seven Portuguese surface longliners to continue to operate as they have been doing.
Â Â  . The issue here is the conclusion of another fishing agreement between the EU and various Indian Ocean countries, in this case Mauritius.
This agreement, with the necessary adaptations, extends the successive agreements concluded in the field since 1989.
Although this a relatively modest agreement from a financial point of view and solely concerns tuna, the highly migratory nature of the species makes this agreement even more important to Community tuna shipowners.
The agreement also makes economic sense given that the value of catches far exceeds the cost of the protocol to the EU.
The further advantages of concluding the agreement, such as creating jobs on fishing vessels, in ports, auctions, processing factories, shipyards and service industries both in the EU and in Mauritius itself, strike me as similarly beneficial.
Given that right now seven of the 90 Community vessels in Mauritian waters are Portuguese, I voted in favour of the report before us, as I feel that the amendments suggested by the rapporteur add value to this Proposal for a Regulation.
Â Â  . These fisheries deals show the European Union in its worst possible light: greedy, exploitative and behaving like a colonial power.
Over the last five years I have campaigned against this appalling environmental degradation and tried to highlight the human cost to the indigenous black African communities.
In 2003 and early 2004 over 100 MEPs had, at last, begun to listen.
Now I see that opposition has fallen to 70 or 80.
The reason, I am told, is that the deals have been reformed.
But I would be very cautious about the word 'reform' in an EU context.
Invariably it is meaningless.
In the case of Africa, it means that some aspects of the deal may be slightly less bad.
It is the whole principle that is wrong and that is why UKIP will continue to oppose these deals until that tragic continent gets its fishing grounds back.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mr Morillion on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006 the tuna fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Democratic Republic of Madagascar on fishing off Madagascar, because I am in favour of responsible and sustainable fishing.
This Protocol sets fishing opportunities for the Community tuna fleet and promotes the development of cooperation based on respect for the laws and regulations under Malagasy national fisheries policy.
The new Protocolâs global cost is identical to that of the previous Protocol.
This agreement is equally crucial to the Malagasy economy, providing an important source of currency and creating jobs for local seamen, as well as in the processing industry and surveillance activities.
Â Â  . This eighth Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement with the Democratic Republic of Madagascar runs until the end of 2006 and defines the tuna fishing opportunities for Community fleets â which include six Portuguese surface longliners â pursuant to the other agreements on tuna concluded by the Community with Indian Ocean countries, which we broadly welcome.
Nevertheless, one question that raises a number of doubts is the so-called exclusivity clause, which suggests that vessels flying the flag of a Member State cannot obtain a licence by any means other than this Protocol.
In practice, it will be forbidden to make any further agreements, such as bilateral agreements, which strikes us as excessive and also constitutes interference in the internal politics of individual Member States.
This is particularly so given that there are countries that enjoy traditional, historical relations that are not covered by the Community Agreement.
Â Â  . This agreement, which focuses solely on tuna, is another of the agreements concluded by the EU with Indian Ocean countries, enabling the European fleet to continue to operate in the waters off Madagascar.
I feel that the EUâs fisheries policy must stress the need for transparency, which is especially important in agreements of this nature, the objective of which is not simply about European interests.
Indeed, the development of the Malagasy economy, respect for the environment and the sustainability of the fishing effort in Madagascarâs territorial waters are three areas that must not be overlooked in this Protocol.
I share the rapporteurâs concern that the Malagasy Government must take steps to monitor fisheries activities more closely. Otherwise, the balance of resources and his assertion that coastal communities must benefit from this Protocol will be in jeopardy.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters concerning the extension of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cape Verde on fishing off the coast of Cape Verde for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, given the mutual benefits for both the Community and for Cape Verde that will result from the conclusion of this agreement.
We understand that this extension is an attempt to improve certain aspects of this agreement, in view of the fact that the authorities of this country, of which the official language is Portuguese, do not have a reliable study of the state of resources and of the repercussions of the targeted measures designed to develop Cape Verdeâs fisheries sector.
Cape Verde and its fishing communities can only benefit if this situation is rectified.
Â Â  . We welcome this report in view of its social and economic importance to the Republic of Cape Verde and to those countries whose fleets are involved â the Spanish, Portuguese and French fleets â amounting to 117 vessels.
The report focuses mainly on tuna, but also covers demersal species.
The extension of the current fisheries agreement for a further year â until 30Â June 2005 â will enable tuna shipowners to pursue their fisheries activities in the exclusive economic zone of Cape Verde, including the two Portuguese pole-and-line vessels and the ten Portuguese surface longliners.
The Portuguese fleet is, furthermore, allowed to catch up to 630 gross registered tonnes (GRT) by bottom trawling.
These fishing opportunities appear miniscule, however, in view of the traditional and historical relations between Portugal and Cape Verde, but this is also a reflection of the fisheries policies of a CFP that has gradually led to the destruction of distant water fishing fleets, as in the case of the Portuguese fleet.
Â Â  . The issue before us is the extension of the fisheries Protocol between the EU and Cape Verde for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, which focuses mainly on tuna and which is intended to enable Community tuna shipowners to continue to pursue their fisheries activities in the exclusive economic zone of Cape Verde.
The Commission says that a thorough assessment of the current Protocol must be carried out for this relationship with Cape Verde to continue, and for a new agreement for the coming years to be concluded.
Like the rapporteur, I feel that this commitment by the Commission is opportune and welcome.
In view of the advantages for Community tuna shipowners, of the fact that the value of the catches far exceeds the cost of the agreement, of the mutual benefits for both the EU and Cape Verde and of the fact that these catches can supply the Community market, I must welcome the conclusion of this Protocol, which has been improved by the proposals tabled by the rapporteur.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is abundantly obvious that the situation in Iraq is gradually deteriorating.
Guerrilla fighting is spreading and the number of terrorist acts is rising.
Last Sunday, 600 attacks of this type occurred.
The position of the interim government is weakening, and there is a risk that the political process outlined in Security Council Resolution 1546 will be brought to a halt.
Elections are meant to take place by 31 January 2005.
If they do not, the constitution will not be adopted and a final, permanent government will not be appointed in early 2006.
This means we are currently at a turning point, and that either Iraq will take action to abide by the timetable outlined in Resolution 1546, or the entire reconstruction of the country will be brought to a halt.
This leads to the question as to how to proceed.
Firstly, the military coalition should not be weakened, as the socialists wish, and troops should not be withdrawn.
Instead, the military contingent should be increased, as the present number of around 200Â 000 soldiers is quite inadequate to stabilise the situation in Iraq.
Secondly, the UNâs role in Iraq should gradually be stepped up, and it should go beyond its current role as midwife to the democratic process.
Thirdly, and as set out in the motion for a resolution on Iraq by members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is important for the European Union to be extremely active in its support for the transformation of Iraq in various fields, on the premise that Iraq is our joint responsibility, the joint responsibility of all Europeans and that of the entire European Union.
It is important to provide political backing, supporting the measures taken by the interim government, and later by the permanent Iraqi authorities.
Expert support is also needed, in creating police forces, for example.
Humanitarian and financial support on a far greater scale than this year is required too.
A democratic Iraq should not be held hostage to last yearâs arguments in Europe.
Mr Bot said that Iraq is a divisive issue.
It should not be, and a line should be drawn under the arguments of the past year.
Iraqâs future requires all of us and the entire European Union to be fully mobilised, as was and is the case for reconstruction in the Balkans.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in Europe have had very divergent opinions on the war in Iraq, but the disaster in that country, which is there for all to see, has unfortunately confirmed that the fears that many of us expressed were well founded.
It is now urgent to try to bring a stop to the chaos and violence, even if it is difficult to talk of peace and democracy when every day is marked by kidnappings, murders, guerrilla attacks, terrorist ambushes and air bombardments.
Europe is being called upon to act and Parliament itself must take a more active investigative and steering role in such a decisive matter of foreign policy.
I believe, therefore, that the Presidency of the European Council should resolve to take part in an international conference on Iraq as soon as possible with a view to the multilateral management of the crisis, which should involve the United Nations, the major world powers and all those countries with an interest in the region, that is, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Syria.
To promote this path to restoring peace, Europe needs to take strong, united action that is clearly in favour of dialogue with the Islamic world and strongly against terrorism and all kinds of violence.
I thank Commissioner Patten for his very lucid and effective speech.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly appreciated Commissioner Pattenâs words, but it is with great disappointment and concern that I note that the text of the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Iraq that has been put before us is a serious step backwards compared with Parliamentâs condemnation of the United Statesâ pre-emptive war that was issued early in 2003.
Today, faced with the political and military disaster of the occupation, we cannot even demand or envisage the withdrawal of the occupying foreign troops and we avoid the need to identify those responsible for the current situation.
I see no political realism.
The evidence says that a mass uprising of the people is under way against the occupying powers and against a government that does not represent the country.
The terrorist presence cannot hide that fact.
Indeed, as Mr DâAlema said as well, it is the presence of foreign troops that is attracting and causing the terrorism.
If it does not make a stand, Europe is in serious danger of finding itself in a few monthsâ time not only facing an even more widespread disaster but also of being jointly responsible for it.
Under these conditions, the elections planned for January 2005, if they take place, will be neither free nor fair.
Condemning terrorism without saying who and what created the whole situation means we are hiding our heads in the sand.
I believe we should send out a different signal to public opinion in the Arab and Islamic world and also to public opinion in Europe, the major part of which is hostile to the war, calling first of all for an immediate halt to the bombing.
Otherwise we all shall miss a great opportunity to contribute to justice and peace and to influence the international situation for the good.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for the work he has done.
I wish him all the best â drive carefully, Commissioner!
Mr President, it is obvious that Iraq and the world are better places without Saddam than with Saddam.
It does not help to blame others in this difficult situation; instead we should look ahead.
Mankind has to answer the question of what we are to do with tyrants, despots who kill their own people or those of another country.
Human suffering, whether it is in oneâs own or another country, is always the same.
There was no help from the League of Nations when Stalin attacked Finland.
What is the role of the United Nations today?
To maintain world order we need a revamped UN.
We need a UN with a Security Council and a UN on which there is also a seat for the EU.
Before we can do this, however, we need a common EU foreign policy.
Now, the issue of Iraq has split the EU, and the EU cannot play the role we should be able to in securing world peace, or peace in Iraq, because we are so divided.
It is important for us to help Iraq on a wide front in this difficult situation.
We must do all we can to combat terrorism, including its causes, as otherwise tomorrow we will find bombs in our own homes.
We must do all we can to help Iraq to develop democracy, to develop civil government.
Now is not the time to hide our heads in the sand.
I am disappointed that the resolution makes no mention of prohibiting the death penalty.
The Iraqi constitution should definitely contain a mention of the prohibition of the death penalty, as the protection of life is a basic value, the starting-point for everything.
Finally, this is an opportunity to show the international community and the EU whether we are capable of leadership and keeping overall control of the situation, or whether we are just content with discussing the politics of the day.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my solidarity with and support for the European citizens â the two French journalists and the two Italian aid workers â being held hostage in Iraq.
Their continuing captivity is causing serious injury to the European Union itself and its contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq.
We must all strengthen our cooperation and join our voices to obtain their immediate release.
Iraq is sinking deeper and deeper into violence and instability and is now lacking even fundamental security.
Every day, the political process of transition to free elections, as provided for in UN Security Council Resolution 1546, is being undermined.
The departure of the international and European aid workers will be a defeat for the international community and, more importantly, for the European Union.
Last June we all welcomed unanimous Security Council resolution 1546 marking the start of the political process which would result in free elections and a new democratic constitution.
Despite the legalisation of the occupying forces as a multinational force by the Security Council, the occupation continues; it is a fact of life and the source and main reason for the continuing conflict.
Under these circumstances, who truly believes that the timetable set out in Resolution 1546 will be adhered to, who believes that it can guarantee smooth political process, who believes that the UN can play the leading role in Iraq?
The European Union must play its own autonomous role, make its own analysis of the security situation and proceed with its own analysis of the role and composition of and prospects for the multinational force.
The 2004 Commission communication is important, just as the role of Commissioner Patten is important.
However, I fear that they cannot be implemented.
The European Commission and the Council of Ministers must proceed at once to draft a report evaluating the security situation in Iraq, just as an international initiative must be taken to convene an international conference.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate I have listened to learned, elaborate speeches about geopolitics, with which in fact I agree to a great extent.
It is, however, quite clear that, despite a declared common European feeling, Europe â and the Council in particular â will do nothing for the four European citizens who are being held hostage right now by the terrorists.
Europe â and the Council in particular â will do nothing to make these four European citizens stop being considered just Italians or just French; stop being just journalists, doing a job assigned to those who feel they have a duty to report the truth; stop being just international aid workers, doing a job assigned to those who feel they have a duty to work for the common good; and start being adopted simply as children of Europe.
This observation, though bitter, is not intended to be one of resignation, and in fact I continue to call insistently for the immediate release of all the hostages, without making them undergo any further ordeals, and for support for all efforts to achieve this outcome.
With its people, its volunteers and its solidarity, including in peacekeeping or crisis containment operations, Italy has always done its utmost for the good of the population in the Italian areas of activity.
The two Italian women volunteers, like so many others, are there to help, to protect the weak and to do good.
That is why we want them released, together with all the other hostages.
We also ask that the body of Enzo Baldoni be returned and, in this respect, we ask for his family to be shown pity as well.
We must not now allow the ideal that those two young women embody to be held in check, for there is a real possibility to build a sense of the common good and brotherhood within the Iraqi mind.
Those two women and the two journalists are genuine representatives of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, one aspect of this debate that angers me is that neither the Council nor the Commission have had a word to say about women, who make up the majority of the population in Iraq, not a word about their exclusion from the transitional government or the process of democratisation.
OK, so we want free elections, but what about Iraqâs female majority?
The Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality organised a hearing with Iraqi women, at which the hope was expressed that we would provide outside help, highlighting painful issues as we did in Afghanistan, and that women could be involved in the process of democratisation.
For that reason, we women in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament want this aid with reconstruction to be tied to the stipulation that women be fully involved.
No matter what the terror, hope must not be allowed to die, and it is through women and children that it lives on â the hope that they will again be able to work as police officers, as politicians, as doctors, and as university professors, as they did under Saddam, dictator though he was.
That, I believe, is why we must not forget, while demanding the immediate release of the hostages, that Iraqâs women, too, have to be set free.
Â Â  The instability and terror that Iraq is currently enduring, and the recent nominal restoration of sovereignty in the country, with the establishment of an Interim Government, go to show the complexity of the process of creating a secure, stable and democratic Iraq.
The EU must, however, play a part in that process, in these turbulent and dangerous times for all of us.
Accordingly, the direction taken by European cooperation with Iraq is consistent with the process of reconstructing the country and restoring democracy.
We must, now more than ever, be conscious of the thin line separating internal security and external security.
Consequently, new approaches to cooperation are needed that go beyond bloody-minded unilateral acts, which are no longer acceptable and are little more than representations of outdated debate, as has already been said in this House.
Nowadays, when anything can be deemed a target, it has become even more necessary for our alliances to remain firm in that fight.
No effort must be spared against the endless horrors of terrorism.
Europe must set an example of firmness in condemning terrorist attacks against civilians, the police, soldiers of the multinational force and civilian hostages.
Parliament must bring all of its political weight and influence to bear to ensure that those hostages are released immediately.
We are speaking about appalling crimes that have yet to be punished.
We must also support the Interim Governmentâs intention to press ahead, in spite of all the difficulties, with preparations for free and democratic elections in January 2005.
When time appears to be against the Iraqi people who want to be able to prepare the route towards democracy and the dismantling of terrorist networks operating in the country, we have no doubt that the EU and its Member States share this commitment to support the Iraqi people in reconstructing a country that is secure, democratic, unified and prosperous, a country at peace within its borders, a country that wants to re-establish working relations with its neighbours and with the rest of the world.
Mr President, Parliament must not waver in the face of the complex nature of these times.
We must remain firm in our societies, our alliances must remain solid and loyal and, most importantly, our actions must form part of a concerted struggle for the peace, stability and prosperity to which Iraq and the Iraqi people are unquestionably entitled.
After all, Mr President, nobody wishes to see this fail.
Â Â  Mr President, my observations are, above all, inspired by my role as member of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I realise that although the EUâs role is modest for the time being, it can nevertheless help determine the quality of democracy in future.
My questions are concrete and I should say beforehand that I welcome the proposal by the President-in-Office of the Council to perhaps send a fact-finding mission to Iraq later on this year.
My first question is about spending EU funding in Iraq itself.
It appears to me that for practical considerations, it has been decided to spend these monies mainly via the existing, traditional channels in a bid to make the greatest possible impact.
However, as a result of this, it looks as if minorities, and I am particularly referring to the Assyrian minority, which accounts for 10% of the population and mainly consists of Christians, are at risk of falling by the wayside.
That would be harrowing, because they also suffered the effects of Saddam Husseinâs arabisation programme, and are now also suffering repression in the Kurdish region.
Could the Commission, and also the Council, say a little more about how the funds will be spent, particularly where this minority and other small minorities are concerned?
My second point concerns the draft constitution, in which Arabic and Kurdish are recognised as official languages. Assyrian, however, is not, despite the fact that more than 10% of the population speak it.
What role can the European Union play on this score in order to guarantee the positions of minorities and also in respect of minority languages in the new Iraq and Iraqi society?
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I can say that I have listened with great interest, and also with much appreciation, to the many contributions today about this sensitive issue.
I should like to say that after everything that has happened, we would do well to look ahead instead of heaping reproaches on one another.
I think that that is what we should do, because our ultimate goal is not to leave the Iraqi people in the lurch.
That is why we need to constantly remind ourselves of what our goals are.
First of all, I think that we have to ensure that the political process is completed, as has also been clearly explained in Resolution 1546.
I also think that the European Union is determined to make a constructive and effective contribution to that effect.
We could, for example, help to ensure that everything in the election process runs smoothly and that all Iraqis can actually take part.
We could help install a legal government, and ensure that, once that legal government is in place, it is also supported by effective administration.
In short, I think that we must seek to introduce in that stricken country the values we regard as so important.
Democracy, something that Iraq has lacked for so long, springs to mind.
I am also thinking of human rights and respect for them, and I can tell you that that also includes women, something that was quite rightly pointed out earlier.
I am thinking of respect for minorities, including the Assyrian minority, which is another of that countryâs problems to which sufficient attention will need to be paid.
I am thinking about the establishment of a constitutional state and the way in which we, the European Union, backed by our extensive experience, with the contribution we can make to restoring a true, independent, legal body with judges who truly render judgment, with everything that is involved in this and what is important, can train these people and give them guidance.
Someone has also pointed out the importance of the neighbouring countries.
This is a view that I readily support. As I already stated in my first intervention, during my meetings with the Prime Minister and ministers during my visit to Iraq, I noted that the European Union will gladly accept an invitation to take part in the next conference of neighbouring countries.
After all, as has been said several times on this platform, stability in Iraq also means stability in the region.
Peace and democracy in Iraq will also rub off on the neighbouring countries.
I think that we should do our utmost, firstly, to ensure that peace and democracy are in place in Iraq itself.
Therefore, once we have managed to bridge the differences of opinion which existed, we as European Union should also be able to make our presence clearly felt in Iraq.
I know how much this is appreciated and wanted by the present government.
I therefore think that we cannot avoid our responsibilities and that we must actually follow the clear trajectory that we have mapped out.
The Dutch Presidency will ensure that this is done.
I have clearly set out those goals.
I have also explained that we have sent an exploratory mission, that we will now send a follow-up mission and that, based on this, we will very shortly state how we can give substance to this.
That is our aim, and I hope that I will be able to report on the results at the end of our presidency.
Â Â  âThe debate is closed.
I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate on the situation in Iraq in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday.
Â Â  â Having learnt the lessons from previous experiences and failures, this was to be a surgical operation; complete in a matter of days, weapons of mass destruction located and eliminated, a dictator toppled, a democracy â another democracy â installed.
Days passed; the days ran into weeks, and then months.
We are now measuring the time in terms of years; the weapons never existed (as we knew); a country is being occupied against the will of its people, who are resisting; the war goes on, in increasingly dramatic fashion; the casualty figures mount up, from dozens, with names and faces, to thousands, who are anonymous and do not count towards the statistics.
What is more, some political positions appear to be held hostage by hostage taking.
The United States has installed military bases in that part of the Middle East whilst in Palestine violence against Palestinians has reared its head again, the price of oil has risen, thereby demonstrating all the inconsistency of an economy that is entirely dependent on oil, of a globalised economy that is in thrall to finance and speculation.
In the countries of the EU, since the initial split, there has been relative unity in search of a share of the spoils of occupation and reconstruction.
There are those, however, who have denounced this enormous sham, and it is essential that they do so because people now have access to information that was previously non-existent or much less complete.
Let us fight to ensure that positions of this ...
Â Â  The Minutes of yesterdayâs sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to intervene on behalf of Mr Pannella of the Italian Radicals, who is in Italy, to make a point of order regarding the calendar.
I am informed that Mr Pannella was refused the right to amend the calendar by the Presidency in the same way that I was two years ago, as it threatened the twelve Strasbourg part-sessions, albeit within the letter of the Treaties.
In Parliament's verbatim report it fails to register your statement that 'no amendments were submitted'.
In fact, of course, none were permitted.
Can you ensure that the verbatim report accurately reflects what you actually stated, which is now being taped for verification purposes?
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Tannock.
Your comment will appear in the Minutes, which will be corrected to reflect precisely what happened.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission Statements on the Stability and Growth Pact.
Â Â  . Mr President, we had an interesting meeting in Scheveningen.
The discussion was based on three papers.
First, a Commission communication on the Stability and Growth Pact; second, a Court ruling on the excessive deficit procedure with reference to Germany and France; and third, a statement by the European Council on the Stability and Growth Pact.
Ministers agreed that the Commission communication offered a good basis for discussion.
The discussion was held in two parts.
First, we had a long discussion in the euro group with the 12.
Next, we discussed these conclusions in the group of 25, because the other 13 hope to become members of EMU as soon as possible.
The first conclusion we came to â contrary to some press interpretations â is that Ministers are not seeking to water down the pact, but rather want it to be strengthened, clarified and better implemented.
Of course, the discussions could not be concluded in a single day, so we gave our collaborators some political guidance to enable them to work on the question in the future, together with the Commission.
The first thing we noticed is that, contrary to what is sometimes thought, the Stability Pact has proven its usefulness in anchoring budget deficits.
If you compare, for example, the budget deficits in the Member States during the current slowdown with earlier slowdowns, or with what is happening elsewhere in the world, it can be seen that the pact has contributed to lower deficit levels than we would otherwise have seen.
If you also look at interest rates and inflation, we can be pleased with the effects of the combined budgetary and monetary policy.
The second point we agreed upon is that we will not change anything as far as the 3% or 60% criteria are concerned â these are in the Treaty, are of paramount importance and should not be changed.
We also agreed that a rule-based system remains the best guarantee for ensuring that commitments are enforced for all Member States in an equal way.
We agreed that the Treaty should not be changed at all and that changes to regulations should be kept to a minimum, if indeed they are needed at all, but we are not sure of that yet.
In strengthening and clarifying the Stability and Growth Pact, due consideration should be given to strengthening its economic rationale and its implementation.
To ensure the credibility of the framework, rules should be kept both transparent and simple.
We think the following elements should be analysed.
Firstly, the preventive arm of the pact should be strengthened.
A more symmetrical approach to fiscal policy is needed through budgetary discipline during good times so as gradually to achieve budgetary surpluses when the upswing comes.
Secondly, we shall use peer pressure and peer support at an early stage of budgetary deviations, rather than waiting until a country breaches the 3% rule.
Thirdly, we need transparent budgetary figures and growth assumptions in order to identify and correct budgetary deviations in a timely manner.
The second issue we discussed was debt and debt sustainability.
The focus on these elements should be enhanced.
Firstly, more attention should be paid to the fact that a debt ratio should be sufficiently diminishing if it is above its reference value, approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.
Secondly, in assessing whether a Member State has reached sustainable public finances, the costs of ageing should be taken into account.
Thirdly, we agreed to look further into the issue of debt sustainability.
One particular concern centred on the possible statistical implications of pension reforms.
Thus concerns a few countries, but is something we should investigate further.
A third important element is that when a country is subject to an excessive deficit procedure and we have to assess whether it is complying with the recommendations, we should make a clear distinction between measures taken, on the one hand, and economic forecasting errors.
Until now we issued recommendations on the efforts required and hoped for a result, but that result was in the same spirit as the written forecast.
Thus in future, when assessing whether or not a country has met the recommendations, we should make a distinction between policy mistakes and forecasting mistakes.
Finally, within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, budgetary policies need to set the right priorities for structural reforms, innovation and competitiveness in support of the Lisbon Agenda to promote economic growth and create jobs.
We asked the Economic and Financial Committee and the Commission to work these principles out further so we can have another discussion at ministerial level.
We also agreed that it would be best to hold this discussion in parallel with discussions on France and Germany and the excessive deficit procedure applied to them.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to start by thanking you for inviting me to this debate on the Stability and Growth Pact.
As you know, in September the European Commission approved a communication on strengthening economic governance and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.
I believe it is very important that there be a debate not just in the Council, like the debate we held last weekend â and those we will have over the coming weeks and months â but also in this Parliament and in the national parliaments, on the framework for economic governance and, in particular, the situation and the future prospects of the Stability and Growth Pact.
As the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said, last weekend in the Hague, both in the Eurogroup of 12 and around the table of the extended Eurogroup â the informal Ecofin of 25 â we held an initial debate on this issue.
The Council has agreed that the Commissionâs Communication provides a good basis for discussion and now we trust that in the coming weeks and months the work we are going to carry out at a more technical level between representatives of the Member States in the Economic and Financial Committee and the Commission will allow us to go to the November Ecofin with a degree of agreement with much more content than we have been able to debate and achieve on many points involving the more general ideas and principles included in the Commissionâs Communication.
As Mr Zalm has also said, the draft Constitutional Treaty approved in June ratifies what is already included in the Treaty and we do not propose changing it.
They are the basic principles, the basic reference values in terms of the evolution of public deficits and public debt and the excessive deficit procedure, as defined in the current Article 104 of the Treaty.
It is not therefore a question of discussing what is not subject to discussion, because that is in the current Treaty and is going to be in the future Constitution.
What we need to do is debate proposals to improve, strengthen and clarify its application and improve the degree of compliance with the framework laid down in the current Treaty and provided for, amongst other things, in the Stability and Growth Pact.
This framework is based on national but coordinated economic policies involving budgetary policies that must conform to the 3% limit for budgetary deficit and the debt criterion of 60Â % of Gross Domestic Product.
On this basis, the Commissionâs ideas expressed in the Communication deal with both the coordination of economic policies and the coordination and surveillance of budgetary policies.
With regard to economic policy, we believe there is a clear need to coordinate our actions better in the field of structural reforms and increase our efforts to implement the Lisbon Agenda.
Europe needs to increase its growth potential and create more jobs and we cannot work solely on the basis of one instrument â the Stability and Growth Pact â in order to coordinate our economic policies.
We must therefore use the broad economic policy guidelines more effectively, an instrument which, by its very nature, is more flexible than the Stability and Growth Pact and, at the same time, we must improve the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by applying the preventive measures and aspects of the Pact more frequently and effectively, strengthening mutual control (peer pressure) and, in particular, we must do so during favourable periods of the economic cycle.
With regard to budgetary coordination, the Commission's proposals aimed at strengthening and adapting the Stability and Growth Pact are based on four main issues.
Firstly, the need to place more emphasis on the level of indebtedness and on the sustainability of public finances throughout the process of monitoring the evolution of those public finances in each of the Member States.
In principle, compliance with the maximum limit for deficit of 3Â % must guarantee an adequate reduction in the level of indebtedness and the sustainability of the public finances of each country.
In practice, however, in many countries the evolution of debt has not been as expected due to the application of exceptional measures or the appearance of implicit debts.
We must therefore pay more attention to the evolution of debt in addition to tight control of the evolution of public deficit.
It must be made clear that the problem of sustainability does not only affect countries that already have high levels of debt, above the reference value of 60Â %, but also other Member States where the percentage of their debt in relation to Gross Domestic Product is increasing or where, though it is not increasing at the moment, they know that in the future very important and very difficult challenges have to be faced, including those resulting from demographic developments and the ageing of the population.
Secondly, the Commission is aware of the need to take more account of the different national situations when it comes to monitoring the budgetary evolution of each of the countries and, in particular, when it comes to determining the mid-term objective.
In a Union of 25 countries it is not a question of creating an pact â as some people have said â it is not the Commissionâs intention to do that, but rather to apply the economic logic that suggests that it is not advisable to establish a uniform mid-term objective for the evolution of the public finances of each and every country of the enlarged Europe.
At the same time, the specific mid-term objectives for each country must in all cases guarantee compliance with the 3Â % of GDP rule for their public deficits.
Equal treatment for the different Members States is thereby guaranteed, regardless of their differing situations in terms of the sustainability of their public accounts.
Thirdly, the Commission believes that the debate must deal with the need to apply measures quickly, to increase the use of the preventive measures of the Stability and Growth Pact.
We all know that, at the end of the Nineties and the beginning of this decade, not all the Member States took advantage of the good state of their economy, of the good stage they were at in the economic cycle, to consolidate their public finances sufficiently, which means that at times of economic difficulty they are not able, or find it very difficult, to obey the 3% rule.
All of these aspects â these first three blocks of ideas â as the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said, were received favourably by the Council almost immediately.
On the corrective part of the Pact there was more debate and there will continue to be so in the future.
In order to be consistent in our preventive measures, we also need, in the corrective part of the Pact, in the excessive deficit procedure, to take account of the circumstances of each country and which stage of the cycle each country's economy is at.
How can this be done?
By means of two possible procedures.
Firstly, the current definition of exceptional circumstances included in the Stability and Growth Pact can be improved, allowing a country not be included in the excessive deficit procedure, despite being above the 3% of deficit, if it has been in a prolonged situation of growth beneath its potential level.
In order to distinguish between periods of cyclical low activity and those of structural low activity and in order to avoid weakening the surveillance framework, the other two requirements contained in the current exceptional circumstances clause must be applied strictly in all cases.
That is to say that the deficit must be temporary and there must not be much deviation from the 3%.
A second consideration is the need or the possibility to adjust the path of deficit correction, the speed with which a country which is above the 3% must bring its public deficit below that reference value.
The differences between the cyclical situations of the different countries in this position justify this approach.
In any event, the Commissionâs Communication maintains the principle that an excessive deficit must be corrected quickly, but â as Mr Zalm has said â the influence of other economic factors, other than the intensity of the effort being called for and being made by the country in question on the budgetary results must be considered.
In any event, there is an interrelationship between these two elements included in the exceptional circumstances clause.
There is a trade-off here.
We cannot choose to increase the room for manoeuvre in the two simultaneously in an uncontrolled manner.
If more emphasis is placed on reviewing the entry of a country into the excessive deficit procedure, we will have to be more rigid on the adjustment path.
If the current rigidity in relation to entry into the excessive deficit procedure is maintained, the possibility of adjusting the deadlines once the country has been integrated into that procedure may be considered in order to conform to the Treaty.
I am convinced that these improvements are going to provide a basis for strengthening the framework for economic governance of the Economic and Monetary Union, that these ideas and the debate which we will be holding following last weekend not only do not weaken the pact but in fact strengthen it, because the weakness of a pact, the weakness of a fiscal framework, does not just stem from the theoretical brilliance of the rules we all respect or in theory, but also from the capacity to apply those rules and, as the recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities states, the decisions fall to the Member States meeting in the Council.
The Commission maintains its right to present proposals, but it is the Council, the Member States, who must apply the rules that they themselves have committed themselves to by approving the Treaty and the subsequent regulations.
We cannot demand that the Member States approve rules which they do not believe in themselves.
And, if experience suggests that certain rules require adaptation, it is better to adapt them than not to respect them, leave them unchanged and carry on failing to comply with them, which has unfortunately been the situation at times with the Stability and Growth Pact.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have ahead of us a debate that will be a difficult one and crucial to Europeâs future.
What is at stake is the credibility of the European Union, of its institutions and of the governments of the Member States.
Our experience to date with the single currency has been a good one; it is stable and it and the dollar are the most important currencies in the world, the ones on which all else depends, but the strength of a currency depends not only on the independence of the central bank and on price stability; it also, and in particular, depends on the governmentâs financial and budgetary policies.
An unsound budgetary policy can be an even greater danger in a currency union and damage the Community as a whole, that is to say, all who participate in it, particularly if certain larger countries fail to take the required and necessary action.
It is to prevent this that the Maastricht mechanism, the Stability Pact and the relevant regulations are there, and they have been breached in the past.
The fact is that, during economic boom periods, budget deficits were not reduced.
