And, if there are supplementary questions, they should be very brief, since it is a very broad question and it could take a long time, which would prevent us from moving on to questions to other Commissioners.
Question No 33 by (H-0805/01):
Subject: European Year of Languages The European Year of Languages 2001 is now coming to an end.
The Commission has co-funded 185 projects aimed at promoting the European Year.
Does the Commission consider that the objectives for the European Year are being met, and will it make a statement on how it considers the European Union can further develop the learning of languages in the EU, including the 60 plus European languages which are not official languages of the EU, and what measures it considers need to be introduced to help to further promote interest in and learning of languages among young people in the Member States?
As the honourable Member is well aware, the linguistic issue is one that is close to my heart, since I am a Luxembourger.
It is, moreover, one of the reasons why I have been so committed to the European Year of Languages 2001.
Something I did not realise at the beginning, when I launched this plan, was that there would be such enthusiasm, in all our Member States, about the linguistic phenomenon.
All sorts of organisations have lobbied, local councils have discussed language education, in short, there has been huge enthusiasm in all our Member States and this enthusiasm has also made itself felt at government level.
Some governments have adopted measures to give language learning greater priority in their curricula with effect from the 2001-2002 school year.
I shall be attending the Education Council on 29 November, and on that occasion we will be discussing the best way to follow up the European Year of Languages, because it is not enough to have launched an action and for that action to have been received with great enthusiasm on the part of the public; this action also needs to be followed up.
Let me reassure you that I shall be pursuing this course of action most conscientiously.
In concert with the Ministers for Education, I shall be making the frameworks of the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes more open to language teaching than has been the case in the past, and then I shall be presenting a report on the very practical way we have been implementing on the ground, and that is not all, because the year is not yet over and many projects are still underway, the lessons we have learned from the public. In this sense, when I talk about lessons that we have learned from the public, I am thinking of the entire linguistic panoply that we have in Europe, not only the 11 official languages, but also the sixty-odd languages spoken by Europe' s citizens.
Mr President, in deference to you and following the very comprehensive and satisfactory reply given to me by Commissioner Reding, I waive my right to a supplementary question.
We are going to ask the two supplementary questions, but we must try to be very specific.
May I frame a question which I hope the Commission will feel free to answer simply yes or no.
Wittgenstein told us that to choose a language is to choose a form of life.
I think, therefore, that if we lose languages we lose forms of life.
Does the Commissioner agree with me that it would be a tragedy for Europe if it loses languages such as Scots Gaelic, and Lowland Scots through neglect and that the lesser-used languages deserve greater encouragement than they get now?
- I fully agree with what the honourable Member has said.
Mr President, I was speaking in Luxembourgish and I would say that I have answered the question, having chosen to answer in Luxembourgish.
Very good, I believe that Mr MacCormick has received the reply he wanted.
Many months ago, in the run up to the European Year of Languages, plenary unanimously adopted a report by Mr GraÃ§a Moura which proposed that ancient Greek and Latin, as the root languages of today's languages, should be taught in secondary schools throughout the European Union, so that contemporary languages could be taught properly and in greater depth.
I should like to ask, first, if you passed this recommendation on to the governments of the fifteen Member States and if you have any information as to whether or not this matter is being pursued.
The Commission has funded some 200 projects in the course of the Year of Languages.
Some of these projects involved Greek and Latin.
The Commission has never, therefore, sidelined these languages.
It must, however, be pointed out, Mr President, that the Commission cannot set school curricula.
This is in the sphere of subsidiarity and, therefore, falls within the remit of the Ministers for Education.
This is why I conveyed to the Education Ministers all the discussions that took place in all the institutional frameworks, of which there were many, in order to tell them: 'Here you are, Europe' s citizens and their representatives want the linguistic element to become an important part of the education system' .
On the basis of all the reports available, at the end of November, the Ministers will have to decide and adopt a resolution, and then I shall ensure that this resolution is followed up with deeds, in other words that these ministers will make sure that their national or regional education systems, depending on the country, will provide the greatest possible range of languages, and from as early an age as possible.
I cannot, however, force a minister to put a particular language on his or her agenda.
I can only encourage him or her to do so.
Let me assure you that I am quite convinced that multilingualism represents Europe' s future, because it reflects cultural diversity, which is our true wealth.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
We now come to questions to Mr Liikanen, and I would invite him to take his place.
We now have no choice but to strictly obey our time limits.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 34, 35 and 36 will be taken together.
Question No 34 by (H-0786/01):
Subject: EU safety markings on instruments useable for torture I am concerned that EU Member States may be effectively allowing manufacturers of stun weapons (which are readily useable as instruments of torture) to use the European Commission CE 'safety' markings on their stun batons as a quality 'selling point'.
Can the Commission please indicate its position on the following points:
What is the process by which European CE standard marks are awarded and which Commissioner is responsible?
Can the Commission estimate how many stun weapon manufacturers are using the CE markings on their products?
Will the Commission take action to prevent stun weapon manufacturers using CE markings to promote the sales of their products?
Question No 35 by (H-0790/01):
Subject: Electric-shock devices The recent Amnesty International Report, Stopping the Torture Trade (2001), found that electric-shock devices have been used to torture or ill-treat people in prisons, detention centres and police stations in no less than 76 countries around the world.
The report also found that stun gun weapon manufacturers are advertising that these products have been 'awarded' the European CE standards mark.
I am concerned that EU Member States are effectively allowing stun gun weapon manufacturers to use the European Commission CE 'safety' markings on their stun batons as a quality 'selling point'.
Could the Commission clarify the process by which European CE standard marks are awarded, and explain to the European Parliament how many stun gun weapon manufacturers are using the CE marking on their products?
Could the Commission also take action to prevent stun gun weapon manufacturers using CE markings to promote sales of their products?
Question No 36 by (H-0801/01).
Subject: CE markings The Commission is aware that manufacturers and distributors of electro-shock devices (or 'stun guns' ) have been using CE markings to promote sales of their products, sometimes claiming that such marks constitute a 'guarantee' or an indication of product quality.
What steps is the Commission taking to ensure that CE markings are not used as a promotional device, both in the EU Member States and in third countries?
In cases where a product is manufactured, distributed and sold by companies based in countries not in the EU, can the Commission say what authority may challenge the validity of the CE mark, and prevent a firm from claiming that the CE mark on its product is a guarantee or an indication of quality?
Mr President, we have just been discussing minor languages. That is the reason why I am now using the Finnish language.
Regulations on the CE marking are contained in a Council resolution of 1990 on the various phases of the compliance assessment procedures to be employed when applying directives on technical harmonisation, and also in a Council directive issued in 1993.
The latter stipulates that the CE marking should be incorporated in a number of directives on technical harmonisation that apply to specific industries.
Conformity marking must be affixed to any product falling within the scope of a technical harmonisation directive providing for it.
It signifies that the product complies with the legally binding requirements of the applicable technical harmonisation directive.
The manufacturer is responsible for affixing the CE conformity marking, although the directives often require the intervention of a third party conformity assessment body.
Member States are responsible for the designation of such bodies in accordance with the applicable provisions of the directives.
A number of services in the Commission are responsible for technical harmonisation directives providing for the CE conformity marking, although most fall under the responsibility of the Enterprise Directorate-General.
However, the Commission does not directly intervene in the evaluation of product conformity, nor in the award of the CE conformity marking.
All the manufacturers of stun weapons falling within the scope of technical harmonisation directives providing for CE conformity marking must affix this marking to the relevant products.
The Commission does not have information about the number of manufacturers involved.
In an earlier reply to a written question in 1997, the Commission noted that a wide variety of equipment could potentially be used for purposes of torture.
However it is not always possible to determine in advance what use such equipment will be put to.
Therefore it is not feasible to apply different treatment under these directives to equipment that could potentially be used as an instrument of torture.
Nevertheless, to take account of the concerns of Members of Parliament and many others who have written to me on the issue, the Commission, in particular the External Relations DG, is currently preparing a proposal for a Council regulation concerning trade in equipment which may be used for torture or for cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
The specific aim of this regulation is to lay down Community rules to prohibit the export, sale and transfer to third countries and the import and purchase from third countries of such equipment.
This proposal should also deal, as appropriate, with electrical devices.
The Commission will no doubt have realised, from the shared language of these three questions, that they originate outside this House, and indeed Amnesty International has been pressing us on this point.
I need not underline the significance and weight that attaches to representations by Amnesty International.
I am very grateful indeed to the Commissioner for his assurance in response to the third part of the question about the steps that are being taken to try to bring this matter under reasonable control.
It is a kind of irony, is it not, that the original idea of the CE marking was to give assurances about safety.
Well, if I am at the wrong end of a safe piece of torture equipment, it is not a good place to be.
Can you give us any indication of a timetable for the progress you hope to make on this?
The inter-service consultation in the Commission is going on right now.
Different services are expressing their opinions, so it is at an advanced stage of internal preparation today.
Further to the comments of my colleague, Mr MacCormick, I too was very concerned.
That is why I tabled the question.
The Amnesty International Report, Stopping the Torture Trade (2001), found that electric-shock devices have been used to torture or ill-treat people in prisons, detention centres and police stations in no less than 76 countries around the world.
The report also found that stun-gun weapon manufacturers are advertising these products with the 'awarded' CE standard.
As Mr MacCormick has said, the CE mark was meant to be a sign of quality and safety, but in a torture weapon it is pretty perverse and sickening.
I welcome the Commissioner's proposal and would welcome further clarification of the timetable.
To push things a little bit forward: you have explained how the CE mark is awarded, but how are the recipients of the awards monitored and have any CE marks been withdrawn, to your knowledge?
I will make two comments.
Firstly, according to the Amnesty International report referred to, stun guns are not used for torture or ill treatment by either the police or prison guards within the EU.
It is in the export to third countries where problems may arise.
As far as the CE marking is concerned, if it is incorrectly affixed and the competent authorities of the Member States know this, they can intervene with the manufacturer or his representative within the EU.
So there are possibilities for national authorities to take action.
It is our responsibility to monitor it properly.
The third part of my question is slightly broader.
I ask by what authority can the validity of a CE mark be challenged?
The Commissioner has said in his first answer that it was not the Commission that would make a ruling and in his second supplementary he said that it would be the competent national authority.
Is there any system of mutual recognition of a ruling by one national authority, or would it be necessary to challenge the use of a CE mark on something like a stun gun separately in each of the 15 Member States?
Is there not some overall body that can say this is valid?
It seems to be a very long-winded process if it has to be challenged 15 separate times.
The market surveillance authorities of Member States are responsible for this.
We do not have any European body to do this.
Questions can, of course, be raised and we can consider how the provision of information between the authorities could be improved and progress made.
However, we must remember that it is only the producers that are involved and that there may not necessarily be producers in all countries.
Question No 37 by (H-0800/01):
Subject: Proposed ban on hydrofluorocarbons Can the Commission confirm what steps it is taking with regard to the proposed ban on hydrofluorocarbons by the Danish government?
Denmark notified the Commission in March 2001 of a draft regulation intended to prohibit the import, sale and use of three greenhouse gases - HFC, PFC and SF6 - and products containing them as from 2006, except in the case of certain products and applications for which a different timetable was laid down.
This notification, pursuant to Directive 98/34/EC, allows the Commission and other Member States to carry out a prior examination of a measure which might create obstacles to the free movement of goods in the internal market.
Several Member States have reacted to the Danish proposal.
The Commission for its part has sent the Danish authorities a letter whose effect was to postpone the possibility of adopting the proposal until 6 September 2001.
Denmark must reply to the Commission and inform it of the action it intends to take on the proposal.
The position expressed by the Commission can be summarised as follows.
Firstly, the Commission recognises the legitimacy of the objective of the Danish proposal.
The text is aimed at combating greenhouse warming and at contributing towards a 21% reduction of six industrial gases to which Denmark committed itself at the Environment Council in June 1998.
The European Union, for its part, undertook under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce by 8% the emissions of the six industrial gases in question produced by all its Member States.
In the light of information already provided by Denmark, however, the Commission considers that the proposal is disproportionate to the objective pursued and does not appear, therefore, to comply with the rules of the internal market.
The Commission notes that there are technical measures for monitoring these emissions and that those measures create fewer distortions of intra-Community trade than a total prohibition.
Moreover, the Commission is not convinced that safe alternative measures which are technically compatible with the systems currently used exist in all cases or will be in existence within deadlines laid down by the Danish proposal.
If Denmark does not respond to the Commission's request the latter, as the guardian of the Treaties, may, whilst the proposal has been adopted, initiate infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty.
First of all, I thank the Commissioner for a comprehensive and clear reply.
Clearly the Commission has taken action with regard to this issue.
It is of concern not only to myself but to a great deal of other people in the Union, particularly those in the airconditioning industry, who could see a potential change in their market happening far too rapidly for them to respond with technical measures on with any kind of appropriate economic steps.
I hope the Commission will continue to press the Danish authorities to be quite clear about their intentions.
I hope that the Commission will seek further contact with the Danish authorities over and above the letters they have already sent, to ensure that a reply is received quickly.
The amount of uncertainty at the moment with regard to the intentions of the Danish Government is creating ripples across the single market and raising doubts that are not conducive to the progressive restructuring of the air-conditioning market - and the other markets in which these gases are used - so that they can be phased out over an appropriate and sensible period of time.
I hope the Commission can assure us that action will be taken.
We will act accordingly and keep the European Parliament informed.
Question No 38 by (H-0821/01):
Subject: Swedish ban on cadmium in fertiliser At the end of this year the Swedish ban on cadmium in fertilisers will expire. The EU derogation will then run out and new arrangements cannot be prepared in time.
On its accession in 1995, Sweden was entitled to retain stricter rules than those applying in the EU for various chemicals and dangerous substances for four years.
The derogation for the Swedish restrictions on cadmium in fertiliser was extended by three years. This time is up at the end of this year, and no new arrangements will be ready.
The purpose of the derogation for a limited period was that the EU would, in the mean time, tighten up its rules on dangerous substances. This has been done in some cases, but not in respect of cadmium in fertilisers.
Pending common rules the stopgap solution must be to extend the derogation, which applies to Finland and Austria as well as Sweden. But not even that will be possible before the end of the year.
The Commission proposal has yet to be submitted, and it then has to be adopted by the Council and Parliament.
This will mean that there will be a period during which high cadmium content fertiliser could theoretically be sold in Sweden.
Does the Commission consider that Sweden may continue to apply its own rules during this interim period?
On 14 September 2001 the Commission proposed the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to fertilisers in which the derogation permitting Austria, Finland and Sweden to maintain national limits on the level of cadmium in fertilisers is extended up to 31 December 2004.
This proposal is now in the hands of the Council and Parliament for the codecision procedure.
The issue of cadmium in fertilisers has been under study by the Commission for a number of years, originally with the aim of introducing appropriate harmonising legislation before the derogation expires on 31 December 2001.
However, due to the complexity of the scientific issues involved, and the delays in the risk assessments carried out by the Member States, it was not possible to propose the required legislation at an earlier stage.
For this reason, the Commission decided to extend the derogation on cadmium in fertilisers for a further three years and it did so by including the appropriate provisions in a proposal for a regulation recasting the existing fertiliser directives.
As the major part of the text of the proposed regulation is not new, it is hoped that this proposal will be adopted rapidly, possibly at first reading.
The Commission is doing everything possible to facilitate rapid adoption of the regulation.
But if it turns out that it is not possible to have the proposed regulation in place before the end of the year, the Member States concerned can ask for a derogation under Article 95(4) of the Treaty.
I would thank the Commission very much for its exhaustive and constructive answer.
I would also thank the Commission for its proposal to the effect that the derogation on cadmium in fertilisers should be extended.
This derogation is very important to Sweden and also to other countries.
I obtained the impression that the special derogation rule mentioned last in the answer means that we have a sort of guarantee against having to receive fertilisers containing cadmium for a possible interim period before the new extension comes into force.
Is this view correct?
I am very familiar with this issue because it was already important in 1993 in the negotiations on enlargement with Finland, Sweden and Austria.
If the Council and Parliament do not manage to adopt the proposed legislation in time, it is important for these three countries to request a derogation.
I believe that all the Member States are likely to be prepared to approve this quickly.
It is the Commission' s responsibility to check that EC legislation is implemented carefully.
We have already produced a proposal.
We do not intend to take measures to cover only a specific short period of difficulties.
I believe we can find a good way of dealing with this issue.
Thank you for all your replies, Mr Liikanen.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 39 and 40 will be replied to in writing.
We now come to the last series of replies which will come from Mr Vitorino, on behalf of the Commission.
Questions to Mr Vitorino
Question No 41 by (H-0782/01):
Subject: Landing of large numbers of illegal immigrants in the Canary Islands What measures does the Commission intend to put forward to guarantee the integrity of Community waters around the Canary Islands, given the recent reports that motherships are being used to land large numbers of illegal immigrants from Africa on the Canaries?
The events referred to by the honourable Member demonstrate how important it is for the European Union to develop policies on preventing and combating illegal immigration and in particular irregular arrivals by sea.
Such policies need to be developed in partnership with the countries of origin and transit, and should also contain initiatives concerning the internal policies of the European Union.
The Commission is in favour of addressing migration in a comprehensive manner which implies that European Union policies should not only address illegal migration but also include initiatives to serve the socio-economic interests of countries of origin and transit as well as legal migration.
As regards the initiatives that need to be developed in partnership with the Mediterranean partners, it should be mentioned that illegal migration is one of the subjects currently being discussed within the framework of the Barcelona Process.
Both sides agree that multilateral efforts are needed to address illegal immigration from North Africa to the European Union.
The need to develop such a policy was underlined during the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs held in Brussels on 5-6 November this year.
This subject, including a number of concrete proposals on preventing and fighting illegal immigration, is also part of the draft regional programme on justice and home affairs.
Partners hope to adopt this programme during the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs to be held on 22-23 April 2002 in Spain.
Moreover, illegal immigration has been identified as one of the relevant themes for cooperation within the framework of the Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and Morocco.
During the Association Council of 9 October this year Morocco underlined its determination to fight illegal migration and the networks of traffickers and called on the European Union for support in its efforts.
The Moroccan authorities have presented concrete and ambitious proposals which aim to curb illegal migration, primarily by reinforcing the surveillance of Morocco's Atlantic and Mediterranean borders.
The Commission is currently studying these proposals and hopes to be in a position to respond to the proposals fairly soon.
The Commission has also decided to use the newly-created budget line, aimed at cooperation with third countries in the area of migration, to support financial projects to assist the Moroccan authorities responsible for border control and the fight against illegal immigration by providing training and technical assistance.
Thank you, Mr Vitorino, for the information you have given me.
The problem we have today is that every week approximately 100 illegal immigrants are reaching the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.
The operation seems to consist of getting hold of a supply ship from somewhere and than putting the immigrants onto small boats which take them to the coast.
Some make it, others drown, and the process goes on and on.
The Commissioner' s response is that there is no Community action, but that it is hoped that the neighbouring countries will control immigration.
But the fact is that this immigration is taking place. My supplementary question is as follows: a couple of weeks ago, the Mayor of the city of Las Palmas bought 200 one-way air tickets for illegal immigrants who were there and they flew to Madrid.
The Mayor of Madrid, who is from the same party, was not very happy.
Does the Commissioner believe that, if this immigration continues in this way, this would be the way to proceed, i.e. that the Canarian local authorities should pay for one-way tickets for illegal immigrants, because there is no more space on the islands, or do you believe that there is another possible solution, which would not make this air link for immigrants between the Canaries and the European continent necessary?
Mr President, I believe there has been positive development since our last dialogue here in Parliament on this issue.
Firstly, the Barcelona process recognised the priority nature of the debate and dialogue on the joint strategy of the European Union and the Mediterranean countries for fighting illegal immigration, which is not an isolated issue, but which must be integrated into the overall negotiation of the socio-economic development of the Maghreb countries.
Secondly, in the bilateral relations between the European Union and Morocco, the Moroccan authorities have sent us very specific proposals to strengthen the control of the Atlantic and Mediterranean borders.
And I stress the Atlantic border because, as well as being an innovation in relations between the European Union and Morocco, it is particularly important for the specific situation of the Canary Islands.
These are two positive points in the dialogue between the European Union and the countries of this region, and specifically, Morocco.
The third point, which I believe is new, is that there is no European policy on returning illegal immigrants to countries of origin or transit.
Therefore, the Commission intends to present Council and the European Parliament with a communication in the coming weeks on illegal immigration, which includes the issue of creating common standards for the policy on returning illegal immigrants.
When we have this communication, the honourable Member will be able to see the Commission' s ideas and contributions to this debate on the creation of a European policy on returning illegal immigrants, which is currently the exclusive competence of national or regional governments, as in the case of the Government of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.
Question No 42 by (H-0792/01):
Subject: Inclusion of religion on new EU identity cards The recent terrorist attacks in the USA have given rise to intense debate over whether more detailed information about an individual's characteristics and origin should be included on identity cards in the Member States of the Union.
The Greek press reports that this issue will be discussed early next December in Brussels at the meeting of the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the 15 Member States of the EU.
In the light of recent events, what is the Commission's view of including religion on the new identity cards to be introduced in the EU, as mentioned in the above reports?
Mr President, The European Commission has not submitted any proposal that seeks to have an individual' s religion included on his or her identity card.
In no Member State is the religion of an identity card holder mentioned on the card.
Lastly, the Republic of Greece has removed any mention of religion on identity cards and its initiative has been approved by the Greek Council of State, which considered that even the optional mention of religion on identity cards contravenes Article 13 of the Greek Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion.
The Commission' s position with regard to the indication of religion on national identity cards has not changed.
We would ask the honourable Member to refer in particular to the answer the Commission gave to the oral question H-0456/00 by Mr Alavanos.
Such a measure would not only breach an individual' s right to freedom of religion, but could also lead to discrimination, whether overt or covert, on the grounds of religion.
Thank you Commissioner for your reply, but you did not answer my question as to whether the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the fifteen are due to discuss the matter in their forthcoming meeting in Brussels.
That was my question.
My second comment is this: I absolutely agree on the sensitivity issue and, anyway, it is the common view in the European Parliament that the argument of religious identity should not be used as a factor which might cause problems if it is included; but I should like to ask if the European Union agrees that schools in the Member States of the European Union should do the same as the madrasses in Islamic countries and teach the view, and we see this on a daily basis, that Muslims should kill Christians and Jews and that this is a part of their religion.
I should like to ask, given that it is prohibited to teach Fascist or Nazi ideas about the annihilation of the Jews, if we can accept, on the contrary, that they be taught by Muslim fundamentalists in the light of the specific circumstances which have arisen following the attack on 11 September.
First of all, I have attempted to answer your question by saying that the Commission has not submitted any proposal on the matter.
This type of issue could not, therefore, be discussed at a Justice and Home Affairs Council on the basis of a Commission proposal.
As far as I am aware, nowhere on the agenda is a discussion scheduled on the issue that you raised at the meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs of the European Union.
With regard to what I believe is your second question, the content of education provided by schools in Arab countries, if I have understood correctly, I must, of course, tell you that the Union has no competence at all to interfere in the content of school curricula of third countries.
Furthermore, even in schools within the European Union, as you are well aware, Mr Marinos, this falls within the sphere of subsidiarity, which means that it is within the exclusive competence of each Member State government to define the content of school lessons, both in state schools and in private schools, within the European Union.
Question No 43 by (H-0794/01):
Subject: Application of fundamentalist laws within the European Union With regard to a number of violations of women' s rights within the European Union justified by fundamentalism, is the Commission in favour of taking appropriate measures to prevent the implementation of laws incompatible with human rights?
Can the Commission accept that basic human rights are violated on the pretext of religious beliefs, cultural practices or customs?
What steps will it consider taking in the short and long term?
The breaches of women' s rights to which the honourable Member refers come in different forms and should be considered on an individual basis.
Nevertheless, the Commission notes that, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is founded on the principles of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law, principles shared by all Member States.
As confirmed at the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, in 1995, the promotion and protection of women' s rights are an integral part of universal human rights.
In no circumstances can the Commission accept the abuse of an individual' s fundamental rights under the guise of religious beliefs, cultural practices or customs.
This position is laid down by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Articles 1, 4, 21, 23, 24) and by the other texts dealing with fundamental rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Articles 2 and 5 ) and the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 2, 3 and 14).
Item 18 of the Vienna Declaration, adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, lays down that all forms of violence towards women, including those resulting from cultural prejudice, must be eliminated.
Regardless of national protection of fundamental rights and of women' s rights in particular, it should be noted that the Community has been working on a policy to promote equality between the sexes since 1975.
Equal access to the labour market, to governing bodies and to social rights are equally important rights in this respect, as well as the right to protection from violence and sexual harassment.
There is a raft of Community legislative measures, directives, and even case law from the Court of Justice, underpinned by a specific legal basis, Article 141 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Incidentally, Article 3 of this Treaty imposes the obligation of integrating concerns about equality between the sexes into all Union policies.
Thank you very much for your reply, Commissioner. It shows that the Commission has understood the problem.
As a supplementary question, I would like to know whether, in accordance with your reply, you foresee, or support the idea, that women immigrants should be informed of their rights within the European Union.
Could women immigrants be provided with services to defend their rights?
I would like to hear your opinion and whether you have any intentions in this respect.
I am very happy to reply.
I will begin by saying that all the initiatives presented by the Commission in the field of asylum and illegal immigration contain specific legal rules to deal with the very special situation of women immigrants or women seeking asylum or refuge in the countries of the European Union.
We have ensured that in the questioning relating to the granting of asylum there are specific conditions for dealing with the situation of women.
For example, women who have been victims of sexual abuse can ask for the official doing the questioning to be changed, so that it is a woman rather than a man, because that will perhaps make them more feel more comfortable when recounting the story their asylum application is based on.
The honourable Member has raised a very important issue: informing immigrants of their rights.
Unquestionably, one of the Commission' s concerns is that it should be possible to provide immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers with the fullest possible information about their rights.
I believe that if the honourable Member examines the Commission' s specific proposals to the Council and the European Parliament, both with regard to immigration and to asylum, she will see that the idea of information about rights is present.
It is the responsibility of the national authorities of the Member States, as well as the non-governmental organisations which we work with very closely in these areas, to provide complete and full information on the rights which immigrants seeking asylum in the European Union can benefit from.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 44 to 84 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
(The sitting was adjourned at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Security of energy supply
The next item on the agenda is the report by Mr Chichester (A5-0363/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Commission Green Paper 'Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply' [COM(2000) 769 - C5-0145/2001 - 2001/2071(COS)].
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Commission on the Green Paper.
It is an excellent analysis of our energy supply situation in Europe.
I thank all my colleagues for the way in which they have contributed to my report to bring it to this stage this evening.
There are three main points in the Green Paper.
Firstly, the European Union will become increasingly dependent on external energy sources, reaching 70% by 2003.
Secondly, the EU has very limited scope to influence energy supply conditions so that it is on the demand side that the EU can intervene, mostly through promoting energy saving in buildings and in the transport sector.
Thirdly, in present circumstances the EU is not in a position to respond to the challenge of climate change and to meet its commitments, notably under the Kyoto Protocol.
One thing above all else is staring us in the face: the massive dependence on oil and on imported oil in particular.
For commonsense reasons of security of supply and protection of the environment, urgent steps should be taken to address this disproportionate dependence.
We cannot alter the fact of where the oil comes from, but we can do a number of things on the demand side, particularly in the transport sector.
Being dependent on imports is not necessarily a bad thing or economically inefficient, provided that the sources are diverse, no one supplier is dominant and we can produce sufficient goods and services to pay for them.
The Commission is correct to focus on demand management measures as a first priority and it is to be hoped that the Member States will pursue this approach vigorously.
However I do not accept the view that little or nothing can be done on the supply side.
In four areas the EU and Member States can be masters of their own destiny and make a real difference, both to security of supply and to protection of the environment.
Renewable energy sources are by definition indigenous supplies and we are correct to seek to increase their share of final consumption and electricity generation.
However let us be realistic,. Even if the ambitious targets for RES are met, they cannot be expected to replace any of the other energy sources completely or become the sole supplier of all our energy needs.
Nuclear energy is not popular in some quarters, but it supplies more electricity in Europe than any other energy source. It provides large volume, base load power and produces hardly any greenhouse gas emissions.
It is a safe and secure European technology, operated under stringent standards of regulation.
To deliberately deny ourselves this major source of electricity seems perverse in the absence of an alternative source of supply that can provide an equivalent volume.
Coal is a source of energy in decline in Europe, because of cost and environmental concerns. Yet it is an important indigenous resource which could be given a new lease of life with new technology to make it more efficient and less pollutant.
Furthermore, there is huge scope for gaining business in the rest of the world for European suppliers of equipment and systems, if the industry can seize the opportunity.
The fourth area is research work for future technologies and energy systems.
That is something Europe must do in order to safeguard future security of supply, employment and technology.
It seems obvious but needs repeating.
For all the above reasons, I also disagree with the view that the EU cannot meet its Kyoto commitments.
What is needed is realism on the nuclear issue, determined effort on clean coal technology, much encouragement of RES and coordinated demand management measures, as well as a sustained effort to inform public opinion about the necessity to stop wasting energy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur because the Green Paper on the security of energy supply is a wonderful document which is accompanied by a great report.
This document represents the first great step in Europe' s energy strategy; it offers a global view of the situation and raises all the relevant issues in this sector without reservations or conditions.
It states that our main problem is our supply, characterised by great external dependence, which will increase over the coming decades.
We must not leave aside environmental issues, however, which are inseparable from energy use.
In this respect, the directive adopted on renewable energy sources and the proposal on the promotion of biofuels are going to lead to great progress in terms of the diversification of the supply of clean energy, but they are not the solution in either the short or medium terms.
We must not hinder any type of energy, above all if it does not produce CO2 emissions.
The solutions, as the Commission points out very well, involve the diversification of supply sources, especially clean sources - those which do not produce greenhouse gases.
We must insist on technological research into energy sources, energy saving and the liberalisation of the gas sectors, in order that we may create a genuine internal energy market.
Furthermore, it would be good if the Treaties could include a chapter on energy.
Mr President, I too wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on the remarkable work he has achieved in analysing the issue and making a proposal and to say that I fully subscribe to his realistic and pragmatic approach, which maintains a crucial balance between the various sources of energy in implementing a European policy for energy supply.
This strategy is based on three complementary objectives, which I support: to reduce the European Union' s energy consumption by improving efficiency in certain sectors, particularly the construction and automobile industries; greater cooperation and investment for supplying countries, the diversification of energy resources with what I consider to be an essential objective: to reduce our dependency on oil.
I am also very pleased that this report explains how these objectives are to be achieved, namely by liberalising the energy sector, and I should like to reiterate the need not to give in to populist rhetoric, especially where renewable energies and nuclear energy are concerned.
We must remain realistic and understand that, without the contribution made by nuclear energy, the European Union will not be able to reach the objectives it has set for itself for reducing greenhouse gases.
Compliance with the Kyoto criteria must be one of the European Union' s priority objectives.
This is within our grasp if we demonstrate clear thinking in our choices and I also note that the options available in the field of taxation could prove to be powerful incentives, provided that they do not block the development of industry in the European Union.
Several amendments by the group of the Greens are counter-productive.
Instead of stimulating debate, they exclude from the outset various possibilities for energy choices and I feel they should be rejected so as to maintain the coherence of this report.
I hope that we shall do so, following the recommendations of our rapporteur.
Mr President, I like this report, and would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what he has said and, moreover, congratulate the Commission on its Green Paper, for, by it, the Commission is making us aware of our dependence on energy.
I can recall no debate in the past twenty years which has pointed out our dependence on imported energy in the way this Green Paper has.
Thank you again.
I would like to make two observations on nuclear energy.
Unlike many in my group, I take the view that it has a future.
I believe that we should also express that in a positive way.
Secondly, and this is perhaps even more important than the first point, I would like to observe that we have been given the task of developing a clean coal-fired power station.
I say this also with reference to our obligations as a result of Kyoto.
A clean coal-fired power station is not only of interest to Europe, but also to the world.
For let us not forget, as the Commission repeatedly emphasised, that in the next one or two generations, our dependence on fossil energy, at any rate worldwide, will be up to 80% and it is all the more important to master combustion technologies.
Mr President, I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Chichester, the rapporteur, for his significant work in preparing this matter.
As has already been stated here on previous occasions, the EU has only limited possibilities to interfere with the terms and conditions of energy supply.
Its chances of influencing the matter are restricted to the demand, and hence to the promotion of energy saving in the construction and transport industries.
The most important things, therefore, are to ensure the diversity of energy sources and an even distribution of suppliers of energy.
The availability of energy on a local level enhances the reliability of energy supplies, reduces dependence on imported energy and provides employment opportunities.
In particular, research into and the use of renewable energy sources must be promoted.
Responsibility for assuring the reliability of energy supplies is primarily a matter for national energy policies.
In order to enhance the reliability of supplies, it is also necessary to enter into agreements with other countries.
Also, energy projects that serve common European objectives are an excellent way of putting into specific terms the EU' s policies on the Northern Dimension.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my own position and that of the Greens have been discussed at length in other forums, and it is not possible, in two and a half minutes to present a detailed argument.
I shall, therefore, limit myself to asking the Commissioner a few questions.
First of all, it is important that this debate should be based on figures that are as precise as possible.
Even at an early stage of the debate, it was clear that the various scenarios available to the Commission are not really 'bottom up' scenarios, for energy efficiency, for renewables, or for cogeneration.
Furthermore, another problem is that, often, European scenarios do not correspond to the detailed scenarios drawn up by Member States.
In this context, I should like to know whether the Commission has begun working on this type of scenario with a view to the Barcelona Summit.
Secondly, energy efficiency is everyone' s birthright and everyone is insisting on this point.
What is the Commission' s view today, in concrete terms, on the important actions to be taken in the field of energy efficiency?
Parliament has put forward a number of alternatives, both in its Energy Intelligent Europe initiative, and in the action plan.
Nevertheless, since October, I have not seen the Commission making a genuine, sustained effort on this matter.
Thirdly, and this is a fundamental point, at the beginning of your presentation of the Green Paper, you promised us a real democratic debate.
Today, however, I see that the national round tables have not been entirely transparent and that, at European level, we are still waiting for an open and transparent debate to be held, something that you announced at the beginning as being a key element.
This is why I am asking you today, Commissioner, when will the round tables take place in civil society, amongst experts at European level?
We have been hearing about them for the last six months, and we have yet to see one take place.
I fail to see how the Commission can ensure that the Green Paper is followed up without organising these round tables.
Mr President, we are all aware that the European Union is highly dependent on external energy sources and has very limited scope to influence energy supply conditions.
That does not mean, however, that the European Union should not do more to promote the use of alternative energies and safer and cleaner energies.
It must also play a leading role in ensuring that all the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol are implemented.
The broader international community has not covered itself in glory in the efforts to ensure that the depletion of the ozone layer is stopped.
This report refers to the fact that nuclear energy in Europe will be playing a less significant role, following the decisions by five Member States to phase out the use of nuclear energy in the future.
It also states that no country in Europe is currently constructing new nuclear reactors.
It would be greatly appreciated in Ireland if you would inform the British Government and BNFL of this fact.
The British Government is currently planning the expansion, not a reduction, of nuclear activities at Sellafield.
The MOX facility at Sellafield means more nuclear reprocessing, not less, and nobody in the British Government and BNFL can deny this.
In Ireland we are sick and tired of BNFL breaching so-called high standards of regulation in their nuclear operations.
We cannot easily forget that BNFL falsified documents in relation to nuclear reprocessing contracts with the Japanese Government.
Where are the stringent standards of regulation, when you are dealing with a company that has falsified documents and has been shown time and time again to operate its affairs in this very slipshod manner?
I believe that BNFL is technically insolvent.
Its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste will be up to GBP 34 billion, while it has GBP 235m worth of shareholders' funds on its balance sheet.
What is the economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant, let alone the expansion of its nuclear operations in the future?
Are the British people fully aware of the extent of movements of nuclear materials by rail and sea in Britain?
In Ireland we are very concerned about the security arrangements at Sellafield in the light of the terrorist attacks in America on 11 September.
What assurances can the British Government give the people of Ireland that maximum security operates in the region?
We know the type of devastation that would occur if a twin towers type attack were to take place at Sellafield.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Green Paper on the security of energy supply is fundamentally to be welcomed.
It deals with an acute problem, one directly linked with the world political situation, which is more extensively unpredictable than ever.
Despite the very large number of good statements, I cannot share the rapporteur's view that nuclear energy is a practical alternative to energy imports.
The reasons are well known.
Only recently, a study was completed, commissioned by Parliament, which comes to the conclusion that the reprocessing plants at La Hague and Sellafield discharge as much radioactivity over seven years as was emitted in the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
The problem of the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste has not been resolved.
Nor does nuclear fusion offer a solution.
It therefore makes more sense to invest in safe and renewable energy sources than in nuclear fusion, which can achieve results in 100 years at best.
Mr President, if a good policy consists of producing complete and correct diagnoses and drawing up and implementing the corresponding solutions, there is no doubt that the Commissions' energy policy, promoted by Commissioner de Palacio, is an example of a good policy.
Within this good policy, the Green Paper provides a detailed and consistent analysis of the situation.
The Green Paper provides four fundamental messages: the message that there is excessive risk associated with dependence on external sources beyond a reasonable limit; the message that it will be impossible to comply with the Kyoto objectives if we remain bogged down in inertia and do not introduce corrective measures; the message that we have little room for manoeuvre in terms of supply policies and we must concentrate our efforts on demand policies; and the message that we need to provide our energy policy with a genuinely European dimension.
There is no doubt that this good policy goes further than diagnosis, because the Commission demonstrates that analysis and action can be simultaneous; and in Parliament at the moment we have the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings, the directive on transport, the directive on the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market and the regulation on cross-border exchanges of electricity.
For all these reasons, we must congratulate the Commissioner and I will not end without also expressly congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on his well-considered report and his receptiveness to the work of his colleagues.
Mr President, honourable colleagues, I praise the part of the report where this gas pipeline link with Russia has been incorporated in the Northern Dimension.
Honourable Member of the Commission, I propose that the Commission take swift measures in order to get this northern gas to balance our energy situation.
A great deal of attention in this presentation has been given to lignite.
I should like to ask, therefore, why peat, although it renews itself by a millimetre every year, has been completely forgotten; but then, peat is a type of vegetation found in poorer areas, while lignite is found in wealthier ones!
Nevertheless, peat is an important fuel component in remote areas, and it is also a regional fuel.
Forty per cent of all energy is spent in buildings, to heat them, to provide water, air-conditioning and lighting for them.
Already, during the previous energy crisis, we in Finland had to make modifications to buildings and we have managed to achieve good results in severe conditions.
We must greatly enhance energy efficiency in buildings because that is where there really is a great deal of room for improvement.
We shall have to gradually get accustomed to twilight conditions, for example.
It is great to live in semi-darkness and not always in the sunshine, in artificial light.
Mr President, successive petrol crises and the political and social fragility of the main oil-producing countries demonstrate the importance for our economies of the concept of self-sufficiency in energy.
Unless we show a solid political will to implement this self-sufficiency, our future lies in the direction of energy dependency.
If we allow things to continue the way they are, in 25 years' time, the European Union' s dependency on external sources of energy will reach 70% rather than the 50% we have today.
This realisation is what underlies the Green Paper.
If we wish to remain masters of our destiny, we must give priority to action on two fronts.
We must, on the one hand, encourage energy savings wherever possible.
On the other hand, we must make good use of our advantages, our skills and our resources.
With this in mind, and as the Green Paper and our rapporteur suggest, in a realistic rather than an ideological way, we should address the issue of developing nuclear energy.
This would require acknowledging that this form of energy cannot be faulted in terms of creating greenhouse gases but also that intensive research efforts are absolutely crucial if we are to make waste end products completely harmless, even if they only exist in low volumes.
Blaming reprocessing processes, as the WISE report, commissioned by the STOA and of highly dubious scientific merit, has done once again, will not help us find a solution.
Instead of allowing their technological lead to stagnate, the European countries should capitalise on it, particularly by focusing their research on improving reprocessing and recycling techniques.
The same research effort must be made in the field of biofuels, which have the merit of representing a major indigenous source of energy for us: these are non-polluting and offer promising outlets for our farming.
I am sorry that the Green Paper has not given this matter sufficient prominence.
Mr President, here we are, all worried about our dependence on imported fuels and energy, worried about the future of our economy and our jobs, and yet we have Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Kronberger bemoaning and belittling one of the main potential sources for meeting that problem, the nuclear energy solution.
Not only does it meet our energy and economic requirements, but it also meets our environmental requirements under Kyoto.
I would say - and Mr Chichester's excellent report bears this out - that unless we diversify our sources of supply of energy, especially by promoting indigenous supplies of energy, we will be in trouble with our economy and our jobs in the future.
Nuclear energy must play a significant part in both those ambitions: diversification and indigenous supplies.
There are other areas as well.
Mr Chichester mentioned coal.
We must promote clean technologies in coal.
In my part of the world, in Scotland, we would like to see more emphasis on promoting the oil and gas industries and their potential for better recovery systems, for exploration in marginal areas, for developing marginal oil and gas fields, for replenishing the reserves, the reservoirs in the south part of the North Sea, with gas in the meantime to protect us for the long term, and particularly transmission systems.
That applies not only to oil and gas but also to electricity.
In all these areas there is great potential for research.
That ties us into what we will discuss tomorrow in the Caudron report on the Sixth Framework Programme.
In all these areas, diversification, indigenous supplies and research will help us to meet our objectives.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wished to speak in this evening' s debate for two reasons.
First of all, I too wish to reiterate the importance of energy for Europe at a time when it is predicted that we will be 70% dependent on external energy sources in 2030 with clearly very little room for manoeuvre.
Next I wish to stress that I entirely support the approach of Mr Chichester, who is proposing both a diversification of energy sources and the development of all current sources without exception.
These proposals do, of course, make calls for liberalisation that I would probably have rejected had they appeared in isolation.
They are presented today, however, in a very broad range of demands, some of which are extremely bold and that is why I am able to support the package put forward by Mr Chichester, whom I wish to compliment on his report.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express much thanks to Mr Chichester.
Very rarely have I seen reports on energy of this calibre.
The Commission Green Paper was already first-rate, but with this supplement I believe we have many sound building blocks for the EU' s energy policy.
The greatest concern, of course, is, as Mr Chichester rightly points out, our energy dependence and the question 'what can be done about it?'
In my view, therefore, the well-balanced package in the Chichester report offers an excellent helping hand.
That means that one should not only consider natural oil and gas supplies, but also new forms of energy.
That one should consider renewable energy sources, but that one should not immediately rule out nuclear energy. Certainly with regard to the way in which its use can be made safer.
That is certainly feasible, and a great deal needs to be done yet.
One cannot say that nuclear energy is no longer acceptable, for then one gets into the greatest difficulty in Europe.
Something must also be done about those aspects which give rise to questions, of course, and on that score too, a great deal can be done, partly by finding intelligent solutions.
It has been said time and again: if there is no energy chapter, then nothing can be done.
Well, if I read Paragraph 21, which merely sums up all elements of the EU policy that can be achieved at the moment, that is an enormous agenda.
On that score, our Commissioner has a great deal of work to do.
Energy and geopolitical developments are closely related, particularly if we consider the developments after 11 September.
I therefore hope that the energy charter will be ratified at the earliest opportunity and that we will further develop the Caspian Sea Basin, for in that way, we can also slightly reduce Europe' s dependence.
I should like to finish off by congratulating both the Commissioner and our rapporteur on their sterling work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, and congratulating him warmly on the quality of his work and his efforts to produce a truly remarkable report.
I am aware of the scale of this challenge, given both the size and complexity of the issue itself and the number and diversity of the parties affected by it, inside and outside Parliament.
When I speak of the security of energy supply, I am not just referring to the physical supply, but also to energy systems and services which are ecologically, socially and economically sustainable.
In this respect, the security of energy supplies is essential to our development and security in the broadest sense, and recent events have demonstrated this even more clearly.
In fact, the tragic events of 11 September have highlighted our dependency on imports and the security of our installations.
The risk factor has multiplied overnight: the risk of premeditated damage to installations and infrastructures, the risk of volatility on the oil markets (with its prejudicial effect on the world economy) and the risk of interruption to our supply, both internal and external.
All of this means that it is more important than ever to provide appropriate measures for responding in the event of emergency.
It is encouraging to note from the responses to the Green Paper - more than 150 formal responses from different organisations of all types - the interest in issues relating to the security of energy supply throughout Europe and beyond.
I am pleased that the Commission' s analysis has received general support and that there is a considerable degree of awareness of the risks and problems faced by Europe in terms of guaranteeing the security of the energy supply and the international nature of those risks and problems.
This is reflected in the excellent report you have before you.
Many respondents have accepted that it is no longer possible to view energy supply as being independent from economic and environmental objectives.
Furthermore, a series of points in the report confirm that the European Parliament has clearly understood that there is a close link between these three objectives and the balance between them must be maintained.
The responses also confirm that European public opinion shares the Commission' s desire to confront the problem of climate change.
I am pleased to see that the European Parliament not only shares this concern, but that it has many ideas on the instruments which may help us to achieve this objective.
We will carefully study these ideas when we prepare our response to the consultation on the Green Paper.
I am not going to refer to it at the moment, but I would like to state very clearly, ladies and gentlemen, that the issue has given rise to debates in numerous national Parliaments, in some of which either I or high level officials from the Commission have participated, and in various universities, companies and non-governmental organisations, thanks, amongst other things, to the use of the Internet, which is a vehicle for openness within society, which, although not yet concluded, gives us an idea of the importance of this issue in all social fields of the European Union.
I am especially pleased to highlight the insistence on energy efficiency.
Like you, I believe that there are huge areas for possible improvements.
Your ideas are clear, in relation to the supply, in the context of the general recognition that there should be diversification of energy sources and supply origins.
As the report accepts, no individual source is completely lacking in drawbacks: they all have a cost and they all seem necessary.
With regard to coal, we have no alternative but to maintain basically subsidised production, at least for a certain amount of time.
In any event, the Commission' s proposed regulation confirms the importance we attach to own-production, but, above all, the importance of developing clean coal technology, which will allow us to use the only ample reserve of fossil fuel that the European Union has and promote the possibility of improving and reducing emissions internationally.
In this way, furthermore, we will maintain cutting-edge technology which offers all sorts of possibilities for our industry.
With regard to renewable energy sources, their importance will depend on the speed with which we can overcome a whole series of technical, social and economic obstacles.
The renewable energies directive, in relation to electricity, offers a guide for the direction we should take.
I know that we have been criticised for not making sufficient progress with this directive, but we are still trying to achieve our objective of doubling the percentage of renewable energy sources by the end of this decade.
In this respect, ladies and gentlemen, I refer to the previous intervention by Mr Souchet, we approved a few days ago an important and ambitious proposal on biofuels, which I hope will be approved and supported both by the Council and by Parliament.
With regard to nuclear energy, I am very satisfied with the frank and constructive exchange of views which the presentation of the Green Paper has made possible.
Some Member States have announced a moratorium or the progressive dismantling of their capacity for nuclear generation.
But one Member State has clearly stated its intention to go ahead with nuclear energy and to build a new reactor.
In any event, the abandonment of nuclear energy by some Member States may make a significant hole in our energy capacity and speed up the use of forms of energy generation which emit more greenhouse gases and, therefore, create problems in terms of our Kyoto commitments.
Although I have total respect for the decisions taken by the Member States, naturally, I believe that in these circumstances it is very difficult to confront the problem of climate change if we maintain a diversified energy base.
I believe that it is advisable to keep all the options open while the research into the management and elimination of waste is intensified and that is essentially the greatest problem with nuclear energy, given the progress made in terms of the safety of nuclear plants.
The debate on the Green Paper is still open.
It is therefore premature to anticipate its final conclusions.
However, the Commission is continuing, and will continue, to make proposals in the quest for new perspectives on energy supply.
We are working with you and the Council on the internal market legislation relating to one of the pillars of our strategy, in terms of both gas and electricity.
We must continue looking into the tax framework and pricing and, specifically, the guarantee of a mechanism for setting energy prices which reflects all the quantifiable external social and environmental costs.
Also in this field, we will shortly present certain energy network interconnections which will further integrate the national markets and therefore strengthen the security of the whole market resulting from this integration.
Furthermore, I hope soon to present a proposal on the combined generation of heat and electricity, which will allow us to make progress in the battle for efficiency.
Somebody said earlier that we have done little.
But I would remind you, ladies and gentlemen, of a proposal on buildings, which is very important (buildings represent 40% of energy consumption, and there are margins for savings of almost 20%), the proposal we will present to improve the current regulation on combined generation of heat and electricity, and a general proposal, a framework proposal, which will provide measures for all types of electrodomestic or electrical equipment within buildings.
With regard to demand, the benefits of energy saving which have been raised are clear and, I insist, we have presented many serious, solid and important initiatives, and we are going to present those which I have just mentioned.
With regard to transport and its effect on demand, the Commission makes a very detailed analysis in the White Paper, of which I have mentioned some important aspects when I spoke about the proposal on biofuels which was approved last week.
The report also clearly recognises the international nature of the challenges relating to energy supply.
The increase in our dependency, not only on oil, but also on gas, makes it essential that we study the broader geopolitical repercussions of the current market situation.
The Commission intends to produce a report on this issue next year; of course, we would like to use the opportunities offered by the Sixth research and development framework programme and the successor to the energy framework programme as instruments for supporting our strategy.
Ladies and gentlemen, the security of the energy supply is an inextricable element of a balanced social and economic development.
The debate on the Green Paper has highlighted, as never before, the delicate interrelationship between energy needs, environmental objectives and balanced economic development.
Many of the ideas presented in this report may be important elements in guaranteeing the security of our energy supply.
As I have explained, some of them have already been implemented, but they are not yet a defined strategy.
Europe needs to establish a stable long-term framework to guarantee the security of energy supply, which can deal with changes in international economic and environmental circumstances, and which creates a firm basis for the future role of Europe on the international stage.
Bearing this in mind, I would like to use the European Council in Barcelona next spring as a launch pad for a European strategy on energy supply, and you can rest assured that, in drawing up this strategy, the ideas contained in this report will be taken into account.
I hope to have further opportunities to debate this idea with you.
I would like to congratulate Mr Chichester once again on his wonderful report and the work he has done.
I also congratulate and thank Mrs Ayuso for her opinion on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and I thank everybody who has spoken on this report and this debate.
I promise that we will continue working on it when the conclusions closing the general debate on the Green Paper produced by the Commission are finally presented.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mr Turmes, on a point of order.
I asked the Commissioner two very specific questions and I am rather disappointed that she has not managed to give me an answer.
One question concerned possible scenarios and the other concerned round tables.
Sir, that may well be the case, but that is not a point of order.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Chemicals strategy
The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0356/2001) by Mrs SchÃ¶rling on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy [COM(2001) 88 - C5-0258/2001 - 2001/2118(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the strategy for the future chemicals policy, which we are to discuss and adopt positions on in this debate, is extremely urgent and important because it will form the basis for a draft legislative text and for new framework legislation for the EU' s chemicals policy.
Gratifyingly enough, the European Council decided, at the Gothenburg Summit in June, that a new chemicals policy would have to be introduced by 2004 at the latest and that this time limit would have to be respected.
The Commission must therefore table its draft legislation in the course of 2002.
The debate on deficiencies in the current chemicals policy has been going on for quite some time.
Among the criticisms made is the fact that there has been a lack of information about the majority of the 100 000 existing chemicals, that the work has proceeded far too slowly and that the present policy has, in practice, failed to protect human health and the environment.
The Commission' s survey of the legislation on existing substances shows that human beings and the environment are potentially exposed to a large number of chemical substances whose dangerous characteristics are not known.
We know that the human body contains measurable quantities of 350 chemicals.
We also know that the quantity of brominated flame retardants in breast milk has been increasing each year.
Even if PCB and DDT are now surrounded by tough restrictions, it remains the case that high quantities of these chemicals are still found in the fatty tissue of human beings and animals throughout the world, even in the Polar regions where these chemicals have not been produced at all.
New chemicals are added to the list, for example PFOS or perfluorooctane sulfonate, which does not bind in fatty tissue but, rather, in blood protein.
These chemicals are found in a number of products, for example shampoo.
Through the regulation adopted by the Council in order to overcome the deficiencies, detailed risk assessments should be carried out and recommendations made as to measures, etc. which might be taken.
We now know that there are only 140 chemicals on the 'priority list' and that risk assessments have been completed in only eleven cases.
Even worse is the fact that not a single measure has been decided upon in order to reduce the risks, in spite of its having been shown that such measures are needed for the majority of these substances.
The Commission' s White Paper, produced by the Environment and Enterprise Directorates-General, is trying to create a high degree of health and environmental protection, at the same time as maintaining the competitiveness of the European chemicals industry.
This is done, for example, by saying that chemicals policy must stimulate technical innovation and the development of safer chemicals.
In common with the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I believe that the strategy should be focused on the protection of the environment and of human health and that the point of departure for the Commission' s White Paper should be the debate in the Council and the growing unease about the fact that current chemicals policy cannot offer adequate protection of the environment and of human health.
Naturally, the economic and social aspects must be accorded a fair degree of importance as parts of a strategy for sustainable development.
If a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy voted for a proposal that goes further than the Commission' s and shows how an effective, open and consumer-friendly control of chemicals should look in the future, that is completely in line with, and receives strong political support from, the European Council Summit in June when the conclusions drawn by the 15 Member States were significantly stricter and more far-reaching than the Commission' s proposal.
There is therefore an express political will to adopt the policy for a new chemicals strategy proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, above all when it comes to the scope of the REACH system.
As currently desired by the industry and the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, only CMR 1 and 2 and POPs are to be included which, in that case, cannot be said to be much in the way of a strategy for the future.
Even among industrial companies there is a desire to go further, for a competitive industry cannot be achieved through the unacceptable situation we have at present but only by producing safer chemicals and chemicals that protect human health and the environment.
I therefore believe that we should stick to the compromise achieved between the various political groups and to the proposal backed by the majority.

, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 11 October the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted my opinion on the White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy.
Harmonisation of chemicals policy across the EU is especially important, but the following three aspects are no less significant.
First, the practicability of the registration system.
The amount of data to be collected means we must keep a sense of proportion in order that the system is not congested from the start.
The principle of proportionality is also to be applied to the required definition of use, so that the manufacturer of a product must be able to restrict the definition to actually intended purposes.
Secondly, a clear definition of the substitution principle.
The definition of this principle varies from one Member State to another, if they have one at all.
If it is to be laid down in Community law, it will have to be formulated in a consistent and unambiguous way.
Thirdly, appropriate protection for test data.
Insufficient account is taken of the need to guard commercial confidentiality.
At the same time, the security data document should be under copyright in order to protect the applicant against misuse of the data obtained.
Mrs SchÃ¶rling's report is to that extent unbalanced.
It takes too little account of the interests of medium-sized chemical businesses and of the industry as a whole, something that can lead to distortions in competition.
I therefore recommend adoption of the amendments resulting from the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which contribute to a better balance of the interests of all interested parties.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. (DE) Mr President, the Commission's White Paper has the ambitious intention of comprehensively modernising EU law on materials and products.
It is fundamentally right to unite, in legal terms, old and new materials and combine them with standardised registration and evaluation procedures for all materials over one tonne per annum in a strict time concept by 2012.
This fundamental line taken by the White Paper strengthens sole responsibility for chemicals management in the industry and takes past experience with individual items of legislation as the basis for proposing a comprehensive reorientation.
Parliament's Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has adopted this report by a large majority.
The consequences of the White Paper's proposals for competitiveness, international trade, employment and medium-sized businesses had not previously been sufficiently examined, and further studies are still required.
In addition, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy expressed the view that legislation should be made to apply not to the attributes of materials but only to actual, scientifically verifiable risks.
Amounts are merely auxiliary quantities.
What is crucial is the amount of risk involved.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore demands a two-stage screening process.
We expressly reject the following suggestions made by the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy: that sensitising substances be included in the approval procedure; that approval be granted only for a limited period; that the registration requirement should apply to all amounts under one tonne; that the public be given unrestricted access to all data; that there should be extensive prohibitions on materials; that extensive data and evaluations to be submitted by the industry should be subject to additional examination by peer review; and a number of other points.
A massive extension of the approval procedure would run quite counter to our common goal of reducing animal experiments.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore takes a rational line, as demanded by both trades unions and employers in the European chemical industry.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, chemical substances and products are a part of our daily life today.
To a large extent, we could not manage in our society without them.
For example, we use cleaning materials, cosmetics, plastics, medicines and much more besides, almost without thinking about it.
It is though, equally self-evident that we must know what effects the use of these substances and products has on our health and our environment, and so we need a practical and flexible system to monitor and evaluate existing substances and those materials that may be created in the future.
The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats takes the view that the White Paper must do away with the inadequacy of European chemical policy and give first priority to protecting human beings and the environment, as well as to sustainable development, without thereby jeopardising the competitiveness of the chemical industry and of SME's in the global market.
The chemical industry is the third largest processing industry in Europe, and, according to the Commission's figures, provides 4.7 million jobs in almost 40 000 firms, most of them small and medium-sized enterprises.
With this report, we are deciding on their future.
The SchÃ¶rling report clearly focuses on the ecological dimension, and there are grounds for concern that the excessive demands, on the authorities as well, will paralyse the whole system and condemn it to failure from the outset.
We in the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats therefore cannot go along with the obligatory registration of materials of which less than one tonne is produced per annum; the extension of the approval procedure; the substitution and prohibition of substances only on the grounds of their characteristics; an additional peer review process; impracticable duties of notification and databases.
It is our opinion that only a balanced system can ensure the production of high-value products within the European Union, the safeguarding of jobs in it, and the improved protection of people and the environment.
Mr President, I welcome the Commission proposal on chemical policy.
It is long overdue.
For too long we have seen a gradual increase in allergenic reactions and even worse human health effects and at the same time a series of undesirable effects on the general environment.
If we adopt this report, we will be taking a first step towards asking a very important question: whether the 30 000 chemicals in general use today and the 100 000 components that they are used to make are in any way responsible for the things we see happening to human health and the world around us.
There is no doubt that we will have to make a very wide-ranging examination of the chemicals in use today and those that we might want to introduce into our environment in the future.
We will have to start considering issues and areas that we have not previously considered.
Socio-economic issues will be particularly important.
The full effects of changing our chemicals policy and strategy will be wide-ranging across the whole of Europe.
However, one would hope that, by taking a serious step forward tonight and starting to formulate a new structure for chemicals policy, we will arrive at a policy which is truly sustainable in the long term; which brings genuine and positive benefits to society as a whole; ends any negative impacts upon human health in the environment and stands as a shining example to other parts of the world as to how they should progress in future.
So tonight we are taking a step not just towards a cleaner and better European environment and a stronger and more prosperous chemical industry in Europe but also towards a healthier and better future for the whole world.
Mr President, I hope the Commissioner has caught up on her sleep after another succesful climate change conference.
It all seemed very easy when the Commissioner first put the plan to us.
She said that we use tens of thousands of chemicals in Europe.
They are essential to our way of life but there is very little public information about them and the real fear is that some of them may be causing long-term damage to the environment and human health.
So we must get the information, we must carry out the tests and, while keeping the good and maintaining a strong European chemicals industry, we must identify the bad and weed them out.
But that was a few months ago.
In the meantime all of us have learnt a great deal from the lobbyists about the difficulties of putting the policy into practice, as is well illustrated by the difficulty of identifying even the number of chemicals we are talking about.
Sometimes we hear of 30 000, sometimes of 100 000 - quite a big difference.
At least the chemical industry says it is in favour and supports the Commission's objectives, but it warns that the proposals are impractical, will increase bureaucracy and will be immensely costly.
The testing regime, it says, will cause paralysis of the whole system, especially if we extend the requirements.
Millions of animals will be killed painfully and perhaps unnecessarily in order to meet the testing requirements.
All these concerns need to be taken into account.
When the draft directive comes before us, I will be listening very carefully to industry's complaints.
I recognise that in environmental matters we often hear industry crying wolf, but even so we must ensure that new requirements placed upon the companies are realistic and practical and that they enhance rather than damage a very important business.
This is only a White Paper.
In making recommendations, I support Mrs SchÃ¶rling in asking the Commission to strengthen its environmental commitments, rather than relax them.
But in reality we will probably end up following the Council of Ministers in passing the buck back to the Commission, asking you to find a way around the obstacle course and giving an absolute guarantee that we will criticise you, whatever proposals you come up with.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report is a milestone for environmental and consumer protection, areas in which chemical policy to date has completely failed.
Hundreds of thousands of chemicals have been on the market for decades and we do not know in what quantities they are available and what risks they present.
It is as if the precautionary principle was trodden underfoot; these chemicals were, without controls, tested on us and on the environment.
Amounts totalling under 1 000 tonnes per annum are not even notifiable, regardless of the dangers involved.
We have, then, for decades been playing Russian roulette with our health and with the environment.
We must put an end to this frightening, indeed irresponsible, situation as soon as possible.
If the industry does not put the data on the table within a specified period of time, these chemicals will no longer be allowed to be put on the market.
I hope the majority in this House will not allow itself to be made the lackey of the chemical industry, for the aggressive advertising of the German chemical industry in accusatory mode has clearly shown it to be too helpless and incapable of presenting valid arguments at a political level.
Complaints about shop closures, raised even by Members of this House, are a positive joke in view of the way the chemical industry, while increasing production in real terms by 25% over the past ten years, brought about a reduction of 14% in its workforce - without a chemical policy along the lines proposed by the White Paper, and we know all too well that the chemical industry only has the chance to offer long-term employment if it offers for sale products that do not harm the environment.
Only then can the chemical industry's position be strengthened.
We will fight for the new chemical policy as the central point of European policy on the environment.
I believe this is about putting an end to decades of the 'ostrich with its head in the sand' policy and implementing a chemical policy which is effective and has a future, a policy which puts health interests and the precautionary principle in first place.
Mr President, the EU' s chemicals policy requires a thorough renovation and a single, new and comprehensive set of regulations.
Mrs SchÃ¶rling' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which we are now discussing, provides an excellent point of departure for a new chemicals policy.
With this report as a basis, the Commission should quickly be able to table proposals for a new directive.
The strength of the report is that it really puts the environment and public health first, and that must be our main task.
We also believe that industry has a lot to gain from strict regulations in as much as they encourage modern manufacturers, promote innovation and mean that old chemicals that have not been investigated are no longer promoted, as they are in fact at present.
The following points in the report are especially important to our group.
Firstly, the proposal as to which chemicals are to be included under the requirements for registration, evaluation and authorisation should be made more comprehensive, as proposed.
Secondly, tough requirements should be made of chemicals, and of products containing chemicals, when these are imported.
Thirdly, everything must be done to minimise the number of animal experiments.
Fourthly, the substitution principle should be made a crucial component of chemicals policy.
Great importance should be attached to this so that safer alternatives will always be sought.
Fifthly, use of the most hazardous chemicals of all should be considerably restricted.
Our group is pleased with the committee' s proposals.
We nonetheless have some minor amendments we believe could further strengthen the report.
We wish to emphasise the demand that it should be those departments of the Commission with responsibility for environmental protection that should approve new chemicals.
It is also a question of further tightening up the requirements made of the most hazardous chemicals of all.
In the committee, the rapporteur chose a very sound and open method of working which gave all the political groups the opportunity to compromise at an early stage, and I think that that is something positive.
Mr President, it is high time the chemicals strategy were reviewed, for only 11 of the 140 substances on the priority list have been assessed to date.
However, we should take care, in our enthusiasm, not to bite off more than we can chew.
Of course, I too would welcome a complete overhaul, but in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission has already warned that if the chemical substances policy is overloaded, the ship will sink.
That seems to me reason enough to remove some of the cargo from the ship.
In concrete terms, I mean that the substances below one tonne should remain outside the scope of the new policy for the time being.
Furthermore, the ship is reeling from side to side, swaying from a stringent policy on the one hand to the wish to take generous account of social and economic effects on the other.
This half-heartedness can be avoided by prioritising the most harmful substances.
In that way, the benefits for the environment and public health will be the greatest, and the social and economic effects on industry will automatically be contained.
We therefore no longer need to pull the wool over the eyes of industry by positing that the new policy will improve innovation and businesses' competitive edge.
Finally, I am of the opinion that the generally recognised criteria for harmfulness, namely dosage and use, need to be maintained.
Mr President, the principles underlying the strategy for a future EU policy on chemical substances, namely to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment while ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market and stimulating innovation and competitiveness in the chemical industry, receive my unqualified support.
However, I am struggling with the White Paper and also with Mrs SchÃ¶rling' s report, because I believe that the White Paper is not effective on a number of scores.
Although Mrs SchÃ¶rling has worked hard, she too is complicating matters.
Let me therefore give a few examples of a system which, in my view, could function.
I know that the Commissioner too has been informed by the Dutch government about where industry initially refused point blank to adopt the new system entitled SOMS. However, industry and the government are now very happy with this system.
Allow me to give you a few examples and in doing so, expose a few weaknesses in the White Paper.
First of all, the industry' s responsibility.
Lip service is being paid to this, for the White Paper is limited to risk assessment data and to providing information to downstream users.
Responsibility should really be placed with industry, and that means, therefore, that it must also be able to take risk-restricting measures off its own bat.
The entire system proposed by you, including heavy-handed interference from the powers that be, has proven that it does not work.
That is why a change is needed.
Secondly, the reach system should be modified.
In any case, a possibility for rapid screening must be introduced.
Rapid screening can also be done on the basis of a harmfulness profile, for the tonnage is not a determining factor.
My fellow MEPs and I have tried to include these provisions in amendments, and I hope that at least Amendments Nos 102 and 103 will be adopted accordingly.
Mr President, Europe needs a new strategy for dealing with the issues surrounding chemicals.
We are concerned here with the health of all of us, as well as with that of future generations.
The Commission' s White Paper is a good point of departure for continued work on the strategy.
Mrs SchÃ¶rling' s report creates good conditions for bringing about necessary changes.
It is exceptionally important that Parliament adopt the report in such a form that it have the same thrust given to it by the rapporteur.
In the debate that took place while the report was coming to fruition, many objections expressed the fear that stricter regulations would put jobs and economic development at risk.
That is an anxiety which must, of course, be taken entirely seriously but, at the same time, it is necessary to raise one' s sights and look beyond jobs and the economy.
Economic growth and access to jobs can never be invoked to prevent necessary requirements concerning the use of chemicals, work on achieving sustainable development and a high level of protection of public health and of employees.
What is the use of jobs and a sound economy if we poison our countryside and destroy what is essential for future generations?
We have only one earth and we must take care of it.
We often say that we have the earth on loan from our children.
If we are to be able to hand it over in good condition, it is high time that we modified our way of life.
It is in a number of capacities that, as human beings, we are affected by the ways in which chemicals are used.
We are affected as employees and as consumers, and we are affected by persistent and bioaccumulative substances which can give rise to hypersensitivity, hormone changes, cancer etc.
The regulations which now have to be devised must, in the first place, be aimed at protecting individual people and not, as now, companies' interest in making profits.
A society characterised by sustainable development also provides lasting employment, a sustainable living environment and people able to have faith in the future.
In that way, a better world can be created.
Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the European Union must, with the passing of time, equip itself with a new chemical policy.
The one we have at present is unsatisfactory.
There had been advance indications that there would be a vast array of tests, but the overall test result is unsatisfactory.
The Commission's principled involvement is therefore to be welcomed even if we cannot support every aspect of its proposal.
There is, though, something of which I must warn you. You, too, Commissioner, are on my mind today in particular.
When you introduced yourself to us, you announced that the experience of your own country led you to want to establish a new policy on chemicals in Europe.
My impression is that today, like Goethe's Faust, you have conjured up something you cannot control.
What the rapporteur, Mrs SchÃ¶rling, has presented is not a proposal about environmental policy.
It is a classic export of pollution, as many enterprises that are already being marginalised by the European Union will move themselves very quickly even nearer to its boundary and indeed also outside the EU in order to save themselves these unimaginable impositions.
This cannot be a modern environmental policy.
Rather, we must take this branch of industry with us in integrating high but feasible standards.
I believe that the aspects already mentioned - temporary approval, obligatory regulation under 1000 kilos, the principle of substitution and regulation of use as well - are an attempt at multiple protection, for every owner of a medium-sized business is being enslaved, because only industry can now meet the obligations which your proposal envisages.
I believe that this proposal should be sent back to the Commission, but certainly not to the rapporteur, whom I otherwise greatly respect and who, on this occasion, has thoroughly disappointed me.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, particularly my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, let me beg you, as a matter of urgency: can we please turn it down a bit?
This is about a White Paper, and I believe we should not be trying to engage in muscle contests, which are in one way or another politically motivated, on the basis of this White Paper.
At some future point we will be having the legislation, when we can do the real fine-tuning.
It is a pity that some of the earlier speakers are no longer here; they will not hear what I have to say.
But perhaps someone will be able to tell them.
We have submitted amendments with the very same things in mind, which state that the duplication of work is to be avoided.
Amendment No 97 is to remove peer review in order to simplify the procedure.
We have already in committee brought in submissions on behalf of medium-sized businesses to the effect that there should be pilot projects, in which medium-sized businesses could deal with registration simply and effectively.
We want simple administrative regulations and have provided for the employees, who will be directly affected - the employees and the members of the European works councils - to be involved in the decision-making process.
These demands have been met, and I do not know why this all has to be played up and why the fate of the chemical industry has to be dependent on it.
We are dealing here with a White Paper, in which nothing is finally decided.
I cannot understand it.
We have also included a subparagraph relating to substitution principle, which states that substitutes, too, have to be subjected to complete life cycle analysis before they can be used.
So if we do not accept that and say, 'that is the way to do it' then I do not know what we are supposed to do next.
And this one tonne: I simply cannot understand the argument that substances under one tonne are intrinsically less dangerous than substances over one tonne.
Even they should be registered.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the enormous amount of work she has done, but I do not congratulate her on the content of the report.
Mr Lange, I know we are talking about a White Paper, but this White Paper sketches a mere initial outline of our views, and when we in the PPE-DE express our opinions, we like our subsequent actions to be consistent with them.
It is no good saying one thing now and then doing the opposite when the time comes to legislate.
Let this be clear: this is a major sector of industry, the leading sector or one of the leading sectors in Europe. This sector employs millions of people and includes tens of thousands of small businesses.
However, it is also a sector that is causing concern in society because there are 100 000 unknown chemicals being used, and it is therefore right that we should respond to this concern.
That is why we consider the Commission' s proposal and the White Paper to be a good starting point, in that it gives us a procedure, a goal and targets to achieve.
We welcome the industry' s willingness to bear the cost of this operation of sifting the good chemicals from the bad and providing information.
However, what we do not support is the unnecessary expansion, the complicated procedures of expansion, the extension to too vast a range of substances, the use of scientific grounds which are too vague as the basis for forming opinions, which is what the SchÃ¶rling report advocates.
This, ladies and gentlemen, not only harms the chemical industry but also jeopardises the environmental objective we have set ourselves.
As the Romans used to say, 'The best is the enemy of the good' .
Let us steer clear of such at times populist, at times fundamentalist attitudes, for our shared, common objective of protecting health and the environment in a sustainable economy against precisely an excess of, so to speak, overexhaustive initiatives, is in jeopardy.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to welcome the White Paper.
In reality, we are aware of the effects upon the environment and public health of only a very small proportion of the hundred thousand chemicals that exist.
I think it is a serious problem for the EU' s environmental and public health policies that a combined strategy for chemicals policy was not implemented many years ago.
Now, however, it has arrived as something I very much welcome.
I should also like to thank Mrs SchÃ¶rling for an outstanding report which tightens up the Commission' s proposal in some crucial ways, ways which, in my opinion, could well be adopted without changes.
That is not, however, going to happen.
The industry, and others, have also made their influence felt here in Parliament, and the result we shall adopt tomorrow will not be quite as good as it might have been.
I should like to point out some of the substantial improvements contributed by Parliament.
We are having a very great deal of emphasis placed upon the precautionary and substitution principles.
This constitutes a reversal of the burden of proof.
With what is also the Commission' s point of departure, we are now acquiring a stricter system - with, importantly in my view, some clear deadlines - for regulating, phasing out and authorising chemicals.
It is also important that we should have an extended list of hazardous substances that are to be phased out.
Finally, I should also like to highlight the issue of animal experiments.
I think that, in this area, a very important contribution has been made, including by the Liberals, to getting the issue of restricting animal experiments onto the agenda. That is something I am very pleased to be able to support, including in the vote tomorrow.
There are many substantial advances which ought to be included in the forthcoming legislation, and I shall therefore merely ask the Commissioner, finally, when the Commission' s proposal for joint legislation is to be tabled?
I understood it was to have been early next year, but it would be splendid if we could have a fairly clear date made known in this House today.
Mr President, I too appreciate the work of the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on a genuinely advanced strategy.
Parliament is thereby making a major contribution, applying the approach of sustainable development in all its inseparable dimensions, environmental, social and economic, to the chemical industry.
In this report, protecting the environment and safeguarding human health go hand in hand and it is intended to maintain the competitiveness of the chemical industry through incentives to support innovation and facilitate the gradual replacement of the most hazardous substances.
Other improvements can be included tomorrow if we adopt the amendments tabled by Mr Lange and other Members, benefiting smaller business, in particular.
This is a prevention strategy, then, and not just a strategy of acting in retrospect, when the damage has already been done, but it is also a strict, rigorous strategy.
That is why the reference to environmental responsibility must be accorded due importance. This is a principle which must also be recognised as important in those countries in which safeguarding health and safety in the workplace and protecting the environment are not always given due consideration.
I refer to the recent decision which failed to condemn the Porto Marghera petrochemical plant and let the directors of Montedison Enimont get off scot-free, even though they were responsible for the death of 157 workers and the disastrous pollution of the Venice lagoon and the surrounding land, a decision against which the Italian government should appeal.
Mr President, we need to be clear that chemicals can be good for you.
You only have to look around this chamber at the carpets, chairs, desks, paint, steel and glass to see how much we depend on them.
However they can also be bad for you.
Some insecticides, flame retardants and even hair sprays can be a danger and we need to be wary of them.
Chemicals can certainly present a risk if they are mishandled and they can need regulation.
Sometimes they need to be phased out or banned.
However, I fear this report goes too far too fast and so, in some respects, does the White Paper.
I know it is only the White Paper stage, but we need to look carefully at some of the potential costs, said to be some EUR 8bn to European industry.
A massive cost to animals has been referred to.
The BUAV estimates 2 123 animals per high production volume chemical test.
We are told that 12.8 million would be at risk if one were testing on 30 000 substances and the report goes up to 100 000.
Of course not all those would need animal tests, but a substantial number would.
One other example of how this report overreacts: paragraph 38 sweeps up all CMR category 3 substances and designates them of very high concern.
Just take one example from one industry, the raw materials for flexible foam.
The finished product is in no way a hazard and provides comfort and safety for consumers in products from furniture to car dashboards.
That is an industry employing 360 000 people, 96% of them in small- and medium-sized firms.
They could be at risk.
The aims of the White Paper are right: we want to improve knowledge about chemicals and we want a safer world.
We should prioritise areas for action.
That means rigorous management of risk, without damaging unnecessarily the many small- and medium-sized firms that make up the chemical industry which has its risks but also brings jobs, benefits and safety for our citizens.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are apparently all in agreement, for I notice that even the PPE-DE believes that the current chemical policy is characterised by a lack of substance, too much bureaucracy, powerlessness to acquire knowledge about all substances and also the incapacity to take measures.
That is why support for the White Paper is so important, but even more so, support for the improvements which are being proposed in the SchÃ¶rling report.
Pressure from the chemical industry has been enormous, particularly in the last few days.
Apparently, it does not lack the necessary financial resources to set up big campaigns and to portray a large majority of this Parliament as a bunch of eco-fundamentalists.
But I believe that the outcome of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was balanced and that it therefore deserves every backing tomorrow.
I should like to mention a few essential points.
I am of the opinion that, in the long term, all substances will need to be registered, but that in the medium- and short-term, priorities will need to be set; the latter, however, not simply on the basis of production volumes. Smaller volumes too must also be granted sufficient attention, and the starting point should really be the intrinsic characteristics of a substance.
As Mr Bernd Lange stated a moment ago, the substitution principle is essential. If a less dangerous substance is available and tested, what logical reasons do we then have not to use it, other than perhaps financial considerations?
A second essential element is that we must be able to ban substances of high concern, such as persistent and bioaccumulative substances and endocrine disrupters, unless they are essential from a social point of view and no alternatives are available. We should then be able to authorise them under strict licensing.
Last but not least, maximum consumer information must be provided via clear labelling, but also via publicly accessible databases and information on the substances.
Mr President, I too voted in favour of the Langen report in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and believe I was right to do so.
On the other hand, I also understand how our colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy put a different emphasis on things.
That, too, I consider understandable, for otherwise we would not need both committees and could do everything in one.
I also take the view that it is only this tension between the various committees that makes it possible for something sensible to emerge at the end of the day.
I will be quite frank in saying that I have a number of difficulties with the SchÃ¶rling report.
The main one is perhaps that I believe substances should be evaluated not only according to the danger they may present, but also according to their characteristics. In this sense, they are not simply capable of being substituted for each other, at least not all of them.
There are substances that are dangerous, but which are useful in certain chemical processes.
Secondly, I believe that whether or not a substance is dangerous has to be founded on scientific statements.
It must be verifiable.
I am always very dubious about suspicions of danger or risk.
Being very subjective, these can be understood but not verified.
The vast number of testers required leads me to ask where they all are.
Safety does not increase in line with the amount of hyphenation or the number of regulations, but is increased by actual testing.
So we will have to look into that.
And one more little observation: which substances are actually necessary to society?
How does one ascertain something like that?
Who ascertains something like that?
I still need some clarification on that point, but I am happy to listen.
I would, by the way, like to remind the President that, this evening, we are discussing over EUR 800 billion in turnover, 400 billion of it in energy and 400 billion in chemistry.
That is a hell of a lot for two and a half hours.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the European Parliament for the report on the Commission' s White Paper on a future chemicals policy.
I really do hope that it will be adopted tomorrow.
It is incredibly important that we should take this step towards a new, better and more effective chemicals policy.
I want to say a special thank-you to Mrs SchÃ¶rling, who has put a great deal of work into her role as rapporteur.
I also want to thank all those who have taken part in the debate, because it has been an important discussion in which important points of view have emerged.
The White Paper presents the Commission' s proposal for a new chemicals strategy.
The modes of procedure presented in the White Paper are well balanced, and I believe they involve a step forwards in the direction of sustainable development.
The debate in this House has perhaps shown that we have succeeded reasonably well in finding a balance between different views, even though there is scope for improvements.
The background is as follows. Chemical production has increased almost explosively, from 1 million tonnes in 1930 to 400 million tonnes per year today.
We wish to maintain a high level of protection for the environment and human health, but we also need to try to make use of the advantages presented by chemicals.
We all know that there are chemicals in practically all the products we encounter every day.
It would be unrealistic to believe that, with a wave of the hand, we could get rid of all chemicals or that there could be a chemical-free modern society.
However, we must balance these requirements.
Anyone who examined what is now the European Union' s 20 year-old system of supervision would see clearly that it is not effective enough by a long chalk.
I would maintain that the system makes, for example, an artificial or arbitrary distinction between old and new chemicals.
Chemicals have many extremely important advantages for society.
Thanks to medicines and pharmaceutical products, it is possible to combat illnesses and suffering.
It is probably the case that a majority of the products forming part of our modern life-style today are manufactured from plastic or contain chemicals of some kind.
The chemicals industry is one of Europe' s largest manufacturing industries, employing 1.7 million people.
Between three and four million jobs depend upon it.
Ninety-six per cent of all companies are small and medium-sized, and they account for approximately 23 per cent of chemicals production.
We are all of us exposed to chemicals on a daily basis.
We have tried to look into whether this situation can be described in figures.
Calculated, for example, in tonnes, each and every one of us probably comes into contact with several tonnes of chemicals in our daily life.
That should also mean that we are exposed to several tens of thousands of chemicals.
More and more reports are coming in concerning health problems, allergies and asthma assumed to be connected with chemicals.
As has already been mentioned, research results show that the human body can contain at least 350 synthetic chemicals which, in the natural course of things, ought not to be there.
There are persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, and these are now to be found in placentas, foetuses and new-born children, to which they are transferred.
These chemicals are the first things a child ingests.
Chemicals are found in the depths of the sea and in the Arctic, where they have never once been used.
Hormone-changing substances can affect our reproduction and our nervous systems.
That is a fact.
The procedures governing the present EU legislation have been rightly criticised for being too slow and unwieldy.
Even though we have made some progress within the EU when it comes to evaluating the risks and restricting and controlling the use of hazardous chemicals, there is still an incredible amount to do.
At present, it is the authorities who have to demonstrate that a chemical is unsafe.
That obviously has to change.
As in the case of all other products, responsibility for ensuring that products released onto the market are safe must lie with producers, manufacturers and users at later stages in the manufacturing chain. That, basically, is what EU legislation will amount to.
Can you think of any other product about whose content we do not even have basic information or for which responsibility is entirely assumed by the authorities?
That is a basic error in the system.
What we now have to do is find a suitable balance between, on the one hand, the chemicals' advantages and, on the other hand, the unacceptable risks they involve for human health and the environment.
At the same time, we naturally want to ensure that the internal market is able to function and that the European chemicals industry, which is the world' s largest, can maintain its competitiveness.
In order better to be able to assess the consequences of different ways of implementing the proposals in the White Paper, we have set up an inquiry which will look more closely into the costs.
The Commission proposes that a 'REACH system' be set up to cover both existing substances, many of which have been on the market for at least 20 years but have never been properly tested, and new substances released onto the market after 1981.
The industry must be given incentives to gather data and, if need be, test the substances, preferably without using animal experiments.
We must help one another ensure that animal experiments are restricted.
An integrated policy is needed in order to do this.
None of us, I trust, would happily see full-scale experiments carried out on living human beings, animals or the countryside involving chemicals whose contents we do not know enough about.
There is, in actual fact, no denying that that is what happens at present, because we do not know enough about the chemicals that are released.
Pragmatic decisions are required in this area, together with a sensible application of the precautionary principle to chemicals policy.
If there are reasons for suspecting that a substance has damaging effects on health or the environment and if our scientific and technical knowledge is not sufficient to provide a clear appreciation of the risks, we must take no chances and restrict or prohibit the use of the substance until such time as we know more.
The absolute top priority is to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the risks involved in the 30 000 'existing substances' that are produced or imported in quantities greater than that of one tonne per manufacturer per year.
The proposed new system includes a special arrangement for substances that give cause for special concern, or what are known as CMR substances.
These are substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.
They must be authorised before they are allowed to be used, and companies must show that they can be used safely on condition that risk management measures are taken.
It should then be possible to authorise such safe use with reference to the cost and income analyses supplied by the companies.
In this way, the burden of proof will be redistributed, and the risk assessment will be focused on those areas of use for which the companies have sought authorisation.
In this way, approximately 1 500 substances, that is to say 5 per cent of all substances, will be covered by this authorisation procedure.
The system will promote innovation, and that will lead to the most hazardous substances being replaced.
I note that, in its draft report, Parliament proposes that several categories of substance be added to the authorisation procedure.
I can appreciate its wanting to do that, but I believe that, as matters stand, it would be inappropriate to accord the system too much scope.
We must be pragmatic to start with, so that we do not relapse into having an unmanageable system.
If we overload the system, a large number of resources will be employed in managing a very small portion of all those substances that need to be investigated.
We have limited resources, and we must establish priorities and decide how we are to use our resources in the most effective ways.
Parliament' s draft report also says that the proposed EU system must cover chemicals produced in quantities of less than one tonne in the form of substances or preparations that occur in products.
On the part of the Commission, I want most definitely to recommend a limit of one tonne so that it is possible to use the resources of the industry and of the authorities in the most effective way possible.
If we want to get the proposal through, we must concentrate on what is most hazardous.
There is no doubt a misunderstanding here.
This limit does not apply to the most hazardous substances which, in each and every case, must go through the authorisation procedure.
The very fact that the limit is set at one tonne does not mean that chemicals produced in smaller quantities escape monitoring.
The industry is still obliged to carry out a risk assessment of the chemicals and to provide safety information to users in the form of marking and Safety Data Sheets.
It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that these provisions are complied with.
The industry must be able, upon request, to supply information to the authorities.
The Commission has now set up a number of technical working parties with experts from the Member States, industry, non-governmental organisations and the Commission.
The result of their deliberations is expected in February 2002, and it will constitute one of the most important contributions to the draft legislation on the part of the Commission.
It is difficult to prophesy when the Commission will be able to table its proposals.
If everything goes smoothly, I believe that we can aim for April or May 2002, but the objective is, no matter what, to submit the proposals to Parliament and the Council before the summer of 2002.
Finally, I want to say a few words about the debate which I know is taking place and which is perhaps being conducted most eagerly in Germany and the United Kingdom.
What matters is that the European chemicals industry should remain competitive, but we are doing nothing that is not also being done in the United States, Canada and Japan within the framework of the OECD.
Roughly the same measures are also being taken by our competitor countries and in the world around us, where precisely the same problems are being experienced as in Europe.
If the desire is for the European chemicals industry to hold its own, sustainable development must be worked for.
It must be possible to guarantee that what is produced is safe for use in terms of human health and the environment and that it corresponds to the requirements of consumers.
We have tabled a balanced proposal which takes account of the needs of industry but which also states that what is most important is to bring about a high level of protection for human health and the environment.
I think the best answer that can be given is to say that there is no need to be anxious. This proposal will lead to innovation in the chemicals sphere.
We can defend our European chemicals industry through the safe use of chemicals in the future.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0341/2001) by Mrs Flemming on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission communication to the Council [COM(2000) 477 - C5-0634/2000 - 2000/2298(COS)], the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing here not with a legislative procedure, nor with a White or Green Paper, but exclusively with the implementation of Article 9 of the framework directive on water, which very precisely indicates how the costs of water services are to be covered.
By 2010 at the latest, the Member States have to ensure that their policy on water charges offers appropriate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and that it takes into account the social, ecological and economic effects of covering the costs and the geographical and climatic conditions of the region in question.
I have therefore attempted to make it clear in my report that the exploitability of our water resources must be maintained, for future generations as well, that we must keep to proven ways of keeping water pure and providing the population with clean drinking water, but that we may also look into new ways of doing this.
In doing this, universal supply and drainage, high environmental standards, quality of provision and affordable prices must all be safeguarded.
It should be possible to introduce business instruments and involve private enterprise, but also achieve proportionate optimisation of the operational structures involved in providing water supplies.
I myself say an emphatic 'No' to the deregulation of water supply and drainage, but I say 'Yes' to every country being able to use its water in the way that the people want.
I say 'Yes' to solidarity in water use within Europe, but this must not be invoked to force any Member State to make its water available to another Member State without charge.
On the subject of the many amendments that have been proposed, I would just like to say briefly one thing: It is marvellous to repeat things that are important, and also to repeat them over and over again.
It is also very difficult to speak against things that are right and important, especially if they have long been part of legislation and of a directive, such as the water framework directive.
But the question arises of how suitable it is to proceed in this way.
Since we are today only drawing up guidelines rather than legislating, I would say: so what?
One amendment really hurts me - the one which, as it were, condemns a certain Member State because of a project which really is purely an internal matter for that State and the environmental effects of which have not yet been assessed and in respect of which, as and when European Union funds are actually granted, the laws of the European Union will of course have to be abided by.
If I may establish a disagreeable precedent, I would be very happy if this amendment were perhaps to be voted down.
I found the Commission document very good.
I also think it a good thing that Parliament, in contrast to the practice in many Member States, can also be heard on the subject of a law's implementing regulation.
I would like to hope that the Commission and the Council will find their efforts supported by Parliament's opinion.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate both the committee responsible and Mrs Flemming for the work they have done.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the communication from the Commission.
A suitable pricing policy for irrigation water will play a fundamental role in encouraging more efficient and sustainable use of water in agriculture, its largest consumer, and will free up resources for other uses, thereby reducing environmental pressures.
The analysis of the pricing of irrigation water is complex, due to the wide range of agricultural uses in the European Union and also regional differences in the need and availability of water for agricultural usage.
Water is, essentially, the very backbone of the agricultural community in the Mediterranean regions.
Without water, nothing grows, apart from the controversial almond trees.
The pricing policy should be heterogeneous, taking into account the 'polluter pays' principle, as well as the social, environmental, economic, geographical and climatic variations in regions that no doubt will be the most affected by this pricing policy.
The financial, environmental and resource costs of irrigation farming require differential treatment if gradual-recovery objectives are to be achieved.
For this reason, the introduction of this policy should be progressive, transparent and must be adapted to local requirements.
In this way, information to irrigation farmers and the adaptation and optimisation of infrastructures and irrigation techniques should be applied in parallel so that farmers can accept this policy.
Ladies and gentlemen, in its current form the CAP does not help to achieve the objectives set out in the framework directive, which means we must seek coherence between these two policies in order to guarantee the protection of European agriculture' s functional model.
Today, in Europe, water is a factor for cohesion between countries.
The revision of Agenda 2000 on the development of agri-environmental measures should include the objectives of water policies.
This will require the revision of certain types of aid, the application of eco-conditionality and the recognition of the right to adequate compensation for more vulnerable farmers, such as those who work on family holdings, with the aim of promoting the sustainable use of water and an integrated rural development.
Mr President, the price of water is a factor that has an undeniable effect on its consumption. However, the subject should be broached with appropriate caution, so as not to give rise to counter-productive effects of an economic and environmental nature.
The great disparity in the application of criteria in this area should be taken into account, as well as the barriers that can exist in Member States, both of a legal nature and with regard to acquired rights and customs, that can be difficult to amend, particularly in the short term.
On this subject, it is interesting to note that there are certain crops that contribute to the survival of a habitat and fauna that, without these crops, would disappear.
There are also industries today that, after using a certain quantity of water, return it to its source in the same or even in a better state than before they used it.
In principle, it does not seem a good idea to place a burden on this type of activity.
If time permitted, I could continue to give examples of economic activities, both agricultural and industrial, that, far from posing a threat to our water resources, are clearly beneficial to the environment.
Lastly, Mr President, financial resources gained from water-pricing policies should be used to improve infrastructures, which would prevent water loss in transport, for example, and would ensure better and increased access to this resource.
Paying for the amount of water we consume is, indeed, a key element, but only one of the many measures that should lead to a more rational use of this vital resource in all Member States.
I believe, Mr President, that this important issue of water distribution can be relatively easily solved if we have the good will and solidarity of EU governments.
Mr President, water is the Number One food.
I therefore consider constant use of water and protection of water resources to be indispensable.
One means by which this may be achieved is, as required by the water framework directive, a price for water that covers costs, comprising the environmental costs and the cost of infrastructure and of treatment.
Incentives are necessary for water to be continuously used.
Careful use of water is encouraged by having a basic price for basic services and increasing prices for use over and above that.
The basic price must also take social aspects into account, for access to water must be possible for the less well off in society.
One important area in which there is a need for action is that of agriculture.
The reduction of water subsidies in agriculture and the careful use of water resources will only be achieved by promoting rural development and finding new sources of income for farmers.
Water polluters must also be called to account, which means that the 'polluter pays' principle applies.
Every water consumer in Europe should additionally receive a statement of how much water he has used and how the price he pays for his water is made up.
I see it as an important question, how much of a market we permit and whether private commitment conflicts with public and regionally-organised water supply and careful use of water.
I believe that cooperation between public and private undertakings using private know-how and capital is an option when it comes to making the best use of water resources from an ecological and economic point of view, without regional supply zones being given up.
So here I am not talking about deregulation and competition at any price, but about ensuring efficient and environmentally friendly water supply.
Mr President, Mrs Flemming's report builds on the existing water framework directive.
My group is happy to support it.
If water resources are to be used sustainably, the price of water to users must reflect both the costs of delivery and the costs of subsequent treatment.
But when we vote tomorrow, a great deal of attention will be focused on just one aspect of the report, the Spanish hydrological scheme to build 120 dams and transfer vast quantities of water from one river basin to another.
I am not sure that a report about general principles should single out any one Member State for criticism but, having listened over the past few weeks to both sides of the debate, my personal view is that this scheme seems to be the antithesis of the approach laid down in Mrs Flemming's report.
The Commissioner has made very clear in the past her personal opposition to the use of EU structural funds to support projects which are damaging to the environment.
So I hope she will watching closely when the Spanish Government comes to the Commission seeking billions of pounds in structural fund support for a project which seems to me to directly contravene the principles if not the letter of the water framework directive, one of the Commission's greatest achievements.
I expect the Commission to make it absolutely clear that environmental impact studies must be independent and must consider the entire scheme, not just individual proposals.
This Spanish scheme is set to become a test case of whether the Commission's commitments toward environmental sustainability are matched by a determination to stand up to pressure from vested interests and the governments of Member States.
I hope that the Commissioner will do her best to make sure that her colleagues pass that test.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fleming on her excellent report, which is better than the Lienemann report on the water framework directive.
The Flemming report deals with water prices and, as Chris Davids has already stated, particularly relates to one very controversial issue, Paragraph 28, in which concern is expressed about the plan by the Aznar government to tap a vast quantity of the northern Spanish river, the Ebro, and to transport this water 1 000 km to southern Spain to cater partly for the tourist industry and partly for agriculture.
This plan is detrimental to hundreds of nature reserves in Spain and will also adversely affect the natural habitat of the brown bear and Iberian wolf in the Pyrenees.
This gigantic plan will cost EUR 22 billion and Spain wants Europe to contribute EUR 7 billion.
Spain should learn that water is a precious commodity and that clean water comes at a price. That is why hotels and farmers use it sparingly.
This is standard practice in northern Europe.
It is also striking that the Portuguese government - Portugal is, after all, also on the Iberian Peninsula, does pursue a sound water price policy.
Under pressure from the Aznar government, a new Amendment No 6 has been tabled by Messrs Flemming, Cox and Davis, precisely to delete reference to this Spanish plan.
Does Pat Cox' application for presidency have anything to do with this by any chance?
How else can it be explained that the liberal group is now all of a sudden adopting a different position from that which it adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Fellow Members, I urge you to vote against Amendment No 6 to the Flemming report and to vote for the original paragraph.
Mr President, as my fellow Members have stated, water is a limited natural resource that citizens have a fundamental right to access and use.
We cannot, therefore, support the amendments that talk of water as being a commodity or those which talk about the private management of water.
And we will be voting against these amendments.
However, I do believe that the rational use of water is an absolute necessity, as stated in Mrs Flemming' s report, and also a moral responsibility for Europeans with regard to those populations that have an enormous water deficit.
Article 9 of the framework directive which, as the Commissioner knows very well, required a great deal of time and discussion time to complete, provides for the recovery of costs.
The same directive, however, and the report by Mrs Flemming, as other speakers have mentioned, state that different regional, social and climatological situations should be taken into account, which leads on to the need to adopt water-saving measures in order to prevent leaks from water production and distribution systems, and to ensure the maximum re-usage of purified water, as well as the improvement of irrigation techniques.
In order to achieve this, the public, and those who work in the three sectors affected: domestic, agricultural and industrial, need to be informed.
The quality and purity of water must also be improved.
Commissioner, there is still a high level of nitrates in water and this should be addressed, as we have always said in the European Parliament.
I would like to finish, Mr President, by saying that it is hardly surprising that, in the context in which we are speaking, there should be clear opposition to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, approved, it is true, by a majority in the Spanish Parliament, for it is based principally on the use of reservoirs and the transfer of water in rivers such as the Ebro that could have a disastrous effect on an ecosystem that is unique in Europe.
Furthermore, the planned reservoirs are located in Special Protection Areas.
For this reason, it must be said, Commissioner, that, without wishing to condemn my own country in particular, we must pay more attention to how European funds are used.
Mr President, water is not a commodity and the right to water remains a fundamental one.
On the other hand, the Member States must set a number of objectives for themselves to ensure the proper management of water.
In this context, a comparison between States could lead to the use of best practices.
States must, however, maintain control over pricing and regulation.
A community pricing system would create many problems.
How can we reconcile the interests of the countries of the north with those of the south?
As for regulation, the local water committees, for example, the main consultative and administrative bodies in France, should not be undermined.
Similarly, it makes sense for water policy to take account of specific geographical and regional characteristics.
Water needs differ according to the type of agricultural production, soil quality and climate.
Like the Commission, the rapporteur questions the application of the 'polluter-pays' principle to the agricultural sector.
This pricing policy would lead to a substantial increase in price per cubic metre, an additional cost that would be added to the cost of animal welfare.
Changing crop-growing techniques would put farmers in a risky and insecure situation.
Regulating water in too dramatic a way would penalise farming, which has already made huge efforts towards making refunds.
Farming is in crisis and will have to stretch itself even further to comply with the rules of the WTO, which is now meeting in Doha.
Instead, preserving the multifunctional character of our farming, which contributes to land-use planning and to managing the environment, will enable us to achieve better water quality.
Legislating now would be a mistake.
Let us wait for the CAP reforms before we adopt a global approach to the issue of water, listening to and consulting all parties involved.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication from the Commission shows that they are giving thought to how to put into practice the requirements of the water framework directive, and Mrs Flemming's report makes valuable additional suggestions.
Average household water consumption varies, per person per day, between 120 litres in Belgium and 213 litres in Italy.
Germany, with DM 7.72 per cubic metre for the supply of drinking water and for wastewater drainage, is, with Denmark, far and away at the top of the world league, but, as regards consumption, is third from the bottom.
Adequate high-quality water supply and appropriate drainage are part, of course, of services of general interest in the broadest sense, such as we have been discussing this morning.
We must not, though, make the mistake of lumping deregulation and privatisation together.
Privatisation can, in conjunction with other means, be perfectly adequate in achieving the objectives set by Article 9 of the water framework directive.
I would, though, at this point, like - in the context of the discussion on the subject-matter for the new Inter-Governmental Conference - to give a clear reminder of the topic of the demarcation of competencies.
We should not be making the sensitive area of water supply and drainage even more unstable while this issue has not been satisfactorily resolved.
The various aspects of water and the price paid for it are among the most politically sensitive issues in some Member States, not only the southern ones, but also for Ireland and Austria, for example.
I would wish to emphatically warn against mentioning or even attacking individual Member States.
This applies all the more in view of the attempt, for example in item 28 for obvious reasons of party politics, to realise demands at a European level which would not be feasible in terms of domestic policy.
Additionally in this case, the issues addressed are, then, only very marginally concerned, if at all, with the subject of the report.
We would be creating a precedent with unforeseeable consequences, and I urge the adoption of Amendments Nos 3 and 6, for otherwise we would have to vote against an otherwise very good report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this report was to propose a text describing the effects of water pricing on consumption.
Some Members, however, found the temptation to include proposals on the prospects for privatisation in this sector too strong to resist.
To my mind, privatisation is often the first step towards liberalisation.
Some of us in this House support the idea that water must not become a commodity like any other and must instead be given special consideration and above all remain the property of everyone, in present and future generations.
Public authorities must remain in control of the distribution and treatment of water, even if we accept the idea of delegating services to private companies for set periods and under precisely defined conditions.
Above all, if we wish to involve Europe' s citizens in these issues and to ensure that our policy does not simply result in higher bills, let us work on informing and communicating with the public on this crucial matter.
We must win over as many people as possible to our concerns if we are to directly encourage individuals to reduce their water consumption.
Mr President, the report works on the basic assumption that the easily-accessible fresh water reserves have been largely opened up, that long-term water use and savings can be achieved by using economic leverage, and that this would promote the responsible use of water.
This requirement can only be met on a world-wide basis.
I do not see implementation of the report's objectives on pricing as the high road that we should be taking.
Affordable prices are often saddled with negative associations.
The cost of clean water depends on the right investments, on technical skill and on better success than hitherto in allocating tasks in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle.
The Member States are free to come to their own decisions.
It will be difficult to keep to the timetable.
Mr President, as has been said, this debate is directly related to the debate we held before the entry into force of the European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy.
The report before us captures the spirit of the directive and applies it directly to the issue of the cost to be paid, by all users, although maybe not in equal amounts, for using water for economic purposes.
However, the report also, rightly, and here I congratulate the rapporteur, stipulates that access to water at a proportionate or reduced cost, according to need, is a human right.
Therefore, any pricing policy must be based, above all, on a realistic examination of the social and other conditions in which the commodity of water is to be used, but also on a user education campaign that raises awareness and particularly focuses on water saving measures.
In order to provide a service which best responds to the different situations, it would be appropriate to incorporate the principle of subsidiarity so that each State makes its own decisions and each region sets its own levels and parameters.
The general line taken by this report could be described as preventing wastage and assisting the less economically developed areas, and our thoughts therefore turn immediately to the matter of the agricultural world, which, as some of the Members have pointed out, must certainly not be too casually confused with the general issue.
The basic principle is, in fact, that all the users should, in any case, contribute to paying for the commodity of water but in different proportions.
However, priority scales also need to be established on the basis of first social and then economic requirements.
The most direct comparison is with the CAP, which is intended to encourage and propose development measures which, as well as being suitable for the area concerned, are also compatible with the level of water resources available.
Where there is no water available at all, Mr President, I feel that this needs to be taken into account, especially in the pricing policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the report' s assertion that water is not a commodity, but rather a heritage that must be protected, defended and treated as such, and that access to water is an inalienable human right.
As socialists, we do not share the idea that water is an economic commodity, which excludes its social and cultural character, and we think that the protection and defence of water should not be guided by the rules of the market economy.
With regard to the amendment on the Spanish National Hydrological Plan that, according to Mrs Flemming, we should withdraw, both my colleagues and myself, who presented it, are not going to withdraw it.
We think that it is reasonable, that it criticises an EU country' s hydrological plan that is unsustainable from the economic, social and environmental points of view, and that it clearly contradicts the European Union' s Sustainable Development Strategy.
For this reason, we are not going to withdraw the amendment.
We hope that other Members will vote for it and we trust that this will be the case.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to thank the European Parliament for the resolution on the Commission communication on pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources.
I want especially to thank Mrs Flemming who took on the task of rapporteur for this very sensitive issue.
The communication must be seen in conjunction with the launch of the new water policy in Europe - the water framework directive, adopted last year.
The aim of the communication is to establish guiding principles to support the implementation of the article on water pricing, that is to say Article 9 of the directive.
The European Parliament' s draft opinion covers all the relevant issues affecting water pricing, from the covering of environmental costs to transparency and consumer participation.
Moreover, emphasis is given to areas in which more research and analysis are required in order to ensure that future water pricing policy also embraces environmental, economic and social aspects.
Part of this analysis will naturally be carried out in conjunction with the drawing up of management plans for river basin areas in accordance with the water framework directive.
The views of the European Parliament will form the basis for future work at EU level aimed at implementing a more sustainable pricing policy.
In this connection, allow me also to say something about what is happening in connection with the common strategy agreed by the Member States and the Commission to facilitate the implementation of the water framework directive.
Working parties, including a working party on economic issues, have already been set up.
These working parties are to develop implementation guidelines.
The European Parliament will be kept informed about the future development of water pricing issues at EU level.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Packaging and packaging waste
The next item on the agenda is the Report (A5-0323/2001) by Mrs Corbey on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC [2000/2319(INI)] of 20 December 1994 of the European Parliament and the Council on packaging and packaging waste.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the waste mounting is still growing.
Packaging only plays a minor, albeit visible, role in the environmental problem and is a source of irritation to many people.
Packaging could be used as an example of a fresh approach to environmental problems.
We must make sustainable development viable.
We can adopt all the sound ideas from the sixth environmental action programme and apply these to the packaging policy.
