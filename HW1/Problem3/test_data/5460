It is also important that the European Commission strictly adheres to enforcing the principle of additionality through uniform verification methods.
That is the view of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee of this Parliament.
The committee believes that it is important to speed up the introduction of all the streamlining measures needed to improve the quality of Structural Fund spending in Europe.
If EU Structural Funds are going to be applied for the desired purpose, namely to improve the economic and social cohesion of different regions, then these monies must be spent as additional financial resources.
If the principle of additionality is not rigorously enforced and independently verified, it makes it very difficult for European Union institutions and national EU governments to ensure that the competitive position of those regions most in need is improved.
I welcome the introduction of activity-based budgeting, and the setting of clear and measurable objectives will greatly aid the budgetary process.
We all agree that the EU budget must be framed in such a way as to meet its objectives.
I am concerned that, whereas the rate of appropriations from the Community budget for trans-European networks in the field of transport measures continues to be at a satisfactory level, a number of Member States have failed to advance the necessary monies for these TENs projects.
On a broader budgetary matter, I welcome the fact that under the 2004 budget Parliament's Committee on Budgets supports the following measures: the need to increase rural development aid measures under the EU common agricultural policy; the need to guarantee the safety of food products, both from within the territories of the Union and from third countries; greater co-ordination of security measures at the EU's external borders and improved EU immigration and asylum policies; and promotion of an EU media space to disseminate information on the workings of the European Union and raise public awareness of the impact of European Union legislation on the day-to-day lives of the citizens of Europe.
Mr President, I shall talk about a very tiny, but nevertheless very important, element of the budget: that of the Committee on Petitions.
I should also like to mention the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
Both of these committees come into very close contact with the individual European citizen.
In recent years the Petitions Committee has developed the possibility of inviting petitioners to attend committee meetings, where appropriate, to have their petition addressed.
We need to ensure that there is adequate funding to enable citizens to do that, where appropriate.
Petitioning Parliament is an essential right for the citizens of Europe.
The Petitions Committee often offers the citizen a way of cutting through the bureaucracy of Europe to address issues affecting their lives.
I am talking about only a very modest increase in the sums available, but this would send out a very big message to the European people.
We must also remember that the Ombudsman is the other great defender of citizens' rights.
According to Eurobarometer, 87% of citizens recognise their right to go to the European Ombudsman.
We have just appointed a new Ombudsman.
I have no personal interest in this, but we need to ensure that there is adequate funding for the Ombudsman to have the staff and resources to cope with the enlargement of Europe.
On culture - less than 0.5% of total expenditure - we must have an effective procedure for the A-30 lines.
I heard what the Commissioner said earlier.
I welcome that.
Timing is critical in this.
I hope that we will have the procedures in place so that bodies like the European Youth Orchestra and the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation know that their future is assured.
Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to support the position adopted by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats with regard to Mr Mulder's report on the 2004 budget guidelines. My remarks are also addressed to the representatives of the Council although they do not appear to be present.
Thanks are due to the rapporteur for his ideas and for the care he has taken to include most of the ideas expressed by others into the report.
My group fully endorses the report. Indeed we support it so strongly that we have not tabled a single amendment to it in the House.
We trust that only a limited number of the amendments tabled by other groups will be adopted.
Turning to a more contentious issue, as the rapporteur mentioned, the 2004 budgetary period will be unusual throughout. Initially, the budget will apply to 15 Member States.
At the close of the period it will, however, apply to 25. This will call for an additional effort to reach understanding between the three institutions, whereas relations are currently somewhat strained.
Times are hard for Europe and even harder for the wider world.
The 2004 budget should represent a statement of faith in ourselves. We should be confident of our potential and abilities as Europeans.
Further, the 2004 budget should help to strengthen Europe's role and influence beyond its borders. This is sorely needed as our common foreign policy, its instruments and even the individuals charged with operating them appear to have gone missing in advance of the action.
The Europe foreshadowed in the Mulder report is a united Europe. It is a Europe able to generate competitiveness and employment.
It is also a Europe to be relied on by its partners in the wider world, and a Europe better able to manage its common policies. Interinstitutional cooperation is one of the prerequisites to such a Europe.
Unfortunately it cannot currently be guaranteed. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of this very report state that enlargement financial perspectives are to be approved jointly by the Council and the European Parliament.
This does not seem to be the case at present.
Parliament must have a considerable say regarding the financing of internal and external policy, if Europe is to prove a reliable partner, and if we are to become competitive and create employment.
Global amounts for the adjustment of financial perspectives must not be set unilaterally.
Parliament must be entitled to identify the shortfall in these areas and negotiate adequate sums.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is prepared to negotiate with the Council and the Commission concerning these areas.
They are key to the achievement of the objectives identified by Mr Mulder. In the present climate of disunity and dissent, the Union's institutions are called on to illustrate dialogue and cooperation, not to contribute to the unrest.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, for the very good cooperation that we have already enjoyed over recent weeks.
This is very early in the year to be setting down Budget lines, but the procedure has changed in such a way that we will always be doing this rather earlier in the future, which is not necessarily a disadvantage.
If you see what discussions are going on at present in the European Union, you will know that, on the one hand, Europe is associated in the public mind with an enormous amount of hope, but that also, on the other hand, people are at present somewhat disconcerted by many aspects of it.
The debates that we will be having this year, which will also have an influence on next year's Budget, will be on issues such as the Convention, enlargement, future economic progress, and the prospects for peace.
It is also necessary that we, that Parliament, should be reliable in the work we do on the Budget, reliable as regards what we did in the past, and as regards what we want to carry forward into the future.
Each individual issue has to be approached and discussed in a frank and transparent way.
I have said in every Budget debate that we have to have equal rights in every area of the Budget, and I will stop saying this only when we actually are, and the Convention has a chance of making this happen and, in the Budget procedure too, even in matters of agricultural policy, of giving both parts of the budgetary authority equal powers.
We have to ensure that transparency and clarity in matters concerning the European Budget are capable of being communicated to the public.
We are on the threshold of enlargement.
We want enlargement.
The division of the continent of Europe into West and East, poor and rich, is a falsehood, but preparations for enlargement must be transparent, and the rationale behind them must be comprehensible, even when it comes to financial matters.
Parliament is one of the two component parts of the decision-making authority, and we will not allow the Council to present us with faits accomplis in these matters.
As far as Europe's economic development is concerned, many of those who have already spoken have said that we have to further develop the internal market - that internal market that many saw as pointing in the right direction and that raised their hopes; but unemployment in Europe is as much an issue now as ever it was.
The means are available to us to do something about this.
In recent years, we have refunded EUR 14 billion on one occasion, EUR 11 billion on another, and this year we will be refunding EUR 7 billion - resources that have not been used, in the Structural Funds for example, to combat unemployment.
That is something we cannot accept.
This tendency may have been alleviated somewhat, but it remains the case that far too much of the funds we have cannot be made use of.
In order that we may make progress in this area, I ask you to take the simplification of administration further.
As regards peace - both around the world and on the continent of Europe - it is only natural that we should take our past actions as the basis for future development, but, as it strives to develop a common foreign and security policy, Europe must not be understood to consist only of those who are currently engaged in developing joint military structures.
Our approach must be that of avoiding and preventing conflicts and of disarming, as we have done with such things as landmines, and, if I may turn to developments in Palestine and Iraq, we are of course prepared to provide humanitarian aid there at a later date, but let nobody regard this as a licence to do whatever is possible on the basis that they can do their bit, and reconstruction can be left to the European Union.
We have to make it abundantly clear that we are not giving anybody carte blanche.
Now for the final point that I want to address.
Europe is undergoing demographic change - and this is where we have to look slightly further ahead - in that it has an every-increasing number of older people and ever fewer young people.
At European level, that will have an effect on pensions.
We want all policies to be considered from the point of view of what these changes will mean in the future ?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, as has already been mentioned on quite a few occasions, the budgeting for 2004 is particularly exciting and particularly complicated because of enlargement and the continued reforms of EU budgeting.
This is now the first year involving the activity-based budget, which will make it simpler for us all in future to interpret the political messages in the budget.
I should like to begin by thanking Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill for their constructive and well set-out discussion documents for the work on the 2004 budget.
The objective of this year's budget has been to unify Europe, for enlargement means that there is a need for a range of new initiatives. In this context, I would especially mention the need for the Commission's reforms to be implemented in such a way that the administration becomes genuinely efficient and is made sufficiently flexible for it to be possible, once and for all, to straighten out those problems that led to the Commission's departure in 1999.
If we do not get the problems solved now, matters will become so much the more difficult in an enlarged EU.
It may be argued that enlargement will provide special opportunities for sorting out a number of problems. On the other hand, the difficulties in solving them will also be exacerbated.
As Mrs Gill mentioned, that also applies, of course, in relation to our own institution, Parliament, which will no doubt have to be persuaded to tidy up its administration.
It is important for us to set aside the necessary funds for the continued development of administration, training and social dialogue in the new Member States.
That also applies to the budgets for the agencies in the spheres of training and the labour market.
The last point I wish to make is that, upon enlargement, the EU will acquire new borders in the east.
In the budget, aid to the former Soviet bloc countries is to be provided through the Tacis programmes which provide money for administrative development, training and the promotion of safety in connection with nuclear power stations.
It is important for Tacis to continue to ensure that the projects are properly implemented. Nuclear safety, in particular, is a high political priority.
I am delighted that, in this budget process, we can also welcome our future fellow MEPs from the new Member States.
I think that, with their more detailed knowledge of our new neighbours, they will have some good ideas as to how, in the future, we can generally develop the Tacis programmes and also ensure that they are efficiently implemented.
That is a strand of the debate and of the budget to which I am very much looking forward.
Mr President, Commissioners, I have had a poor impression in the European Convention of the direction in which the EU's policy on languages is heading.
There the proposed amendments to the Praesidium's draft constitution are not translated into the official languages of the EU.
The discussions held by the Convention's working groups have only been interpreted into two or three languages.
A constitution is being drafted, however, which is at a higher level than the Member States' national legislation.
As the Convention is called the Convention on the Future, language restrictions and the destruction of national linguistic identities would seem to be the future of the EU.
Both budget reports give attention to language, translation and interpreting.
When Mrs Gill speaks of controlled multilingualism I am not sure that that means equality for all languages.
When distance interpreting is mentioned, I am not sure that that means distance interpreting for all languages.
If not all languages in the EU are to be used equally, let us draw lots for those languages that are to be the so-called working languages.
Another linguistic outrage is the fact that the European Parliament visitor's service no longer has a Finnish-speaking official.
Otherwise, the guidelines for the budgetary procedure are on such a general level that there are only a few general remarks to make.
Parliament's unanimous political will would seem to be that there should be a determination to reduce the amount of unpaid payment appropriations, or RALs.
Many in our group oppose the introduction of financial support for Europarties, as the parties would then become supranational.
As regards Mr Wynn's report, which is the next to be discussed, some amendments to it have been tabled calling for the introduction of 'Eurotaxes' to finance the work of the EU.
These supranational taxes are unacceptable to many in our group.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, the defining of a strategy for the coming year provides us with an excellent opportunity to set priorities.
In its policy strategy for 2004, the Commission chooses the accession of ten new Member States to the EU first of all, followed by stability, and lastly sustainable growth.
We can endorse this choice of political priorities.
The accession of ten new Member States has been an important theme throughout the term of office of this Commission, and it is right that it be given top priority in 2004.
After all, by 1 May of next year enlargement from 15 to 25 Member States will be a reality; provided, of course, that the populations of the candidate countries agree to this.
In the Commission's elaboration of the theme of 'sustainable growth and solidarity' it strikes one that, in the opinion of the Commission, the Union bears a very large number of responsibilities, namely: a) strengthening economic and social cohesion, b) tackling the uneven level of development between the various regions, c) supporting sustainable economic and social development and d) promoting balanced and sustainable development.
This optimism about one authority single-handedly bringing about social change does not square with our view of the matter.
The Commission should adopt a more modest attitude in this regard and should not take on so many tasks.
We consider that making stability a priority was the right choice.
After all, we need to take the global terrorist threat most seriously.
The elaboration of this policy area in concrete terms, however, is once again at odds with our idea of security and stability in Europe.
The most important partner in the global fight against terrorism and in maintaining international stability is missing from beside what is known as the 'new neighbours initiative', or 'ring of friends' policy.
I am talking about the NATO alliance, with the United States of America as a strong ally.
Is the Commission prepared to define its position on this matter?

It is in the European Union's multi-annual perspective for the period 2004-2006 that it really shows its true colours: this perspective talks of the fundamental tasks not only of 'European citizenship' and the solidarity mentioned above, but also of 'enabling the Union to exercise the responsibilities of a world power'.
In the light of the current situation, it is Utopian to think of the deeply divided European Union playing a more active role in the maintenance of security in the world.
Congratulations are due to Mr Mulder for his commendable report on the guidelines for the 2004 budgetary procedure.
Unfortunately, I cannot talk in such positive terms about the report by Mrs Gill.
The advantages she envisages in the draft statute for European political parties completely escape us.
The Commission wants to get no less than 75% of the budget for these European parties out of the EU budget!
Is that not completely out of proportion?
Political parties are free associations of citizens.
Is it not logical, then, for citizens, who form the basis of every party, to give financial support to the party of their choice?
This also respects the natural link between parties and their support base, which can only be beneficial to their involvement in politics.
National political parties that wish to associate at European level should pay for that themselves - that is to say, their members should.
European political parties are by definition much further removed from the bed of our citizens than national parties.
If, therefore, we give those European parties an enormous subsidy from Community funds, we increase the gap between citizen and politics.
We find completely incredible Mrs Gill's analysis that a propaganda offensive would bring the parties closer to the citizen.
What visible effect have European campaigns about European citizenship or the benefits of the euro produced?
The answer is none, so why should that succeed now?
In the opinion of our group, it would be better to get the draft statute off the table as quickly as possible.
Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur, I wish to raise four points on the Gill report.
Firstly, on political party funding - the matter just raised by Mr van Dam - my Group considers that this funding should be in Parliament's, not the Commission's budget.
The reason is that we can be accountable: the rules are already set down and agreed between the three institutions.
I understood that there was also a move by the Council of Ministers and the Commission to move this budget towards Parliament's financing.
It is right and appropriate to show that we are responsible and accountable.
An amendment has been tabled and I urge Members to vote - perhaps against their own groups - for Parliament to have control of the political party funding budget.
Secondly, on buildings, the Bureau has made too many decisions without referring back to the appropriate committee - the Committee on Budgets.
I welcome Paragraph 40 of the Mrs Gill's report, which I broadly support.
That calls on the Secretary-General to submit a report by 1 June 2004 outlining 'the functional justifications for the new building projects'.
I hope that report will include the proposals for two new conference rooms here.
The United Kingdom Conservatives and Socialists are opposed to those two conference rooms, as they would spoil the very pleasant entrance to the European Parliament by the flags.
There is no functional justification.
The conference rooms - in particular the large ones - are under-utilised.
There is more than enough room, even with the enlargement countries, to provide all the necessary facilities.
That is a very important matter and, in future, we at least will be requiring functional justification before spending is approved.
I should like to draw attention to a very positive amendment - of which I am sure Mrs Gill will approve - to Paragraph 28.
This clarifies the movement towards more facilities to cover multilingualism, which is particularly important for enlargement.
It concerns electronic guidance, computer workstations and directions to rooms.
I know that as a new Member three years ago I had great difficulty in Brussels and Strasbourg even in finding rooms.
Think of the language difficulties for Members from the new countries.
Therefore, monitors and permanently-installed signs scrolling through the various languages would be a very important addition.
Finally, there is a reference in the report to the Court of Auditors.
It does very important work and needs extra resources, a suggestion I fully endorse.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs. However, I would particularly like to thank President Prodi for stating in a very wide-ranging speech a political fact: these are terrible times but the Union must press ahead with its projects and ambitions.
The historical goal we are about to achieve - the enlargement of the Union - calls for total consistency in our budgetary decisions.
In this regard, too, Parliament will play its part, which is not the part of a solicitor who merely writes reports and accepts the decisions of others without having any influence.
There are four main European policies which will contribute to enlargement: cohesion policy, the common agricultural policy, the TENs policy and the policy for cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises.
The success of enlargement and integration will depend to a large extent on the way these policies are revised and the importance given to them in the budget.
There are just two things I want to say.
Firstly, I believe that we need to reconsider the funding allocated to the TENs and the Union's contribution, simplify the procedures and reinvigorate the North-South dimension as well as the East-West dimension. Secondly, I believe we need to increase the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises and their ability to form partnerships with the small and medium-sized enterprises of the candidate countries.
To this end, it would be beneficial to enhance the current instruments and the current pilot project on enlargement and SMEs and take the opportunity afforded by the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 to give a clear boost to the measures facilitating the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Mr President, firstly I want to offer my warmest congratulations to Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill for their excellent reports, and also to Commissioner Schreyer for the very constructive approach she has shown in the preparation of the budget.
My special thanks, however, go to the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, for the important work he has done so far in building the European Union and bringing nations closer to one another in a joint project that we now call enlargement to the east.
The budget before us will be the first to be drafted for a Community of 25 Member States.
This is a very challenging undertaking technically speaking, as the budget will apply to 15 Member States for the first four months and 25 Member States for the rest of the year.
For this reason the important role of the rapporteurs in drafting this budget must be emphasised.
Fortunately, we have activity-based budgeting, which is now being implemented in earnest for the first time.
It will improve the transparency of the budget and give a better picture of the work that is done within the framework of the European Union.
Activity-based budgeting provides a straight answer to the question of what each activity actually costs.
Eastward enlargement is a challenge for everyone, and has to be taken into consideration throughout the entire budget preparation process.
That starts with administration.
We must continue to have respect for the individual languages of the Member States and hold multilingualism in esteem.
The greatest challenge, however, concerns the Structural Funds.
Enlargement to the east will be an enormous rebuilding project, the largest that Western Europe has embarked on since the Second World War.
For it to succeed, the administration of the Structural Funds must be simplified and dealt with more efficiently.
Only in this way can the results we are striving for be achieved.
Mr President, the Commission has emphasised in its communication that enlargement of the European Union will be the core challenge of 2004.
Whilst the importance of this issue is not to be denied, I do, however, have my doubts as to whether these Budget lines will actually enable the Commission to handle these challenges.
My real concern is with the fact that, in connection with enlargement, provision has been made for expenditure of some EUR 11 billion in 2004, which amounts to only 10% of the total commitment appropriations.
In agricultural expenditure, the proportion is as low as 2.4%.
These proportions are hardly likely to guarantee the Member States participation on an equal basis, even when it is borne in mind that accession will happen as late as 1 May, so what I expect of the Commission is that they should set out in detail in the preliminary draft Budget what legal entitlements the new Member States will have to participation in all programmes funded from the EU Budget.
Funds for the structural measures are very extensive - for this too, sensible advance plans were made in former years - but what is not working is the outflow of resources.
What I expect is that the Commission will not delay long in producing precise figures and an analysis of why this is so and of the obstructions involved.
There is a need here for greater confidence in the system's fairness, for not one euro of structural support funding must be wasted.
For many citizens in the European Union's regions, the projects that depend on such funds are often the last fragile hope for the maintenance of their jobs.
Now, today, the starting pistol has been fired, and the process of drawing up the preliminary draft of the 2004 general Budget can begin; there are important debates before us, and important work remains to be done.
I therefore expect absolute transparency of the whole procedure, coupled with wide-ranging public relations work, which cannot fail to improve the public's perception of the European Union.
Mr President, the President of the Commission recalled the context of the Commission's strategy for 2004.
Mr Prodi was bound to speak of the crisis over Iraq, enlargement and the strategic need for a political project for an enlarged Union.
He also referred to the in-depth assessment of ourselves and our role in the world currently under way in the Convention preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference.
A number of other issues were mentioned such as the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice and, more directly relevant to the budget, the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation on 1 January.
I should like to focus on foreign policy. Clearly, the Union needs an effective, transparent and visible foreign policy.
It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to give some indication of how the policy on decentralisation has evolved.
An update on abnormal outstanding payment commitments would also be helpful. Parliament has been concerned about both these issues for some time now.
In my view, serious thought should be given to heading 4 on foreign policy.
We have been making do and mending for years.
We are, however, likely to be called on to take urgent decisions on Iraq.
We need to deal with Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Balkans and Mediterranean policy too. In addition I believe it is essential for us to review our transatlantic relations.
They are bound to be affected following the conflict with Iraq. Last but not least, Commissioner, we should tackle the matter of relations with Latin America.
I urge the Commission to be consistent as it presents this year's draft budget proposals. It must honour the undertakings given at the Madrid Summit.
Additional priorities cannot be financed out of the same resources. For instance, the Commission is adjusting the system of generalised preferences for countries such as Colombia or Costa Rica, and the Commission is not expected to suggest further budgetary cuts in the draft proposals.
Commissioner, I urge you to bear these considerations in mind.
In my view, if we wish to develop an ambitious foreign policy we must consider how to make available the necessary resources to move forward in the context of foreign policy and defence policy.
If we do not do so I believe we shall continue to be excluded from negotiating tables and be reduced to bankrolling major international events. We will never be involved in decision-making.
I congratulate Mr Prodi on the vision he has shown on opening this debate on strategic priorities. The debate should be linked to the debate on budget guidelines for 2004.
Mr President, the war about to be waged in Iraq in the interests of American imperialism and its allies, is not just an inhumane war; it will have a huge impact on the economy of the European Union and will palpably reduce working class incomes and the revenue of the European Union.
The accession of the new Member States, whose GDP is below the Community average and whose needs are greater, will also cause severe problems.
The European Union 2004 budget guidelines are all about cutting spending on the structural funds and the common agricultural policy and funding the repressive, aggressive common European defence and security policy, using the fight against terrorism and immigration, crisis management and conflict prevention as an excuse.
In other words, agricultural spending is to be slashed in line with the WTO approach and under pressure from the USA, and this will be compounded by mandatory restructuring and an anti-farming slant to the partial reform of the CAP.
All this does is to prove that the budget is still an anti-grass roots budget and that the sacrifices imposed on the workers in the interests of the monopolies are continuing, in the Lisbon vein now, with increased exploitation, attacks on workers' employment and insurance rights, galloping unemployment, environmental disasters and even greater commercialisation of health, education and social services.
The workers, the poor and lower middle classes of urban and rural society, are again being called on to pick up the bill for the recession, so that big business can keep raking in the profits.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are opposed to these budget guidelines because, instead of resolving the problems of workers, farmers and small enterprises, they will create new ones and the standard of living of people in the candidate countries will fall.
Instead of helping to maintain peace, the budget is being used to fund more militarisation and aggression on the part of the European Union and its anti-democratic, anti-grass roots philosophy.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to respond to a number of remarks that have been made about these Budget lines from the point of view of foreign policy.
Traditionally, in the Member States, foreign policy is a matter for governments, but the parliaments are involved via the budget procedure, which enables them to influence foreign policy and the government's setting of priorities.
As there is something of a lack at European level of any counterpart to this sort of democratic control, we welcome the attention given by the Convention to a wider range of options for Parliament to exert influence on fundamental issues of finance for foreign policy concerns.
Above all, we welcome the fact that it was possible, in the course of the 2003 Budget procedure, to come to an agreement with the Council on information concerning measures in the area of foreign and security policy.
For the Council to take significant steps to accede to Parliament's wishes is a new thing, and although it did not, initially, keep to the undertaking it had given during the Budget procedure, information on our activities in Macedonia has now found its way onto the table.
The most recent consultation with the Council made it possible for this to be guaranteed, and I see this as having been a step in the right direction.
Such cooperation between the Council and Parliament is a foundation for our future endeavours.
It is for this reason that we consider particularly important the passage in the guidelines in which Parliament lays renewed emphasis on its willingness to work together with the Council on the common foreign and security policy, and on its own insistence on its involvement to the fullest possible extent in budgeting for joint actions, planning them and taking decisions concerning them.
We have had problems with this in the past, in that financial undertakings given by the Council meant that Parliament ended up being obliged to provide the funds from the Budget.
That can be changed if Parliament is informed and involved in good time.
If that happens, I think these Budget guidelines may well usher in a new stage in cooperation between Parliament and the Council.
Still on the subject of foreign policy, let me make another observation concerning the ad hoc group that we have now set up to examine direct payments to the Palestinian National Authority.
I think this ad hoc group gives us a good opportunity to cooperate with the Commission in seeing exactly what has been done with European taxpayers' money.
We decided not to set up a committee of investigation, which would amount to laying charges at the outset, whereas we simply want to know how this direct aid worked and how we can organise it better in the future.
This working group is about to start work.
This is not so much a problem between Parliament and the Council as one between Parliament and the Commission, and we hope that, in the working group, the Commission will keep to its promise and be willing to work together with Parliament.
Madam President, when analysing what you, President Prodi, called the state of the Union and the related budgetary guidelines, we must take care, as you also said, to avoid two pitfalls.
The first would be to exaggerate our differences, while the second would be to consider them negligible.
If we are to establish a Community foreign policy, if we are to provide this enlarged Union with the means to defend its values, we must not be afraid of debate and, if we may, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps for the first time at this stage, let us discuss the financial resources that we will have to agree to release for this purpose.
As the rapporteur, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for a report on the new architecture of the European security and defence policy, which will be voted on in committee at the end of this month, I welcome the opportunity to introduce this subject without further delay, just as I welcomed the information and signals received over the past few weeks, both from the Commission and from the Council.
With regard to the Council, first of all, at its meeting of 27 January last, the General Affairs Council, in deciding to take charge of the military operation in Macedonia, simultaneously decided to establish an operational financial mechanism designed to cover the share of related spending that will have to be cofunded by the European Union.
This initiative is entirely new and will certainly begin to give some credibility to the stated objectives, which you have just recalled so clearly, President Prodi.
We must now hope that this instrument, which was swiftly drawn up in accordance with Parliament, can be extended to all future EU operations.
With regard to the Commission, I was equally interested to note the account of the recent meeting between you, President Prodi, and the Greek Defence Minister, Giannos Papantoniou, who apparently suggested including a new heading to fund research into defence within the EU budget.
That is precisely one of the new proposals that should certainly be endorsed in a few days by a majority of my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Might I ask you, President Prodi, what your own reaction was to this proposal and when you think it could start to be implemented?
In conclusion, Madam President, President Prodi, unless the Union provides itself with the necessary institutional, operational and financial means, it will be doomed to remain on the sidelines of the international playing field for a long time.
I am sure that this is not what the majority of our fellow European citizens want.
Madam President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the Commission for having done as it promised to do last year and synchronised the debates on the coming year's policy strategy and Budget; I see today as an important occasion and one that bids us shoulder together this great shared responsibility for Europe and its inhabitants.
The questions with which we are faced are of course important ones, and, right now, I want to say one thing in very clear terms: Commissioner, it would be a very great help to us if we did not have to concern ourselves solely with questions that will become relevant after your term of office has expired, such as how we are to proceed after 2006, and what we can expect to face then.
What we have to deal with, quite specifically, is how the Financial Perspective is to be adjusted to take account of enlargement.
I would have been glad if the Commission could have taken a line more openly sympathetic to Parliament in order to secure Parliament's rights, and hence the public interest in the transparency and openness of this process.
We could certainly have done with more explicit statements in this area.
Let me just say now, in very clear terms, that we will have to consider whether we will be in a position, a month from now, to deal with the applications for accession in this House, or whether we perhaps ought first to resolve the institutional question of how Parliament is to be involved in dealing with this important issue.
What I actually wanted to do now was to say something to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, who are now conspicuous by their absence and do not think it necessary to send someone to represent them in this debate - and that itself speaks volumes!
Now that we are discussing enlargement and preparing to welcome to our Parliament observers from the candidate states in only a few weeks' time, we should certainly be giving thought to other options for cooperation - Mr Dover made that point very impressively, and I am very grateful to him for doing so - in order to grow together in a more organised way in our day-to-day work and daily life.
I think it is a pitiable thing for the Greens to table amendments aimed at deleting these passages from Mrs Gill's report.
That is the very opposite of what we need if we want to accommodate over a hundred new Members in this House.
So now, Commissioner, here comes my request that we should now be concentrating on the matters in hand!
I have mentioned the subject of the Financial Perspective, so let me remind you of the Andreasen case.
I have here an internal memorandum from the Commission, which reaches an assessment different from that which you set out in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Now, at long last, we have to sort out the problem with the accounting systems.
One of this Commission's great promises was that this parliamentary term would see things getting moved forward.
When we have worked through all these things properly, then we will be able to talk about the prospects for the EU finances after 2006, but right now there are other things on the agenda, and they have to be sorted out as a matter of urgency if all the things promised since the day the Prodi Commission took office are to be finished by the time its term of office comes to an end.
If we manage that, we will have achieved much for Europe.
Madam President, I believe three basic issues arise out of the 2004 budget guidelines. These are firstly, the potential level of expenditure, secondly, improved implementation, and thirdly, strategic options for expenditure.
As regards the level of expenditure, the Union's budget currently represents 1.02 % of gross Community income, and is at its lowest level.
The present perspectives would allow an additional 5 000 billion.
The same level of expenditure is planned for the 2004 budget.
We are therefore operating in austerity mode, which should please the Council.
Sound implementation is crucial for the 2004 budget.
Payment take up has been well below that forecast during the last three years.
The total surplus for those three years amounts to some 23 000 billion.
Last year's declaration on implementation profiles and the plan to do away with the abnormal RAL must therefore be followed through.
Concerning priorities, I am sure Mr Mulder's report is on the right lines. It takes account of two key issues, namely the concerns and expectations of the citizens on the one hand, and on the other, the conditions needed to allow the budgetary authority to reach a consensual decision.
The 2004 budget is crucial and represents a new departure for the Union. There are a number of reasons why this is so.
The citizens understand that their security, freedom and prosperity demand appropriate budgetary decisions and common instruments.
External border controls, the fight against organised crime and terrorism demand increased capacity for Europol and Eurojust.
Finally, the promotion of business activity is crucial to the success of an enlarged Union.
Many issues are still outstanding. I refer for example to the potential financial implications of agricultural reform or of the adoption of the adjustment of the financial perspectives.
I have to say that I am amazed the Council is not represented in the House today. Nonetheless, the Council must realise that there is only one way of dealing with the challenges before us, and that is by reaching agreement with Parliament.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the Budget and the strategy for 2004.
As has been said, 2004 will be the year of the European Union's enlargement, but it must also be a year in which, at last, the European Union's foreign and security policy is developed further.
So the crucial question is what democratic control there will be when we get a common defence policy.
In this area, democratic control is exercised primarily by way of the Budget procedure.
If we are to have to handle issues of war and peace in the same way as issues of foreign and security policy, such democratic control is even more important than in other areas.
It is in view of the Convention that we need to make certain demands now, demands that will be significant in 2004.
For a start, we have to ensure that the military element of operational expenditure on peacekeeping and crisis management has a fixed place in the European Union's regular Budget and that we in Parliament get full powers of codecision.
Secondly, President Prodi, you said that joint actions were being undertaken in the European Union in the area of research and development, and in the purchase of armaments.
We know that the Convention is talking in terms of an armaments agency, and we must do all in our power to ensure that these Budget lines do not disappear into a shadow budget somewhere, a budget over which neither the European Parliament nor the twenty-five national parliaments will have any control, but rather that these items of expenditure are reflected in the regular Budget of the European Union.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of this joint debate on the European Commission's political strategy for 2004, I am bound to recall that this is the first budget in an enlarged Europe covering the new Member States.
The European Union budget must therefore, now more than ever, contribute to achieving social and regional cohesion, both in the new States and in the current 15 Member States
I support the fact that the priorities selected for this 2004 budget are the completion of the internal market, the strategy for sustainable development, and achieving the Lisbon strategy, in the aim of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
This is, in fact, one of the major challenges facing the European Union, and which stand out because they have immediate and practical implications for every European citizen.
I also welcome the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice which, despite all the criticism it has rightly generated, has at least one virtue: it has increased the number of policies covered by the codecision procedure, thereby giving the European Parliament greater power to act.
Nevertheless, and because the situation is not entirely rosy, I should like to make some criticisms of the European Commission document that has been presented to us today.
Firstly, I agree with the rapporteur on the need to insist that the European Commission makes increasing rural development aid under the CAP its priority guideline. This is precisely the area in which the greatest disparities between Member States can be seen.
Secondly, I urge the Commission to step up the process of streamlining and improving the implementation of the budget, especially in its structural funds policy.
In this context, I support the implementation of more reliable payment provisions, and the European Parliament being better informed about the level of payments underway, by programme, in order to respond to the risks of payments being cancelled.
Specifically in the context of the cancellation of funds, it is my view that Rule N+2, which forces Member States to use funds within two years of their being programmed must be seen as an incentive for the rapid use of funds, without, however, compromising the quality of the expenditure undertaken.
With regard to the structural funds, I should also like to take this opportunity to draw the Commission's attention to a problem of which it has already been made aware: the accession of the new Member States will have the statistical effect of reducing the European Union's average GDP.
Consequently, some regions' levels will increase, with major risks of losing structural funds because they exceed the minimum levels that would entitle them to Community aid.
I wish to emphasise that this, as in fact the Commissioner for enlargement himself, GÃŒnter Verheugen, has said, constitutes wealth on paper, but not in reality.
Statistical indicators alone cannot justify terminating a cohesion policy for the current Member States.
It is entirely in the European Union's interest to see its current Member States enjoy high rates of growth, more employment and more opportunities.
Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the public - especially in the candidate countries - often makes the erroneous assumption that the European Union's Budget deals, in effect, only with agricultural policy.
Such an assumption is not only fatal, but also false.
It is even more important, in times of economic upheaval and renewal, for us to affirm and create social cohesion in order, among other things, to stabilise democracy and gain public acceptance in these new Member States.
Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like, then, to highlight four points from the debate that were of particular importance to us.
In this context, the first is support for the social dialogue.
In practically all the candidate countries there is still the need to establish and reinforce structures that will make the social dialogue a reality.
The second point is the need to improve conditions in the workplace.
Our work in the Member States treats health and safety at work as a priority, and the same must be true in the candidate countries.
The third point is that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has stressed our desire to have greater support, in every case, for the social platform as part of the action programme against social exclusion and discrimination.
I would refer you to the Lisbon resolution in which we highlighted competitiveness and employment opportunities and stressed the need for them.
In the candidate countries, restructuring affects not only agriculture, but still also major, and outdated, sectors of industry.
They need our help with that, help that we can - and should - provide by means of European Union funds.
In all these areas, we rely, of course, on the knowledge of the agencies.
We therefore expect them to receive the financial appropriations that they need.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like briefly to respond to some of the questions, which are extremely interesting. It is a pity that the majority of the Members are absent.
This should be a dialogue. However, I am glad to see that Mr Elles is here, and so I will address my answers primarily to him, for he has asked a number of key questions.
First of all, he raised the issue of whether this perspective is just for five years or whether it is for seven years.
We are not in a position to decide, and so we have kept our options open.
I personally am in favour of a five-year perspective, both because that would synchronise it with Parliament's work and because I feel that a seven-year perspective would be too long, that it would make control too difficult and extend beyond our powers of farsightedness.
Mr Elles also raised the issue of the number of Commissioners.
The problem is not the number of Commissioners but the authority to organise and take decisions accorded to the President.
Whatever the number of Commissioners, the question is how to organise the Commission's work.
It can be managed well with a small number of Commissioners or it can be managed well with a large number of Commissioners.
Then, as regards the staff and the translation service, we have made veritable Herculean efforts and restricted the number of new staff to be employed to cope with enlargement to the bare minimum.
Mr Elles raised a number of other points which I feel it is important to discuss.
For instance, he pointed out possible shortcomings in the chapter on external relations, particularly as regards the transatlantic partnership.
I mentioned one of the two errors to be avoided right at the beginning of my speech, that of failing to understand the importance of the transatlantic partnership, and I did so precisely because I consider it to be crucial.
Indeed, the 'peace group' set up by Commissioner Lamy is concerned with this too.
More specifically, there are two major dimensions of external relations - the regional dimension - 'Wider Europe', the project we are approving today - and the international dimension, which essentially and primarily covers transatlantic relations.
Reforming the Commission has been a priority right from the beginning and, starting in 2004, we will have completely new Staff Regulations.
It has been a huge undertaking. We have a qualification process which covers all the institutions, today we are discussing the annual policy strategy, we have completely transformed the Commission's financial management and we have a new management system giving much greater powers and responsibilities - this is vitally important for our future - to our officials, we also have a new control system and we are working on precisely the new accounting system, as you are aware, Mr Elles.
Seeing as you mentioned the letter, now that I know of its existence I can assure you it will be published immediately, for these things must be made public.
In any case, however, we must realise that, should a disciplinary procedure be necessary, all the rights of those involved in the procedure must be respected.
In any case - I would stress - the letter must be made public without delay.
As far as the famous requests still outstanding are concerned, I will look into it. I will do everything possible and more, employing all available resources to look into it as quickly as possible.
I must say, however, that the fact that 400 requests - as you said , Mr Elles - have yet to be addressed, might mean that too many requests have been made.
I take the blame for the delay in producing some replies, but I believe we have a barrage of extremely important questions to deal with.
I would also like to focus on the point raised by Mr Clegg concerning better regulation, for it is related to these issues.
An agreement is imminent, but I must say that my impression is that Parliament is taking less interest in the matter today than it did some time ago.
I would like to take this opportunity to call for a last spurt so that an agreement can be achieved during the interinstitutional summit on 19 March.
I formally urge the Presidency of Parliament to make the most of this opportunity and to be prepared for a political conclusion next week.
The Commission, for its part, is genuinely ready for this.
General Morillon asked for information on the budget heading and research related to defence.
We are exploring the possibility of financing military research outside the Sixth Framework Programme for research but we do not yet have a definitive answer on this matter.
I have pointed out the need for a debate - it would be useful to discuss the issue and we will submit solutions as soon as possible.
My final points are in response to the questions raised by Mr Swoboda, in other words what he described as the imprecise debate on objectives, on the Balkans and the Mediterranean.
The Commission has presented - and it is supplementing that material today - an extremely precise plan with a clear policy which treats the Balkans as part of Europe.
They will be Members of the Union, but they will be subject to the same strict conditions which have applied to the countries of this first phase of enlargement.
There are no discounts. The door will be open when they approach it, but they will only be allowed to come in when they are ready.
There is absolutely no leeway on this.
I agree with what Mr Swoboda said regarding the issue of the visa policy - which he described as stupid - not because we do not need to be rigorous in protecting the Union's borders but because I genuinely feel that it is a policy which is in need of a complete overhaul.
Indeed, in many cases, criminals have no trouble at all obtaining visas whereas, for normal citizens, this is often a tedious process which is not matched by greater controls, and I am saying this precisely because I have seen how the visa policy is applied in practice. What we need is not, I would stress, to reduce the protection of our borders but, on the contrary, to increase it and make it more effective and focused.
Finally, Mr Caudron's last point: the Commission displays unwarranted optimism in its report. We are in an extremely difficult situation in which everything is falling apart.
I want to make it quite clear that we are fully aware of the difficulty of the situation, of the tragic events taking place, but we are also aware of the huge importance of maintaining a balanced approach which takes all the factors into account, of the need to give maximum consideration to the work of the United Nations, of the fact that the new strategy genuinely calls for stronger, universally supported international institutions, with regard to which Europe's role is indispensable.
I believe that there may well be an extremely serious crisis in the coming weeks, but I am deeply convinced that this very crisis will reveal the indispensable role of the European institutions.
Europe alone has succeeded in uniting with peace as its top priority, introducing and implementing a new concept of national interest and relating it to the common interest, behaving towards the countries which support it with openness and displaying, I would say, a new insight into world relations and issues.
This cannot go unnoticed.
Clearly, at a time of crisis such as this, people are not paying as much heed to us as we might like, but we know that we are sowing seeds for the future.
Thank you, President Prodi.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0046/2003) by Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on reform of the budgetary procedure: possible options in view of the revision of the treaties [2002/2271(INI].
Madam President, the Committee on Budgets decided that it would be wise to draw up a report on this subject.
As a consensus could not be reached on the person to draft it, it decided that the Chairman of the committee should also be the rapporteur and I was left with the wonderful task of putting this report together.
Because of that, I am wearing three hats at the same time - if that is possible.
I wear one hat as the rapporteur and reflect the wishes of the committee in the way it has voted and amended the original draft.
I wear another hat as the Chairman of the committee, thereby keeping an eye on the rapporteur.
I wear my third hat as a British Labour Member who is at odds with a number of amendments from his own political family, the PSE.
It has not been easy trying to put those three together.
It is fair to say that the only change I attempted to make to this report was to try to merge Paragraphs 6 and 8 to make it more coherent.
However, I failed to achieve a consensus amongst the political groups and, therefore, the report stands as it is.
If I could change those hats - which I cannot because I am wearing my hat as the rapporteur - and if I were speaking as a British Labour Member, then I would approve Mrs Buitenweg's text as it reads well, it is simple, concise and, in particular, it does not make any big deal about own-resources!
However, I would run a mile - well perhaps I could manage half a mile - from the amendments by the PSE Group!
Let me make it absolutely clear that I am not speaking as a British Labour Member and, therefore, I cannot say those things.
I have to wear my hat as the rapporteur and speak as the rapporteur, knowing full well that the Chairman is keeping a watchful eye on what I say.
In fairness, the report is acceptable to all the political groups.
The vote was almost unanimous in committee, but there are one or two small points of disagreement on own-resources.
That is why the PSE Group has tabled two amendments.
What we are all agreed upon is that the budget procedure needs to be simplified.
That is quite clear.
The own-resources system in this age of transparency is completely opaque and no one outside the Committee on Budgets or the Budget Directorate-General understands what it is about and how it is made up.
Codecision is needed and, therefore, compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure need to be eradicated.
This is stated quite simply in the first three paragraphs of Mrs Buitenweg's report.
We need to reform, update and simplify our procedures.
There is a need for the budgetary system to be more transparent, comprehensive and democratic, and the codecision procedure should apply to all legislation, including the Financial Regulation and the budgetary procedure.
Under those conditions, compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure would disappear.
I hope when we vote on this - I am sure the vote will be successful - that we can send this along to the members of the Convention and that our Parliament representatives on the Convention can present this as Parliament's position for the future.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's Budget exists to finance its policies and its institutions.
That sentence should be printed at the head of the financial part of the constitutional treaty that will be our future constitution, for it is self-evident that this should incorporate a financial constitution in the form of a chapter devoted to finances.
That is indeed provided for in the outline of the constitutional draft on which the Convention is working.
The chapter on finance should specify the most important budgetary principles and lay down the principal instruments, principles and, above all, rules whereby decisions are to be reached, as regards both outgoings and receipts.
The financial constitution would thereby lay down Parliament's budgetary rights.
The Convention must come to treat this as a core point.
A parliament's budgetary rights are a yardstick indicating the degree to which a system is democratic, and it is the Commission's opinion that the time has now come for the European Parliament to be accorded full budgetary rights.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Wynn, on the competence and extensive experience with which, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, he has even-handedly set out the core points in his report and put forward proposals for the future constitution.
I also congratulate him on his ability, so to speak, to wear three hats at once!
In Budget matters, Parliament and the Commission cooperate so closely that it is not surprising that a very large number of Parliament's proposals are identical with those put forward by the Commission or tend in the same direction.
Among these is the principle that the Budget's receipts and expenditure should balance and that expenditure should not be allowed to be funded from credit.
Another is the proposal that the multiannual financial perspective should be incorporated into the constitution as an instrument; the consequence of this would be that, in future, the multiannual financial perspective would no longer be founded on an agreement, but would become a law enacted jointly by Parliament and the Council on the Commission's initiative.
Even when it comes to the proposal that the European Development Fund should in future be an integrated part of the Community Budget, there is complete agreement.
On the subject of the Community Budget's outgoings, let me also address an issue that has not yet been discussed in the Convention, but is on the agenda, and that is whether or not the future constitution - like the present Treaty - should exclude the possibility of military expenditure being borne by the Community Budget.
Is there not much to be said for the idea that, where Petersberg tasks are undertaken jointly, the costs resulting from these joint operations should be borne by the Community Budget?
That the Community Budget should be funded from own resources is a firmly-embedded principle about which there is no debate, but does the present financial structure reflect the principles of transparency?
Are our financial arrangements sufficiently autonomous; is it enough for Parliament to be able only to give an opinion on the own-resources resolution?
The Commission's view on all these questions is that, no, what we have at present is not enough, and change is urgently needed.
When taking decisions on the own resources, it follows that the sensitivities of the Council and of the national parliaments must also be taken into account.
Even so, the European Parliament should be accorded the right of codecision in this area too.
The financial structure should reflect the fact that the EU is a union of Member States and of citizens.
The Commission has therefore, in its proposal, advocated more direct involvement in financing the European Budget.
If I may turn to the Budget procedure, the Commission shares the position stated in Parliament's report, that the Budget procedure should be simplified and resources concentrated.
The Commission should submit a draft to Parliament, and the first reading in Parliament should be followed by one reading in Council, followed by a consultation and the second reading in Parliament.
If this procedure were to be adopted, the amendment of Council resolutions would require a super-qualified majority in Parliament.
There is also full agreement between the positions of Parliament and the Commission as regards the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, a distinction that could not, in any case, be made clearer to the public and justified to them.
I really do hope that there will be absolute consensus in the Convention, and that this distinction and the consequent curtailment of Parliament's budgetary rights will become a thing of the past.
The constitution's financial chapter should describe the whole of the Budget process in simple words and with unambiguous rules.
It should therefore also refer to the implementation of the Budget and specify not only the Commission's responsibilities but also the Member States' obligation to cooperate.
It should give a fixed place to the discharge for the Budget, and impose on the Community and the Member States the obligation of safeguarding the Community's finances against fraud.
It should, with this in mind, at last enshrine the possibility of instituting the office of Public Prosecutor at Community level.
The public expect Community assets to be able to be protected effectively and fraud to result in criminal prosecution.
The Convention now affords us the opportunity to establish new rules, appropriate to the Union's development, for the European Budget, which is an important Community instrument.
This debate is being held just at the right moment, as the Convention is at this very moment working on the financial chapter; the Convention should adopt this important report by Parliament, and the Commission, in its proposals to it, will be putting forward clear principles and provisions that will, in particular, put the case for Parliament to enjoy full budgetary rights.
Thank you for your attention.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate Mr Wynn on his work as both Chairman and rapporteur.
His is an excellent report. I am delighted it has been favourably received by all the political groups.
I should like to point out to Mr Wynn that even as disparate a group as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats only intends to table a single amendment. This is an indication of the scale of our effort to achieve consensus and support the report.
Further, my group strongly supports adjustment of the current system of distinguishing between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.
This has now become a common position of Parliament. It should always be taken into account when specific types of expenditure can be guaranteed, notably in the case of agriculture.
We endorse most of the proposals put forward by the Convention's working groups seeking to ensure the principle of a dual budgetary authority: Parliament and Council.
The Group of the European People's Party is of the opinion that the most effective way of ensuring this comes about is to formalise a balance between both branches of the budgetary authority.
The budget would be adopted by a codecision procedure adjusted to this specific case. In the event of failure to reach agreement, the Council would have the final say on income and Parliament on expenditure.
As regards the financial perspectives, we believe it is imperative to endow them with greater flexibility. This would ensure an effective response to unexpected situations.
Unduly rigid provisions have sometimes served to safeguard expenditure. On other occasions, however, such rigidity has hindered more effective allocation of resources.
We fully endorse the proposal by the Convention's working group to include financial perspectives in the treaty, together with provisions on discipline and budgetary cooperation.
In the interests of providing continuity regarding financial decisions, financial perspectives should cover the five-year term of Parliament and the Commission.
Finally, reform of the budgetary procedure must be based on simplification with a view to greater democratisation, legitimacy and transparency.
We therefore fully endorse the proposal to do away with first reading in the Council, as this seems to be consistent with the objective of simplification.
Further, we reject the amendments leading beyond this debate, as we wish the document presented to the Convention to enjoy the fullest possible support of the House.
Madam President, only a few stalwarts are in the House at present. Nonetheless, history has shown that the budget is the cornerstone of representative democracies.
They can only flourish if Parliament controls the sovereign's expenditure.
We are on the point of adopting the first European constitution.
The Union has been in existence for 46 years and budgetary powers have remained unchanged for the last 30.
I therefore believe updating is imperative. Several points are now obsolete.
In addition, if the treaty were applied to the letter it would not be in line with the reality of present day budgets.
Mr Garriga Polledo referred to budgetary perspectives a moment ago. There is no provision for these in the treaty, though the Council often seems to be unaware of that fact.
Ladies and gentlemen, the constitution must encompass the budgetary process and own resources.
The mantra of seventeenth century revolutions was 'no taxation without representation'.
Precisely the opposite applies in the European Union. There is strong democratic representation in the form of this House, but taxation is not approved democratically.
Essentially, the own resources system amounts to national contributions by another name, even though these are legally the Union's own resources.
This cannot be allowed to continue.
Resources should henceforth come directly from the citizen. The citizen would then understand that taxes are destined to the Union's budget.
This is a basic feature of democratic responsibility. Otherwise, Finance Ministers will go on collecting the money and the Community will go on spending it and the reasons will remain unclear.
This is bad for democratic control.
It is therefore necessary to move towards a system enabling this connection to be made without increasing the total tax burden on the citizens. Personal and possibly progressive taxation should be introduced.
It would then no longer be possible to allege, as is often the case, that unemployed citizens in eastern Germany are subsidising large landowners in Andalusia. Please excuse this crude simplification.
The result is unhealthy populism. It is essential to ensure that it will no longer be possible to distinguish between the various countries' contributions under any future financial system.
A citizen's contribution should be based on his or her personal resources.
It should not depend on his or her place of residence. In my view, this must be a key feature of the new approach, that is, of the new way of tackling the system of resources.
Madam President, this is the main point the Socialist Group wishes to make.
Other honourable Members will speak on further aspects of our stance.
The rapporteur, the chairman of our committee and my esteemed fellow-Member from the British Labour Party have really given all groups ample opportunity to contribute their ideas and to attempt to reach a compromise.
I give him my most sincere thanks for that.
Nevertheless, my group is not completely satisfied with the end result.
We have chosen not to table any amendments, because it would result in a kind of hotchpotch, but instead to table an alternative resolution.
We have opted to do that precisely because absolute clarity is necessary when it comes to establishing the form the budgetary procedure of the future should take.
For example, we also wanted to make it very clear right from the outset how competences should be divided up.
The Council and Parliament should negotiate with each other to reach common agreement both on the structure and the ceiling of the financial resources for the EU budget and on the annual or multi-annual expenditure.
Should the negotiations fail, the Council would simply have the last word on revenue and Parliament on expenditure.
In our resolution, we also keep repeating the necessity of having codecision powers in all legislation.
It is all very well to argue for an end to the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, but if we do not also have the power or codecision over the legislation, we are often left empty-handed.
Then a situation can arise in which we do have codecision over agricultural expenditure but in which we are obliged to simply hand out money to farmers because they have a right to it under European law.
In addition, the judgment of the Court of Justice on the legal basis has taught us that we cannot take any budgetary decisions in our own right without a legal basis.
I should like to conclude that budgetary codecision is of no benefit to us as a Parliament if we do not have legislative codecision.
The two matters must go hand in hand.
Madam President, Mr Wynn's report is consistent with the very high standard we have come to expect from him in this House.
However, he will understand if, from my group's perspective, I cannot go along with the suggestion that we abolish the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.
I signal openly to the rapporteur that I will seek to remove this suggestion from what, as I have already said, is otherwise a very constructive report.
The distinction is there for one simple reason and it has served its purpose well down the years.
That reason is to depoliticise decision-making when it comes to the agricultural budget.
Farming is perhaps the industry in the most precarious position in the European Union at present.
There are onslaughts on farm income from left, right and centre.
I will not attempt to outline my objection to the CAP reform proposals in today's budget debate, but I wish to make one very short and simple point: farmers need to plan ahead and they need policy stability.
Exposing the common agricultural budget to the vagaries of annual political battles in the European Parliament will wreak untold havoc on farm income and on the viability and competitivity of the European farm sector vis-Ã -vis the world market.
I appeal to the House to consider this when voting tomorrow.
Farm income in Ireland and many other Member States is very much dependent on the direct income support from the European Union budget.
Stability arises from the fact that such expenditure has hitherto derived from legally binding assurances and we must continue to give these assurances.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, under the process of revising and simplifying the Treaties, which is currently being debated in the Convention on the Future of Europe, the European Parliament has taken the opportunity to apply itself to the reform of the European Union's budgetary procedure.
In fact, year after year, reform after reform, the budgetary procedure has been amended on an informal basis, by means of political agreements between the various institutions involved.
These informal amendments have rendered the current text redundant and obsolete.
The next constitutional Treaty must contain articles covering the principles that govern the budget and the procedures for approving it.
As a contribution to the debate on this report that the Committee on Budgets has presented on its own initiative, I wish first of all to congratulate our Chairman and rapporteur, Terence Wynn on his commitment and on the exemplary quality of his work.
I wish to express my full and unequivocal agreement with the proposals for reform that have been tabled.
Firstly, because I believe we must seize this opportunity to review the issue of the European Union's funding.
More Europe means, amongst other things, more money.
The contribution of the Member States must be appropriate and in proportion to the objectives that the European Union wishes to achieve.
It is entirely utopian to set objectives, such as those of the Lisbon Summit, which uphold the current financial framework.
It should be added that the European Union itself must undertake a thoroughgoing study into its own resources for funding the EU budget.
Secondly, because I can see that, in addition to these new challenges, a new reality is approaching: a European Union with 25 Member States.
In this context, the Structural Funds will reveal their fundamental importance, on the one hand, to achieving economic and social cohesion in the new States and, on the other, to continuing the progress that has been made in the current Member States.
Thirdly, because I believe that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure and their respective procedures has become artificial.
I am therefore in favour of a complete revision of the procedures, giving the European Parliament greater power to act by means of the codecision procedure, thereby achieving an equal footing with the Council.
In this context, budgetary expenditure for the common agricultural policy (CAP) would then be studied by the European Parliament under the codecision procedure.
If it is adopted, this measure would represent an historical development for the European Parliament, which has been forced to remain at a distance in political terms from the CAP since its inception, despite the fact that the CAP today accounts for more than 50% of the EU's total budget.
Greater involvement of the European Parliament in the CAP can only be positive for farmers and for rural development.
This will provide greater control over the use of funds.
I would remind you that every year, enormous sums intended for the CAP end up being refunded to the Member States because they have not been properly used.
It is also worth adding that the CAP is becoming increasingly diffuse, incorporating new dimensions, such as rural development, conservation of the environment and food safety and quality, and consequently requires funding that corresponds to this new state of affairs, which is of the utmost importance to European citizens.
Only last week, Eurostat published data that warrants our utmost interest: European citizens, including those of the future Member States, feel that the CAP's priorities should be food safety and support for improving rural life.
By the European Parliament having this greater ability to act, the economic, social and environmental interests of European farmers will be safeguarded.
Madam President, Commissioner, our debate is being conducted under the heading of 'reform of the budgetary procedure', which is a modest title for an ambitious enterprise.
It would probably be more appropriate to speak in terms of a reform of the financial constitution, for we want the Convention to produce a coherent draft for a constitution that will advance European integration.
We want the Treaty to be underpinned by democratic legitimacy, to be transparent and effective, and to give the public unambiguous answers to their questions as to what the federation of states and peoples called Europe can - and must - achieve in the interests of its citizens.
The European Union's Budget must enjoy the very same democratic legitimacy in its function of financing European policy.

What we urgently need, then, is not just changes to the Budget procedure, but a reform of our public finances, and what this will require is plain for all to see, encapsulated in our demand for all Budget areas to be subject to the codecision procedure - even decisions on the own-resources system, the structure of which is in need of fundamental change.
Whilst it has to be admitted that the present system of finance works, it meets with criticism quite apart from its undemocratic nature.
Neither what we receive from VAT or out of gross domestic income can really be described as the European Union's own resources.
The fact is that they are transfers from the Member States, and that is precisely the argument used by the Member States when the positions of net contributors are under discussion.
It is not immediately evident to the public which taxes go towards financing the EU's outgoings.
The proportion of what are termed traditional own resources is decreasing all the time, and the whole system is mutating from genuine self-financing into the transfer of lump sums.
Nor does what we call the British rebate have any rationale behind it any more, Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Wynn, and, wearing only my one hat - in my capacity as rapporteur for the PSE on own resources - I can tell you that, in that area too, the British rebate makes no sense any longer, any more than does its being funded in different ways by the other Member States.
It should be abolished!
The structure of the Budget has ceased to provide any justification for it.
Changes have had to be made in the structure of the European Budget's expenditure over the past fifteen years.
Policies already in existence, such the agriculture policy, were reformed, and other policy areas were added, such as structural policy and pre-accession aid, and this renders obsolete the imposition of an unfair burden on everyone else by preferential treatment for Great Britain.
All this leads to the logical conclusion that we should introduce a tax to replace the former own resources, and that this should be done without imposing additional burdens on European taxpayers, who would, though, be able to see, at last, how they are funding the European Union.

Let us in this Parliament, then, not demand less than the Commission has already done, but, rather, join together in taking a great step towards greater transparency and democracy.
(Applause)
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the main points of the report presented by the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, have already been described.
We can all, therefore, understand its importance.
Reforming the budgetary procedure is by no means a technical issue that can only be handled by specialists.
Quite the opposite: it is an eminently political subject: it concerns our ability to give substance to European integration and demonstrate our solidarity through action.
I personally would simply like to remind the participants in the current negotiations of their responsibilities.
That means going beyond the sterile little game of defending national privileges and territory in the short term.
That kind of attitude never leads to successful negotiations, ending instead with lame compromises which, at the end of the day, do not satisfy anyone.
It is time we looked to see where the true interests of Europeans as a whole lie.
We need to create a virtuous circle where the concessions made by the various parties ultimately benefit everyone.
If this state of mind is allowed to triumph, I think it will be possible to seize the opportunity provided by the Convention.
Let us therefore have the political courage necessary to demand a genuine reform which, I reiterate, includes, specifically, removing the distinction between mandatory and non-mandatory spending, establishing a European tax and laying down uniform rules for all the Member States.
The Convention must establish a genuine codecision procedure, within which framework Parliament and the Council can work together as equals to handle all aspects of the Community budget and the other financial instruments available to European politicians.
This method alone will make it possible to strengthen the democratic nature of the European budget decisively and to bring the citizens closer to our institutions, as we want with all our hearts.
Mrs Guy-Quint, I would congratulate you on having managed to speak calmly and clearly amid this hullabaloo.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mr President, yesterday we had a short debate in this House about a very serious matter: asking the Commission to respond in a debate to allegations concerning its Budgets DG.
Unfortunately, it transpires that in that debate Mr Watson, the leader of the Liberal Group, factually misled the House and thereby influenced the House by indicating that the Director-General of the Commission's internal audit service, Mr Muis, was attending last night's meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control to discuss this matter and therefore no debate was needed.
Mr Muis did not attend last night.
In fact it is only because of pressure applied at last night's meeting by the PSE Group and the PPE-DE Group that he could be attending a meeting next week.
Would Mr Watson like to tell us whether he deliberately misled the House, or is this just another example of British Liberal Democrats' inability to call failing Commissioners to account?
I should point out to the Member that in the matter of accountability the ELDR Group has an excellent record in this House.
(Mixed reactions)
Mr President, it is an honour to be attacked by one of the Conservative Party's young Turks.
(Mixed reactions)
I gave the House information which I believed to be correct.
In fact I said to the House that I 'understood' that Mr Muis was going to be at the committee meeting, but I am pleased that later on in that debate the Chairman of the committee herself said that she was unaware Mr Muis was going to be there, so the House was in no way misled.
Had I had different information, I would have communicated it.
Mr President, today's vote on these four reports concludes the long process of adapting the comitology system which came into force in 1987, a process which started in 1998 with the Commission proposal, continued with the adoption of the new Council decision in June 1999 and which we are, at last, concluding today by approving with these four reports the bringing of all the existing committees into line with the system which has been in force since 1999. This has been a mechanical and, I am sure, tedious project for the people who have dealt with the details and, on behalf of our institution, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to them today.
It has taken four years to bring the hundreds of committees into line with the new system and to prepare for the vote which we are about to take.
This figure alone makes it clear that a great deal of work really does remain to be done if we are to give the Union a system for implementing its rules which is transparent, simple and helps to improve the as yet unsatisfactory way in which Community rules are implemented.
Parliament has worked furiously to make substantial improvements to the comitology system.
I would, therefore, on this occasion, like to pay tribute to the patient, accurate work of the rapporteur during those years, Mrs Adelaide Aglietta, who succeeded in fully involving Parliament in the comitology discussions, which was no easy matter at that time.
I am sure that the proposals on comitology presented last December by the Commission and the proposals in the recent texts submitted to the Convention are also the result of this work.
Although, in 1999, it was not possible to achieve what Parliament has always wanted, namely parity with the Council and the option of revoking an implementing measure when it is considered to be contrary to the will of the legislator, this path now seems to be open.
At that time, the intransigence and formalism of the Commission and the Council prevented us from achieving that result and we had to be content with a modest alarm bell system. Now, thanks, not least, to that year and a half of patient, sometimes obscure work, the Commission appears to have changed its position and the Convention looks set to overcome the bureaucratic reservations of the governments.
It is my genuine hope that the reports we are voting on today will soon be forgotten or superseded too, and that the mysteries of the comitology system will be confined to the history books.
Mr President, the committee agreed overwhelmingly on the need to restrict self-handling to ships' crew.
Now, though, we have the problem that these expressions are used very differently in the various translations, not only the German, but also the English and French versions.
As I see it, knowing that the basis must be the German text, the most correct and tidy translation is the English one, which refers to 'regular seafaring crew', enabling Parliament to make it abundantly clear that we are not talking about what is done on land, but only about what can be done by the ship's crew, using their own equipment, and nothing more.
That is why I would like this made clear by the language used in the translations.
'Seafaring crew' and 'Schiffsbesatzung' would have the additional advantage over the expression used in the German version, in that 'seemÃ€nnische' in German still has a very masculine ring to it, whilst 'Schiffsbesatzung' and 'seafaring crew' could be said to be gender-neutral, which would have an advantage in terms of gender mainstreaming.
(Loud applause)
Before I turn to the rapporteur for advice, I have been informed that Amendment no 48, as you suggested, constitutes a linguistic amendment in several languages.
It is an important linguistic clarification, but the primary amendment in this regard is Amendment no 13.
My suggestion, if the rapporteur agrees, would be to vote on Amendment No 13 first and then to vote on the relevant parts of Amendment No 48 and the linguistic dimensions therein.
Mr President, I, too, think it would be right to vote on Amendment No 13 first, but I do believe that, in the event of Amendment No 13 being adopted - which I hope it will be - all the others will lapse.
I do not see the need to vote on the others.
As regards the question of language, we should not be having a great debate about it right now, but should proceed as follows.
The committee wants - as, I assume does this House - to delete the words 'regular land-based personnel' from the Council's version.
Whatever is in the other part - 'seafaring personnel' - we do not want to change it, and it should remain in the text the way it is in the Council version, so that questions of language do not bring us into conflict with the Council.
So what we are aiming to do is to delete the words 'regular land-based personnel', and we should approximate the terminology used in English, French, and so on to the Council's Common Position, as we should not deviate from that.
Thus far, I believe that Mr Piecyk and I are of one mind without having to engage in great linguistic discussions.
Mr President, I wish to ask whether, following the vote on Amendment No 13, Amendments Nos 56 and 57 should now lapse.
Let me explain: the purpose of Amendment No 13 was to restrict self-handling to crew members.
If I understand correctly, Amendments Nos 56 and 57 concern conditions for granting licences for port operators to undertake self-handling.
This makes no sense in my opinion, however, when we are restricting self-handling to crew members.
Mr President, my group believes that this amendment should not fall even if Amendment No 24 is adopted.
Mr President, this amendment is redundant, as sentence 2 of Amendment No 24 makes provision for the eventuality of an appeal at law.
The reference therein to Article 17 (3) of the directive is final, and so we cannot now vote on any alternative options.
There is no doubt in my mind that this amendment must lapse.
Mr President, I do not agree with the rapporteur.
I think that the amendment can indeed supplement the amendment by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that has now been approved, and that it is a more precise statement of the content of the first amendment.
Mr President, when we, in the PPE-DE Group, tabled Amendment No 4 we added the words: '... expects the legislative procedure to be concluded by the end of June 2003 at the latest'.
I suggest that Amendment No 8, by the PSE Group and others, is split so that we have the first section from the start, 'welcomes the fact that the Commission has presented ...', down to the words '... in the Commission's budget' as the first split.
The second split should be the remainder of that amendment.
We would support the first part and oppose the second.
That split would then be followed by a third vote - it need not be a roll-call vote - which would take up our words which stand alone from the rest of it: '... expects the legislative procedure to be concluded by the end of June 2003 at the latest'.
I ask for your permission, Mr President.
- Mr President, the proposed deletion does not make sense.
There is no reason to have the remainder of the paragraph as it has been suggested.
That is a matter for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to deal with.
The reason we have a reference here is to try to take a decision as to whether, under the proposal from the Commission, the funding should be moved to Parliament's budget or not.
I do not think it should be moved to Parliament's budget, in the interests of transparency and accountability and also because it has cost implications.
It is important that we leave it in the Commission's budget.
Therefore I suggest that we support Amendment No 8 as it stands.
Mr President, just on a point of order, Mr Dover appears to have requested a split vote, and there are rules governing that sort of procedure.
Therefore, if it can be done, that is all well and good: it will be a precedent that we should follow.
Thank you for your cautionary advice, Mrs Frassoni.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0046/2003) by Terence Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on reform of the budgetary procedure: possible options in view of the revision of the treaties (2002/2271(INI))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
. It is now 20 years since it became compulsory in Britain for car drivers and front-seat passengers to wear seat belts.
That law has saved an average of 7 lives every day.
Yet lives are still being needlessly lost because those rules do not apply to coach passengers.
Too often the European Parliament becomes bogged down with regulations which do little to help our constituents.
This directive is our chance to make a real difference - to reduce the tragic waste of lives lost on our roads.
That is why the British Conservatives welcome this report and congratulate all of those who have helped to bring forward these long-overdue measures.
However, we are disappointed that the proposals do not go further.
It is time that the safety of children on school buses was given the consideration that it so urgently needs.
It is unacceptable that children are being taken to school on buses without seatbelts and that many children are forced to stand due to there being too few seats.
Naturally, I fully support this report.
Firstly, because I believe it is crucial and of the utmost importance to reduce the number of fatalities on Europe's roads, which today stands at around 45 000 per year and mainly because I am convinced that the compulsory use of seatbelts has made a positive contribution to reducing these tragic figures.
It is indeed bizarre that in the third millennium, road accidents are the main cause of death amongst children.
As a Portuguese citizen, I am particularly concerned to note the fact that my country, together with Spain and Greece, is responsible for a significant share of Europe's total number of fatalities.
As the rapporteur states, this proposal must be seen simply as an integral part of a broader action plan.
In this context, I think that this plan in particular could be linked with European transport policy and seek for example, to provide safer alternatives to road transport as swiftly as possible.
Furthermore, I believe it is crucial to invest in implementing genuinely preventive measures since, although the safety belt is an important measure, it serves only to minimise the effects of accidents.
I am referring, in particular, to improving road signage, to stepping up passive protection, to monitoring...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) Drugs are one of the issues of greatest concern to European citizens.
Combating drugs requires a European dimension that includes the immediate adoption of legal instruments against the manufacture and trafficking of drugs, cooperation with producer countries and the promotion of preventing and combating drug addiction.
Mr Pirker's proposal responds to the steady increase in the production and trade in synthetic drugs.
It is a matter of concern that most illegally produced synthetic drugs originate in Europe - according to data compiled in 1999 by the Swiss Federal Criminal Investigation Office, the Netherlands alone accounts for more than 50% of world production.
There is an urgent need for effective and rigorous control of the manufacture and sale of substances which, whilst also being chemical products with legitimate applications, are frequently diverted to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
This does not apply to the legal trade in these substances, specifically the manufacture of medicines.
I support this proposal, which transforms the current directive into a Regulation, allowing legislation to be simplified, making it easier to implement - in a uniform and concurrent way - (which is even more important in the context of enlargement).
The main aim is to monitor the trade in drug precursors in a harmonised way and prevent their misuse for illicit drugs production, through closer cooperation between the competent authorities and economic operators (who should immediately notify the authorities of unusual orders or transactions), which must be extended to substances that have not to date been included on our lists.
. (PT) I agree with this report first of all because I am extremely concerned at the fact that Europe is described as the main source of illegally produced synthetic drugs.
As if this were not serious enough, reports from international bodies such as the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), have also revealed that the production of and trade in synthetic drugs continues to increase.
Consequently, the way effectively to combat drugs lies, primarily, in effective precursor control.
There are, however, some obstacles to this control and it cannot be undertaken simply by prohibiting the use of these substances.
Precursors are not used purely for illicit drug production, which means that ensuring effective control will entail some sacrifice on the part of medicine manufacturers, for example.
I feel that the report has achieved a reasonable balance on this point.
Lastly, I believe it is equally crucial to adopt measures on Internet sites that promote the sale of these substances and provide information on how to produce them.
. (PT) I have voted in favour of all of these four reports by Mrs Frassoni, despite some difficulties that this matter raises.
Indeed, the use of comitology must be marked by greater transparency in the work of the various committees, focusing especially on the need to provide the EP with the agendas for and summary records of committee meetings, lists of participants, draft implementing measures submitted to the committees, provisional calendars of meetings and details of the outcome of votes.
Furthermore, all committee documents, with the exception of confidential documents, of course, should be accessible to the public.
I therefore agree with the assessment made by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs stating that it is not the intention of the European Parliament to usurp implementing powers pertaining to the Commission: what it is actually seeking to do is to introduce a system that will enable it properly to exercise control and, if necessary, to contest an implementing measure with which it does not agree when this falls under the codecision procedure.
This is the only way of ensuring that the legislative process and Parliament's powers as co-legislator are fully respected.
Mr President, it is very good to see you again, and I hope to visit you again in person in future.
I am very pleased that you are now President of Parliament, but I should just like to talk about this directive.
My group, or at least D66, voted for this directive to provide for the possibility of fair competition in ports and to prevent social dumping.
That means that all parties, including self-handlers, must have the required high social standards and professional qualifications.
In addition, the Member States and the port authorities, in particular, must lay down conditions in the field of safety and environmental protection.
What is important is that the Council and Parliament draw up and present the directive in such a way as to rule out the possibility of social dumping, and also the possibility of rigid protection of one of the parties, and I hope, therefore, that the negotiations are productive.
Mr President, the ports of Harwich, Felixstowe and Tilbury are in my constituency.
Hundreds of dockworkers are concerned today about this directive, one I believe was never required in the first place, mistaking, as it does, competition within ports for the real aim, which should be competition between ports.
Nevertheless I am very proud that the European Parliament has passed amendments ensuring that action is taken against unfair public subsidies, that pilotage is excluded for good safety reasons, and - perhaps most important - that the new providers have to protect workers' rights properly and work under the EU flag, not one of convenience.
Above all, with a 36-year phase-in period where there is major investment, I believe that no dockworkers currently working in Harwich, Felixstowe or Tilbury need have their jobs affected for their lifetime.
I call on those involved in the conciliation to stick resolutely by Parliament's amendments, so that we can ensure that the safety of our docks and the jobs of our dockworkers are put first.
On the pretext of creating a single operating framework and providing better port services, the private sector is being paid to take over a sector which is still being run as a public utility.
Existing ports are being given the opportunity to start providing more services in any sector they deem profitable, in contrast to the public administration and central service provider which takes care of necessary - if unprofitable - activities.
Under the new system, terms and operating licences will be the preserve of a decision-making centre, which will be different from the past port services provider, because the same agency cannot act as both service provider and port manager.
Corporations providing port services must comply with transparency requirements in their financial dealings with the public authorities.
However, there is no evidence of any such obligation on the part of the private sector.
The directive specifically mentions staff.
Under Article 6.5, the service provider has the right to employ personnel of his own choice, but no reference whatsoever is made to qualifications or training.
What we want are port services which operate transparently, which provide the same standard of service to everyone, as well as employment rights for workers, environmental protection and safe ports.
. (FR) The aim of the directive, which is to establish common rules for sea ports in order to increase their role in terms of transport and give them pride of place in intermodality, by means of transparent access to port services, must not be achieved regardless of the cost, in other words by forsaking a high level of maritime safety, effective environmental protection and satisfactory employment conditions for workers in this sector.
The directive under examination, however, calls into question the social rights of workers, the subject of self-help being the paradigmatic example: it would allow self-handling to be entrusted to 'land-based personnel' employed by shipowners, which would probably lead to this work being taken away from professional docker workers and other qualified technical personnel and given instead to cheaper, unqualified workers.
The risks of social dumping are clear.
I shall therefore vote to reject this directive, a position that will certainly not be shared by the majority of the EP.
That is why I shall then vote for any amendments that seek to increase the protection of workers provided for by the text.
. (FR) Parliament, the Council and the Commission continue in and confirm their desire to liberalise port services.
The small amount of progress that has been made, such as deleting pilotage services from the directive, does not reverse the process that is underway and we fear that pilotage services will only enjoy short-term respite.
If liberalisation - a synonym for abandoning public service missions, combined with social regression for workers and serious violations of environmental and safety standards - is to fail, workers and users of port services must be rallied on a large scale.
The dock workers threatened by self-handling, in other words by the possibility for shipowners and charterers to use their own staff to load and unload their ships, have led the way by organising several European strikes and demonstrating in their thousands in front of the European institutions.
We supported and still support their action.
That is why we have voted to reject the directive.
It will lead to environmental, social and human tragedies, just like the liberalisation of the rail sector.
These disasters will no longer take place along our coasts, like the Erika and Prestige shipwrecks, but within the ports.
In order to combat liberalisation, we must promote a public port service that is coordinated at European level and guarantees the highest possible levels of safety and social standards.
Having opened maritime transport to ultra-liberal competition, with its known consequences: polluted beaches, French fishermen killed by a Norwegian tanker carrying chemicals, piloted by Sri Lankans, the European Commission is now going to deliver port services, from pilotage to dock work, into the hands of private services, in the name of competition between ports, competitiveness and cost reduction, as in the case of the air and rail sectors.
The opening of the market, which will apparently be limited to large ports, although we do not know whether that means those handling 3 million tonnes of freight or those handling 45 million, will, for example, include 'self-handling'. In other words the ship's crew, who I imagine will be underpaid workers from South-East Asia, a reservoir of new slaves to world capitalism at the service of social dumping, will be able to carry out dock work, all under a flag of convenience.
The debate is limited to ascertaining whether concerns for safety will make it possible to exclude pilotage and towage from port 'privatisation'.
That said, our dock workers in Marseilles, SÃšte and other large ports will be handed over to the pirates of ultra-liberalism.
The destruction of port employment will be added to the destruction of fisheries employment.
The rebellion and despair of these men in the face of a directive produced by the hawks of economic globalisation is understandable.
- (NL) The ports between Hamburg in Germany and Le Havre in France, and all the Dutch and Belgian ports in-between, see the most competition of all ports.
This is because together they serve largely the same extensive hinterland, including the German Ruhr district, through which flows of cargo can constantly move from one port to another.
As a result, the transhipment costs per quantity of cargo are already lower in these ports than in America or East Asia.
The effects of a ports directive, which aims to encourage competition in order to drive down the price of port activity, are the most far-reaching in precisely those ports.
They cannot operate at still lower costs, and yet they are forced to do just that.
In ports such as these, the risk of social dumping and deteriorating safety is much greater than where one port has a virtual monopoly over a smaller hinterland.
The port or port town that has the strictest requirements regarding safety, environment, quality of work and working conditions loses the competition, and the worst port is the winner.
Furthermore, the directive will force EU Member States to act contrary to obligations they have entered into within the framework of the ILO Convention.
Opting for self-handling at second reading and declaring that votes on the obligations under the ILO Convention are not in order throws up conflicts for the third reading, and, after that, legal proceedings and strikes.
. (FR) This directive is far from perfect - the States must be able to demand that the rules in force for land-based personnel should apply to seafaring crew carrying out self-handling activities cited in the annex to the directive - but it is welcome nonetheless.
The reluctance shown by some companies merely demonstrates a categorical rejection of the opening up of port services to competition.
This autocratic logic is not just a rejection of the principle of a market economy.
The formal declarations on maintaining public service obligations, the guarantee of jobs and the preservation of safety and the environment in ports - which are perfectly legitimate objectives that nobody is disputing - conceal the far less noble desire to defend monopolies, in particular trade union monopolies, that some believe to be untouchable.
The implementation of a large-scale project such as 'Port 2000' in Le Havre, the largest French port in terms of container goods trading, clearly shows that our ports and companies in the sector are not afraid of the introduction of a more competitive dynamic into port services.
On the contrary, by equipping themselves with the infrastructure necessary to prepare for the future, ports will be able to meet the challenge posed by the opening up of the market and overcome it.
. (PT) Following the shipwreck of the Prestige, concerns have been growing about maritime safety.
I share these concerns because my country has a long coastline, which is highly dependent on maritime resources.
For these reasons and because these problems also affect other countries in the European Union, the Jarzembowski report on port services warrants our full consideration.
With regard to the regulations on pilotage, I think that it makes sense to remove these from the scope of this decision.
Every Member State must be able, for reasons of public interest, to maintain the current system, taking account of specific local characteristics.
This report is marked by the way in which it maintains a degree of balance between liberalising port services and demonstrates ongoing concern for social legislation on worker protection, maritime safety and environmental protection in sensitive regions.
This balance has already been achieved in the liberalisation of air and rail transport.
With regard to social and labour legislation, the rights of workers in EU ports must be safeguarded.
I therefore support the opinion of the rapporteur advocating greater protection for these workers, not forgetting the need to maintain qualified personnel in ports and insisting on measures for the training of crew members.
. (PT) We are broadly in agreement with the Commission's proposal for a directive on ports and infrastructures for maritime transport, which is intended to create or re-establish transparent conditions of competition for all EU ports, in the specific context of opening up the market to the various port services.
The services covered by this directive for towing, mooring, cargo-handling, including loading and unloading, do not warrant special attention.
The issue lies in whether or not to exclude pilotage activities in those covered by this directive.
Since I believe pilotage to be a job that requires considerable experience and which is extremely important to the safety of maritime traffic in ports, I agree with the majority vote achieved in this Parliament, which I supported with my vote in favour of the report.
.
(PT) My vote is intended above all to highlight three points that I believe are crucial: firstly, what is known as 'self-handling', must not be surreptitiously subverted, opening the door to all types of opportunism and market distortion. Instead, it should properly be restricted to the ship's own crew and undertaken in conjunction with the competent port operator; secondly, the system of pilotage in ports must be kept outside the scope of the directive and reserved for national legislation; thirdly, it is crucial that the way is opened for clear rules on State aid in this field to be properly defined, as suggested during the debates on the Green Paper and on which, regrettably, the text of the directive still says very little.
Lastly, where the directive makes significant economic amendments to the port operating system, I believe it is also crucial to provide for transitional systems that protect the rightful interests of those operators who have nevertheless accepted ongoing obligations imposed by national legislation and whose economic balance could suffer irremediably.
In general, we think that the proposal is balanced and constructive, with the exception, however, of the inadequately justified limitation upon self-handling.
Restricting, as now, self-handling to apply only to personnel on board a vessel and not to land-based personnel such as employees at a factory near the port, means that the legislation ignores how the business operates.
The opportunities for competition within this area are in this way reduced.
We have therefore chosen to vote against the committee where these aspects are concerned.
With regard to pilotage services, we agree with the proposal that the nature of these is such that they ought not to be covered by the directive.
. (PT) The rapporteur recalls the low level of payments set and accepts the trend of reducing the EU budget's share of Community GNI/GNP.
Given this situation, with the systematic increase in priorities and with the savings policy that has been pursued - inseparable from the Stability Pact and which contains the systematic practice of cuts, freezes, call-backs, redeployment and reprogramming of budgetary expenditure - consequences that are damaging to the implementation levels of the EU's traditional priorities are inevitable, especially in the social fields and those of cohesion and cooperation. The very credibility of the budgetary process is also undermined.
We are now seeing further problems with defining priorities, such as that given to the Lisbon strategy, or to issues of immigration and asylum.
The rapporteur also concedes on the need for changes to national budgetary policy when he accepts the current framework of financial perspectives and even the existing limitations in internal and external policies.
He does so to the point of contradicting himself, where Afghanistan is concerned, stating on the one hand, that he would not reduce support for other regions but then says, on the other hand, that he intends to evaluate the possibilities of redeploying the budget and of making it more flexible.
Furthermore, priority is still not being given to Palestine ...
. (IT) We can only agree on the perspective presented: the priorities of the accession of ten new States and stability and sustainable growth cannot be denied or rejected.
The view of the immediate future is not as optimistic as might appear from the Commission's document, however.
With regard to accession, considering everything that has happened in recent weeks between the President of a Member State and the candidate countries and considering the recent statements of the Chairman of the Convention regarding the danger that the Convention might not conclude its work within the timeframes laid down, our optimism is clouded by a misgiving which we hope is unfounded. Will we succeed in ensuring that the dates set for enlargement are observed?
If they are not observed, many points of the strategy will be just wishful thinking.
The objective of stability is also a priority which must be pursued.
We know how difficult it is to create all the conditions necessary to ensure stability and we must work to ensure sustainable growth.
With the almost 5 million unemployed in the Federal Republic and with the negative rates recorded in many other countries too - both Member States and candidate countries - how can we be optimistic about these priorities?

. (PT) The Copenhagen European Council confirmed the outcome of the accession process involving ten candidate countries and negotiations were concluded on the basis of a financial package totalling EUR 41 billion, which will enable the financial perspective to be adjusted and will form the basis of the budget for 2004, which also increased with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, on 1 February 2003.
We voted in favour of the report because, where internal policy is concerned, the text recalls that the completion of the internal market, the implementation of the Lisbon strategy and the strategy for sustainable development remain the European Union's three main objectives and will take on particular importance in 2004, when the new Member States start participating.
It is also to be welcomed that the emphasis is placed on measures supporting SMEs, as creators of employment and economic growth and also on the absolute need for the global war on terrorism.
This is, in short, a report that properly expresses the Union's political guidelines with a view to including them in the 2004 budget.
We continue to object on principle to the idea of Community funds being used to finance European political parties.
Should the adoption of this draft still be imposed by the large groups, however, we consider that it would be vastly preferable for these appropriations to remain within the budget of the Commission, which would remain in charge of their implementation and would thus shoulder the responsibility for its initiative all the way, rather than offloading them onto Parliament's budget and perpetuating the confusion between parliamentary groups and political parties.
We have therefore supported Amendment No 8, but purely on this principle of budgetary technique and with a view to the resulting responsibility, but we are still opposed to the proposal as a whole.
.
(PT) The 2004 budget will be the first in a European Union of perhaps 25 Members and we must emphasise the historic importance of the forthcoming enlargement, which will bring to an end the artificial division of Europe; until then, a considerable number of measures will have to be adopted in 2003 and 2004, to ensure that the European institutions obtain the necessary means with which to complete preparations.
I was particularly sensitive to the request made in the text for Parliament to adopt an ambitious approach to streamlining its operations and consequently its spending, whilst at the same time maintaining multilingualism and fidelity to its principles, since these form an integral part of the institution's democratic legitimacy.
It should be added that the report's idea of improving the technical assistance given to Members is a fine one; indeed Members must be given the best assistance possible in order to enable them to undertake their legislative and budgetary duties, whilst at the same time improving the performance of their work in order to minimise as much as possible the impact of staff being based in three different working places.
Although I do not agree with other points, specifically with the idea of the Commission's managing funds intended for the European political parties, a task which should be transferred to Parliament for obvious democratic reasons, the broad thrust of the report is to be welcomed as it was in ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
We have today chosen to vote in favour of the report on a reform of the budgetary procedure.
The report contains a number of important measures in the area of the budget.
It is proposed, for example, that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure be abolished.
We believe that there is no good reason for such a division.
Clearly, Parliament must have influence upon agricultural expenditure too.
We support the proposal for making it simpler to move money between different categories of expenditure in the EU budget.
That is an important measure for creating a system in which money is used more efficiently in the EU.
The report also points out that the rules governing the EU's own resources must be reviewed.
We want particularly to emphasise that we support a system that is clearer than the current one and that is better at showing how much money is going into the EU.
We are, however, completely opposed to a system that could lead to Parliament's being given influence over how much money is to be allocated to the EU.
It is important that it be the Member States that decide upon the levels of funding for the EU and that Parliament have the last say on the money that is spent.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
Exceptionally, Mr Fatuzzo is not here today to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the Italian pensioners.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the report (A5-0062/2003) by Mr Mann, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on new proposals for employment strategy and social policy in the European Union [2002/2236(INI)].
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was three years ago that the European Council, meeting in Lisbon, decided on a thoroughly ambitious strategy, according to which the European Union was to become the world's most competitive and dynamic economic area by 2010, and was to do so on the basis of qualified knowledge.
This was intended to achieve lasting growth, along with full employment, more and better jobs, and greater social cohesion.
Were we too ambitious, too euphoric?
Were not today's crises foreseeable even then?
Eurostat tells us that we currently have almost 14 million unemployed.
The primary causes of this are the failure to resolve structural problems in the Member States, such as bloated bureaucracies, the distortion of competition by the failure to remove subsidies, and extremely high unemployment among women, young people, older workers and people with disabilities.
Official figures indicate that there are 4.7 million unemployed in Germany alone, the highest level for five years, and the wave of bankruptcies among its businesses and the high level of taxes and duties, which spare neither businesses nor private citizens, are set to reach record levels.
There is no doubt that the European employment strategy has achieved successes by coordinating national, regional and local employment policies.
Although the subsidiarity principle has been adhered to, the continual expansion of the European employment strategy, from horizontal objectives to the Four Pillars, has led to constant reductions in its effectiveness.
I agree with the Council and the Commission in their assessment that the new guidelines should be tightened up for the sake of greater efficiency.
We need, above all, evidence of their having been transposed and of resultant changes in labour markets.
Whatever the orientation in the medium term - the Commission proposed three years - it is my view that we must keep checking up on an annual basis whatever happens, so that there will be healthy pressure on the Member States, some of which have problems with implementing their National Action Plans.
What we need is voluntary undertakings, of the same calibre, let me add, as the Stability and Growth Pact, and these elements must not then be altered in the way they once were when the stimulation of growth and investment are high up the agenda.
Strict adherence to the Pact is the foundation for stability, for confidence on the part of the markets and the public, and so economic dynamism and employment are essentially dependent on it.
The one is inseparable from the other.
The new thing about the European employment strategy is the adherence to three priorities: firstly, getting as close as possible to the Lisbon employment rates of 70% for men and 60% for women up to and including 2010; secondly, improved quality of work, the direct effect of which is to increase productivity; and thirdly, the opening up of the labour markets to the vulnerable and those on the margins of society.
Jobs call for the right financial framework conditions.
The tax laws of many Member States are inimical to enterprise and employment.
Far from there being further increases in taxes, these should be reduced.
Consumers and enterprises must have the burdens lifted from them, and administrative expenditure must be reduced.
We must get back to job creation being worth it in financial terms.
Reducing VAT on services up to the end of this year was the right way to go about it.
I propose that there should be more mini-jobs subject to reduced taxation and levies, quite independent of full-time jobs rather as an alternative to them - as I am alleged to have said.
It is always a matter of balance between, on the one hand, greater flexibility, and, on the other, long-term security.
Above all, small and medium-sized enterprises need favourable conditions, for they are, after all, the driving force behind employment, providing as they do 70% of all jobs and 80% of all traineeships.
I have not contented myself with generalised commitments to support for SMEs, but have made very specific demands.
They range from the making available of venture capital at favourable rates via favourable tax treatment for start-ups to the speeding-up of approval procedures, from networks for people starting up businesses to ways of freeing them from bureaucracy.
Different experiences at national level meant that there was intensive debate on these proposals in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but together we achieved compromises with some reservations.
Let me, at this point, thank all the groups' shadow rapporteurs for their constructive suggestions.
We learned a great deal together and from each other.
We can also expect employment to receive impetus from more flexible ways of organising work, such as contract work and part-time jobs, from which women benefit in harmonising work and family.
We call on the Member States to do more to provide childcare facilities and tax benefits for the people who work in them.
Flexibility is also of benefit to the long-term unemployed, to those starting work and to those with few qualifications, who can acquire new employment skills.
Too little attention is paid to demographic change and the lack of specialists.
The way people are treated when they are in their fifties is not acceptable; many of these, who find themselves laid off and excluded are willing and able to work, and want to learn more.
They want more training and can take the strain.
Experience is a bonus; it cannot be a defect.

One final thought: if this new European employment strategy focuses on the three priorities I have mentioned, we may well not have long to wait for effective changes in our labour markets, and so we will be taking a significant step closer to the Lisbon targets.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, five months ago I presented the results of the evaluation of the European Employment Strategy to Parliament and Parliament passed a resolution approving the core results of this evaluation and the basic guidelines.
The presentation of the results was followed by an extended debate between all the European institutions.
Broad consultations were also held with the social partners, so that the Commission could present the results of the debate together with specific proposals for future priorities and improved management of the Employment Strategy.
As a result, the Commission presented a document in January containing a new approach to the Employment Strategy.
Basically, the new approach focuses mainly on implementing the Lisbon objectives.
As Thomas Mann said, the situation is different, the economic situation is not auspicious, and this is having a significant impact on unemployment, with certain groups of the populace being harder hit than others.
Thus, despite the positive evaluation of the results of the Employment Strategy, with reforms in all the Member States and ten million new jobs created between 1997 and 2001; despite the positive approach, there can be no doubt that we need to activate more policies and speed up the reforms.
In order to be able to focus more on Lisbon, we have set three basic objectives: full employment, labour standards and productivity and a cohesive labour market.
I should like to emphasise that the gender dimension has been mainstreamed in all three objectives and in our priorities and specific reference is made to the particular conditions faced by women in the labour market.
Having agreed on the three basic objectives, we then come to the substance of the guidelines.
Both Parliament and the Council called for fewer, simpler guidelines focusing more clearly on results.
Our objective, therefore, is to cut the number of guidelines, if possible by half, and to articulate them around highly specific priorities.
We have selected eleven priorities; the new priorities and those that have come up against the greatest resistance, in the sense that some countries accept them while others do not, are undeclared work and immigration.
So we have three basic objectives and eleven basic priorities around which the guidelines on employment are structured.
We believe, in the light of experience over recent years, that the quantitative approach plays a very important part.
In other words, the guidelines need to include quantitative targets, if policy is to be quantifiable, and governments need to be judged on the basis of specific targets.
Our proposal therefore includes specific sectors which can be used as a basis for discussion and in which Member States can agree on European or specific national targets.
Another important point is partnership.
The method of administering the procedure for the Employment Strategy does, of course, vary from one country to another.
Each country takes a different approach, depending on its culture and on how the social partnership and local authorities are organised.
However, the evaluation identifies certain points which are common to every country.
The social partners need an enhanced role, the procedure needs to be advertised in order to increase awareness among as many citizens and agencies as possible and, of course, in the European and national parliaments, the territorial dimension of the strategy needs to be developed in the form of regional and local employment plans, civil society needs to be galvanised into action and, finally, parliamentary bodies need to be more involved in the procedure.
This last point brings me to timetabling.
I should like to say from the outset that I understand perfectly Parliament's concerns this year, as far as approval of the guidelines is concerned, because this year is the first time we shall be implementing enhanced coordination of economic policy cycles and employment policy cycles.
In order to implement this coordination, which has been called for on numerous occasions, including in Parliament, we need four different stages.
The first stage is to decide on the general guidelines for the strategy on employment and the broad economic policy guidelines at the spring Council.
The second is to submit the guidelines as quickly as possible after that, as a package.
This means that, once we have the spring Council's guidelines, the Commission will present a package of guidelines on both economic policy and employment.
The third is to approve the guidelines; this needs to be done as quickly as possible, if possible at the June Council.
The fourth, once these guidelines have been approved, is to draw up national action plans and the joint report on employment by the autumn.
Clearly, therefore, we are all under a great deal of pressure this year if we are to keep to this timetable, but may I remind you that we shall not be starting the debate in April from square one.
The debate on the reform of the Employment Strategy started back in July last year.
A very specific debate was held in Parliament, followed in January by the recent communication and I think that, if Parliament and the Commission work closely together, we should be able to overcome timetabling problems and coordinate economic policy and employment policy this year.
This is very important if we are to avoid overlaps and ensure that one procedure does not take precedence over the other.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his report, which I see, moreover, as a courageous one.
For the first time, some new ideas are raised, ideas which have not always come up in recent years and which also tie in somewhat with the new reality that we are now faced with, in the context of a less favourable economic situation than we have seen in recent times.
That is why I find it a courageous report, and, moreover, it is not very politically correct on a number of points.
I think that that is a good thing too, because if there is to be a genuine debate on employment, it cannot just be politically correct, and that is something I believe applies to this aspect as much as it does to others.
As I said, we are faced with a kind of economic slump.
That is always bad news for employment, with unemployment rising, as a rule.
In that case, we generally see unemployment among young people increasing more sharply than unemployment as a whole.
That is because it is harder for young people to find a job than it has been in the past.
The minute the situation suddenly improves, young people are the first to find a job.
The minute the situation is less good, however, they are left standing.
In order to prevent that happening, and precisely because we can see it coming, we should be focusing on this in particular.
That does not mean that we should completely forget about the other groups we have indicated - that is, women and older people.
On the contrary, you take the view that we should also continue with this, but I believe that young people need extra attention that they have not received in recent years.
I should now like to turn to the matter of comparisons.
At present, unemployment in the European Union is approximately 2.5% higher than in the United States and Japan, but the differences are not as great as they seem at first glance.
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, Denmark, Great Britain and Sweden are doing better than the United States.
The other countries are therefore doing somewhat worse.
If, however, we look at the differences, that is very alarming.
It is precisely for that reason that this policy and these ideas are so important.
One cannot help but see that if a country has very high unemployment and this unemployment does not go down, something is not right.
There are countries that have historically had high unemployment, whose unemployment is going down.
On the other hand, there are other countries that have historically had low unemployment, whose unemployment is rising.
This is especially the case if one part of such a country is doing well and another part is not.
In Germany, for example, which is of course our greatest concern at the moment, there are states that are simply at the European level.
How is that possible?
That is a very interesting question.
It is not a valid approach to only look at the countries, but also at the regions.
That is the way to bring it together.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to be frank, it gives me a bad taste in my mouth to be discussing a new employment strategy in the midst of an international crisis situation and maybe immediately before a war in Iraq, but it is perhaps important to do so.
The Lisbon process must be kept on the rails even in difficult times.
On behalf of my group, I can tell you that the Commission's new approach to the employment strategy has been received very favourably in our camp.
Increased stability in the employment strategy is indeed necessary.
That does not mean that we must be less ambitious, but it does mean that, in future, we shall possibly have to concentrate more on depth and make the employment guidelines more results-orientated.
We also agree with the Commission that there should be more cohesion between the coordination processes.
It is becoming increasingly the case that the broad economic guidelines are in practice playing the role of overarching instrument.
In our opinion, however, that also means that the economic guidelines must take more account of the ambitions with regard to employment, the fight against poverty, the future of pensions, and health care.
In our opinion, it also means that the economic guidelines should actually be economic and social guidelines, on which not only the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs express their opinion, but also the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs, the Ministers for Education and possibly the Ministers for Science Policy.
In our opinion, that means that, while the processes must run autonomously, a great deal more coherence is needed between the various political processes.
That also has consequences in terms of content, because it means that, in our view, the economic policy must also stimulate economic growth.
Therefore, a lot more work must be done towards innovation, research and development, and investment in people.
In the opinion of our group, this means that the Stability and Growth Pact must also fulfil its role as a growth pact and must enable counter-cyclical operation in the Member States and breathe life into the economy.
My group fully agrees with the Commission that greater coherence is also needed in the coordination in the social sphere; that is to say, between the pensions issue, the pension process, the poverty process and the health process.
We should therefore like to lend our full support to the intention of the Greek Presidency to activate these processes and give them more continuity.
We fully agree that more attention should be paid to an effective implementation of the employment strategy.
We must not let this strategy become a paper tiger.
At present, the disparity between the Council's intentions and reality is still too great: not only with regard to the employment participation of older people, young people and migrants, but also as regards investment in people.
For example, we see that there are serious shortcomings in businesses' training efforts and that people with low skills and older people are treated unequally.
That is why we think that the involvement of all the stakeholders is very important.
That is why we also say to the Convention that the open coordination method must be incorporated into the Constitution not only with regard to employment but also to the social process, in order to guarantee more democratic legitimacy and transparency.
My group thought that the Mann report was reasonably balanced, reflecting our main concerns, just as it came out of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We have no intention of tabling any amendments, therefore.
I have to be frank: the amendments that are now on the table threaten to distort the whole report.
This is not, Mr Pronk, a question of political correctness or anything of the sort.
In our opinion it is a question of the efficiency of this Parliament.
A report like that, with a consensus in this Parliament, may not be sexy, but the intention is to present a report which applies to the whole of the Union and not just to one Member State, and which sets out guidelines for a common policy.
Such a report does not lend itself to national political deliberations or ideological debates on specific points of this or that policy orientation.
My group is therefore inclined to reject these amendments.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the spring summit of EU heads of state and government has been devoted to the development of the economy and labour market.
It is, then, also only natural that the two topics be linked, since they are two sides of the same coin.
Success in employment policy is crucial to achieving the objective of economic policy. The fact is, moreover, that an economic policy that increases competitiveness and flexibility and so improves the economic incentives for creating jobs is the core of employment policy.
In addition, there are the factors so brilliantly emphasised in Mr Mann's report, which those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are able to support and which we think will be improved by the amendments tabled by ourselves and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, amendments that we too shall of course support.
Mr Mann's report emphasises that we must have a stronger commitment to training, to improved incentives for accepting and creating jobs and to less bureaucracy and more flexibility in the labour market.
Unfortunately, the common employment policy is seen, from the job figures and unemployment statistics, not to be an unqualified success. We are much too far from the ambitious targets set in Lisbon three years ago.
It might be enquired whether they were too ambitious.
No, they were not; but there are trend-setting countries that do not feel sufficiently bound by the promises.
There has been progress in some areas, but this is overshadowed, I believe, by a general picture of too modest a desire to comply with the common objectives.
I agree with the proposal you have tabled, Commissioner, for simplifying and clarifying the open coordination of employment policy with a view to having fewer guidelines.
These are constructive reforms that have been presented, and I also think it good that we should have better coordination with the common economic policy.
Furthermore, we must also become much better at monitoring and ensuring that the Member States do in fact feel bound by the fine promises given at the Lisbon Summit, and this also applies to the large countries.
Madam President, when Mr Mann's report was discussed by the committee, many amendments were subject to major debate.
There was disagreement over one area in particular, namely the conditions under which small businesses operate, together with their role in employment policy.
Two different approaches were thus pitted against each other.
Advocates of the one view wanted to make life easier for small businesses by means of tax relief, lower wage costs, less red tape, what are known as mini-jobs and such services as cannot be provided without government aid and public subsidies, for example household services.
The other approach was quite different.
The representatives of this approach wanted to put their faith in small businesses with good business ideas, skilled management, possibilities of growth and ambitions to grow and to employ more people.
We are concerned, then, with small businesses that are also strong or are able to become so and that can manage to pay good wages and ordinary taxes, provide their employees with good working conditions and maintain good union relations.
What we have here, then, are two different approaches, but not varieties of right- or left-wing policies, for I know that many people in industry prefer good, strong small businesses and that it is precisely to these businesses that they wish to provide capital, opportunities for growth and support in terms of knowledge.
It is also precisely this route that my group too wishes to go down.
In actual fact, we of course have too many small businesses in Europe. By far the largest number of small businesses is to be found in those countries and regions which are weakest economically and in which unemployment is very high.
We have a large number of businesses that can scarcely support one family.
We have a large number of businesses that start up with the aid of state subsidies and that immediately disappear once the periods of subsidy have come to an end.
In brief, we have a situation in which statistics show that, of ten new businesses, there is perhaps only one, or possibly two, that will survive the first three or four years.
We must put our faith in quality.
We could unite all the political groups in this Parliament around a progressive policy in this area, a policy that would take our overarching objectives and the Lisbon strategy's objectives seriously, that is to say 'good jobs for all'.
Such a policy would require that, in small businesses too, the jobs should be of good quality and be the source of sufficiently high productivity to provide a social surplus.
Mr Mann's report contains a number of constructive proposals for a modern and forward-looking policy of this kind towards small businesses.
I hope that those amendments that point in the opposite direction will be rejected and that Parliament will send the Commission and the Council a clear signal to the effect that we want to see small, and not so small, businesses that are of good quality and in line with the Lisbon strategy.
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.
The report that eventually came out of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was indeed a reasonable report.
However, my group had one major problem with it over the support for the rigidity of the stability and growth pact.
Consequently we are going to be supporting the amendment on that which will be coming from another group this afternoon.
Because we felt that what came out overall had a sense of balance to it, we are not going to be supporting many of the other amendments seeking to reinstate certain parts of the original text, e.g. Amendment 17 concerning GATS.
We do not agree that the General Agreement on Trade in Services will be a job engine, either here or in the developing world.
That was the subject of the extensive debate that Parliament had on Monday.
What concerns us as well is that the present text again lacks a mechanism for sustainability, that is, an environmental dimension that really must be incorporated into all that we are doing.
Too often we see that the poorest people in the worst quality jobs also live in the worst environment.
If we are really going to do something to upgrade employment or our social environment, we need to take account of the physical environment.
We also agree with a lot that the Commissioner said about the ownership of this employment strategy.
It would be very useful if national parliaments debated the national action plans that were put forward by governments.
In our delegation visits from this committee, we have found all too often that national parliaments do not have a clue that these plans even exist and they certainly have not participated in them.
That would be a welcome step forward.
To pick up on the issue of small- and medium-sized enterprises: yes, they are important, but only if - as Mr Schmidt said - they are of high quality.
You can have a small sweatshop as well as an ethical business and regulation is there to support the latter, not the former.
Madam President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that Mr Mann has done an excellent job.
Indeed, his proposals are based on the highest Community tradition in social matters and employment policy and, in terms of proactive measures, incorporate a broad range of innovative points and fields such as the knowledge-based society and its strategic implications.
I am certainly not making the points that follow out of a desire to criticise, therefore, but, if anything, in order to share our hopes, although I fear that they may be quite insubstantial in areas such as small and medium-sized enterprises, with regard to which a number of different points have been made.
Indeed, we all know that, as regards taxation, if we want to implement the recommendations made we have three options, which can either be treated as alternatives or employed in parallel: the Stability Pact and its durability, particularly with regard to the possibility of complete exemption for SMEs for the first three years, in view of their substantial contribution to national GDP; a review of the areas covered by the subsidiarity system; or, again, a review of the areas requiring a unanimity vote in the Council.
I am not being pessimistic here, just realistic.
Another good example in the area of financial matters is the proposed policies for making credit available to small and medium-sized enterprises, which would appear to be in contrast with the contents of the 2002 Basel agreement, which does not allow the necessary raising of sufficient venture capital for small and medium-sized enterprise and for the internationalisation thereof.
The same may be said of incentives to promote employment, as the rapporteur calls them, which are considered to be a different matter from flexibility and bureaucratic relief.
If they are, then they are direct examples of State aid pursuant to Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which, as the rapporteur is aware, only apply in areas identified in 1998, apparently without possibility of amendment, not even where situations have changed with the passage of time.
The role of the social partners, however, which the rapporteur has rightly emphasised, is a consideration worthy of mention.
Called upon to implement forms of local partnership and contractual flexibility within a coherent framework of principles, the social partners are now, despite the European social dialogue, in a position where they do not, in practice, have the bodies or policies to lay down minimum social standards for enterprises, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, notwithstanding, inter alia, the fact that a great many of these enterprises originate from current Member States.
This is a situation which, in these countries, usually combined with lower taxation and a gradual increase in the consideration given to the Community acquis in environmental matters, is certainly creating new jobs, although it does mean that there is no hope of narrowing clear social gaps, even in the medium term.
A further point concerns the knowledge-based society itself, aims and objectives of which we support.
As the rapporteur is aware, the knowledge-based society cannot be achieved just by increasing the number of computers in families and schools or by introducing better, more focused training, although that is needed, but it is based on both the full, appropriate exploitation of useful information and the availability of this information.
In conclusion, what I fear is that, despite all the emphasis continually and repeatedly placed on the importance of employment and social policies and their horizontal integration with other policies, they will remain merely a kind of by-product, a by-product which, within the Member States which are unmindful of the content of the European social agenda, combines the sterile display of positive or negative quantitative results with, I am sad to say, constant rhetoric and equally persistent erosion of quality.
Madam President, I want sincerely to thank Mr Mann for the work he has put into this report and for all the compromise amendments through which considerable agreement was brought about in the relevant committee.
For ourselves as Christian Democrats, it is extremely important that an employment strategy and a strategy for social welfare in Europe should combine fixed, stable values, built upon the ethical and moral basis that is European cultural history, with a social, market-oriented economy.
I would emphasise that, in this context, we are concerned with both social and economic values and not, therefore, with a free-market economy devoid of ethical, moral and social values.
I would particularly draw the Commission's attention to item 37, which emphasises the importance of making it easier to combine family and professional life by creating greater opportunity for parents to spend more time with their children, by extending childcare facilities, by enabling parents to take parental leave and by providing tax concessions for childminders and foster parents and care and assistance facilities for the elderly.
This item is also about allocating greater resources to programmes for combating female unemployment.
I want really to focus upon what is in actual fact the biggest issue for Europe, namely the demographic challenge.
I know that we have a Commissioner with a strong personal commitment to finding ways of solving the issue of obtaining a large enough European workforce and population in the future.
Item 37 indicates the value of combining working life and family life and of giving more time to children.
This report is therefore about seeing the Stockholm European Council's decision of March 2001 on the demographic challenge as one of the absolutely most important issues for Europe.
Item 37 emphasises this extremely clearly.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mann observed during the discussions in committee that his report had not enjoyed the support to which he had previously been accustomed.
This of course is partly due to a number of demands which have a very specific national character and which do not really belong in the European debate at all.
I support the intention expressed in his report, which is that the guidelines should concentrate on what is essential and that annual reports should also continue to be produced in future.
Also in terms of the objectives, I believe that we have achieved broad consensus, especially as regards flexibility on the labour markets, without subjecting the workforce - the employees - to any unnecessary dismantling of their social protection.
The path towards this goal is undoubtedly a matter of debate.
Fresh ideas would be all well and good, Mr Pronk, but in some areas, we can detect very clear retrograde steps, starting with the involvement of the national parliaments.
Mr Mann has called for the national parliaments to be allowed to exercise greater control, yet we agreed some time ago that they will not only exercise control but will participate through the framework of legislation - which goes much further.
Indeed, Sweden and Denmark have already applied this in principle.
Moreover, Mr Mann calls for implementation of the national further training plans to be pushed through.
Here too, we agreed that there should be legislation imposing a binding obligation and setting out workers' rights to further training.
Furthermore - and this, of course, is where we cannot agree with him - he calls for indiscriminate tax cuts and wage subsidies.
These are not fresh ideas.
They are completely obsolete.
Nor do they promote the entrepreneurial creativity that we urgently need.
Mr President, I should like to make a couple of brief remarks.
I think that, in the context of economic development, demographic developments, technological developments, enlargement, and a possible war, we have together ended up in a complicated situation in which the things we like, such as a comprehensive approach, will become increasingly difficult.
That was something I just wanted to say on this day when elections are being held in the Netherlands.
For, although we have taken pains over it, it will not be easy, for example, to continue in the coming period to attain the standards of employment creation to which we have become accustomed.
In any case, I concur with remarks such as those by Mrs Van Lancker with regard to the linking of economic and social policy.
In my opinion, we should also adapt the economic policy to the social policy.
I also concur with a number of remarks by Mr Pronk regarding the frequently erroneous comparison between the United States and Europe.
You have to have a much better, much more careful look at this.
I am in agreement with the main objectives of the new employment policy and should like to call attention in particular to the second objective.
The first objective, full employment, needs be elaborated, including with regard to the social economy, but of course it is also necessary to devote attention to better employment, and that will become even more difficult in this period.
Looking at the priorities, it is funny to see that some eleven remain of the original eighteen guidelines.
I think that we have to look very carefully at how to present and systematically secure the new fields, such as immigration and undeclared work.
If we look, for example, at those elements which the evaluation of employment policy revealed to be relatively poor - the improvement of the organisation of work, and better work, for instance - we have to ensure that we do not break these down again into all manner of categories, when we are presently just at the stage of initiatives in this field.
In other words, I think that we need to do some work on this in the coming period.
With regard to the streamlining of the whole package of guidelines, which makes sense to me, this also means that - as I said at the beginning - we have to adapt these to each other.
Lastly, I think - and hope - that the Council will also commit itself in the coming period to implementing the method of working which we have adopted together, namely the open coordination method, without any kind of deviation.
Mr President, I also wish to join with the others in thanking the rapporteur for his work on a very important topic which has become even more so in the last year because of the increase in unemployment across many economies in the European Union.
