If it is unworkable, then, as the Commission has said, repeal it.
Finally, we need to make sure the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking is complied with.
In a reply just the other day, the Commission admitted that little progress had been made.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to tell MrÂ Barroso that what was decided today on energy shows that where there is a will there is a way, and so it is our âwillâ that you find a âwayâ in a greater number of cases, particularly in the areas of environmental, consumer and health policies.
That, however, is an obvious message.
MrÂ Winkler, I was sorry to notice that you did not say a word on the subject of the implementation of the law, even though this subject concerns the Member States most of all.
I also believe it would be interesting to hear the Councilâs views on the possibility of reopening the talks on the part of the better regulation agreement dealing with the implementation of the law, which failed miserably before.
In addition, on the matter of impact assessments, I do not hide my concerns, since this topic is becoming a kind of myth, a magic formula that in itself ought to make legislation better by basing it on scientific, impartial sources.
I personally am sceptical on this point.
Indeed, I am concerned that this topic is taking on too much importance, primarily because some of the proposals contained in the reports â particularly MrsÂ McCarthyâs but not only hers â introduce some bureaucratic elements that would be really complicated to administer, above all for the Commission.
That seed of doubt has made my group realise how lucky we are that we have postponed the vote, because that will give us a chance to review the situation in order to reach an agreement.
In addition, those items that everyone is talking about that have been considered crucial in an impact assessment, including administrative costs, too much red tape and excessive costs for businesses, whether real or presumed, are in themselves a political choice.
I shall give you an example, MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Verheugen: a letter from UNICE was all it took to drastically cut back the air quality strategy, despite a EUR 2 million impact assessment that said that the costs to consider were not only the costs to businesses but also the costs to peopleâs health.
In the end, therefore, even impact assessments are political choices, and as a result I would ask you not to make them such a priority and so completely overstated compared with the other aspects of the law.
I wish to say a final word about the issue of co-regulation and self-regulation.
I should like the Commission to carry out a study to determine how well these procedures have worked because, according to our studies, they have not worked properly.
The ability of businesses and companies to comply with these self-regulation agreements has been considered rather unsatisfactory by the companies themselves.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is extremely lamentable that there seems to be only one running through the discussion on subsidiarity and better lawmaking, namely increased economic growth and more competition by means of fewer rules and regulations.
This creates the illusion that, particularly in the regulatory environment, more attention should be paid to subsidiarity in areas such as social protection, the environment and consumer protection.
All of this fits into the neo-liberal way of thinking that fewer rules and regulations are, by definition, a good thing.
Reality, however, shows us that it is those very same European rules on the hallowed internal market that make life difficult for the European citizens.
For example, it is those rules that require a small municipality in the north of the Netherlands to ask for permission from the European Commission before it can install a glass-fibre cable network for its own citizens, or that consider government support of the City of Amsterdam to the local zoo to be distortion of competition.
No wonder the people of the Netherlands, having lost all faith in a further extension of Brussels powers and in the proposed Constitution which approved and backed this process, proceeded, by an overwhelming majority, to consign that document to the waste paper basket.
Reality is that subsidiarity has been an empty concept for a long time.
European institutions, headed by this House, rarely, if ever, question whether European interference in a certain area actually makes a positive contribution to the wellbeing of people and the environment.
On the contrary; a steady stream of European rules and regulations continues to undermine the authority of national and regional governments.
One example I would give of that is the European services directive, which, even in its amended form, will seriously erode the autonomy of municipal authorities in the area of licences or the local provision of services.
In a nutshell, whilst a discussion on the quality and subsidiarity of European legislation is to be welcomed, it is totally naÃ¯ve to assume that by scrapping a handful of rules or carrying out impact assessments, the fundamental problems of interference from Brussels can be solved.
For this to happen, the internal market rules will, in the first instance, need to be completely overhauled.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to thank the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council, as well as our rapporteurs, for the mood they have set with regard to this debate today.
Obviously there are problems within our lawmaking process; there are difficulties which we can all recognise and see in our everyday working lives.
One of the things that is most clearly and importantly needed is the codification and simplification of the existing body of law â the â not only to ensure that businesses can operate more freely or properly across the internal market, but also to guarantee that individuals recognise where their rights are protected; that there are clear and defined rules to ensure that big business cannot overrun the rights of workers; that consumers cannot be trodden under foot because of decisions taken by financial institutions or whatever else. That is why for many years we in Parliament have been attempting to put in place this idea of impact assessment with regard to all legislation, to test it before it becomes law, to see its necessity and to understand fully what its impact will be when it is eventually transposed into law.
However, when you look at the whole question of lawmaking, the biggest difficulties and the biggest culprits are found at Member State level in transposition of agreed European law. This is where governments have already been represented at the decision-making process, where Parliament and the Commission have been involved, but when it comes to transposition there is a difficulty because of a local domestic political dispute or because of a fear of a backlash in that political area.
I think it would be wrong for the Commission to portray itself purely in the guise of the terrible enforcer against the Member States, because sometimes there are mistakes and errors within the legislation which must be corrected, and flexibility is required to achieve this.
My last point is that, in setting up any working groups or expert groups concerning better lawmaking, it is essential to get the practitioners of politics involved â not just technocrats or parliamentary draftsmen, but politicians themselves who can understand how this must be sold to the public and enforced at a local level.
Â Â  Madam President, at present it is only selected specialists who can read EU laws and work out the state of the law in a particular area.
Every shepherd has to keep track of every sheep, but no EU institution knows precisely how many laws we have.
We have laid down something like 20Â 000 rules filling more than 100Â 000 pages.
The state of the law governing, for example, the fisheries area is to be sought in more than 70 different regulations.
Why not combine all the rules governing the same subject in one simple act?
In that way, citizens themselves will be able to see and read the resultant act, which is the first precondition for their having influence.
Bold type can be used to draw attention to proposed amendments, and words that are to be deleted can be written in italics.
In that way, everyone will be able to see what the aim of the proposal is.
We shall also adopt the democratic principle from our own constitutions, namely that, in future, it will not be possible to adopt any EU law without its having been decided on here in the European Parliament.
Under these arrangements, EU laws would be able to authorise the issue of notifications, but any such instrument could be reconsidered on the basis of a straightforward majority in the Council and Parliament.
All committee procedures in which a minority combines with the Commission to legislate against the majority in the national parliaments and the European Parliament should also be abolished.
It is absurd that the Commission should have been able to approve genetically modified cornflakes when, their citizens having discovered what had really been decided behind closed doors, 14 out of 15 countries were opposed to such approval and country number 15 also came out in opposition.
If legislation in its entirety is opened up to the citizens, we shall also obtain better laws.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, the European Commission monitors application of Community law on a yearly basis.
At present we are debating the Commissionâs 21st and 22nd annual reports.
In order to appreciate the scale of the problem, it should be pointed out that some four thousand infringement proceedings are involved.
A so-called reasoned opinion has been issued for almost one thousand of these, and over 400 have been referred to the Court of Justice.
It is a matter of regret that the Commission was late in submitting the 22ndÂ annual report.
This was only received in JanuaryÂ 2006 and consequently Parliament was only able to refer to part of the Commissionâs information for 2004 in its resolution.
Paradoxically, it could be said that the more complaints, the better.
This is because the complaints indicate that citizens of the Member States are playing an important role in the monitoring process and thus also in Union lawmaking.
The citizensâ complaints are not symbolic in nature.
They are part of the process of building a citizensâ Europe and in general they are an effective way of monitoring the application of Community law.
The European Parliamentâs committees should monitor the implementation of Community law closely, particularly in situations where the relevant rapporteur is required to participate actively in monitoring the application of a particular legal provision in individual Member States and also, naturally, when it comes to calling for immediate action should any infringements be noted.
The efficiency of the process should be improved by abbreviating the internal procedure, as was rightly included in the draft European Parliament resolution.
It would also be appropriate to authorise individual Commissioners to exercise direct control over the transposition of Community provisions into national law within the stated periods of time.
This could be achieved by authorising Commissioners to address requests for dealing with infringements within their particular sphere of competence directly to Member States.
Â Â  . â Madam President, your helping me to make a very practical contribution to better lawmaking by being privileged to meet with the Conference of Presidents and have very in-depth discussions with them about legal acts is very definitely relevant to this debate.
I am in any case grateful for your understanding.
I would like to say something, very briefly, about one or two of the issues that have been touched on in this debate.
A very large number of speakers had something to say about the comitology issue.
We have a saying in Austria to the effect that one should not cluck over eggs that have not yet been laid, but, under the Austrian Presidency, we have returned to the comitology issue with a great deal of commitment.
We have already had two rounds of very detailed negotiation with your Houseâs appointed representatives, the latter of which took place a couple of hours ago.
After a number of years, I believe we are now on the right track towards finding a solution with which both the Council and Parliament can be satisfied.
Whatever emerges will in any case be an improvement on the current situation, since it goes without saying that Parliament will have a say in those legislative acts that are adopted through the codecision procedure with its agreement and that of the Council.
We are not far away from a solution, and I hope that we will arrive at finally sorting this out by the end of this period of six months.
That will help improve our lawmaking processes.
Mrs Frassoni was, of course, quite right in what she had to say about the implementation of the law and its importance.
This is a matter for the Member States rather than for the Council as such â on behalf of which I am of course speaking â but the individual Member States are of course endeavouring, in their discussions with the Commission, to find better ways of ensuring that the law is applied.
We too â by which I mean âwe Austriansâ â are of course just as much affected by this as any other Member State; infringement procedures have the same effect on us as on any of them.
Speaking as a lawyer, I can say that every law does of course need machinery whereby it can be put into effect; that is important, and we are also endeavouring to pay more attention to the Commission and to find better ways of enforcing and applying the law.
The fact that what I said about this was not said in the name of the Council does not of course mean that the application and enforcement of the law are any less important than the legislative process itself.
The question of legislation and of the review of legislative acts already adopted is of course at the forefront of the Councilâs considerations.
Â Â  Madam President, I cannot help it, but when I see the name Winkler up there, I immediately think about Henry Winkler: remember the guy who was Fonzie in Happy Days?
It is good to have an Austrian Minister as Fonzie, giving the thumbs up to better regulation!
We have three linked issues in this plenary session.
The first, which we dealt with yesterday, was to do with transparency and the openness of the Council; the second is this debate on better regulation and legislation, and the last one we have this evening is on citizenship.
I support all those initiatives; I think they are great; I think the work that the Secretary-General is doing in the Commission under MrÂ Ponzano is extremely good and I would like to recommend all four reports that have been put on the table today.
Having said that and given that we are talking about better regulation, when I started going through the reports, I got a bit uneasy.
I will just read you the language.
I think there is a communication problem here.
MrsÂ Frassoni drew up a great report, but paragraph 18, âNotes that the SOLVIT network has proved its effectiveness in the internal market as a complementary non-judicial mechanism which has increased voluntary cooperation among Member StatesÂ ...â.
It is all true, but if you are sitting up there trying to listen to this, you are not necessarily going to understand what it means.
MrÂ Doorn, on better lawmaking, at paragraph 5, âis of the opinion that the Lamfalussy procedure is a useful mechanism; regards the convergence of supervisory practices as crucial; welcomes the work of the Level 3 committees in this respect and supports the call for an adequate toolbox;â â great.
Then, the McCarthy report â which I think is the clearest one â states in paragraph 6, ârequests that the Commission carry out both and impact assessments on legislation to assist in identifying whether key policy objectives have been metÂ ...â, and the Gargani report has exactly the same.
What I am trying to say is that we need better regulation, better lawmaking, but it is to do with simplification and us understanding what we are deciding on and people understanding what we are trying to decide on.
That is what better regulation is all about; therefore, we need to use better language.
I cannot imagine how that sounded through the Finnish interpretation!
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, under the guise of a technical debate, there is hidden here a debate of great political importance.
We need better lawmaking, of course, but without deregulation and without sidelining the legislator itself.
In this regard, I wish to express my very strong reservations about certain mechanisms, including alternative regulatory mechanisms such as regulation and self-regulation.
They have their place but, in the interest of the citizens and of consumers, I believe that they must not, under any circumstances, take the place of the law, which confers rights but also duties and therefore constitutes the most legitimate democratic tool.
As regards consultation prior to the legislative process, I call on the three institutions to organise, alongside the economic operators, the actual participation of the social partners and of civil society in all its diversity.
It is, in fact, the responsibility of the public authorities to support the organisation of these players - consumer associations, public service users, associations fighting against exclusion or community education associations â throughout Europe.
Finally, I should like to comment on the simplification rolling programme that is supposed to facilitate the Lisbon Strategy.
I am surprised that it includes as its main principle the recasting of the regulation on organic farming, when even the producers in this sector are not asking for that, and that proposals as important as those on the status of the mutual benefit associations and of the European Association have, at the same time, been withdrawn from the legislative programme.
Â Â  Madam President, I quite agree here with those who think that a slimming diet would be good for the Europe of regulation, a Europe that is fussy about principles and, sadly, more lax about the monitoring of the transposition and proper application of our legislation.
This much is clear: ten years after the launch of the SLIM programme, and despite the signing, two years ago, of the âBetter lawmakingâ interinstitutional agreement, there is still a long way to go.
We have still not curbed the Unionâs appetite for legislation.
I am therefore delighted that the Commission is now proposing to us this balanced diet: three conditions to ensure that this agenda functions, strengthens the Union and brings it closer to Europeans.
It has been said that Europe should make laws only when it can do better than other levels of authority.
As we have just heard MrÂ Stubb say, from the Canaries to Scandinavia, by way of Brussels, we must avoid once and for all using European jargon, and we must speak and write laws in the language that is most easily understood by all those for whom it is intended.
There are many more examples.
Thirdly, this slimming diet that we want and that the SMEs, in particular, also want is not a casual, non-interventionist diet.
It must be stressed - and here I shall conclude, Madam President - that better regulation does not mean lack of ambition.
I agree with Mrs Frassoni: it is REACH, for example, that I am thinking of in highlighting this last point.
Â Â  Madam President, I congratulate all our rapporteurs in undertaking this gargantuan effort today and shall focus briefly on two points: Council transparency and Mr Doornâs report on subsidiarity.
As we heard yesterday, a lack of Council transparency remains the elephant in the room; it remains the root cause of so much discontent with EU lawmaking in general.
Surely the Council can take more steps towards meaningfully meeting in public.
Right now only Havana and Pyong Yang operate in such an opaque fashion.
We should be doing better than that in the 21st century.
More substantively, turning to subsidiarity and especially paragraphs 25-29 of Mr Doornâs report, I give my own country, Scotland, as an example of the missed opportunity that subsidiarity currently represents.
Scotland is currently part of a Member State not known for its enthusiastic EU engagement and yet our parliament in Edinburgh would represent an enthusiastic partner in better EU lawmaking.
Our parliament has total responsibility for health, the environment, justice, education, fishing, agriculture and many more areas, yet the EU view of subsidiarity too often stops at the Member State when, in fact, the more relevant partner may well be much more local.
I would associate myself with all of Mr Doornâs recommendations on impact assessments, although I echo Mrs Wallisâ comments on political engagement and stress that such engagement must be as local as possible.
Then perhaps we will see subsidiarity starting to work for the betterment of EU legislation in the future.
Â Â  Madam President, I do not think that this debate can be reduced to a debate on the quality of legislation.
The actual quantity of EU legislation must also be debated.
The fact is that the number of EU laws has risen dramatically in recent years, and the EU is now legislating in a host of new areas.
At the same time, it is extremely unusual for the EU to give its right of decision-making back to Member States or to repeal legislation.
The combination of a very large quantity of legislation and the deficient quality of such legislation makes for a lack of clarity and makes it difficult to implement legislation in practice.
Where quality is concerned, there is a lot that can now already be done, and the reports contain proposals for doing these things.
Out-of-date legislation can be repealed. Other legislation can be simplified, and some can be merged and consolidated.
All that is fine, but another way of approaching legislative work is also required.
In determining the direction to be taken by legislation, we need to focus more on objectives and less on detail, and we need to give the Member States greater freedom to choose how they are to pursue the objectives set.
Impact analyses are fine, but it is not always so easy to measure what we want to measure.
More often than not, it is simpler to measure straightforward economic factors than, for example, environmental factors.
We had this debate in connection with the debate on the chemicals policy, REACH.
It was easy to measure a companyâs costs, but difficult to measure the huge benefits in terms of public health and reduced human suffering of there being fewer diseases.
This means that there is a need to be rather careful in this area.
If there is a real desire to simplify matters, the number of EU laws must be reduced, and the area that is absolutely the most overregulated is agricultural policy, where most matters could be returned to Member State level and thousands of laws could be abolished.
A number of speakers refer to the European Constitution.
The fact is, it would have made these problems worse by increasing the EUâs power and making it easier for the EU to appropriate new legislative powers and to be able to legislate in areas in which it really ought not to get involved.
We should therefore thank the Dutch and French voters now as well.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, a legislatorâs skill is demonstrated not only by the ability to make sound laws, but also by the ability to refrain from regulating where no regulation is needed.
Accordingly, the statements in the report on broadening and tightening the principles for assessment of the cost and impact of legislation deserve strong support.
There is a reference in the report to the negative impact of political compromises on the development of European law.
The directive on services is a case in point.
Each of the two sides of the debate maintains that it has won the day.
For the Socialists, MrsÂ Gebhardt claims she turned the directive upside down, whilst for the Conservatives MrÂ Harbour rejoices that an excellent compromise has been reached.
Who is mistaken?
Perhaps nobody is?
We may well have come up with a document consisting of dozens of contradictory provisions, in the hope that it will contain something for everyone.
It amounts to feel-good therapy for the Member States, the Union as a whole and also for this House.
We are, however, salving our consciences at the expense of the citizens, the entrepreneurs and the quality of our laws.
Â Â  Madam President, further to the reports on better lawmaking that are the subject of todayâs discussion, I should like to make a few observations about the role of impact assessments.
I gather from Mr Doorn that he is in favour of a random test being carried out by a panel of authoritative experts.
I wholeheartedly support the idea behind it.
Like him, I call for a truly independent committee, one that is not made up of representatives of the three institutions.
We have examples of this in the Netherlands, in the shape of the committee that monitors the environmental impact reports.
If you have had a few bruising encounters with such a panel, then you are bound to clean up your act the next time.
I would also like to add that legislation is always a learning process, but the explicit description of it as such in Recital J of the Doorn report is, in my view, far too negative.
We do what we can to adopt sound legislation.
We are bound to get it wrong the odd time, but to see this as an objective from the outset strikes me as taking things too far.
Â Â  Madam President, you are an eminent specialist on the ancient Japan of the Tokugawa era, during which people were deliberately kept in ignorance of laws deemed to be state secrets, knowledge of which was restricted to a small number of great lords, because it was thought that in this way people would retain far greater respect for standards about which they knew nothing.
Well, I sometimes wonder whether we do not, in fact, draw our inspiration from this ancient Japanese legislation.
In reality, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the complexity of European law is the perverse effect of a group dynamic to which we are all party.
What is it all about?
Firstly, the initiative rests with the Commission, but behind every Commissioner, there is, of course, the general management and the officials who are part of it.
Next, it passes to the Council.
In theory, the Council is composed of ministers.
They reach agreement on a text, provided that each of their respective bureaucracies recognises in it all of the standards that are to feature in the joint text, then the text is passed to Parliament and Parliament appoints a rapporteur.
Naturally, the rapporteur, as is perfectly legitimate, wants his name to go down in history.
His name is much more likely to be remembered if he adds standards rather than removes them, and that is without mentioning the Members who table amendments, the important role of lobbies and so on. Thus it is, ladies and gentlemen, that we arrive at a real regulatory monster.
I have been in this Parliament for 17 years and, right from the very first year of my taking up my seat here, there was already a debate being held on the simplification of European Community law.
I have the impression that we are no farther forward with this than we were 17 years ago, the only difference being that the situation has got even worse.
What is to be done then?
We have to agree on the meaning of the terms used.
We need a proper dictionary of Community law, a code like the Civil Code, or the Commercial Code or the Penal Code, which is organised rationally and divided into parts, sub-parts, chapters, sections and articles, in such a way that, when we are working on a text, we know in advance that we are going to amend such and such an article.
In short, we need to make a great effort towards simplification.
I fear that, despite the good intentions expressed by the rapporteurs, we are not quite there yet.
Thank you.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, CommissionerÂ Verheugen, I should like to start by taking this opportunity to thank all four rapporteurs for their constructive work on this issue, which is not only preoccupying pub regulars, but increasingly politicians, too.
What I found particularly refreshing about this debate was the speech by MrÂ Gollnisch, in which he made a truly impassioned plea for the establishment of the European Constitution, something which we obviously have in common â I was previously unaware of this.
Indeed, I also believe that, with the European Constitution, we would be in a very much better position in the field of normative lawmaking than is presently the case.
I am glad that we are pulling together on this.
I believe that we should always bear in mind with regard to better lawmaking that the aim of all these reports on the subject is not, of course, to improve the familiarity of the individual citizen with the legal texts, but to provide Member States with a simple text to help with transposition.
Therefore, we need to keep our objective clearly in mind when faced with these challenges.
Naturally, in this particular context â and I do not mean to be ironic in any way when I say that I have to expressly agree with the previous speaker for once on this particular point â we complain that our legislative process is not at all transparent in the field of comitology.
This legislative process has been criticised in this House from time to time.
For this reason, I am convinced that we need external scrutiny of European legislation, and that this cannot just be carried out by the Commission itself.
The question arises whether this could be carried out by an agency â and you are all aware of our reservations about the creation of further agencies: âno increase in bureaucracy to reduce bureaucracyâ â or by other external authorities.
At all events, Parliament should be involved in choosing these external authorities.
Therefore, the four reports we are discussing today also provide an excellent starting point for arriving at a common position between Parliament and the Commission, and possibly even the Council, on this issue.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, better lawmaking in the European Union calls for sound provisions formulated more transparently, and also for swifter and more effective implementation and application of such provisions.
There are still too many instances of incorrect implementation of Community law.
This is partly due to the poor quality of the provisions and partly to deliberate action by the Member States, intent on undermining Community legislation for political, economic or administrative reasons.
In addition, the national courts in many Member States are still reluctant to implement the principle of the primacy of Community legislation.
If Union legislation is not deemed to be binding on all, and its transposition and implementation depend entirely on a governmentâs good will, the outcome could be the objective renationalisation of Community policy, as MrsÂ Frassoni rightly highlights in her report.
Clearly, this would be very detrimental to the internal market and to the entire .
Lack of uniformity of transposition may also lead to incorrect implementation of Union legislation should different provisions be implemented in different countries, thus undermining the Unionâs credibility.
If we are not capable of bringing pressure to bear upon the governments of Member States to transpose Union legislation correctly, we cannot expect people to believe that Union institutions such as the Commission, the Council or the European Parliament will effectively defend citizensâ rights derived from Union law.
Â Â  Madam President, the European Parliament must be the standard bearer for better legislation.
The European Parliamentâs work must be transparent and clearly formulated, and we must, in particular, remove the administrative barriers in European legislation.
I therefore call on Parliament's leadership to ensure that our legislative work is better coordinated so that we do not again end up in a situation in which the committees propose amendments that contradict each other.
At the same time, we must prioritise legal certainty and predictability for our citizens and not let the authorities or the European Court of Justice have too much discretion.
The President of the European Council - the Austrian Chancellor â has attacked the European Court of Justice for arrogating too much power to itself.
However, the Court is merely doing its job, because we legislators are not doing our own sufficiently well.
I am, unfortunately, afraid that, with the Services Directive, we are in the process of repeating previous errors and that we are letting the European Court of Justice have too much scope for interpretation.
This is an area in which we must all do better at second reading.
Â Â  â In my meetings with internal market stakeholders I have often faced criticism over current European legislation.
Poorly drafted legislation often makes it difficult to transpose drafts into the legal systems of the states concerned.
Participants in the public hearing on this matter, including Commissioner Verheugen, have confirmed that textual ambiguity often causes legal uncertainty or, alternatively, distorts competition and fragments the internal market, weakening the ability of consumers and enterprises to make full use of its benefits.
I therefore welcome the recommendations of the rapporteur, MrsÂ McCarthy, for the Commission to continue consolidating, simplifying and codifying Community legislation in order to make it easier to understand.
It goes without saying that the rule should apply that improvements in legislation must not weaken environmental, social or consumer standards.
Based on my experience from drafting the report on financing European standardisation, IÂ fully agree with the rapporteur that only good, clear and, above all, simple laws on the internal market will benefit citizens, consumers and enterprises, helping the European Union to strengthen its position with regard to competitors in the global economy.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that better regulations will provide a basis for efforts by European institutions to create jobs and generate growth in the European Union under the revised Lisbon Strategy.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for establishing a new architecture of better legislation for a Europe that is closer to its citizens.
Â Â  Madam President, there was a time when laws were made by gods; gods made perfect laws.
Then the gods became tired and men began to make laws, and laws are now imperfect.
At the moment, therefore, whether a law is good or bad is decided by nobody but ourselves, the only criterion for judging whether a law is good or bad is democracy, the criterion of the majority, because, as Rousseau said, âit is reasonable for the majority to decide, rather than the minority'.
Having established this principle in the modern democracies, democracy is representative and it is the parliaments that legislate; they can make mistakes, but the only criterion for legitimacy is the parliamentary majority.
On this basis, I believe that the greatest danger to democracy at the moment is the technocracy associated with economic interests â what is known as self-regulation or co-regulation â which is a way to put general interests into the hands of the individual interests of the few, and that is something we should remember.
I myself, having been elected to many terms in office, would not be prepared to renounce my legislative responsibilities in favour of sub-contracting and in favour of technocratic interests.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I realise that the new approach to European regulation requires changes in thinking, and possibly even changes to agreements.
If we wish, however, to retain the publicâs faith in the single market, we must stem the outflow of investment and the loss of jobs.
This means that we must not only reduce and simplify legislation, but we must also, in my opinion, reconsider the original aims of both European and national regulation.
This is a serious political challenge.
It is also up to us, ladies and gentlemen, to demand that every single measure, whether aimed at, for example, protecting health or the environment, is subjected to an impact assessment.
MrsÂ McCarthy is requesting this in the report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I would add that it must be made clear what costs will be borne by European producers, by how much public finances will be increased or depleted and what will be the effect on unemployment in our regions.
In particular we should know in advance how regulations aimed at improving standards will affect the competitiveness of European products vis-Ã -vis third countries, so as to ensure that the main outcome is not the further migration of plant and capital away from Europe.
Better regulation also means that, in the context of costs, we will investigate seriously whether the new measures might really improve the health or social conditions of our citizens, or whether this is merely an unfounded assumption.
Both as a doctor and as a politician I do not like it that so many European and national regulations are merely populist gestures.
Against that, I have no clear ideas on how to protect consumers against the harmful or counterfeit products from third countries that are displacing quality European products.
An example of this might be the childrenâs footwear from Asia that has orthopaedic defects.
The only solution to this would be a mandatory new health certificate for childrenâs footwear, which would also be better regulation for the public.
I am sorry that the Commission is being so slow to codify consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property.
Never before has the standard of European regulation been as important as it is today, when the Union faces serious competition from third countries.
The political aim of todayâs regulation is to safeguard both fair competition and the European consumer â not only inside but also outside Europe â and also to motivate the creativity of our citizens while ridding them of ineffective regulation.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, better Community lawmaking means assessing and defining the endeavour with regard to its technical side.
The complexity of national administrations, the limited facility for transposition and, often, the lack of will exacerbate things.
Sanctions by the Union itself would appear here to be the most effective measure.
Nonetheless, the wager for the proper application of Community legislation is the shaping of political and, above all, social will.
The proper application of Community legislation is a procedure which would allow Europe in the medium term to reduce its inertia and become more competitive in the international globalised environment, for the benefit of citizens, consumers and companies.
We need rules which are clear, integral and comprehensible.
Such texts, of course, presuppose clearer agreements between their authors.
It is very important to simplify and rationalise the legislative .
It would be even more preferable for laws respecting the principles of transparency, proportionality and consistency to regulate the basic points of a sector and make provision for implementing measures which also relate to the technical details.
As for the effectiveness of the arrangements, it is important to assess the costs and benefits of application.
Social dialogue is therefore needed with the agencies involved, which will thus be in a position to act as joint legislators.
As regards major political proposals in particular, this is the only way for us to win the confidence of the citizens.
A good law is not a labyrinthine law with strict procedures, it is a law which is convenient for citizens and, at the same time, makes them jointly responsible for its application.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that this debate has made it clear that the problem at the heart of our discussion here is regulatory impact assessments.
In my opinion, it has absolutely nothing to do with democracy being replaced with technocracy.
That is not what this is about.
It goes without saying that the democratic institutions are still in control.
The Commission makes decisions on proposals on its own responsibility, as, of course, do Parliament and the Council.
This matter hinges on a vital point, namely that we are changing the procedures governing our support.
Currently, the EU makes legislation on the basis of âlearning by doingâ.
We decide on something, and something comes out of it in the end that has some effect or other.
If we subsequently discover that the effect is undesirable, we have the problem that, thanks to the EUâs complex procedures, we cannot just quickly amend these laws, as national parliaments do, but need a complex procedure lasting many years to revise directives and amend regulations.
Thus, different mechanisms are needed from those often existing at national level.
We need to know what we are doing.
What regulatory impact assessments do is give us support; we are informed of the consequences our actions will have by independent people, too.
Even though, ultimately, the political decision remains ours to take, we still need this support.
That is quite crucial when the Commission, the Council and Parliament have to take decisions on behalf of 470Â million people in such a large economic area.
For that reason, too, it is vital to have an independent element.
I would appeal quite clearly once more to the Commission to work to ensure the introduction of this independent element within its own structures, too.
If it does not, Parliament â if it takes itself seriously â will be forced to conduct its own independent impact assessments in each case.
That is contrary to the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2003.
We should like the Commission to do this on its own initiative, so that we have sound bases for decision.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to try once more to explain what this is all about, and what it is not about.
It is not about less legislation, nor about worse legislation.
It is not about deregulation, nor about neoliberal free-market radicalism.
It is purely and simply about shaping the European legal system such as to make it understandable to the public, and such that the European economy can use it for growth, investment and job creation.
It is really the simplest thing in the world, and I am astonished time and again at the kind of motives being attributed to such a clear, unambiguous concept.
Whether or not we believe that we have too many European laws or that these may not always be good enough is irrelevant.
We are not talking about a matter of belief, but about an alarmingly large proportion of the European public being convinced that that is the case.
We are talking about European entrepreneurs and trade unions unanimously saying that that is the case.
Too much bureaucracy, too many laws, overly complicated laws, too many unnecessary restrictions.
It does not matter if this is really the case; what matters is that those for whom we make the laws are convinced that it is.
That is why we had to do something.
The âbetter lawmakingâ exercise proposed by the Commission uses all the instruments that have been mentioned here â various ways of simplifying and modernising legislation without changing its content.
To reiterate: the important thing is not to change the substance of regulations, but to make them user friendly and transparent.
I would once more solicit Parliamentâs support.
In reality, of course, we are concerned here with two large projects, two different projects, one of which is the retroactive screening of the whole corpus of legislation.
Let us not fool ourselves, however.
When European integration was still in its infancy, the attitude towards the adoption of legislation was quite different from that which prevails today, and, going back a little further, astonishing things are to be found in the annals of our statute books.
No one is denying that modernisation is needed there.
The screening of the whole corpus is no simple matter, and I should be very much in favour of our agreeing on common procedures for this, too, and not just with regard to codification, where this has already been done.
A separate issue is how to make regulations or laws in future.
The issue of impact assessments plays a quite fundamental role in this connection.
I agree with all of you here who have said that it is essential in a democracy that the legislature knows the consequences its action will have for those affected.
Of course, that does not mean that the legislature will refrain from acting once in possession of that knowledge.
It will always be a matter of judgment.
If the Commission were to say that a piece of legislation would incur costs to the economy of EURÂ XÂ billion but that, on the other hand, this legislation had to be presented in order to meet the publicâs need for health protection, the decision would not be a difficult one.
The Commission would then say that the protection of public health takes precedence, even if it costs money.
I should like to make it clear here that impact assessments do not automatically mean that, should it emerge that one of our actions also incurs costs, we simply say: we shall not do it.
It is a case of knowing exactly what we are doing.
Some important thoughts have been expressed here on the issue of how best to organise such impact assessments, and I can tell you quite frankly that a discussion on this issue is currently under way in the Commission, and both PresidentÂ Barroso and myself are truly of the opinion that the current system needs to be changed.
I wholeheartedly agree with those of you here who have said that the final decision on the validity of an impact assessment cannot lie with those who performed it, and that work on an impact assessment cannot be carried out exclusively by those making the law associated with it.
That is exactly the way PresidentÂ Barroso and I see it.
We are discussing the best possible solution.
Indeed, in his introductory statement, the President said that he is considering establishing an independent authority under his own responsibility for screening impact assessments.
We are ready and willing to continue our dialogue with Parliament, therefore.
The same goes for the comitology procedure, in which, indeed, we largely endorse Parliamentâs requests, and also for all the other ideas that have been expressed here.
I should just like to impress upon you once more that this exercise should not be dealt with in a technical, bureaucratic or formalistic way.
It is truly a highly political exercise.
It is intended to help reinforce public confidence in the system of European integration as a whole, and to help provide our economy with a stable, reliable framework, so as to resolve the great social issue of our time, namely that of the future of our jobs.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 16Â May.
Â Â  The rapporteur did an excellent job in identifying the obstacles in Community and Member State laws that create difficulties in the operation of the internal market.
The solution is the review of the existing laws and a better, more cautious preparation of new laws.
This is the responsibility of the legislation process itself.
Neither the Commission, who prepares and executes the laws, nor the legislating Council and Parliament are passing on this responsibility to others, and particularly not to external bodies.
Parliament has a role and responsibility in the review of existing laws in its capacity of legislator.
I respectfully ask the Commission to cooperate closely with Parliament, in the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making.
When preparing future regulations, it is not expedient to further complicate the long, bureaucratic procedures.
If we were to create an independent external audit body today to examine the quality of impact assessment studies, why should we not create an independent external inspection body tomorrow, to examine the independence of the audit body?
Rather than multiplying the bodies inspecting procedures that have proved to be wrong, we should develop new, more efficient working methods to improve the regulation of the internal market.
Together with the review of the laws, the Commission, Council and Parliament must also reconsider their own procedures, and if required, they must transform them responsibly.
Finally, I would like to call the attention of all three institutions to the fact that society will only trust and respect European law if we ensure full publicity and social control.
Â Â  European legislation is too complex and sometimes superfluous: an intelligent overhaul must make it possible for us to fight against this unhealthy and damaging lack of clarity.
On the one hand, we should make improvements by reducing and simplifying the existing legislation.
In this simplification project, as for any new measure adopted, the principles of proportionality and of subsidiarity must be respected: the European Union where it is necessary, when it is more effective than the Member States acting independently, as much as is needed, but no more than is needed.
The application of these apparently technical principles involves making a judgment as to their social, cultural or other appropriateness, even though there is no effective mechanism with which to monitor their application.
This loophole was filled by the draft Constitution.
While we are waiting for it to be ratified, we have to wonder about the proper application of these principles.
On the other hand, we need to improve the monitoring of the transposition of Community law because lack of legal certainty undermines the competitiveness of our businesses.
The introduction of national correspondents is a positive measure if the controls encompass a quantitative and a qualitative analysis and include an impact analysis regarding the social, economic and ecological environment.
These impact analyses must be comparable: they must therefore be standardised.
In order to achieve this aim, the European Parliament must strengthen its power in this area.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0017/2006).
The following questions have been submitted to the Commission.
Â Â  . The Commission recognises the importance of raising awareness on the new, more comprehensive EU regime against money laundering and terrorist financing.
That is why the Commission has already undertaken a number of information initiatives.
In that context I would like to mention: first, the Commission's participation in outreach efforts European professional organisations initiated by the OECD Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing; secondly, the ongoing consultation on the impact of the second Anti-Money Laundering Directive on the legal profession, which will lead to the publication of a report this summer, probably in July; thirdly, an extensive consultation of all stakeholders in the context of the preparation of possible implementing measures under the third Anti-Money Laundering Directive; fourthly, participation in conferences organised by Member States as part of their responsibilities for implementing EU money laundering directives.
In view of those ongoing initiatives, the Commission currently is not planning to conduct a further EU-wide information campaign.
However, the Commission continues to monitor closely the implementation of the directive, and it would not rule out further actions if there are shown to be problems in particular sectors and EU action would have added value.
Â Â  . Commissioner, that all sounds very good, but my eye was caught by something in the Law Society of England and Walesâs new money laundering newsletter.
It referred to an extensive industry that has developed around services aiming to help lawyers with their compliance duties.
It struck me that, as the third money laundering directive brought in the notion of proportionate checks of risk sensitivity, we need to make sure that the compliance falls where the really serious risks are.
Often constituents come to me because as individuals they have difficulties opening bank accounts.
I hope that you will convey that message.
It truly has to be risk-sensitive compliance.
Â Â  . In this particular directive the point about risk sensitivity is well made.
There are different categories of risk and the authorities should draw up their procedures on the basis of those risk assessments.
That is clearly specified in the third directive, and the point is well taken by the MEP.
I would not like to see a whole industry developing around people charging exorbitant fees for what should be a relatively reasonable procedure.
The levels of risk should be assessed.
There is very little to be done for those at a low level of risk, and there are higher categories.
That is clearly set out in the directive.
I thank the honourable Member for raising this question, because it gives me an opportunity to emphasise the point that she made in her supplementary question.
Â Â  Commissioner, bearing in mind that the IRA is believed after its Northern Bank robbery to have exploited money-laundering opportunities in Bulgaria, what specific steps are being taken to ensure that the authorities and organisations there, and indeed in Romania, are ready and able to implement the legislative requirements on money laundering and terrorist financing?
Â Â  . The honourable Member will be aware that part of the procedure that any applicant country must go through is that it must ensure that the directives of the Community are put into effect.
That will apply equally to Bulgaria and Romania.
The Member is probably also aware that these recommendations stem from the Financial Action Task Force â FATF, as it is known â and most countries around the world are bound to implement the recommendations of that particular body.
In the EU we have taken it upon ourselves, in a directive, to implement the recommendations, which has been done in the third money laundering directive.
You can rest assured that Bulgaria will be taking those measures into account in its legislation, as it is part of its deal to acquire full membership of the European Union.
Â Â  . The President has pointed out that I am taking this question on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Kroes.
The Commission has significant powers to ensure that Member States fully respect the internal market rules and do not create unlawful obstacles to cross-border mergers.
If a Member State violates internal market rules, the Commission can launch an infringement procedure pursuant to ArticleÂ 226 of the EC Treaty.
This procedure may require a certain time, as the Commission has, at two separate stages, to grant the Member State the opportunity to express its view before introducing an action before the Court of Justice, which then has to take the final decision on the alleged infringement.
Where justified by the circumstances of the case, the Commission can act more speedily by giving very short deadlines to Member States in the pre-litigation phase and asking the court to grant interim measures.
Even in that case, the Commission is obliged to take into account the observations of the Member States, including late responses, as it is settled case-law that the proper conduct of their pre-litigation procedure constitutes an essential guarantee required by the EC Treaty, not only in order to protect the rights of the Member State concerned but also to ensure that any contentious procedure would have a clearly defined dispute as its subject-matter.
Moreover, in cases where a Member State intervenes with regard to concentrations with a Community dimension, the Commission has special powers to adopt a decision under Article 21 of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 139/2004, known as the Merger Regulation.
Pursuant to that provision, the Commission has the exclusive competence to assess concentrations with a Community dimension.
Member States can adopt measures which could prohibit or prejudice or such operations only if, first, the measures in question protect the interests other than those taken into account by the Merger Regulation and, second, those measures are necessary and proportionate for the protection of interests compatible with EC law.
Public security, plurality of media and prudential rules are considered to be interests compatible with EC law.
Measures adopted in pursuit of those interests must in any event be necessary and proportionate, and the Commission may seek information from the national authorities about the intended measures in order to verify this.
The other interests must be communicated to the Commission before the adoption of those measures.
The Commission must then decide, within 25 working days, whether the national measures are justified for the protection of an interest compatible with EC law.
The Commission considers that the abovementioned provisions can allow it, in a timely manner, to act against any unlawful protectionist measures adopted by Member States.
The Commission is, moreover, firmly committed to use all the powers at its disposal to ensure full compliance with EC law.
Â Â  . That was a very lengthy response, but with respect it was not really an answer because I appreciate what the powers are.
My question is whether you really needed any more powers.
Specifically you said that the pre-litigation phase could be speeded up.
I should like a specific answer please: as regards the post-litigation phase, would you not agree that sometimes that can take several years and then again several years before a penalty is applied?
Would it not be handy to have powers to cut that short and make it even sharper?
Â Â  . I can understand the intent of the supplementary question put by the honourable Member.
Yes, it is sometimes frustrating to have to wait for a considerable period of time before there is action.
However, we are a Community of laws and we must abide by settled law on this.
The procedures must be followed.
Even in Member States these types of actions take some time.
Although sometimes there are mechanisms to expedite the process in Member States, and even in the Community you can exercise rights to expedite the process, it is still pretty time consuming.
So, I am afraid that we cannot rule by or by in this Community.
It would be an abuse of privilege.
I do not think anybody would advocate that.
On the other hand, it is sometimes frustrating that there is such a considerable period of time, but I do not see any other way around it.
Furthermore, I do not foresee any Member State rushing to give the Commission more immediate new powers or powers to expedite the process.
We have to live by what is there.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr DÃ©sir, the Commission has not yet received notification of the French law referred to earlier in the question raised by the Member, and the Commission is therefore not ready to express a detailed opinion on the law.
The aim of Directive 2000/78/EC, as already mentioned, is in fact to prevent discrimination in the area of employment, especially age discrimination.
The Directive also sets out several exceptions to the general rule.
Allow me to quote directly from the Directive.
âNevertheless, differences in treatment in connection with age may be justified under certain circumstances and therefore require specific provisions which may vary in accordance with the situation in Member States.
It is therefore essential to distinguish between differences in treatment which are justified, in particular by legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and discrimination which must be prohibitedâ.
Another quotation: âPutting in place special conditions regarding access to employment and vocational training, and occupation, including dismissal and remuneration conditions, for young people, older workers and persons with caring responsibilities, in order to promote their vocational integration or ensure their protectionâ.
So you see, the situation from the standpoint of the Directive is of a twofold nature.
The Directive acknowledges different forms of handling, where there are legitimate grounds, and different measures, where such measures are of a character that is in proportion with the purpose for which they are intended.
I have nothing further to say about the situation that currently prevails.
The definitive viewpoint on any notified law must understandably rest with the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Â Â  . Commissioner, I think, in fact, that when the Commission receives notice of the First Employment Contract, it will be important that it can conduct a precise analysis of the conditions in which this law would authorise allowing the employment contract of young people under the age of 26 to be terminated during the first two years.
If, as you have said, directive 2000/78 allows differences in treatment, including on grounds of age, it is within the framework of positive actions, of actions proportionate to the desired objective.
Recently, a judgment was delivered by the Court of Justice â Mangold judgment of 22 November 2005 â concerning another piece of legislation, the German âHartzÂ 4â law, which relates to provisions for older workers.
This judgment took the view that, in this case, the way of renewing fixed-term contracts exclusively for these older workers was not proportional to the desired objective.
I think that, in the case of the First Employment Contract, nobody believes that the measure in question is favourable to young people under the age of 26.
This is therefore clearly an act of discrimination towards them, which denies them the benefit of a number of elements of employment law.
I hope that the Commission will rely on Court of Justice case law in order to condemn this First Employment Contract.
Â Â  . Mr DÃ©sir, you cited one particular case which is very important for assessing similar situations, since the Directive does in fact assume that each measure will be on the one hand proportionate and on the other hand legitimate in relation to its purpose.
In the case you mentioned relating to older workers, the Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that the purpose was legitimate but the measure was not proportionate and therefore the measure was rejected.
At this point in time, as I have said, due to the fact that the law has not yet been notified, we do not know what form it will take, and indeed I have even read reports in the media that its final form has still not been determined, so it is impossible for me, as a representative of the Commission, to provide further details.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in EU Member States such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, a full-blown labour market for trainees has developed.
Increasing numbers of regular workers are being replaced by unpaid or poorly paid trainees, or in Germany, for example, by state-financed â1 euro jobsâ â in which previously unemployed persons are entitled to earn EURÂ 1 per hour on top of their unemployment benefit â which are not liable to tax or social-security contributions.
To what extent is the Commission aware of this problem?
Â Â  . The Commission, of course, monitors the labour market in the individual Member States, as well as developments in employment legislation.
Incidentally, a Green Paper on the development of employment legislation in Europe will be published shortly, and will become, I hope, the basis for some very far-reaching discussions on the customs, methods and development of employment law and employer-employee legal relationships in the EU Member States.
Otherwise, of course, the Commission can monitor and take decisions only within such frameworks as have been provided under the Treaty, and here it must be said that the Treaty does not provide direct links to employment legislation.
Â Â  . Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 485/2005 to which the honourable Member refers extends the possibility of withdrawal of fishing vessels from the Community fishing fleet with public aid to vessels which can be transferred to the countries affected by the tsunami for the benefit of the fishing communities concerned.
This possibility is granted on an exceptional basis, under certain conditions and only during a limited period.
While several countries in the Indian Ocean whose fishing sectors were affected by the tsunami disaster enquired about the possibility of a transfer of vessels, only Sri Lanka submitted a formal request for vessels.
It concerned 120 vessels with an overall length of 9 to 12 metres.
The Commission informed Member States of the request and reminded them on several occasions of the obligation to report on the transfer of vessels.
Despite the unanimous adoption of the regulation by the Council, all 20Â Member States which are engaged in maritime fisheries have now informed the Commission that they have not identified any possibility of transfers of vessels in response to the Sri Lankan request.
As the regulation sets a deadline of 30Â June 2006, there are at present no more prospects of transfers of vessels under the scheme.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have, then, no option but to conclude that the regulation we approved was a meaningless exercise, which is in fact what we predicted.
I think that the regulation as it was presented was nothing but an act of public relations and it is evident from the Commissionerâs response that this was a bad piece of legislation.
I would like to ask the Commissioner an additional question: if this regulation does not help the countries affected by the tsunami rebuild their fishing fleet, can he say whether the Commission has taken other measures in order to really help those countries build their own boats and organise a more appropriate way of fishing in the regions that were hit by the tsunami last year?
Â Â  . Obviously, when this legislation was enacted, by way of exception to the rule that had been established, under which it was no longer possible to effect transfers of vessels to third countries, it was made subject to certain significant restrictions, one of which related, for example, to the length of the vessels.
I remember the discussion here in Parliament that we should not allow a situation where vessels would be transferred to third countries stricken by the tsunami without imposing any conditions because that could, in actual fact, increase the fishing effort and therefore intensify the problems that existed in certain fisheries in those third-country waters, but that the vessels should be suitable and appropriate to the fisheries that were traditionally carried out in those countries.
Therefore, we had restrictions with regard to the size of vessels, the age of vessels, the fact that vessels should not use towed gear and other conditions relating to ecological resource management and seaworthiness.
Having said that, I must underline the fact that the responses we have received from the Member States on why it was not possible to identify vessels for transfer to Sri Lanka were either that there were no appropriate vessels available among those to be decommissioned in certain Member States, or that decommissioning was not foreseen in certain other Member States, or that the incentives provided for the transfer of vessels were not sufficiently attractive.
I must also underline the fact that this was a Commission initiative aimed at trying to help the countries affected by the tsunami, with regard to the fisheries sector specifically, if there was scope to do so.
There was an element of additionality which was therefore the main thrust of the assistance, albeit under the general umbrella of development cooperation rather than under the fisheries portfolio.
It was an âoptional extraâ that was not taken up.
I must underline that the end result was that certain individual Member States gave assistance to the tsunami-affected countries by providing funds for the acquisition of vessels which have been purchased without any control measures.
The end result today is that there is a significantly larger fleet in the tsunami-affected areas, which creates much more pressure on the fishing effort than before and creates further problems.
Rather than moving in the direction of sustainable fisheries, according to the information we have, there are significantly more problems than there were before.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, is the very example the Commissioner has just given not a typical indication that the Union should endeavour to view disaster relief as a separate entity and provide funds promptly to this end â as, indeed, had already been done in the case of the floods â rather than attempting to push things forward by way of derogations within traditional policy areas: fisheries, transport or other policy?
After all, experience has shown that that takes far too long and does not work.
Â Â  . Yes, obviously it is important to try to strike the right balance between the needs of the countries that would be affected by such disasters and long-term assistance, which should aim not to create further pressures or difficulties for those countries by trying to help rebuild the economy in a sustainable way.
We are trying to do this specifically with regard to fisheries; however, unless there is closer coordination between Commission initiatives and the individual initiatives of Member States, the chances are that the possibility of success will be limited.
Â Â  . Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramosâ question concerning the ban on the use of deepwater fixed gillnets to the north and west of Britain and Ireland follows a number of written questions on the same subject from her and from MrsÂ FragaÂ EstÃ©vez and MrÂ VarelaÂ Suanzes-Carpegna.
The ban, which took effect on 1Â February 2006, was introduced in the TAC and Quota Regulation that was adopted at the Council in December 2005.
It was proposed in response to the report of the DEEPNET investigation, which highlighted the potential damage that those fisheries may be causing to deepwater sharks and other species.
The DEEPNET Report was carried out by reputable scientific organisations in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Norway, and so was taken seriously by the Commission.
In parallel to the prohibition in Community waters, at its annual meeting in November 2005, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission adopted an identical prohibition of deep-sea gillnets in its regulatory area from 1Â February 2006.
First, I should like to reassure you that this ban is intended as a temporary measure in response to serious concerns about the practices of some of the participants in such fisheries and in particular about the impact of those practices on vulnerable species such as deep-sea sharks.
Those species are in such a poor state and take so long to recover their numbers once depleted that the Commission has to react very quickly without waiting for definitive scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).
The prohibition was originally envisaged as an emergency measure in September but deferred until the December Council to give time for consultations.
Unfortunately, no concrete suggestions for alternative measures were presented in time for inclusion in the proposal discussed at the Council in December.
I am aware that most of the fishermen using such gear behave responsibly and that it is a minority who are causing concern.
For that reason, I would like to introduce measures to regulate the activity of deep-sea gillnets at the earliest opportunity.
The Commission has already had some feedback on possible approaches, especially from the North-Western Waters Regional Advisory Council, which suggests an earlier reopening of the hake fishery and a limited number of vessels participating in the monkfish and deep-sea fisheries with observer coverage.
The Commission services will meet with the North-Western Waters Regional Advisory Council and scientists on Friday, 7Â April 2006, where we will discuss those possibilities.
Depending on the outcome of that meeting, a proposal to allow a limited fishery under an observer programme could be made in May 2006.
The data collected by such a programme could then be made available to the STECF, which will address the issue in late June or early July.
The geographical limits of the prohibition were determined by the coverage of the DEEPNET study.
I am aware that there may be similar problems in other areas, but we currently have no information that would justify enlarging the area of the prohibition.
That is another reason for bringing in effective legislation applicable in all areas as soon as practicable.
Unfortunately, the prohibition is bound to create economic difficulties for the fleets concerned.
No transitional measures to mitigate the effects of the ban have been planned, but I would encourage Member States to make full use of the possibilities that are already available for the temporary cessation of activities under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance to help those most severely affected.
Â Â  . Commissioner, the truth is that I have heard all of that on previous occasions; I thought that you were going to tell me something rather newer.
For example, that you would insist rather more on those dates that you have mentioned; May and June.
What I really wanted to ask was what possibility is there of amending this decision immediately, what possibility is there of amending the Regulation on TACs and quotas, so that the pelagic longlines at least â which fish hake with nets that do less harm, as you yourself acknowledge in letters that I have seen â can return to those waters; and what timescales the Commission has in mind for the definitive regulation of fixed gillnets, so that the sector does not have to remain in a situation of uncertainty.
I ask this, Commissioner, because this decision had and has still having very negative effects, in particular socio-economic effects.
Â Â  . Yes, there are two aspects to it: one concerns the action that can be taken in the short term to try to soften the impact of the temporary imposition of the ban on deep sea gillnets.
We are discussing this with the North-Western Waters RAC, and a meeting is scheduled for 7Â April when, hopefully, we will be able to discuss this matter with the North-Western Waters RAC.
Immediately afterwards, we will hopefully be able to take certain decisions on introducing the possibility of limited fisheries for hake and perhaps look at the possibility with regard to monkfish, establishing a system of supervision on board vessels.
We are also looking into establishing permanent measures which would replace the driftnet ban to cover all Community waters.
Later in the year, we could then come up with a proposal to withdraw the driftnet ban and replace it with permanent measures, satisfying ourselves that there is no longer any risk of irreparable damage to the stock of deepwater sharks as a result of fishermen leaving nets in the sea for extensive periods, fishing on their own account and causing significant damage to the habitat.
Â Â  The Commissioner probably finds himself between Scylla and Charybdis in this argument, but I am sure that he will bear in mind the great damage that drift nets and gill nets have done in the past to, for example, the wild salmon in the North Atlantic, and that he will be robust in protecting the fisheries from that method of fishing.
Â Â  . Yes, one needs to draw a distinction, because we are speaking here of deep-sea gill nets, which are normally used very selectively, and therefore we do not want to discourage the use of this type of gear.
However, if nothing is done, such fishing for an extensive period of time causes significant damage.
Therefore, we want to curtail the abuse of the use of gill nets, not their proper use.
So, on the one hand, given that the use of gill nets is quite selective as a gear, we would not want to discourage that; but on the other hand, we certainly want to discourage the abuse of gill nets, as that would create so-called âghost netsâ, which continue to be used for fishing for a period of a month or so, causing significant damage to the species concerned.
Â Â  . I would like to remind the honourable Member that the negotiations on the new EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement are concluded and that the Commission and the Moroccan Government initialled the draft agreement in July 2005.
With respect to its territorial application, the text of the new agreement is no different from the previous agreement, which ended in 2000.
With regard to the honourable Memberâs specific question, I would like to point out that the Polisario Front is not formally accredited with the European Community.
There is no formal policy dialogue between the Commission and the Polisario Front.
Concerning fisheries negotiations, the Commission has been authorised by the Council to negotiate with the Kingdom of Morocco.
It has no mandate to extend the negotiations to third parties.
In the framework of the preparations for the negotiation of the EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement, the Commission thoroughly evaluated the political, legal and economic implications of an eventual agreement.
In this case, as in others, the Commission is taking care to avoid a situation where the conclusion of new agreements in the field of fisheries could become a factor in international disputes or conflicts.
Regarding the issue of the EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the question of Western Sahara, the Commission took special care to fully respect the relevant principles of international law and support the efforts of the United Nations in finding an appropriate solution with regard to Western Sahara.
The content of the initial text, as in the case of the previous fisheries agreement, does not in any way prejudice the issue related to the international status of Western Sahara.
The Commission is convinced that the new EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement is in conformity with international law and with the opinion of the UN Legal Advisor of 29Â January 2002.
The Commissionâs view with regard to the geographical scope of the agreement has been confirmed and endorsed by the opinion of the Councilâs legal service and the European Parliamentâs legal service.
Â Â  . â Within the context of the EUâs development policy, the Union has earmarked funding for refugee camps for the Sahrawi people run by the Polisario Front in the Western Sahara region.
I should therefore like to ask, once again, whether, as part of its approach to the problem of Western Sahara, the Commission intends to ask the Polisario Front what it thinks of this agreement, given that it will have far-reaching implications for Western Sahara.
Â Â  . As I said in my previous response, the negotiations were conducted by the Commission with the representatives of the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco.
The authorisation that we had from the Council was to negotiate with Morocco.
The negotiations concluded with an agreement which entails that any fisheries carried out in waters within the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco should benefit the communities directly adjacent to where the fisheries are carried out.
It is therefore the responsibility of the Kingdom of Morocco to see to it that any benefits deriving from fisheries carried out in waters adjacent to the Polisario Front area would go to the communities living there.
Â Â  Commissioner, this morning Parliament agreed to reject the Councilâs request to apply the urgent procedure to the Agreement with Morocco.
What will be the consequences of the European Parliamentâs decision this morning in terms of the entry into force of that agreement?
Â Â  . Yesterday, I took part in a meeting of the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament, and the understanding is that the rapporteur will present his report to the Fisheries Committee in early May, with the possibility of submitting amendments, which would then be put to the vote in the Fisheries Committee in mid-May, and then come to the plenary for a decision during the Strasbourg part-session in May.
I will be discussing with the Austrian Presidency the possibility of having the Council decide on this agreement in the meeting of the Council of Ministers later on in May, so that if it works in that way, the agreement can come into effect from the beginning of June.
That would mean only monthâs delay as regards the terms agreed between the Commission and the Kingdom of Morocco.
Â Â  . On the basis of the European Council agreement dating from 16 and 17Â December 2005, the situation of the outermost regions for the period 2007-2013 is as follows.
For the parts of Europe concerned, there will be a higher co-financing rate under the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund.
It will be 85%, both for regions under the convergence objective and for those outermost regions which are part of the regional competitiveness and employment objective.
There will also be a specific additional financial allocation to help finance operating aid to offset the additional costs which are incurred in these regions due to their geographical location.
The co-financing rate under this additional allocation will be at the level of 50%; this additional allocation amounts to EURÂ 35 per year per capita in each of the seven outermost regions.
We then have specific situations as regards individual outermost regions.
There is Madeira, which will be keeping the status of a phasing-in region, but at the same time will benefit from more generous financial transitional arrangements, similar to those of the statistical phasing-out regions.
There are also the Canary Islands, which will benefit from an additional envelope of EURÂ 100 million over the period between 2007 and 2013.
With regard to territorial cooperation â the objective set for the policy â all the outermost regions will be eligible for the transnational strand of the European territorial cooperation objective, and the French outermost regions, like the Canary Islands, will be eligible for the cross-border strand. In addition, Madeira, the Azores and the Canary Islands will benefit from special provisions applicable to Portugal and Spain.
As you know in the case of Portugal, Madeira and the Azores will also be eligible for the Cohesion Fund, as also for the temporary application of the n+3 rule for the period 2007-2010.
In the case of Spain and the Canary Islands, that means they will also be eligible for the Cohesion Fund and for an additional allocation that was awarded to Spain in the form of a technological fund.
The participation of the Canary Islands would be by decision of the government.
As you may know, the outermost regions can also benefit from specific measures, which aim at supporting traditional sectors of these regions.
There will be specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union, as well as specific treatment under the rural development policy, in particular concerning the intervention rates of the new European agricultural fund for rural development.
On top of that, of course, there are the ordinary instruments that exist under our policies, and all the regions will have access to all the Community programmes envisaged under all the titles of the European budget.
Those in brief are the specific measures available under the new financial perspective for the outermost regions.
Â Â  . Commissioner, so far the Commission has done great work helping the outermost regions, but it is clear that in the new financial perspective there is a reduction in the European Union's overall effort.
I would like simply to ask you a very specific question: whether, within the new context of the crisis taking place in regions close to the European Union, North Africa in particular, it is possible for the European Union, through the outermost regions and the new fund allocated to the neighbourhood policies, to help to resolve the problem, which affects the whole of the Union, of mass access to the European Union for immigration.
In other words, what cooperation instruments could we have in order to prevent the immense crisis taking place in the regions close to these outermost regions of the European Union?
Â Â  .
As you know the regions in Europe can also use part of the funds allocated to them to invest in those regions that are not in EU Member States, but which are part of neighbouring countries, so this possibility of using part of the allocation on neighbouring territory is open to the outermost regions.
Additionally, within the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument, which is still currently under preparation with regard to its legal form by the Commission, there will be the possibility of working together with neighbouring countries and regions on issues related to those that you are addressing to create jobs and employment opportunities on the other side of the border.
In the Canaries, in particular, they will be able to allocate part of the money in the new neighbourhood and partnership instrument and thus will be able to have external cooperation, for example, with the border areas of Morocco.
So that is what this policy, through the financial instruments, can do.
But on top of that comes a political concern. Within the Commission we had a discussion a week or so ago on the situation in some of the outermost regions in the context of migration and the difficult situations experienced.
So, within other instruments and politically, the Commission will be involved in the very near future to help address this issue.
We have some financial instruments, which are restricted.
As you have said yourselves, the budget is not what we expected when the Commission put the proposal on the table, nevertheless, in addition to those restricted financial means, there are also efforts to work with neighbouring countries, or regions next to our outermost regions, to find political solutions to some of the problems.
Â Â  The challenges faced by the outermost regions of the Union are very similar to those challenges which are facing the northernmost regions of the EU.
Would you say that the balance between EU support to the outermost regions and EU support to the northernmost regions is now met in the proposals for cohesion?
In addition, could you briefly outline what the cofinancing rates and special targeted measures are for the northernmost regions of the European Union, especially the northern parts of Finland and Sweden?
Â Â  . It is a very difficult question.
It is very difficult to see what balance is in this case, because the issues and problems faced by those regions are very different.
Some of our regions suffer because they are very sparsely populated and that means that infrastructure costs are very high.
This is a challenge not only for us at European level but also for the governments involved.
Other regions suffer from overpopulation and from problems of migration.
Therefore, it is very difficult to measure what is balanced and what is not.
As you know, within this very restrictive budget during the Council â which is also part of the European tradition â there were also additional requests put on the table.
What I presented â all those additional measures which were offered to the regions â is something that came during the Council and was not part of a global balanced proposal of the Commission.
We have to look at the current situation and try to make those resources work as well as possible and try to use the resources that were allocated to the sparsely populated regions of Sweden and Finland in the most efficient way and do the best we can.
However, I do not see a need to compare the EURÂ 540 million that Finland and Sweden received for those regions to the money allocated to the outermost regions.
The situations are very different: the money has a different value.
The Commission will certainly work with both types of problems â in the outermost regions and the sparsely populated regions â to get the best we can from the funds which will be available.
Â Â  â Commissioner, the Commission indeed presented a very ambitious financial framework.
The Council cut it drastically at its December meeting.
Negotiations are currently being held in the trialogue.
What I find a little lacking here is the role of the Commission.
If the Commission presents such an ambitious proposal, why is there nothing more to be heard from it, and why is Parliament no longer willing to fight to receive the budgetary resources we need for the implementation of these programmes?
This particularly concerns rural development â not only in the outermost regions, but in rural areas in general, where a massive transfer of funds is required to reach necessary levels.
Â Â  . I do not have the feeling that the Commission is not strong in the negotiations.
My understanding is that we are trying to help reach a compromise at a level that would be satisfactory for all three institutions.
It so happens that the two institutions â the Council and Parliament â have gone quite far in financial terms; in terms of the level of the budget that is on the table.
The Commissionâs efforts should go, in my view, towards helping them to find a compromise.
The level of budget is extremely important.
We hope that we will have the funds also for those areas that were cut so seriously in December.
But it is also important to reach agreement.
I do not know what the trialogue looks like as I do not participate in it, but I can imagine that there are moments when the Commissionâs role is to be the one who helps to find a compromise.
That might give you the impression that we do not care about money, but that is not the case.
We do care.
We know that if we had more money we could do more for Europe, with Europe and in Europe for all citizens.
However, sometimes realism and the challenge of timing are also important.
That is my understanding.
Â Â  . You may be aware that the before the end of last year the Greek authorities submitted to the Commission a list of requests for exemptions from the n+2 rule.
The total amount was more than EURÂ 655Â million.
The intention was to cover an amount of EURÂ 342Â million, potentially subject to the n+2 rule.
The request submitted relates to 12 operational programmes in Greece and also implies the intervention of three funds: the ERDF, the ESF and the agricultural fund.
The Commission has completed the processing of the Greek request concerning the application of the n+2 rule and reached the conclusion that what is left as the potential cut due to the n+2 rule is EURÂ 8Â 638Â 000, which is less than what was initially on the table.
We are still waiting for confirmation by the Greeks and, if they confirm this, this will be the amount the Commission effectively expects as the commitment.
The second part of your question concerns the eligibility period for the commitments and payments.
As you know, for the 2000-2006 programming period, the eligibility period ends on 31Â December 2008.
Commitments are, theoretically â and I would like to stress that â possible during the entire eligibility period, which means 2008.
However, commitments should be made early enough to allow the final recipients to implement the operations and projects and to carry out the payments before the final eligibility date for the expenditure, which is the end of 2008.
We will close the expenditure for all the Member States under the current financial perspective on 31Â December 2008, with the exception of programmes and measures which are covered by state aid.
According to the rules, this eligibility date is 30Â April 2009.
I also want to inform you that, according to all our legal analyses and the information we have in the Commission, there could be no exceptions to these conditions â I mean the end of 2008 or April 2009 â as regards the final possible date of eligibility.
So the final date is the end of 2008 or April 2009, and that is the situation.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to ask you something else.
Given that acceptance of the exemption requests shifts the pressure to forthcoming years, I should like the Commission to tell me how Greece's obligations for the years 2006 and 2007 are being formulated and what is the Commission's prediction, if there is one, for the application of the n+2 rule for these two years?
Â Â  .
With this kind of question it is too risky to embark on an effort to respond without good checking and preparation, so I can make a commitment that we will try as early as possible in the next few days to respond and come back to you with an assessment of the current situation as regards the payments and commitments for Greece.
Â Â  Questions 48 to 59 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
What is the Commissioner's view of the current state of preparations and the schedule for the introduction of the euro in the ten EU Member States which acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004?
According to opinions expressed in the press and in official statements, assessment of new EU Member Statesâ readiness to join the euro zone will take account not only of the Maastricht criteria but also of each countryâs general economic level of development.
Specifically, it has been declared that Slovenia, on account of its higher level of GDP per head than that of Lithuania and Estonia, can be invited to join the euro zone, whereas the latter two countries will not be invited to do so even if they fulfil the Maastricht criteria, including the level of inflation.
Are these statements accurate?
Can the Commission give a clear assurance that any decision on the accession of new Member States to the euro zone will be made on the basis of the Maastricht criteria alone and not of any other criteria?
Â Â  . I shall respond to Mr Posseltâs first question by saying that Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia have set 1 January 2007 as their target date for adopting the euro; Cyprus, Latvia and Malta propose adopting the euro on 1 January 2008; Slovakia intends to do so on 1 January 2009; the Czech Republic and Hungary hope to enter the eurozone in 2010 and Poland has not set a target date.
At least every two years, or at the request of a Member State, the Commission and the European Central Bank must report to the Council on the progress made by the Member States in terms of compliance with their obligation to become full members of the Economic and Monetary Union.
In February 2006, the Commission, in agreement with the European Central Bank, announced that the next convergence report, on all of the States that are not members of the eurozone, except the two with an opt-out clause, the United Kingdom and Denmark, will be published in October 2006, that is, two years after the last assessment.
Nevertheless, in accordance with Article 122 of the Treaty, two Member States, Slovenia and Lithuania, have asked the Commission and the European Central Bank for an individual report on the progress they have made in terms of convergence; the Commission and also the European Central Bank intend to adopt this report on these two Member States on 16 May 2006.
In the event that the assessment of compliance with the economic and legal convergence criteria is positive, the Commission would present the corresponding proposal and, following consultation of this Parliament, in the middle of June the European Council could analyse and, if appropriate, adopt, a decision, and definitive proposed derogation could therefore be discussed by the Ecofin Council on 11 July.
Independently of this process, we in the Commission of course maintain regular contacts with all of the States intending to enter the eurozone, we monitor them very closely and we cooperate with them in relation to the practical preparations for this important decision.
In response to Mr Paleckisâs question, I must say to him that of course the Commission will apply the principle of equal treatment when assessing the progress of the ten new Member States in terms of economic and legal convergence.
As I have just said, the countries will be assessed according to the procedure and the criteria laid down in the Treaty, in particular Article 122, and the Commission obviously has no intention of changing this procedure or introducing additional criteria.
With regard to the inflation criterion, as you are aware, the Treaty states that the Member State in question is obliged to maintain sustainable price trends and an average inflation rate which does not exceed that of the three Member States with the best price stability results by any more than 1.5%.
The Commission proposes applying this criterion rigorously in the future, just as it has done in the past.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his precise answer.
However, if I may say so, he spoke so fast at the beginning that the German interpretation was practically incomprehensible.
I should like to query whether I have understood correctly, therefore, that the last two of these ten Member States, namely the Czech Republic and Hungary, are due to join in 2010?
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether developments have really been finalised, or whether there are some of the ten Member States who have requested postponement beyond 2010.
Â Â  . Thank you for your response to my question.
The Maastricht criteria are being strictly applied to those countries which are applying for entry into the eurozone.
Lithuania cannot be accepted into the eurozone, even though it currently exceeds the inflation criteria by a mere 0.1%.
Lithuania complied with this condition over the past six years, as did others.
In the current eurozone, many members are infringing one or other of the Maastricht criteria.
For instance, some large countries for many years breached the conditions on budgetary deficit without receiving a red card, the same with inflation and other criteria.
Are the new Member States not being discriminated against here with these double standards?
Â Â  . I shall begin by responding to Mr Posselt and I shall not speak too quickly.
The objectives I have mentioned in relation to when Members States wish to enter the eurozone, are dates defined by those States themselves.
The first three countries, Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia, originally stated that they wished to enter the eurozone in 2007.
For its part, Hungary has set a target date of 2010, as you have mentioned.
As I said before, the only one not to have set a target date is Poland.
That is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient condition.
The sufficient condition is that the assessments of both the Commission and the European Central Bank, of compliance with the criteria laid down in the Treaty, indicate that the Member States that wish to enter the eurozone have indeed complied with those criteria.
Both sides must demonstrate will: the Member States and ultimately the Council, on the proposal of the Commission, once the Commission and the European Central Bank have judged that the criteria have been complied with.
That is the situation.
In the case of Poland, which is the only one of the Member States that has not yet set a target date for entering the eurozone â Sweden is also in this position following the ânoâ vote in the 2003 referendum â the Commission would point out that it is the obligation of the Member States themselves â except in the case of those with an exception clause, which are just the United Kingdom and Denmark â to propose their entry into the eurozone and it is our obligation and responsibility to assess whether or not they conform to the requirements.
I cannot tell Mr Paleckis in advance what the content of the report that the Commission will adopt on 16 May will be and it would be even more difficult for me to anticipate the content of the European Central Bankâs report, for obvious reasons.
What I can say once again to the honourable Member â and I have said this on many occasions â is that the Commission is going to assess whether or not the criteria have been met as defined in the Treaty.
The Commission does not set these criteria on a whim.
It is a requirement of the Treaty and our obligation is to comply with the Treaty, and I would repeat that in making that assessment, we shall be treating everybody equally, and we shall not be applying certain yardsticks to some countries and other yardsticks to others.
In short, therefore, compliance with the Treaty, a clear and rigorous assessment of whether or not the criteria are met and equal treatment for everybody.
I will be able to inform you and all of the honourable Members of the conclusions of this analysis on 16 May.
Â Â  New Member States must comply with the convergence criteria in order to introduce the euro.
In order to ensure compliance with the convergence criteria, the Commission and Council are formulating various proposals for these Member States.
My question is this: may a Member State follow an economic policy that ignores the proposals of the Council and Commission, and if it does, what does it risk by doing so?
Â Â  . Mr President, in general, for all of the Member States with derogations, which are not members of the eurozone, but with an obligation to join in the future, we carried out that assessment in October 2004 and we will repeat it in October 2006.
In the case of the two Member States that have made individual requests for that assessment â to which they have the right, according to the Treaty â that is, for Slovenia and Lithuania, we shall present our individual assessment for each of them on 16 May.
I cannot tell you the result of a report that will be adopted by the College of Commissioners on 16 May in advance.
If you wish, I shall come to Parliament on the afternoon of 16 May to explain the content of the report to you, but I cannot say anything before then.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the Commissioner has already mentioned one of the problems.
We are discussing how seriously new Member States are taking their commitments, but what we are not really discussing is how, specifically, a Member State that has been meeting the criteria for some time but obviously does not wish to join the eurozone, namely Sweden, sees its future.
The question is whether the case of Sweden could potentially set a bad example to others, who are now new Member States.
The Commissioner named a new Member State that has not yet announced a date.
If sanctions are not imposed, will this not set a negative precedent?
Â Â  . I agree with Mr Rack that we are facing a problem, because there is one Member State that called a referendum, the result was negative and, on the basis of that negative result, it cannot, it does not wish to, or it does not intend to, comply with an obligation that falls to it as a Member State.
We must deal with the issue of how to resolve this question.
The Commission felt it prudent not to do so immediately after a referendum.
The Commission must fulfil its obligation to comply with the Treaty while at the same time taking account of the opinion expressed by the citizens of that Member State, but I have not forgotten that the Commission must hold talks with Sweden to consider how that country can fulfil its obligations as a member of the European Union in the future.
The same thing is happening in relation to Poland, which had originally proposed a particular year as an objective for its entry into the euro.
The new Polish authorities say that they do not accept the objective of their predecessors and that they are not setting a future objective at the present time.
And I have had the opportunity to remind the new Polish Government that it will have to do so.
We do not want to apply pressure, but we cannot forget that this is an obligation for the Member States.
As I said before, we must combine fulfilling our responsibilities with political prudence, but what I will say â and I have said this publicly on other occasions â is that compliance with an obligation which falls to the 25 countries of the European Union as Member States cannot not be put to a referendum.
In this case there is an exception in place for two countries, the United Kingdom and Denmark, but, the Stateâs obligations should not be put to a referendum generally, and neither should the 23 States without an opt-out clause do so, because the question of whether or not a Treaty is complied with cannot be put to a vote.
Â Â  Commissioner, I wanted to ask about inflation.
As we are aware, inflation in the eleven countries, which were first to join the economic and monetary union and were ready to introduce the Euro, has surpassed the index for a significant period.
Only two countries did not exceed the index.
The others exceeded it for between 10 months and almost six years from the end of 1998 to the end of 2005.
My question: are we applying double standards to the new states and is the economic and monetary union a technical union or is it simply a political union.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commissionâs obligation is to ensure compliance with the Treaties and it goes without saying that on previous occasions, when the eurozone was created, or when the twelfth member of the eurozone joined, the Commission and the Council of the time, with the opinion of the European Parliament, took account of the obligation to ensure compliance with the Treaties.
Myself as Commissioner, and the Commission, headed by Mr Barroso, are naturally not going to fail in our obligation to apply the Treaties and ensure compliance with them.
The economic criteria, including that of inflation, are stipulated in a protocol annexed to the Treaty and of a legal value identical to that of the provisions and articles of the Treaty.
We cannot therefore ignore them or amend them.
It is true that an academic discussion is under way on a correct definition of the criteria, but the procedure for changing the Treaties will consist of an Intergovernmental Conference and a process of ratification when the time seems right and when there is a sufficient majority to do so.
It is not for the Commission to change the Treaties and it has the obligation to apply them.
It is true that there is asymmetry, because compliance with the criteria is required in order to enter the eurozone, but then, once a country is a member, it can fail to comply with the criteria; once a country is a member of the eurozone, it can have more inflation, more debt or more deficit.
In the case of deficit and debt, there are rules relating to budgetary discipline â Article 104 of the Treaty â and the Stability and Growth Pact but, in the case of inflation, those rules do not exist, but there are some rules that are probably tougher than legal rules in application of the Treaty: the rules of the market.
There are currently countries in the eurozone that are suffering considerably because they are not able to moderate the evolution of their inflation or their unit labour costs.
I believe that we must also take account of the harsh reality of how the markets judge those who do not comply with certain rules, quite apart from the Commissionâs obligation to ensure compliance with the rules of the Treaty.
Â Â  . Mr Crowley, the revised Stability and Growth Pact was agreed by the Ecofin Council almost a year ago, in June 2005, following a political agreement within the European Council in March last year.
Our initial experience of the revised Pact has been positive, encouraging, and the indications are that the Member States have a renewed commitment to that framework.
In all recent cases that have been dealt with, when the Commission and the Council have applied the rules of the excessive deficit procedure, in accordance with the letter and the sprit of the revised Pact, there has been full consensus and there have not been the political discrepancies and difficulties that arose last time.
With regard to the preventive aspect of the Pact, the assessment of the 2005 stability and convergence programmes, which have been carried out during the first months of 2006, have shown that the Member States have set their medium-term budgetary objectives in accordance with the agreed principles.
Some countries have even decided to set more ambitious objectives, which reflect a national strategy aimed at guaranteeing greater sustainability of public finances.
With regard to adjustment to the mid-term objective, the Member States that are not yet in a situation of medium-term balance are generally fulfilling the requirement to make a budgetary effort at least equivalent to 0.5% of their GDP, in structural terms.
To name certain cases, I would remind you that, since the new Pact was approved last year, the excessive deficit procedure has been applied to Italy, Portugal, Hungary, the United Kingdom and Germany, with unanimity in the Council and without the problems of political acceptance which arose during the previous stage.
In response to your question, therefore, the Commission is pleased with the way the new Pact is operating.
Â Â  . Thank you, Commissioner, for your response.
On the last point that you made with regard to the rules concerning excessive public deficits and the fact that proposals have been made to Italy, Portugal, Hungary and the United Kingdom, what about France and Germany?
Both of them have public deficits that are well beyond the limits agreed under the criteria.
In particular, what about the undermining of confidence in the Stability Pact which that creates on the wider market?
That is particularly apparent when we look at the current difficulties concerning the recognition of the euro and the eurozone economy within the United States and in the Far East, and at the constant questioning concerning the enforcement of the rules concerning the Stability and Growth Pact in those areas.
Â Â  . Mr Crowley, Mr President, the excessive deficit procedure is being applied to France and it is subject to the procedure laid down in Article 104(7) of the Treaty.
In accordance with its obligations to apply the Councilâs recommendations within the framework of the excessive deficit procedure, the French authorities were obliged to bring their public deficit to below 3% in 2005.
Last week, the French authorities notified the Commission that the public deficit at the end of 2005 was below 3%.
Over the next three weeks, by 24 April, Eurostat must analyse the figure notified by the French authorities, and will explain whether or not those figures, a deficit of 2.87%, are correct.
In the event that they are â I hope that they are, although I cannot anticipate Eurostat's decision â France would have complied with the recommendations in 2005.
The French Government also intends to bring its deficit to below 3% during 2006; the European Commission takes note of this and is pleased with the French Government's intentions, but we are going to publish our spring economic forecasts on 8Â May.
Until then I will not be able to predict what our economic forecast will be for this year, but, without anticipating the final assessments, I believe that the budgetary situation in France is improving with regard to our forecasts a year ago, amongst other things because the French Government, and in particular the Finance Minister, Thierry Breton â whom I thank, as I did publicly the other day in Brussels â are politically committed to complying with the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is a sign of the way the renewed consensus in relation to the new Stability and Growth Pact is working.
A year ago, before the revision of the Pact, we would have been unlikely to hear the French, the German, or the Italian Minister repeatedly expressing their political commitment to bring their public accounts into line with the recommendations to them from the Commission and the Council for the application of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Two years ago it would have been impossible; a year ago it was difficult.
Today it is a reality, a genuine political commitment.
But we still have difficult times ahead of us, because we must not be content with deficits of 2.8%.
Europe, the European Union and the largest economies of the eurozone must pursue fiscal consolidation until public accounts, in the medium term, are in a situation of balance in structural terms so that we can deal with the significant challenges facing us for the future, the first of which is the consequences of the ageing of the population.
With regard to the euro, confidence in the eurozoneâs economy is growing day by day, and certain indicators of confidence, such as the German IFO index, are showing fifteen-year highs.
Figures on the indicators produced by the Commission services for which I am responsible were published yesterday, and they show that levels of confidence are at their highest for five years.
We had not achieved such levels of confidence since the previous expansionary phase.
Our currency is remaining perfectly stable in the currency markets, in fact it is over-valued according to certain economic sectors.
The euro is used in the financial markets, in the debt markets and in the capital and money markets at world level to a degree that is disproportionate to the relative weight of the eurozoneâs economy within the world economy.
I therefore believe that we must be vigilant, but we must also be pleased with our achievements during the first seven years of economic and monetary union.
Â Â  Has the introduction of the longer-term presidency for the eurozone had any practical implications for your work as guardian of the Treaties and guardian of the Stability and Growth Pact?
What are the practical effects of the longer-term presidency of the eurozone?
Â Â  . When the Member States of the eurozone decided to appoint a stable President of the Eurogroup, I expressed my great satisfaction.
I was convinced that regular, continuous and permanent dialogue with the President of that body, which is not a Council body, but which in practice holds very important debates and responsibilities, was going to be an effective decision.
When I found out that the President was going to be Jean-Claude Juncker, my confidence was confirmed.
I can now say that relations with the President of the Eurogroup are excellent, our contacts have been continuous and the preparation of meetings has improved considerably.
I believe that the role it plays towards the outside, expressing the views and the criteria of the eurozone countries, is greatly appreciated.
I take an extremely positive view of the institution, of its institutionalisation, of its President and of the work of that institution and its President.
I believe that the eurozoneâs needs in terms of the coordination of economic policy are obvious.
Earlier I mentioned the problems faced by certain eurozone economies, in dealing with losses of competitiveness resulting from an evolution above their average unit labour costs for example.
Certain economies of the eurozone are facing problems with inflation of assets, there is a clear need to improve the dialogue between the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank.
All of these functions are being carried out by the Eurogroup, and this is largely due to President Junckerâs effective and intelligent direction of the Eurogroupâs work.
Â Â  I would like to ask the Commissioner what level of discussions he has had with Member States of the eurozone in relation to their performance and their potential performance.
In the case of Ireland, for example, asset inflation, the price index for houses, went up 1.5% in February.
We have had double-digit inflation in housing for some time and it looks like we will continue to have that.
If there is a hard landing in the construction industry; it has implications for revenue; it has implications for unemployment payments and therefore revenue; it has implications for consumer confidence.
Have you had discussions with the Irish Government on this issue, and to what extent has the Commission considered the implications for a eurozone member of the possibility of a hard landing?
Â Â  . Of course I discuss the evolution of the eurozone economy, and not just the eurozone, but the whole of the European Union.
In particular, however, since you have asked about the eurozone, I discuss the economy of the eurozone bilaterally with the various Ministers of the zone and with the President of the European Central Bank, and collectively once a month in the meetings of the Eurogroup.
In the majority of meetings of the Eurogroup, an item is dedicated to analysing the economic situation.
Sometimes the economic situation is analysed in a general sense, and sometimes a specific aspect of that economic evolution is looked at.
With regard to inflation, the body responsible for maintaining inflation, in accordance with the objectives set by the European Central Bank, is the European Central Bank itself.
It is an independent institution, which, pursuant to the Treaty, has a mandate from the other European institutions to preserve price stability, and which makes its decisions entirely independently, but also holds a dialogue with the other institutions.
The President of the European Central Bank participates in the meetings of the Eurogroup each month.
Furthermore, the President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs are invited to take part, with the right to speak but not to vote, in the meetings of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, and we accept those invitations.
On the issue of housing, in particular, in one of the items at the last meeting of the Eurogroup in Brussels in March, we discussed the situation of the housing markets, which is not the same in all of the countries of the eurozone.
Certain countries in the eurozone have the problem of property inflation, while other countries have the opposite situation, in some cases with total stability and, in others, a decrease over several years in the price of houses and other real estate property.
This internal divergence within the eurozone with regard to real estate prices creates problems, because, by definition, there can only be one monetary policy in the eurozone, while its impact varies from country to country.
We have discussed this issue.
The European Commission has undertaken to present new analyses and new considerations to the Eurogroup over the coming months.
If you are particularly interested in knowing our analysis of property prices in certain countries of the eurozone, I will send you the latest three monthly report on the economy of the eurozone which was published a few days ago by the Commission services under my responsibility.
Â Â  The questions that have not been taken due to lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes questions to the Commission.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0076/2006) by MrÂ Takkula on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007â2013 the programme âCitizens for Europeâ to promote active European citizenship (COM(2005)0116 â C6-0101/2005 â 2005/0041(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to start this presentation of my report by expressing my thanks to all those who have participated in this work.
This came before our Committee a year ago, the proposal was put to Parliament on 6 April 2005, and from the start of May our Committee began to deliberate on it.
Since then statements have been given by the Committee on Budgets, on which Neena Gill has done such good work, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on which Giusto Catania has also done good work.
There has also been a statement on this issue from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, drafted by Maria da AssunÃ§Ã£o Esteves.
I would like to thank them all for their excellent, well-informed statements.
I might say that this year we have been very busy, and I also want to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committeeâs determined female â and male â members, who have assisted me in this, and all the others who have been involved.
We are now at a point, then, where this is to be voted on tomorrow, and I was thinking of saying a few more words about this report.
It contains four Actions.
The first is âActive citizens for Europeâ, which includes town-twinning and which has now received a lot of positive publicity and feedback through the existing programme.
Citizensâ projects also come under Action 1.
Action 2 is âActive civil society for Europeâ. This is a means of acquiring structural support for EU think tanks and civil society organisations as well as support for civil society projects.
This is also a very important Action.
Action 3 is âTogether for Europeâ: high-visibility events, studies, dissemination and information.
Action 4 is âActive European remembrance throughout Europeâ.
The purpose of this programme was specifically to reach those Europeans who, for one reason or another, have not yet managed to take part in the European agenda.
As we know, currently there are people who have for some reason felt the issue of Europe to be alien to them, and Europe has even seen growing exclusion.
Through this programme we have tried to find those people and create a programme suited to them so that they too might experience what it is to act together, what European identity is, and how we can strengthen the common European identity.
Both the recent events in connection with the European Parliament elections and the results of referendums show that far too few people are interested in matters that affect all of us.
As we know, it is important to strengthen European identity and it is important to increase activity in which all nations of Europe are involved, thereby creating opportunities for everyone to participate.
In a word, this programme has worked on the assumption that what we needed was not an elitist programme, but a programme that would be appropriate for all Europeans.
Some might say that it is a bit of a patchwork quilt or that many issues of greatly varying importance have been put in the same programme, but it is tailor-made precisely in order to overlap successfully with some existing programmes and really give all Europeans the opportunity to get involved in Europe.
Now it appears that, although the Committee was almost unanimous (just two abstained and the rest voted for the programme), a few amendments are going to be tabled at tomorrowâs part-session.
They mainly relate to Action 4, active remembrance. They also concern organisations which are already mentioned in this programme.
Regarding these organisations, I would like to say the following: I hope that this part of the programme that deals with active remembrance will help us adhere to its original purpose of supporting memorial sites to the victims of Nazism and Stalinism, because the impact of these totalitarian regimes was a European-wide one and was not limited to a single country.
Regarding this, I want to thank Marianne Mikko in particular, as it was she who made a strong case for the Stalinist component and wanted it to be included.
In this connection I must say that I hope that we will keep to our views on this.
I also hope that the additional remarks which have been made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance with regard to these new organisations, , the Berlin-based and the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, can be adopted as part of this programme.
Unfortunately, time is so short and I have gone over mine, so I cannot speak here any longer, but I will say thank you for all the support.
I hope that the vote will go as we on the Committee would like it to.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is one year since we proposed this important programme to promote European citizenship.
Tomorrow you will vote on the report, which reflects a lot of work since that time, and it is an important step towards the adoption of the new generation of programmes.
I should like to thank all the listed committees, in particular the Committee on Culture and Education and its rapporteur Mr Takkula for his efforts, combining determination and modernisation.
The report reflects this balance and shows that the committee shares the concerns of the Commission about the necessity to promote the active participation of citizens in the construction of a common Europe.
The proposal is based on the conviction that the strengthening of active citizenship at European level is closely linked to the development of a sense of belonging to the European Union and of a European identity, which is complementary to other identities: national, regional and local.
Common values, history, and culture with all its diversity will therefore be the building blocks of the programme.
The parliamentary committee adopted several amendments that enrich our proposal with references to European values.
I note with pleasure that the report followed the Commission's proposal on the various actions of this programme, ensuring continuity of activities that proved to be successful and the introduction of innovative projects and methods for citizens' participation.
I appreciate that the report proposes the integration of a new, fourth action providing support for memorials to victims of Nazi and Stalinist regimes, as agreed by the European Parliament, Council and Commission in November.
I should like to come now to the question of designated beneficiaries.
The Commission has proposed a limited list of six designated bodies because of their uniqueness in the European arena.
Three of them celebrate the memory or continue the work of the founding fathers, while the other three are pan-European umbrella organisations.
All of them have been supported for many years by the European institutions.
All of them contribute to the objectives of this programme.
I appreciate the fact that the committee shared our philosophy and confirmed the choices.
It proposed adding one more organisation: the Maison de l'Europe.
All the previously mentioned characteristics apply to this organisation.
This pan-European network of local organisations is aimed at engaging citizens in the construction of Europe.
I am therefore pleased to say that the Commission could support this amendment, provided that it does not mean other organisations will be eligible for this designation.
Finally, I should like to give my thoughts on the issue of volunteering.
This was mentioned in the proposal as an example of the field of interest of this programme.
An amendment by the committee proposed deleting this reference.
We believe, however, that volunteering is a powerful tool for developing social cohesion and commitment towards society and that it therefore deserves special attention within the programme.
Those were, in brief, the main points to which I wanted to draw your attention.
You will have noticed that our views converge on many points.
Let me emphasise the importance of continuing our constructive cooperation, despite the current uncertainties about the financial questions connected to this programme.
In the interest of citizens, we should make every possible effort to reach an agreement as soon as possible in order to prepare for the implementation of this programme by January 2007.
Your vote will send an important signal to the European citizens, as another important step is taken towards a Europe for citizens.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first let me thank the rapporteur for his report.
This is a key programme, be it citizens for Europe, or Europe of citizens.
The last time we asked this question in 1992, half the EU citizens surveyed said that they never felt European.
I think that figure has probably decreased over time, but not as dramatically as we would like.
But whether we feel it or not, we are European citizens and we share the rights and privileges citizenship brings.
This programme should make people aware and proud of their EU citizenship.
However, it is important to remember that we already have invested in similar programmes aimed at engaging with citizens.
The problem has been that the Commission's strategy in this area has been piecemeal and confused.
Therefore, what I would like to ask the Commission is: can it guarantee that this is not going to be just one more programme?
Will it really make a difference?
Will it be linking with other actions in a coherent, overarching strategy?
I really hope so, but I would like the Commission to explain how.
Speaking, as I am, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I am concerned that the ambitions are not backed by resources.
Therefore, once again we are raising expectations only to dash them.
I can understand all the Members wanting to address their preferred issues within the scope of this programme, but the funding for it, I believe, is far from adequate and we need to look very closely at some of the amendments that have been put forward.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for paying special attention to organised civil society at local level, including the disabled.
However, I regret that we have not pushed enough for the Commission to do more to reach the most disadvantaged communities.
Finally, I wish this programme every success and hope that the monitoring and evaluation issues that the Committee on Budgets has put forward are taken up.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of citizenship is central to the revival of the European Unionâs political project.
There are no shortcuts to revitalising Europeâs role on a global scale.
What it needs is for a real constituent process to be created, avoiding attempts to revive a constitutional treaty that has been killed off and erased by the will of the people.
We need to build an intercultural society emphasising Europeâs mixed-blood identity and, above all, we must encourage the integration of immigrants and the extension of citizenship rights.
That is why we also think that the European citizenship concept must be tied closely to residence, with the explicit aim of encouraging inclusion.
In that respect, we believe that the âCitizens for Europeâ programme can be a useful and valid means of promoting European citizenship rights, which should be increasingly dissociated from national criteria.
The programmeâs actions are worthy of support, and I refer in particular to town twinning projects and active European remembrance.
I believe we need to be clear on the latter point, however.
The 20th century was one of wars and authoritarian regimes, and there were countless victims of the deportations and mass killings carried out by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes.
Twentieth-century European history cannot be commemorated, however, without remembering the victims of its Fascist regimes: in Italy, Fascists deprived men and women of their freedom for two decades, and there are many connections between the Italian regime and the Nazis.
Spain, Portugal and Greece only recently won back democracy and freedom.
Antifascism is a European value and cannot be reduced to a national event, and we therefore believe that it is now worth remembering the victims of Fascism to prevent similar events from happening again.
There are still neo-fascist groups in Europe today, who feed on xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.
Excluding the victims of such authoritarian regimes from the programme would be both tragic and a threat to the promotion of citizenship and a common European identity.
We therefore hope that Amendments 62 and 63 will be adopted.
Â Â  . â European identity is defined as the point where universal values of human dignity meet with a series of separate traditions.
This identity, which after all is simply one more way of life, is boosted by the Citizens for Europe programme under discussion today.
The programme promotes an ethical awareness of the world, which is the deepest expression of European citizenship.
The programme paves the way for a political model for cooperation between the general public and the EU institutions.
This will help turn the citizens into participants in the European political process.
This is why the programme is of key importance.
Europe now has the task of becoming political and of moving from being a market to being a public area of debate.
This drive towards European citizenship, however, poses a major challenge for the institutions.
The citizenship policy means that the EU institutions must also become more political.
The issue of European citizenship very much revolves around the way in which the institutions promote peopleâs interest in European policy.
There is an obvious need for institutional reform in Europe and for new rules that can attract and empower the European public.
There is also a clear need for a political focal point around which there could be a European political sphere.
Yet for this to happen, Europe needs to be more political in all of its structures, in terms of the citizens, the parties and relations between the institutions.
Perhaps the European public debate is waiting to be kicked into life.
Perhaps the European public debate is waiting for a defining moment and for a Constitution.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU is indeed going through a rough patch at the present time.
Following the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, European citizens have become increasingly sceptical towards the EUâs institutions and rapid EU enlargement.
The programme âCitizens for Europeâ is intended to promote active European citizenship and to reduce dissatisfaction and alienation.
My group actively supports the programmeâs main objectives: promoting European values and achievements and preserving cultural diversity, in order to foster cohesion among Europeans.
This programme is one of the tools that could help the EU to achieve these objectives, by means of town-twinning activities, citizensâ projects, building up European networks in the civil-society sector, and adult-education centres.
Furthermore, as we have heard, the importance of âactive European remembranceâ should not be underestimated in this regard, namely the preservation of memorial sites relating to Nazi and Stalinist deportation and mass extermination.
Memorial sites for the victims of the crimes perpetrated by these totalitarian regimes, whose impact was felt throughout Europe, have been included in the programme and are to receive funding; both of which have the support of my group.
The proposed total budget is to be EURÂ 235Â million within the framework of the Financial Perspective for 2007â2013.
In view of the ambitious objectives of âCitizens for Europeâ, this funding does not, of course, reflect the programmeâs real importance as a tool for making citizens aware of their European identity and common values on the one hand, and the strengthening of and support for European integration on the other.
Â Â  . Mr President, Europe should first and foremost be there for its citizens, and not only the citizens for Europe.
That is why I am pleased to see that Mr Takkulaâs report has turned the Citizens for Europe programme into the Europe for the citizens programme.
I am less impressed with the way in which the Council of the European Union is full of the importance of involving the citizen in the European Union, but subsequently fobs us off with an excuse when it comes to funding the Europe for the citizens programme.
The Councilâs parsimony does it no credit.
What is worse, it has made the discussion on the Takkula report particularly difficult, because when we talk about involving citizens in the European Union, we actually mean all citizens.
This also, for example, includes those European citizens who have become the victim of dictatorial regimes or internal strife in Europe, or new citizens, immigrants and citizens from third countries who have lived in Europe for a long time, as well as citizens of all ages.
Were sufficient funds available â which they are not â we would have certainly been able to fund a wide range of projects that would have touched all those groups.
As it happens, we can only fund a very limited number of programmes.
To avoid disappointment on the part of people who are full of excitement when they come to submit their applications, only for the Commission to turn them down, Mr Takkula was brave enough to disappoint people at this stage, so as to make it absolutely clear from the outset who qualifies for funding and who does not.
That is understandable and in general, I support this way of working.
When it comes to remembering victims of European dictatorships, however, this approach is painful and lamentable.
Are the victims of one dictatorship more important than another?
Of course they are not.
We should try to avoid creating that impression, even at the risk of the Commission having to disappoint people at a later stage.
That is why I hope that everyone will back the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, in which we make an appeal to remember the victims of all European dictatorships.
The European citizen should not be at the receiving end of the Councilâs economy drives.
It is still not too late.
The final decision on the financial perspectives will be taken before the report returns to this House for second reading.
I would make an urgent appeal to the parties involved to make more funds available for culture, in general, and the Europe for the citizens programme, in particular.
Without citizens, the European Union is nothing, as indeed the Council, Commission and Parliament have proved time and again.
We therefore need money on the table, because the programme offers many opportunities, including town twinning opportunities, support for think tanks and NGOs, as well as the promotion of contacts between European citizens, for example in sports clubs.
They are all fine ideas, but fine ideas with no money to back them up are nothing but empty promises.
If Europe wants to be there for its citizens, it should not leave them in the lurch now.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I am particularly obliged to the rapporteur, MrÂ Takkula, for his commitment, which goes to the very heart of the EU.
This Europe should be a matter close to the heart of its citizens; that is the basic idea behind the present programme.
Promotion of active European citizenship should be increased.
It is a matter of improving the integration of citizens, as most of them reject Europe, and know far too little about European ideals, values and objectives.
The EU is alien to the majority of citizens, who do not consider it their homeland.
European integration policy is failing.
For many, Europe is too top heavy, too complicated, too unfathomable, too cold.
That is why the rapporteurâs approach of arousing interest in Europe in areas that citizens are passionate about, for example sports clubs, cultural initiatives and leisure activities, is a very viable one.
I should like to make a plea here today for the promotion of more Eurovision events through the medium of television.
One Eurovision Song Contest a year is not sufficient to give citizens a lasting understanding of the diversity of this continent.
Why is there not a European Cinema Contest, for example, or Eurovision dance contests, or âEuropean Idolâ, or European Saturday-night shows in which the individual Member States compete against each other for fun?
This is the only way to successfully generate interest â maybe even enthusiasm â on the part of even apolitical European citizens in their â our â Europe.
At the present time, there is frequent contact with representatives of European television companies with regard to the new âTelevision Without Frontiersâ Directive.
Let us also call for and promote more commitment to Europe in the national entertainment programmes on television.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner FigeÄŸ, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, welcome this programme warmly â being, as it is, an attempt to respond to the crisis of confidence in Europe perceived by many citizens.
It is important to be able to hold broad debates at the coalface on Europeâs understanding of itself in political and cultural terms, on its social responsibility and its future, and also on the role it wants to play in the world.
After all, having the opportunity to speak to large numbers of citizens at the coalface â young people, the elderly, people in cultural organisations and political associations â about all Europeâs political issues is the only way to reach the people and their hearts more successfully than we have done in recent months.
That is why the issue of Europeâs future is so central to this programme â but equally so is that of Europeâs past.
Indeed, it is unfortunately the case that Europe is the continent whose totalitarianism, whose National Socialism and whose Stalinism has brought great suffering, murder and crime upon not only Europe but also other parts of the world.
Therefore, I think it right that this programme recall that very totalitarian past, that we reappraise that past, and that we be sensitive and do everything possible to ensure that such things cannot happen again.
I should like to state explicitly, therefore, that I do not see this as a matter of competing with other dictatorial regimes that have existed in Europe.
It is of course right to reappraise these at national level â and we are all attending to this â but it is equally right that this European programme make reference to Europeâs totalitarianism.
Therefore, I, too, am in favour of the rapporteurâs motion.
Â Â  . â Let us begin with the name of the programme: âCitizens for Europeâ or âEurope for citizensâ?
The difference is not the result of an oversight by the Commission.
It is the result of the prevailing culture in the European institutions.
There will not be new citizens for Europe while the Europe of the institutions continues, with its policies, to exacerbate the social fissures and the identity problems.
No programme for citizenship can resolve this divorce.
Yet if the programme, right from the very name, is indicative of this primary urge, then that cannot be a good thing.
I therefore welcome the change of name, although I should like to see the consistency that is currently lacking.
I should therefore like to highlight three aspects: Given the scarcity of resources there are two options open.
Either the money is concentrated on few, highly conspicuous actions or it is distributed among projects promoting European citizenship.
The rapporteur has opted for compromise, while seeking to raise the stock of the second of those options.
I would have gone much further.
I have nothing against major events, but I am totally opposed to lying.
The greatest virtue of this programme is that it can be carried out by the associative networks, which, on the ground, foster citizenship.
Any deviation from this option would distort the very idea of citizenship.
Consequently, the idea of earmarking a substantial sum of money for support for six, now eight, institutions, without any kind of contest, is similarly unsustainable.
The normal procedure in any civilised society is to select projects by means of transparent contests.
At the other end of the scale is the law of lobbies, arrangements and favours.
In this particular case, eleventh-hour agreements were reached in order to accommodate two more organisations.
I am not judging their actual merits, but I am criticising the complete lack of merit in this method of awarding grants.
The exact opposite would be a lesson in Europe citizenship, whereby contests are run and, hopefully, the contestants are rewarded impartially on their merits.
My final question relates to the problem of memory.
With the entry of the new countries from the East, it is perfectly understandable that the idea of associating the memory of the victims of Stalinism with the victims of the holocaust has emerged.
That is fair enough, but does not tell the whole story.
What is missing is something to honour the memory of the victims of fascism in southern Europe.
Our view of citizenship must be that of respect for the pain of the victims, their families and their descendents.
There cannot be any other criteria.
In Portugal there is a citizensâ movement campaigning against turning the police headquarters of the old regime into luxury flats, rather than a museum.
Each person brings his or her memories to Europe.
With those memories, all of those memories, memory itself can be a component in citizenship.
Fascism was an example of totalitarianism.
It was also European.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise that we should not just talk about the important values common to the people of the European Union, but that we should also actively put into practice the content of MrÂ Takkulaâs report.
This is all the more true since concerns are growing that in the globalised world understanding of Europe and its identity is vanishing.
In fact, we must develop a multi-faceted, honest and democratic Europe that is open towards the rest of the world.
We particularly need to pay attention to historical and cultural aspects.
We need to promote measures to remember the mass deportations and the victims of both Nazism and Stalinism â I repeat, and Stalinism.
We should preserve the evidence of these crimes.
Such tasks bear witness to progress in the European Parliamentâs thinking, as displayed by Members.
Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the formulations prepared by the Council.
Incredibly, these have retained the connivance characteristic of the cold war years with the half-truths of European history imposed by the totalitarian Communist regime.
The Council must be reminded that Stalinism too was totalitarian and was no less destructive a regime for those who died among Europeâs peoples.
The Takkula report is good.
It represents the now regular affirmation that historical truth does not distinguish between Nazi crimes and Communist crimes.
Crimes are and remain crimes.
It surprises me that in this citadel of democracy, justice and truth motions can still be encountered that attempt to weigh in the scales of importance the memories of those who died in the Holocaust or in the gulags.
I thank the rapporteur and those Members with modern ways of thinking for speaking about a Europe that is honest and based on common values and accurate history.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to conduct a little experiment.
I ask people in the Chamber to remove their headphones for three seconds.
One, two, three.
What did you hear?
Absolutely nothing!
That is the sound of silence that heralds the clamour for this piece of legislation.
Are there demands to do something?
No!
Will it address the fundamental concerns of 450Â million people struggling to earn a living or find solutions to everyday problems?
No, again.
It is well known that something that you give but which cannot be disposed of has little value to the receivers since they have made no effort to get it.
How cheap then is European citizenship, which is forced on people, is unwanted and cannot be refused or renounced.
So here we go again!
Another huge propaganda project to distort and hide the truth.
The hope and belief seems to be that this will cure the scepticism that is growing across the continent.
Low Euro-election turnouts, vocal opposition to enlargement and the rejected Constitution are all, apparently, to be remedied by throwing EURÂ 235Â million at projects to persuade the people that the EU is actually doing something good for them.
This is pay-as-you-go citizenship.
The price rises as your rights go.
The EU will not listen to the people it is meant to represent.
Instead it attempts to bribe its way to a position of favour.
Yet European integration is exactly what the people are increasingly opposed to.
Why?
Because each and every country is slowly waking up to the reality that one size does not suit all in the eurozone, and neither now will one citizenship.
I have said before that, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a stupid question.
That millions of citizens in countries across the world agree with me is really quite comforting.
Â Â  Mr President, citizenship and statehood go together; hence the desire of the promoters of the European project to produce European citizenship.
True citizenship, however, does not need money thrown at it to make it real or desirable.
Loyalty to it is born of the heart, not of the pocket.
Surely we could find better uses for the EURÂ 230 million or even EURÂ 290 million, as some want, than promoting this contrived notion of European citizenship.
At the end of all this wasted expenditure, the French will still want to be French and the British will still want to be British, and no one but the political Euro-elite will prize citizenship of Europe above that of their own country.
Why then do we have to try so hard to defy the natural order and create a synthetic substitute, when in our Member States we can all enjoy the real thing?
GM citizenship may be for some; it is not for me.
Â Â  Mr President, an essential element of effective and engaged citizenship is an understanding of a societyâs shared and common heritage.
A heritage denied, ignored or distorted leaves a society divorced from reality, its true nature and character still oppressed, still deprived of its birthright.
Accordingly, the rapporteurâs Amendment 29 is of enormous importance to those hundreds of thousands of Central and Eastern Europeans whose families or family members were executed, were deported or died in Stalinâs gulags, for no reason other than that their survival was judged to be a threat to the illegal occupation of their countries, agreed by Hitler and Stalin under the notorious Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
In this connection, there has been discussion of other amendments in the name of MrÂ Sifunakis: Amendments 62 and 63, which refer to conflicts in Spain, Portugal and Greece.
It seems to me that these are important issues, but they should be considered in another context.
I hope that the whole of Parliament will support Amendment 29, so that we do not dilute the message that Hitler and Stalin were joint criminals who vented their anger on the peoples of Europe.
The NKVD, the Soviet Unionâs Peopleâs Commissariat of Internal Affairs, under Order No 001223, entitled âOn the operative accounting of anti-Soviet and socially alien elementsâ, issued on 11 October 1939, was the prelude to the mass deportations ordered by Merkulov, the USSRâs Peopleâs Commissar for State Security, and put into effect by his deputy, Serov.
On the night of 13 and 14 June 1941, 34Â 260 people were deported from Lithuania, 15Â 081 from Latvia and 10Â 205 from Estonia.
This was just the most notorious of the many deportations which continued until 1951.
It is significant that the EU will now support the commemoration of the victims of both those dictatorships.
Without truth, there can be no reconciliation.
The Russian people today are no more responsible for Stalinâs crimes than are the German people for Hitlerâs.
But European citizenship and good neighbourliness can only be based on respectfulÂ ...
Â Â  Allow me to make another correction: the translation spoke of the Malta Agreement.
Malta is a beautiful island.
It was the Yalta Agreement that was meant: just a small difference.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the low turnout of European citizens at European elections and the rejection by two countries of the Constitutional Treaty are perhaps the tip of the iceberg of what is sometimes a difficult relationship between European citizens and the European Union.
That is why we need a programme which will be able to motivate European citizens on the weak points; in other words make them participate more actively in common ventures, with the objective of mutual understanding between citizens and between the different cultural and historic permutations of the European identity itself.
As regards the 'Citizens for Europe' programme, in the report on his proposal on which he worked with a great deal of zeal, our honourable friend Mr Takkula has renamed it from its original title of 'Citizens for Europe' to 'Europe for Citizens', thereby filling a gap in the programme, which will join existing Community programmes such as the 'Lifelong Learning' and 'Youth in Action' programmes which mainly target young people.
However, European history also integrates two difficult periods during the 20th century which also form part of our common memory and history.
The memory of the victims exterminated and displaced and imprisoned by autocratic regimes must remain alive.
We cannot and must not forget the tragic moments which our continent experienced 60 years ago in the concentration and extermination camps at the hands of Nazism, nor of course can we or must we forget the crimes committed by Stalinism.
However, we cannot keep selective memories alive.
We cannot honour the memory of the victims of Nazism and Stalinism and, at the same time, forget the fascism and dictatorships of southern Europe.
This year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community, two countries in which fascism, over a period of 40 years, left tragic remains behind it.
We also celebrate the 25th anniversary this year of the accession of Greece to the European Community.
From 1946 to 1974, concentration camps operated in Greece in which thousands of citizens were exterminated for their political ideas.
The islands of Yiaros, which the Romans also used as a place of exile, and Makronisi became a tomb for a great number of people who lost their lives there as a result of the hardship and torture which they suffered together with thousands of other citizens exiled to these islands at that time.
The common factor which links the states of southern Europe is that the stabilisation of democracy in these countries was achieved to a great extent thanks to their accession to the European Community.
The 'Citizens for Europe' programme which we are debating today will therefore acquire material and overall value.
That is why the amendments referred to earlier by my honourable friend Mr Catania and others must also be adopted, because they supplement the most extensive and very important report by our honourable friend Mr Takkula.
Â Â  I welcome and endorse the European Commission's new initiative âActive European Citizenshipâ.
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on a well prepared report.
The promotion of European citizenship is an essential condition for the European Union, which has been successfully enlarged, to function.
The European Union needs a programme, especially after the 2004 enlargement, which devotes particular attention to its citizens.
At the moment, the deficit of active democracy is one of the most acute present-day problems faced by the European Union, and therefore, we welcome efforts to form a European identity, to foster citizenship and promote active participation in the area of European integration.
In Lithuania, public opinion polls indicate great mistrust in important state institutions by residents, and there is a sense that voter participation is decreasing.
These indicators are also similar in the European Union.
An average European has also little faith in, whether it be political parties, his country's government or parliament.
By introducing the active citizenship initiative, the integration of European values will be noticeable in individual national societies, and the European identity, which is actively formed, will also have a positive influence on common European Union decisions.
