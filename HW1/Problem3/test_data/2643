We believe we are doing what we can.
We are also obliged to ask Georgia to make an effort.
Mr President-in-Office, I am absolutely in agreement with your assessment of the tragic nature of the situation in Georgia.
I also concur entirely with what you said and with what Mr Rasmussen told us this morning about the importance of the enlargement process as a means of consigning the division of Europe to history once and for all.
We are also aware of the major role that the prospect of accession has played for all the countries of Central Europe in resolving the enormous problems that have faced them and continue to face them.
What we are proposing is no different to what we have offered and given to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, namely the prospect of accession.
A prospect of accession does not mean accession tomorrow, but it is the guarantee of a framework within which Georgia will be able to resolve its problems.
We know today that Georgia has no such framework; we know of the pressure exerted by Russia, and we are familiar with the role of Russia in the internal conflicts of which you spoke.
This, then, is my question: would your Government, as the incumbent of the presidency of the Union, agree to propose to the Council that it consider the possibility of entering the name of Georgia in the list of applicant countries?
Mr President, I have to say to my good friend and former colleague, Mr Dupuis, that it is, unfortunately, unrealistic to put Georgia on the list of possible candidate countries.
I believe that we in the European Union must consider alternatives to membership for our near and distant neighbours in the east and south.
For certain European countries, the obvious solution is membership; for others, that is completely unrealistic.
We must be realistic about the hopes we awaken in the leaders of those countries with which we cooperate.
I do not believe it would be wise, in any case at the present moment, to awaken any hopes at all of membership in either Mr Shevardnadze or other leaders in Georgia.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Haarder and this House on his new role.
My question also relates to Georgia.
You rightly pointed out that Georgia's security depends on the security situation in the Caucasus, and I would like to ask you what measures are being adopted by the Council to improve the security situation in the Caucasus through the resolution of the Chechnya problem and thus achieve stability in Georgia as well.
After all, while Chechnya is destabilised and war and a lack of liberty prevail, there can be no stability in Georgia either.
They are neighbouring countries, Mr Posselt.
I am not sure whether this is really a supplementary question relevant to the issue of Georgia, but the President-in-Office is entitled to respond.
Mr President, I can just briefly say in reply to Mr Posselt that there is of course an ongoing dialogue with the Russian Government concerning the Chechen problem.
We must not underestimate this problem. Nor are we doing so.
Discussion of the problem is a regular feature of the dialogue with Russia, and I would by no means dispute that there may be a connection between the Chechen problem and the problems in Georgia.
So I agree with Mr Posselt in a way.
I would just say that there is an ongoing dialogue concerning the matter.
It has not been forgotten, as will also be apparent from subsequent questions if we get around to them.
I would also like to welcome Mr Haarder in his new role.
I was spurred into action by Mr Haarder saying that he did not wish to awaken hope in some countries like Georgia, to which Mr Dupuis referred.
I know from my experience of Romania - which is 11th or 12th in the list of countries waiting to join the EU - that the one thing that holds that country together is the light at the end of the tunnel, the hope that it will be able to join the European Union, its rich neighbours, in a prosperous club.
If you are saying to other countries - whether Georgia or some of the former Yugoslav Republics - that we will not awaken hope for them, is there not the danger that they will be pushed into unrest, internal strife, possibly violence, and the pressures for migration to the West will be increased?
President-in-Office, would you clarify the position?
Mr President, I understand that reasoning perfectly well, but the issue is that of whether this would be good advice to give Georgia and whether it would be a good solution to the current problems to switch on that light at the end of the tunnel.
As it is in this case, the tunnel can, of course, be so long that the hope is too faint and might be said to be in danger of actually distracting Georgia's attention from the eminently here and now demands upon it that it is not complying with, including certain agreements we have with Georgia.
I do not believe that encouraging Georgia to work towards membership would be good advice.
The Council must be much more up-front and say: fulfil the existing agreements and solve the immediate problems.
As I am well aware, Georgia is, however, a part of Europe, and there is of course a theoretical possibility, which probably cannot be excluded, that Georgia might at some time or another be able to become a member of the EU.
That is not, however, something that should play any role at all in the present depressing situation.
Question No 5 by Liam Hyland (H-0379/02):
Subject: WTO and imports from world's poorest countries
The EU recently decided to accord imports from the 48 poorest countries, including farm products, unlimited duty-free access to EU markets. This is a world first.
It was also hoped that other developed countries would follow the EU example.
Will the Council now make a statement on the current situation regarding this decision and whether other developed countries are following the EU's lead?
Mr President, the EU hosted the UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries in May 2001 in Brussels.
At this conference, a declaration was adopted, together with an action programme, confirming the intention of improving the least developed countries' preferential access to markets, while making progress towards the goal of giving all products from the least developed countries duty-free and quota-free access to the developed countries' markets.
On 26 February of last year, the General Affairs Council adopted its 'Everything But Arms' initiative and, during the preparations for the ministerial meeting of the WTO in Doha in November of last year, the EU called upon other developed countries to implement corresponding initiatives and so comply with the multinational undertaking - which is part of the WTO's action plan, adopted in Singapore in 1996 - to give products from the less developed countries duty-free access.
The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has also entreated them to do this.
Right now, none of the measures implemented by the large countries are in any way comparable with the 'Everything But Arms' initiative.
New Zealand's initiative is the one that comes closest to the EU's example.
Canada, Japan and the United States have also made progress, but they are still behind in relation to the initiative taken by the EU.
An investigation recently undertaken by UNCTAD looks at the effects of the proposal.
It concludes that the proposal will be to the advantage of all the least developed countries.
The advantages would, however, be much greater if the other countries in the quartet of participants in the meeting - Canada, Japan and the United States - were to follow the EU's example because, at the moment, duty is imposed on half of these countries' exports in Canada, Japan and the United States.
The recent G8 summit in Alberta, Canada, provided a new opportunity to discuss these issues.
The summit focused particularly upon Africa, where the majority of these poor countries are situated.
The matter is therefore evolving, and we in the European Union can be proud of the fact that we have taken the strongest global initiative in this field.
Mr President, I would like to join in welcoming the President-in-Office and indeed to thank him for a very detailed and comprehensive reply.
The decision to allow the poorest countries access to EU markets is a practical expression of our desire to assist with their economic development in the long term.
It is the only credible and sustainable way forward.
But does the Council have any information on the extent to which some of those countries have been able to avail of this facility as far as the EU is concerned?
Perhaps the President-in-Office might also be able to comment on what difficulties these countries are experiencing in meeting the requirements to export to the European Union?
Mr President, the questioner is right in saying that it is important to provide this aid.
It is the Commission that must answer the more detailed part of the question, however.
I would therefore urge that the question be put to the Commission.
Question No 7 by Dirk Sterckx (H-0384/02):
Subject: Inadequacy of the 'strawberry regulation' in the event of serious obstruction of the free movement of goods
Since November 2001, the movement of goods by rail between France and the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel has been seriously obstructed.
The Commission has taken all the measures it can under the 'strawberry regulation'
Mr President, I am able to report that it is still the strawberry season in the northern Member States.
In the conclusions of 27 September 2001, to which Mr Sterckx referred, the Council took note of the Commission's report on the application of the regulation on the free movement of goods - what is termed the strawberry regulation.
The Commission's report contained, inter alia, a number of proposals for possible changes to the regulation with a view to enlarging its scope and expediting the procedures.
The report was not, however, a formal proposal from the Commission on which the Council was to adopt a position.
The Council and Parliament were merely called upon to take note of the report.
Nonetheless, the Council chose to respond to the Commission's report by adopting formal conclusions at the 'internal market' meeting on the day in question.
The Council decided that the Member States and the Commission should closely cooperate in using the regulation in a more dynamic way so that account is taken of the need to protect basic civic rights, including the right or freedom to strike.
Even though there was still limited experience of applying the regulation, the Council welcomed some of the Commission's initiatives designed to facilitate its practical application, for example a handbook on the procedures to be followed if obstacles are placed in the way of the free movement of goods.
The Council is still fully committed to protecting the free movement of goods between the Member States.
That is a central feature of the internal market.
The Council resolution of 7 December 1998, which was adopted at the same time as the regulation, and the conclusions of 27 September 2001 are expressions of this.
With regard to Mr Sterckx's question concerning the arrangements made by the Member States for implementing the Council conclusions of 27 September, it has to be said that it is not the Council's task to monitor what arrangements are made by the Member States in this area.
Nor does the Council receive information from the Member States about such arrangements, so I regret to say that I cannot, unfortunately, answer that part of the question.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is, of course, a real pleasure for me to be able to address you in this capacity.
This is really about a barrier to the free movement of goods in the Channel Tunnel which, since November of last year, has been working at 40% of its capacity.
This is therefore very unfortunate for a number of companies, and is a huge problem for the railways in general, which is, after all, an environmentally-friendly mode of transport.
I should therefore like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that, in the Council meetings, the presidency exerts pressure on the Member States so that they make every effort in order to maintain the free movement of goods.
My question is: what do you, as President, intend to do about this?
At the moment, the strawberry regulation is too lightweight and should, in my view, be improved.
In response to a question, Mr Bolkestein replies that the Council rejects this way of proceeding.
Has Mr Bolkestein perhaps misread the situation?
My question is: what can you do about this in practice to ensure that free movement is also guaranteed in the Channel Tunnel? I ask this because the issue is always being shelved.
I just want to make sure that I am right in thinking that it is the Commission which has to ensure that such rules are observed.
Moreover, I do not wish in any way to trivialise the problem raised by Mr Sterckx.
One can well imagine what it might lead to in terms of financial losses, and the people affected would be at a loss to understand its being EU regulations that were to ensure their dismissal.
I do not, therefore, wish to trivialise the matter, and I should like to pursue it further in the Council, but it must be the Commission that undertakes the inspection.
Question No 8 by Marit Paulsen (H-0389/02):
Subject: Fishing for industrial purposes and the ban on processed animal protein
The impact on the environment and biological diversity of fishing for industrial purposes is widely known.
This form of fishing takes place mainly to supply protein-rich fishmeal for animal production and breeding high-quality fish.
The use of processed animal protein in feed is banned in the EU under Council Decision 2000/766/EC
Mr President, in 1992, a report was submitted on fishing for industrial purposes in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat - the sea around Denmark.
The Council has debated the effect of fishing for industrial purposes upon the environment on several occasions since then, but it has not at any time adopted a common position on this subject.
On 28 May of this year, the Commission submitted a communication on the reform of the common fisheries policy in which it proposed that fishing with a view to producing fishmeal should be targeted at fish for which there is no commercial consumer market and that this type of fishing should continue to be monitored carefully.
The Council has not yet debated this communication from the Commission.
Council Decision 2000/766/EC applies only to fishmeal feed for ruminants, and then only if the feed fulfils the conditions in the Commission decision.
That is what I can offer by way of a reply, and I recognise that it is not particularly satisfactory, but the Council has not yet debated the Commission communication.
I should like finally to emphasise that I well understand why this question has been asked.
I cannot, however, say any more at the present time.
To put the question again?
Very good.
We thank Mrs Paulsen for this decision.
Question No 9 by Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m (H-0396/02):
Subject: Measures against the Cuban Government and support for the democracy movement
Gisela Delgado SablÃ³n, the leader of the independent libraries movement in Cuba, has been awarded the Lars Leijonborg democracy prize.
The prize is awarded by my party to individuals in state dictatorships who have made valuable contributions to democracy and human rights.
Mrs Delgado SablÃ³n has been invited to Stockholm to receive the prize and I myself have invited her to take part in a seminar on the situation in Cuba to be held at the European Parliament.
We have, unfortunately, been informed that the Cuban Government refuses to grant Mrs Delgado SablÃ³n an exit visa to travel from Cuba.
This is only a further example of how the communist regime in Cuba systematically persecutes democrats. It would have been extremely valuable for the democracy movement if Mrs Delgado SablÃ³n had been able to visit Stockholm and Brussels to report on the situation in her country.
What measures does the Council intend to take against the Cuban Government to persuade it to cease the persecution of democrats and to support those who are working for democracy and human rights in Cuba?
Mr President, the Council is absolutely clear about the human rights and basic civil rights situation in Cuba, as well as the need to introduce a system based on civic and other rights.
Such a system is laid down in the Cuban constitution but has not been put into effect.
That is the main reason why Cuba is now the only country in Latin America with which the EU has not entered into a cooperation agreement.
Since 1996, the EU's links with Cuba have been defined by the EU's common position on Cuba.
As stated in the common position, the objective of the links with Cuba is to promote the transition to a pluralist democracy and respect for human and civic rights, as well as sustainable economic recovery and an improvement in the Cuban population's standard of living.
We believe that a results-oriented dialogue and humanitarian aid are the best means of achieving that objective.
The dialogue with Cuba, which was broken off by the Cuban authorities in April 2000, was officially resumed on 1 and 2 December of last year when the EU Troika, consisting of high-ranking officials, travelled to Havana.
The Troika met the Cuban delegation led by foreign minister Felipe Perez Roque.
Its experts also met experts from the Cuban delegation when the UN Commission on Human Rights held a meeting in April of this year.
At its meeting on 17 June of this year in Luxembourg, the General Affairs Council approved the eleventh review of the EU's common position on Cuba.
The Council again confirmed that the objectives are still valid.
The Council thought it was important to continue the dialogue with Cuba so that practical results might be achieved, and it also let it be known that it is awaiting clear signals from the Cuban Government that the latter is fulfilling the objectives laid down in the common position.
On 20 May of this year, when the Varela Project was presented to Cuba's National Assembly, the Presidency submitted a declaration on behalf of the European Union in which it welcomed the Varela initiative.
We believe that the Varela Project is an important initiative which, with the strong support of Cuban civil society, can pave the way for the changes which the country needs and which Cuban society is calling for.
The purpose of the initiative, which is warranted by the Cuban constitution, is to introduce a system of civic and other rights which are laid down in the constitution itself but which have not been put into effect.
In the declaration, the EU expresses the hope that the National Assembly will adopt the initiative being considered and that the Varela Project will be the jumping-off point for a debate that will be able to promote a peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy and a Cuban society at peace with itself.
The Council took note of this eleventh review of the EU's common position on Cuba at the meeting on 17 June in Luxembourg.
It was confirmed that the common position continues to form the basis of the EU's policy towards Cuba, and it was noted that this policy still applies.
The Council observed certain positive signs, such as greater religious freedom, fewer political prisoners, no use of the death penalty for the last two and a half years and the ratification of several UN instruments concerning human rights.
It observed that there have recently been signs of greater openness on the part of the Cuban authorities.
This was seen as a start, and the Cuban Government was expected to take positive steps that could lead to practical reforms in preparation for a political system based on democratic values.
In that connection, the Council is following with interest developments in the project referred to, which is warranted by the constitution. The Council is calling upon the Cuban Government to regard it as a legitimate initiative, since it represents a significant effort to introduce the reforms in question.
The conclusion, therefore, is that the Council should give maximum attention to Cuba, follow developments there and persist in making demands upon the country but, at the same time, note the modest forms of progress which have taken place in spite of everything and which the Council hopes may lead to more such progress in the near future.
Welcome, President-in-Office.
It is a pleasure to see you.
I thank you very much for your reply and I would like to point out that new events have taken place since I submitted my question.
Tomorrow, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is holding a seminar on the democratisation of Cuba.
We had invited four Cuban citizens to take part in the meeting, but they were refused exit visas by the Cuban authorities.
A quarter of an hour ago, I received a fax from the Cuban Ambassador, stating that the seminar was an affront to the people of Cuba.
As you know, the Cuban regime has also pushed through an amendment to the constitution which gives Socialism a permanent place in the constitution.
What is happening in Cuba is naturally an extreme provocation for the Communist regime.
I wonder whether the Danish Presidency is preparing to bring further pressure to bear now that so many different initiatives in favour of democratisation are to be seen.
The tentative improvements we saw appear not to be leading anywhere.
The EU has a vital role to play in this matter, and the Cuban opposition desperately needs us.
Mr President, I was very much aware of the fact that there was a question.
The question concerned what I think of the initiative of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and what I have to say about the fact that no visas can be obtained for travelling from Cuba in order to participate in the seminar mentioned.
My answer is that it sounds like an exciting and positive initiative.
What it has shown, unfortunately, is that there is still a long way to go before quite basic human rights are respected in Cuba.
That must not cause us to give up, and I am pleased to have received the information provided by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m in this House.
It is instructive, and we must of course take it into account.
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that this interest in democracy and human rights is, to say the least, hypocritical when it comes to a country which, despite the long-standing and inhumane embargo imposed on it and the inexorable war being waged against it by the USA, has achieved the highest standard of living and education in Central and Latin America?
Do you not also think that we should respect the desire of the overwhelming majority of the Cuban people to defend their Socialist homeland and that we should start by calling on the administration of the USA to halt its criminal embargo and terrorism against Cuba and the leaders of the Cuban people?
Seriously, what do you intend to do, Mr President-in-Office, to liberate the five Cuban freedom fighters in jail in the USA for condemning the terrorism being inflicted on Cuba and its leaders by the administration of the United States of America?
I should like to say to Mr Korakas that I hope that socialist advances do not need to be bound up with an absence of democracy and human rights and a lack of opportunities to travel to other countries and participate in discussions.
In my view, it would not be wise to have such a definition of socialist achievements.
Whatever may be thought of the American boycott - and I must not rake up the whole history of this - there is of course no doubt that there could have been free elections in Cuba and much greater progress made on human rights and that, if these things had in fact happened, those who want to see the boycott lifted would have had very strong arguments available to them.
Question No 10 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0399/02):
Subject: UN special session on children
In its resolution adopted on 11 April 2002 ahead of the UN's special session on children, Parliament states, inter alia, that it 'supports the view that the family is the fundamental unit of society and holds primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children' and that, therefore, a ''world fit for children (...) has to be at the same time a world fit for families'.
What steps did the Council take during the special session on children to have Parliament's views incorporated into the final document adopted at the session and what success was achieved in accentuating the family as the fundamental unit of society?
Mr President, I should like first of all to refer Mr SacrÃ©deus to the answer given by the Council to a similar question in October of last year concerning the UN Special Session on Children which was planned to have taken place in September 2001.
As you know, the session was postponed to 10-12 May 2002 because of the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001.
I would also point out that the final outcome of the special session is now available on UNICEF's home page.
I am pleased to be able to inform Parliament that the action plan adopted at the session does in fact contain a section on the family, proposed by the European Union.
The section reads as follows in English:
I would like to thank Mr Haarder for his reply and welcome our former colleague to the European Parliament as the Danish Minister for European Affairs.
I would like to express my thanks for the work which the European Union has put into highlighting the family as the fundamental social unit.
I would like to put a few follow-up questions to Mr Haarder:
Will this have any impact on the Council's own work with regard to the demographic challenge, the subject which, at the Stockholm European Council in March, Mr Persson set out as one of the EU's most important areas for the future?
Does the emphasis on the fact that the family may take various forms mean that the EU does not stress that children have a right to a mother and a father, to live in a spirit of community and so enjoy extra security?
Mr President, I should like to apologise for having put the emphasis on the wrong syllable of Mr SacrÃ©deus's name. It will not happen again.
In fact, I am used to people putting the wrong emphasis on my own name.
I think my choice of words was very well balanced.
I agree that the presence of both a father and a mother normally offers the best basis for bringing up a child, but it is not, of course, always the case that matters work out so well.
On the other hand, there are children who grow up without either a father or mother but who can nonetheless have a happy childhood and a good life, and I therefore think it important for us not to have too narrow a definition of the concept of the family.
The demographic challenge constituted by the falling population can be discussed at length.
I do not believe that the problem is as dramatic as some people make out, but it is not my task, here on behalf of the Council, to adopt a position on the ongoing discussion I think we should have concerning this issue.
We are also concerned here with the issue of immigration in our countries, and I think it would be too much of a digression to begin a discussion on that.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 11 and 12 will be taken together.
Question No 11 by Carlos Carnero GonzÃ¡lez (H-0402/02):
Subject: Democratic opposition leaders on trial in Equatorial Guinea
Today, 23 May, various leaders of the Democratic opposition in Equatorial Guinea, including PlÃ¡cido MicÃ³, the leader of one of the most important of the opposition parties, Convergencia para la Democracia Social (Social Democratic Alliance), will be sentenced on the basis of utterly groundless accusation, and without the minimum legal guarantees befitting a constitutional state.
This court case is glaring proof of the absolute lack of my will on the part of the regime to meet the commitments given to the international community, including the EU, to begin the transition to democracy.
What actions has the EU taken or will it take in connection with this court case, to protect the democratic opposition from the disgraceful attacks of the dictatorship of Teodoro Obiang. Question No 12 by Raimon Obiols i GermÃ  (H-0407/02):
Subject: Arrest of opposition leaders in Equatorial Guinea
The Secretary-General of the party Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS) in Equatorial Guinea, PlÃ¡cido MicÃ³ Abogo, has been under house arrest since he was arrested on 9 May 2002 on the grounds that an alleged 'meeting' at his house, at which plans for a coup against President Obiang are claimed to have been discussed, had included the participation of Emilio Ndong Biyogo and Felipe Ondo Obiang.
The CPDS was legalised in February 1993 in the wake of pressure from the international community: the regime had put up considerable resistance to the legalisation of this and other political organisations, and had denigrated the CPDS as being incompatible with the 'experiment in democracy' which was then being officially promoted by the government of Equatorial Guinea.
What information can the Council Presidency supply on the arrests in Equatorial Guinea of opposition politicians belonging to democratic parties such as the CPDS?
What is the Presidency's view on the democratisation process in Equatorial Guinea?
What action has the Council taken with a view to ensuring respect for the fundamental rights of the individual and for the political rights of the democratic political organisations in Equatorial Guinea?
Mr President, the Council has carefully monitored the arrest of opposition politicians in Equatorial Guinea, together with the dubious circumstances of their detention, the court case and the most recent judgments.
Even though the prosecution demanded the death penalty, the opposition leaders were, in the very end, sentenced to imprisonment of between six and twenty years for allegedly having plotted to overthrow President Obiang.
In spite of the president's assurances that human rights are respected, the EU has expressed its concern about procedural irregularities during the court case, as well as about the allegations of torture and maltreatment suffered by the accused.
There continue to be serious doubts about the legality of the detentions.
On Monday 10 June, straight after the judgments had been pronounced, the Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the EU in which it appealed to the relevant authorities in Equatorial Guinea to make the necessary arrangements to have the judgements quashed in order to ensure that the basic rights of the accused were respected.
In the EU's view, the evidence against the accused politicians is flimsy, in sharp contrast to the severity of the judgments.
Hence, our demand that the cases be re-examined.
The EU expressed serious doubts about the authorities' willingness to defend the principle of the Rule of Law and to fulfil its human rights obligations, recently entered into in connection with the 58th meeting of the UN's Commission on Human Rights.
The EU also referred to Equatorial Guinea's obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment - the convention recently signed by Equatorial Guinea.
The EU has therefore been prompt, consistent and firm and, as can be seen, it has a considerable lack of confidence in the court decisions in Equatorial Guinea to which I have referred.
With respect, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has offered a reply which may belong somewhere, but not on Earth or in the European Union, and much less in Equatorial Guinea.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your reply demonstrates that either you do not know or that you do not want to know that in Equatorial Guinea a trial has taken place with no democratic guarantees, with punishments based on non-existent accusations and, furthermore, in a situation in which, after being found guilty, the lives of the accused are in grave danger.
I do not know if you are aware, for example, that for a week they have not been provided with any kind of food and that 48 hours ago two of them have had to be taken to the Malabo hospital urgently with serious pains.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, do you intend to honour the response of the European Commission to the situation in Equatorial Guinea, delivered by the relevant Commissioner at the last plenary, and, furthermore, comply with this Parliament's resolution on this situation, by applying the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement?
Mr President, the Cotonou Agreement does of course contain paragraphs which make it possible for the European Union to initiate a dialogue, to criticise and to ask for explanations, and that is what the European Union has done.
Nor have I in any way excused Equatorial Guinea in my answer.
On the contrary, I have used some strong words.
I began by expressing the EU's lack of confidence in the courts and of the judgments that are given and, if Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez wishes me to, I should also be happy to express a lack of confidence, on behalf of the EU, in the way in which prisoners and people charged with offences are treated in Equatorial Guinea.
Mr President, I will speak briefly and avoid using any euphemisms.
We are talking about the life or death of people who are very close to us.
I am a personal friend of PlÃ¡cido MicÃ³, General Secretary of the CPDS (social democratic party and member of the Socialist International), who has been found guilty at this trial, which was a disgraceful farce which demonstrated not just a complete lack of compliance with any guarantee, but also the existence of very serious physical torture.
We would therefore like to ask the Presidency of the Council to take immediate action, since the information we have from Malabo, from the day before yesterday, is - as Carlos Carnero pointed out - extremely worrying.
It is not simply a question of condemning this situation in some euphemistic way, but of exercising all the European Union's powers to put an end to this terrible scandal for good.
Mr President, I have of course myself been a Member of the European Parliament and myself been involved in formulating decisions in cases where atrocities and acts of cruelty have taken place in countries around the world.
What can be done in many of these cases is what I have stated in this House on behalf of the Council.
Appeals can be made and investigations carried out, and the countries in question can be held to the obligations they have signed up to.
As a rule, it is of course difficult - and forgive me for saying this - to invade the countries in question and engage in policing.
I therefore think that, in this case, the Council is doing precisely what Parliament does on many occasions when it makes appeals, adopts decisions, holds countries to obligations they have entered into, refers to international conventions they have signed, and so on. That is what we have done and that is what can in fact be done in this type of case.
Moreover, I can assure you that, in the immediate future too, the situation will be very carefully monitored by the Council.
Question No 13 by Bill Newton Dunn (H-0405/02):
Subject: Cutting back on greenhouse gas emissions
In view of binding commitments made by the fifteen Member States under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their emissions of the six greenhouse gases, what plans does the Council itself have to reduce its own consumption of energy?
Does it recognise that it could make an enormous reduction simply by agreeing to a single working place for the European Parliament?
I should like to assure Mr Newton Dunn that the Council is strongly in favour of the Kyoto Protocol's being put into practice, and I would also assure him that the Council regards energy consumption in buildings as a very important concern.
I would call attention to a resolution on energy efficiency in the European Community, adopted in 1998, as well as to the conclusions adopted by the Council on, respectively, 30 May 2000 and 5 December 2000 in response to the Commission's action plan for energy efficiency, calling for special arrangements in the construction sector.
The Council has also recognised the importance of energy efficiency in the conclusions adopted on 10 October 2000 on common and coordinated policies and arrangements in the EU for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, designed to help achieve the objectives of the European Climate Change Programme.
As far as the specific arrangements proposed in the action plan are concerned, the Commission has since presented the Council with a proposal for a directive on the energy efficiency of buildings.
On the basis of Parliament's statement, the Council submitted its common position to Parliament in advance of last month's part-session.
With regard to the second question, it must be remembered that matters such as the EU institutions' seats are regulated by the Protocol, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, the ECSC Treaty and the Euratom Treaty, on the location of the seats of the institutions and of certain bodies and departments of the European Communities and of Europol.
This protocol may only be amended in accordance with the procedure described in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union.
The issue must therefore be raised in another forum, as I believe Mr Newton Dunn will fully agree.
I also would like to express my pleasure at seeing the President-in-Office of the Council here.
As a friend and colleague it is very nice to see him back and, if ever things go wrong in Copenhagen, I am sure we would be very delighted to see him back in one of these seats.
However, let us not talk about that bad possibility, until it happens.
Thank you for your answer to my question.
I understand that the question of the seat is really for another place, though it would save a lot of energy if we eliminated this building.
I am particularly interested since the EU institutions should be setting a lead.
I hope we are setting an example to the world by trying to save on energy conservation.
So I would suggest that if I table a question to the President-in-Office for the December part-session, perhaps he will give me an undertaking that he will tell me specifically what the Council has done with its own buildings as regards saving energy and setting an example to the world: energy-efficient light switches, for example, or any other measures that the Council is going to adopt within the next six months to set an example to the world.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Newton Dunn most sincerely for his welcome.
He has made his point very clear, and I shall be happy to communicate that point to the services of the Council.
Question No 14 by Bernd Posselt (H-0408/02):
Subject: Loya Jirga and Afghanistan's future
What is the Council Presidency's assessment of preparations for the Loya Jirga in Afghanistan, and what measures is it planning with a view to stabilising the country further?
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Posselt for his question.
Like UNAMA and other international observers, the Council is generally satisfied with the outcome of the extraordinary meeting held in Kabul in the middle of June.
In general, the Loya Jirga process has successfully fulfilled the objectives set in the Bonn Agreement, that is to say of choosing a Head of State and approving the structure of the transitional administration, together with its key personalities.
The most important political forces in the country have supported this Loya Jirga, and there has been unusually strong popular support throughout the process.
This Loya Jirga was apparently the most representative the country has ever had.
It had a good ethnic balance and there was a significant number of women among the delegates.
That is a noteworthy achievement in view of the difficult political and security environment and the tight timetable, a partially displaced population and the lack of reliable infrastructure and statistics.
The Council is, however, also clear about the difficulties and problems there have been in the period leading up to the Loya Jirga.
In a number of cases, the election of delegates was disrupted by organisational problems and also by attempts to harass, bribe, intimidate or kill candidates.
That being said, these episodes were rare and did not alter the structure and timetable of the process. Nor were they able to undermine its legitimacy.
The Council remains convinced that the extraordinary meeting has paved the way for further reconciliation between the various ethnic groups and for its now being possible to create a stable political structure, something which is essential for the further reconstruction of Afghanistan.
In this connection, the Council would once again emphasise that the reconstruction aid from the EU, pledged in Tokyo, is still conditional upon all the Afghan parties' making a positive contribution to the process and the objectives established in the Bonn Agreement.
With regard to further stabilisation of the country, the EU has confirmed many times since the beginning of the Bonn process that it is firmly resolved to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
In the future too, the Member States will supply most of the ISAF forces in Kabul.
The Community and the Member States will continue to supply the reconstruction aid pledged at the international donor conference held in Tokyo in January of this year.
The Community and the Member States have pledged to donate EUR 600 million in this year alone, and EUR 2.3 billion in the subsequent years up until 2006.
As one of the four leaders of the steering group for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, the EU will continue to play an active role in the country's reconstruction.
The EU will also go on providing the much needed humanitarian aid and will therefore continue to be by far the largest donor of aid to Afghanistan.
I might add that it was stated in the declaration in Seville that repatriation aid will be provided to Afghanistan, as requested by the UNHCR.
In recent months, a good many projects designed rapidly to take effect have been implemented on the spot, and ever more medium and long-term reconstruction and development projects are in the process of getting under way.
The EU will continue to be heavily involved in the necessary reform of the security sector, where a number of Member States will continue to play a leading role in the training of the army, border guards, police forces, anti-drugs squads and so on. High-level visits by quite a few EU delegations have deepened political contacts with the Afghan leaders, and these contacts will continue.
Last but not least, they will also form a sound basis for a continued dialogue on matters of substance with the Afghan authorities.
They will also increase the visibility of the EU and raise its profile in the country, as well as help channel future EU aid to Afghanistan.
That is why it is important for the EU to have a special representative in Kabul, for the Member States to open embassies there and for the Commission to open a representation.
Mr President, I would like to voice my thanks for this very precise answer, also on the issue of women.
I must say that we are often very unfair in this respect.
The Czech Republic's social democratic government - and it is after all an accession candidate - still does not have a single female member.
Hopefully, this situation will now change!
Yet we are demanding that an ancient tribal society should change overnight.
I think we should focus on two points, and would therefore like to ask you this. Firstly, it is important to foster inter-ethnic dialogue, for the Loya Jirga has opened up wounds among the Pashto community, not least as a result of the ineptitude of some American representatives.
Secondly, we must provide training for young people at local level.
I would like to ask you specifically about institution building, and whether the Council could launch an initiative here, such as its own funding programme for institution building.
Mr President, I am able to state that we are strengthening the EU's capacity in the field of institution building so that we can improve our support for this.
With regard to Mr Posselt's observation that the Loya Jirga has deeply offended the Pashtuns, I would go on to say that nothing is perfect and that I did not maintain that the Loya Jirga is the expression of a perfect democracy.
Nor have I heard the European media say that.
In view, however, of the mediaeval nature of what preceded this, it is rather impressive and, in any case, promising in terms of the future, that things have, in spite of everything, progressed as far as they have.
The fact that Czech social democracy is apparently not perfect, either, might be considered comforting in the circumstances.
I do not know whether the two situations have very much in common with each other, but I shall leave it entirely to Mr Posselt, who has a better understanding of the Czech Republic than I do, to decide about that.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 will be taken together.
Question No 15 by Luigi Vinci (H-0412/02):
Subject: The PKK and the 'anti-terrorist list'
Would the Council not agree that, by including the PKK in the 'anti-terrorist list' on 2 May 2002, it became a party to the Turkish policy of military and police repression against the whole of the Kurdish people?
What steps does the Council intend to take to get the peace process in Turkey back on the rails and, in particular, who will be involved in the discussions?
Question No 16 by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli (H-0414/02):
Subject: The European Union, the PKK and Turkey
Having included the PKK in the list of terrorist organisations provided for in Regulation (EC) 2580/2001
Mr President, I should like to thank the many MEPs who have asked these well-founded questions.
The Council would like to emphasise that reviews are regularly carried out of the list of groups and entities included in the annex to the Council's common position on the application of specific arrangements for combating terrorism.
The recent review led to the PKK's being added to the list.
This happened following a careful assessment on the basis of the provisions in Article 1 of the common position I have just mentioned.
The Council does not share the view that inclusion of the PKK on the list will lead to increased oppression of the Kurdish population of Turkey.
Attention should be paid to the recent recommendation by Turkey's National Security Council that the state of emergency which still applies in four predominantly Kurdish provinces in the south-eastern part of the country be lifted.
The Council is fully aware that there are still significant and regrettable restrictions upon basic freedoms, human rights and, especially, cultural rights, particularly in those areas in which the state of emergency is still in force.
These circumstances are naturally covered by the political Copenhagen criteria, and it goes without saying that accession negotiations cannot be initiated until these criteria have been fulfilled to the letter.
The EU uses all the political discussion meetings with Turkey to press for further progress in terms of democratic reforms.
It is made clear on these occasions that human rights and principles of the Rule of Law must be fully observed in the fight against terrorism and that the latter may in no way be used as an excuse for introducing or maintaining restrictions upon these rights.
President-in-Office Haarder, I do not think the Council wanted to consider the fact that the PKK has dissolved itself, that it has not committed any more armed actions and that many of its leading members have handed themselves over to the Turks.
It is absurd to have included the PKK on the list of terrorists, particularly in view of these recent events that I have mentioned, and this will encourage Turkey to be even more cruel towards the Kurds; it will prevent any further peace agreement and will exacerbate the situation.
I must emphasise the fact that the PKK was included on this list at the moment when it had unilaterally started to respect the human rights of the Turkish people far more than Turkey itself.
I therefore believe that the Council should reconsider its decision and remove the PKK from the terrorist list, particularly because its members are no longer terrorists.
I believe the honourable Member can rest assured that the matter has been carefully considered by experts.
This action has not been taken by accident. Consideration has been given to it.
It can, of course, always be hoped that there will be developments as a result of which it will be possible at some time or another to remove the PKK from the list.
Now, however, that the PKK is on the list, it is not without reason.
The matter has been carefully investigated. There is no question of a subjective decision's having been made.
It is objective criteria that have formed the basis for the decision.
Precisely because they are objective criteria, however, it might of course subsequently be possible to remove the PKK from the list on the basis of the same objective criteria.
Finally, I should like to contest or contradict the reasoning according to which Turkey will now engage in worse behaviour - or whatever one wishes to call it - towards the Kurds in Turkey.
There is nothing to suggest that it will.
In my answer, I gave an example of events in actual fact taking the opposite course.
I hope and believe, therefore, that my former fellow MEP is wrong about this matter.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Haarder for his reply.
Unfortunately, my questions about KADEK were not answered. This was what I asked: what is your assessment of the organisation and, in the future, will KADEK also be included in the list of terrorist organisations?
Mr Haarder has not said a word about this.
As regards the other point, I would like to point out once again that if we are going to discuss the list of terrorist organisations, we should look at the situation from the Kurdish perspective as well. More than four thousand Kurdish villages have been completely destroyed.
Who will take action here and protect the Kurdish people? Surely terrorists are at work here too?
Or let's take the case of Leyla Zana.
The European Parliament honoured Leyla Zana with its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. She was sentenced to imprisonment in Turkey for supporting the PKK.
According to the new list published in Turkey, Leyla Zana is a terrorist.
The question is this: what terrorist act did Leyla Zana, a Member of the Turkish Parliament, commit to warrant her being classed as a terrorist?
I can assure Mrs Uca that I am aware both of the many thousands of destroyed villages and also of the fate that has overtaken Leyla Zana. I myself was among those who presented her with the Sakharov Prize.
Specifically in order to enable everything to proceed on an objective basis, it is, however, important for matters to be investigated thoroughly.
KADEK, which is the PKK's successor, is under investigation, but I cannot at the moment say what the outcome of this investigation will be.
Anything I said would be subjective.
Matters must proceed properly.
We must follow the rules we ourselves have set, and we must listen to the experts whom we are asking to assess whether our criteria have, or have not, been fulfilled.
Mr President, the fight against terrorism has also led to excessive military strikes and an excess of justifiable defence, which can easily defeat their purpose.
For that reason it is extremely important for the European Union and its Council of Ministers to act consistently and remain realistic and cool-headed in the way they approach these problems.
That is especially true now that we have our attitude to the charter of the International Criminal Court as well as peacekeeping in Bosnia to consider.
This is entirely relevant to the question we are debating today.
Yes, I agree with what, if I understood them correctly, were the last remarks of my former fellow MEP and good friend, Mr Wuori.
I do not have very much to add other than that it is important for us to maintain an objective distinction between what are, and are not, terrorist organisations.
Matters must proceed on an objective basis.
Allow me, moreover, to say, finally, that I have the greatest respect for the work done by Mr Wuori for human rights here in Parliament, and I thank him for the book he gave me this afternoon.
I shall make a point of reading it.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have two questions for further clarification.
My first question is: which criteria exactly have led to the conclusion that the PKK is a terrorist organisation?
My second question is: in what way is this concept being interpreted as regards those who cooperate with such an organisation?
After all, this could go very far when we talk about a movement which is actually being recognised as a kind of national liberation movement by the Kurds themselves.
Finally, who do you consider as a contact to talk on behalf of the Kurds when the peace process is underway, bearing in mind that in Northern Ireland too, partners had to be selected who were initially thought inappropriate?
Mr President, I would point out that the criteria governing what are, and are not, terrorist organisations are to be found in the Council's common position of 2 May 2002 which states very precisely that it is experts who assess whether these criteria have been fulfilled.
I perfectly understand Mrs Maes's being able to cite Northern Ireland and other places where compromises have ended up being made with former terrorist organisations.
We must hope that this can also happen in the future, for it is often the way in which terrorist organisations can stop being terrorist organisations.
In the light, however, of what has happened and of the threat clearly facing our countries, the international community has reached a broad agreement about the need to take action against possible terrorist organisations.
Hence, these criteria and this list.
I find it hard to see what else could be done, and it does not of course exclude the possibility of former PKK members' being able to play a role in a future arrangement designed to secure the rights for which Kurdish organisations have fought and of which I have as great an appreciation, I believe, as Mrs Maes.
We were fully agreed about these matters during the period in which we sat almost side by side here in Parliament.
Mr Haarder, we are going to ask you the final question within the time available today, which we have extended until 7 p.m. because we started more than fifteen minutes late.
Question No 25 by Konstantinos Alyssandrakis (H-0420/02):
Subject: Attempt to criminalise political beliefs in Slovakia
A proposal has been tabled in Slovakia's parliament to amend the Criminal Code (Law 140/1961), to make provision for prison sentences for anyone expressing sympathy with communist ideas.
This attempt to criminalise political activity is being made with a view to the parliamentary elections in September 2002, at which it is forecast that the Communist Party of Slovakia could reach the 5% threshold required to obtain parliamentary representation.
The aim is to terrorise voters and to criminalise their political views, by providing the sanction of a prison term ranging from six months to three years for anyone expressing merely 'sympathy for communism' or 'doubt regarding its crimes', and thus to prevent citizens from expressing themselves democratically.
Does the Council condemn this unacceptable and deeply undemocratic move, and does it intend to approach the Slovakian authorities to ensure that moves of this kind do not have any effect, at the very least in a country which is on the threshold of membership of the EU?
Mr President, the Council attaches great importance to the candidate countries' fulfilling the political criteria for accession, established in Copenhagen in 1993 and relating to democracy, the Rule of Law, human rights and the protection of minorities.
It was decided that these criteria should be met before accession negotiations could be begun.
The negotiations with Slovakia were not, therefore, begun until the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999 was able to state that the criteria had now been met.
In its 2001 report on the future of Slovakia, the Commission concluded that the country continued to fulfil the political Copenhagen criteria.
The Commission also observed that, since 1999, Slovakia had done a lot in order further to consolidate and firmly establish the stability of its institutions and so strengthen democracy, the Rule of Law and human rights.
With regard to the specific question raised by the honourable Member, the bill in question is, according to what we have been told, being debated right now by the Slovakian parliament.
The second reading, which should have taken place in the middle of June, may possibly be deferred because there are a lot of other bills to be debated.
The Council is not at the present time able to assess the content of this bill.
It would be inappropriate for the EU to interfere in the democratic process in a third country.
If the bill is adopted, the EU will no doubt adopt a position on the content and, should it prove that the fundamental democratic principles, and particularly the Copenhagen criteria, have been violated, the EU will of course not hesitate to raise the issue at every available opportunity, and specifically in those bodies set up under the terms of the Europe Agreement.
The Council is therefore carefully monitoring developments in relation to the bill in question and is awaiting more detailed information about the debate in Slovakia's legislative assembly.
Mr President-in-Office, the Council's sounds in its reply like someone who knows that a crime is going to be committed and does nothing to prevent it but reserves the right to prosecute the perpetrator once the crime has been committed.
The bill in question has already affected political life in Slovakia, especially in the run up to the elections due to be held in September, in which the Communist party is expected to exceed the 5% threshold and obtain seats in parliament.
Unless, of course, the Council is comfortable with this and does not consider that a bill which criminalizes political beliefs and threatens anything from six months to three years in prison for anyone who even expresses sympathy with the Communists or doubts their crimes to be an infringement of human rights.
What I should like to know is, does the Council see this sort of threat, this sort of criminalisation, as falling inside or outside respect for rudimentary political rights?
I should like to draw attention to the fact that we have established a number of very clear criteria - what are termed the Copenhagen criteria.
They constitute the preventive tool called for by this House.
I have said - and this has been stated at every opportunity - that these criteria must be observed by every country which wishes to become a member of the European Union.
It is still only a question of a bill, and one submitted in a third country.
It must be up to the European Union to assess the situation if the bill is adopted with or without amendments.
In that way, it will be determined whether it is in conflict with the Copenhagen criteria.
I do not wish, on behalf of the Council, to pronounce any judgment here in this House today.
Thank you very much, Mr Haarder, for cooperating for so long today.
We look forward to seeing you next month for Question Time, after the holiday.
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 26 to 53 will be answered in writing.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0216/2002) by Mr Wieland, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on machinery and amending Directive 95/16/EC (COM(2000) 899 - C5-0035/2001 - 2001/0004(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am reporting today on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as the rapporteur on a highly technical directive, the Machinery Directive.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has examined this issue at a total of nine meetings and hearings over the last year and a half.
I myself am a lawyer, and these technical matters are sometimes very difficult for a lawyer to deal with, but they are issues which we must address nonetheless.
This is why the amendments before us - and I hope that the Commission will not take this amiss - propose, among other things, that as things stand at present, the article on the Commission and commitology should simply be deleted from the Commission's proposal, for we still do not regard the arrangements regarding commitology as adequate and satisfactory.
In my country, the Government has opportunities to develop legal provisions further.
However, the other side of the coin is the Commission's full accountability to Parliament.
This relationship of accountability between the Commission and Parliament has yet to be established, which is why we find it difficult to leave the further development of legal provisions entirely to the Commission without any scrutiny or control, and have therefore proposed the deletion of this article.
In the remaining provisions of this directive and the subject of our vote tomorrow, there is a great deal of dense technical content.
In many cases, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has merely tried to improve the structure of the provisions, since we feel that they are far from perfect from a legal draftsman's point of view.
We are also aware that there is intensive debate in the Council on the structuring of the definitions.
The discussions on the individual definitions have been outstanding.
We have now reached agreement in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I have the impression that the Committee's proposals will be widely endorsed tomorrow.
I have had comprehensive discussions with the shadow rapporteur Bill Miller, who will rise in a moment and to whom I would also like to express my thanks, and I think that the Parliament's position on the first reading is generally clear.
I would like to draw your attention to a further issue which is addressed in the articles but which is set forth in more precise terms in the recitals.
I have already mentioned that I am a lawyer, but when I was working through this directive, I sometimes had a minor crisis, for it is sometimes utterly incomprehensible even for a lawyer and extremely hard to wade through.
We must ensure that the regulations are much clearer so that our clients - namely the European consumers and the subjects of European law - can actually understand them.
This is why this report finally proposes the drafting of a horizontal directive, an overarching EC directive laying out uniform provisions governing all aspects relevant and important to CE markings in general, such as the form of the marking, implications of affixing the marking, market surveillance and so on.
Below this level, there would be a general product safety directive, so that together, there would be two overarching directives.
Then there would be the individual segment directives on low voltage, machinery, medical devices, and, if appropriate, on high voltage and so on.
The segment directives should simply state that we need this or that declaration of conformity, or that we need a type-examination, or that we just need specific checks to be carried out by the manufacturer.
In other words, what is required are clearer directives which the consumer can understand better, and also a more clearly structured format for the individual elements within the directive itself.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the European strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006 has recently been presented.
If we wanted to highlight three of its characteristics, I believe it would be right to mention the need to greatly increase awareness, to promote a culture of prevention, as well as the need to promote concrete programmes and actions in small and medium-sized businesses and to consider the demographic reality within which this strategy is to be applied.
A fourth characteristic would be the approximation of polices on health at work. This is closely related to the subject of the debate we are dealing with here.
The directive on machinery applies practically to all machines, fixed or mobile, of commercial industrial or private use, in the European Union.
As draftsman of the committee's opinion, I was determined to understand the views of entrepreneurs, unions, economic and social agents, technical and legal advisors and academics.
The Employment Committee's amendments intended, with the contribution of social dialogue, to prevent endangering or weakening the provisions relating to health and safety protection, to respond to the need to simplify certain clauses and provisions for the sake of the clarity of the protection regulations and to relate them to other Community provisions, in particular framework Directive 89/391/EEC.
In this way, an approximation of national health and safety provisions will facilitate the free movement of machinery without reducing the existing obligatory levels of protection, and the specific measures will increase the quality of jobs, provided that the machinery is used in the prescribed manner.
It also clearly stipulates the responsibilities of any person substantially modifying or having modified a piece of machinery.
Safe machinery and installations plus prevention - in other words, more awareness and a culture of prevention - will mean less possibility of risks becoming accidents and therefore better jobs in accordance with the strategy of the Lisbon European Council.
The rapporteur has said that these measures will guarantee the safety of products.
Allow me to add that they will also guarantee the safety of workers, in particular, and that of citizens, in general.
The safety of products implies and demands the safety of workers.
Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I should like to very much welcome Mr Wieland and congratulate him on all the work he has done over a long period.
It has been a test of endurance and, as he says, it is a complex and technical report. He has struggled with it as a lawyer.
I have to say that as an engineer I also found it difficult to work with.
On reflection, bearing in mind this is a first reading, I would say to the Commission tonight that it still has a lot more work to do on this with the Council.
In the light of the recent communication from Mr Prodi on simpler and better regulation, this is a candidate for the Commission to have a further look at.
After all, we are looking for a regulation that will make the internal market work and, as colleagues said, will also ensure a consistently high level of safety standards for users of machinery and people who work with them.
Having said that this is a technical directive, it is important that I say to the Commission tonight that there are some important political signals contained in the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
In particular, there is an issue that Mr Miller and I have worked on - I know he will refer to it in a moment - which is the treatment of particular categories of lifts for disabled people, in particular those installed in private dwellings.
We were disturbed when we saw the draft to find that this directive discriminated against this important category of machinery.
This type of machinery operates very satisfactorily.
It significantly improves the quality of life for disabled people, because it is installed in their own homes.
I have seen these installations. They are engineered to very high standards of safety.
We need to make sure that they are allowed to continue.
It is not the business of this directive to take satisfactory equipment off the market without any basis for doing so.
So we ask the Commission to make sure that this machinery is properly included.
Some work still needs to be done; there are still some aspects to be considered.
In conclusion, I want to say that we must put the internal market aspect to the fore, in particular the primacy of the CE markings. This is still not fully satisfactory.
Mr President, I also add my thanks to Mr Wieland, the rapporteur.
He has done a long and hard job on this.
If he, as a lawyer, and Mr Harbour, as an engineer, found it difficult to understand this, can you please have some sympathy for myself as a milkman - I found it even harder.
There are a couple of areas I would like to touch upon.
I would like to add an oral amendment tomorrow to Amendment No 14(2), because while we put in "seagoing vessels", I was remiss not to mention "inland waterway vessels".
That has been pointed out to me and I have raised it with the rapporteur, who has agreed to its insertion through an oral amendment, which I hope everyone will support.
I turn now to the point Mr Harbour raised about lift platforms.
It might not be the most riveting of subjects but it is an important point, because it helps and assists thousands of people with disabilities throughout Europe.
I should like to point out that there is a mistake in the English version.
The speed mentioned in the English version is "0.015 metres per second". That should read "0.15 metres per second".
If the speed were to be reduced by a tenth, people would be dead by the time they reached the other end.
Lift platforms are slow enough, let us not make them any slower.
I will not criticise the Commission in this instance because it was not the Commission that introduced the technicalities which would have made the lift platforms inoperable in this directive.
That came during the discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I lay no blame on the Commission.
I thank the rapporteur once again for accepting the amendments tabled by Mr Harbour and myself and which we have worked on for a long period of time.
This is important, as I indicated, to thousands of people.
Those are the two main areas which I have identified as being pertinent and relevant.
They are still being discussed in the Council.
There seems to be a blockage there and I hope that is resolved fairly quickly, because the whole question of lifts and lift platforms is important to a large number of people.
We do not want to let them down.
Please get this resolved as quickly as possible.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Wieland on the excellent work he has done on this proposal for a directive, the content of which is highly technical.
Even though I am an engineer, it was not easy even for me to understand all the mechanisms.
Compared with the Commission's original proposal, the amendments adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have the effect of facilitating the free movement of goods in Europe and improving both production aimed at consumers and consumers' health.
Indeed, in the end, the text will be clearer and forgery of the CE marking will be more difficult.
The debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs focused on a number of points.
One of these has already been mentioned.
Article 14(3) of the amended Lifts Directive contained a reference aimed at excluding from its scope lifting devices with a speed of less than 0.15 metres per second. This was to exempt low-risk devices from the burden of compliance.
Such devices also include lift platforms for the disabled or elderly.
The Committee on Legal Affairs rightly rejected the amendments aimed at introducing more binding parameters than those laid down by the Commission regarding speed, distance of travel and use by authorised persons of lift platforms.
Had they been adopted, these amendments would have considerably limited the use of such devices and would have made many platforms already installed in public places and private dwellings in our countries unusable without valid safety grounds.
The impact really would have been very, very negative.
The provision would have helped turn the citizens against the process of European integration.
The current new wording of the provisions of the Wieland report relating to Article 24 of the proposal for a directive on the specifications referred to in Annex 1, section 7, as the report was amended following ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I would like to welcome the conclusion of the first reading of the revision of the machinery directive and I would especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wieland, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The aim of the proposal is, as has been stressed by the speakers, to enhance legal certainty by clarifying the directive's scope and meaning and by removing ambiguities that have led to different interpretations.
At the same time the highest possible level of health protection and consumer safety should be ensured.
The European mechanical engineering sector which is subject to the machinery directive contains a very large range of products: machines, mechanical appliances and components.
In 1998 it produced goods to the value of EUR 300 billion.
It employs over 2.2 million highly skilled people in the 15 Member States.
The sector's production volume exceeds Japan's and rivals that of the United States of America.
The European Union is the world's largest exporter of machines and mechanical equipment, ahead of the USA and Japan.
Based on the experience of the past 12 years, the proposal reflects the Commission's determination to cut red tape whilst facilitating compliance with European Union legislation, taking due account of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles.
It is also fully in line with the recommendations of expert groups acting within the framework of better regulation of the internal market.
The proposal and its implications have been extensively discussed with a very wide audience of stakeholders.
I would like to emphasise that the aim of the proposal is to improve areas that have proved to cause difficulties in terms of application.
Many of the numerous proposed amendments improve the Commission proposal.
Some could be included in a revised proposal as they stand, whilst others could be retained in part, or in principle.
Some proposed amendments concern detailed, highly technical items and do not add any value and will therefore not be part of a revised proposal.
Still others are outside the scope we perceive as the correct scope for the machinery directive.
Concerning Amendment No 5 on fairground equipment, the Commission is aware of the question and we are prepared to launch a study into the matter.
We are currently preparing a Commission communication on the functioning of the new approach to be published this autumn.
The new approach to technical harmonisation and standardisation provides for the free movement of goods and a high level of health, consumer and environmental protection.
We do not want to interfere in the general debate on commitology.
We want to concentrate on the practical application of the current directive.
We therefore prefer to hold back the discussion of subjects that are common to the around 20 new-approach directives until the future communication that I have already mentioned, in order to have a coherent approach.
Practical application of the current machinery directive has shown a need for a regulatory committee procedure in order to resolve technical matters that do not infringe the democratic control by the European Parliament.
We also share the principle that there is a need to improve the complete texts of amended directives, as suggested in Amendment No 13.
However, this amendment goes beyond the scope of the machinery directive. Therefore, for legal reasons, we cannot accept this amendment.
In practice, consolidated texts of amended directives are often presented on the Commission website, as will be the case for the amended lifts directive.
Consequently, the Commission position on amendments is as follows.
Amendments that the Commission could accept in full, or in part, are Amendments Nos 2, 3, 14 to 18, 23, 27, 42, 45, 47, 49, 56, 57, 59, 63, 66, 69, 72, 74 to 76 and 80.
Amendments that the Commission could accept in principle are Amendments Nos 22, 30, 41, 51, 61, 62 and 64.
Finally the Commission cannot accept all other amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 4 to 13, 19 to 21, 24 to 26, 28, 29, 31 to 40, 44, 48, 50, 55, 58, 60, 65, 67, 70, 71, 73, 77 to 79, 82 and 83.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0189/2002) by Mr Ceyhun, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia (COM(2001) 664 - C5-0689/2001 - 2001/0270(CNS)).
The rapporteur, Mr Ceyhun, sends his apologies and will be replaced by Mr Evans.
Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising to Parliament, on behalf of Mr Ceyhun, who has been stranded in Germany and is unable to be here.
So I have the pleasure of presenting his report on his behalf.
Can I say through you, Mr President, to Mr Ceyhun that, as a non-German speaker, I am extremely grateful for the briefing notes that he has sent me in German, from which I will make my contribution this evening.
I welcome this report, which is both ambitious and particularly welcome: a report that Parliament has wanted for some time.
I also welcome Commissioner Vitorino, because this report clearly shows the very high principles and commitment that he gives to this issue.
We in Parliament - certainly on my committee -are very grateful to him for the amount of work that he does.
It is also a very topical and timely report.
We have seen right-wing extremism and populism on the rise.
We saw a very high vote for Mr Le Pen in France and similar issues in other countries.
Where right-wingers are, racism and xenophobia are not far behind and we have to be very wary of that.
Colleagues will be aware that there is also a great deal of concern in Europe at the moment about asylum and immigration.
There are lots of horror stories presented by the press to misinform people.
This report attempts to clarify the definition of what is racism and what is xenophobia and to make the actions that should be punished much clearer.
Our group and the committee welcomed the effort made by the Commission to try to harmonise this legislation.
The rapporteur also recognises the importance of protecting the right to free speech and, equally, the need to protect minorities and other groups.
We must ensure that any new legislation does not stand in the way of these important European fundamental rights.
As regards the penalties for transgressing these laws, individual governments must consider the recommendations that are made, and these vary from six months for some offences to two years for others.
We must regard them as minimum points - as lowest common denominators - and we should be pressing countries to do more.
Mr Ceyhun also refers in his report to the growing use of the Internet, which is not just European but global and knows no boundaries.
There is a considerable level of responsibility here that must fall on the Internet service providers.
They must be responsible for their sites, users and contents.
That does not mean that they will always be responsible for everything that goes through their sites but they must be responsible for presenting racist and xenophobic material.
More complex is the question of whether a prosecution is possible - the Commissioner is a lawyer so he will know this - without the announcement of victims.
Perhaps Member States should be responsible for this, since some of them are not happy about it.
I now turn to the manufacture, distribution and the private possession of racist and xenophobic material.
The rapporteur has looked very closely at the possibilities.
We have to make absolutely clear that manufacture and production of such materials should be punishable.
However, in many cases the private possession of such materials may not be punishable and it may not be desirable that it should be, because this would - if we took it to its logical consequence - prevent people from keeping, for example, old books, photos and other historical materials which would have to be destroyed en masse.
The rapporteur looks to Europol and Eurojust to enforce the existing structures across Europe, in cooperation with the judicial forces in each country.
I am sure the exchange of data should help to improve the implementation of this framework decision.
Finally, the rapporteur has asked for periodic reports on the progress by the Commission, how it is getting on, and this is customary practice.
There is good support for this legislation across Europe, across parties in the committee and from a whole range of NGOs across Europe.
It is very timely legislation.
I welcome the amount of work the Commissioner has put into this, and I hope very much that Parliament will give it its full support tomorrow and that we can press forward and make real progress on combating racist and xenophobic materials.
Mr President, the proposal presented to us by the Commission today pursues a twofold objective: it is designed on the one hand to ensure that racist and xenophobic behaviour is effectively punishable in every Member State and on the other hand to increase cooperation between national judicial authorities in cases relating to such offences.
This is a timely proposal, Commissioner, given the political context with which we are familiar in a number of Member States.
As a matter of fact, in its latest report, covering the year 2000, the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia notes that a substantial rise in the level of racial violence and in the incidence of anti-Semitic attacks and racially motivated threats and intimidation was recorded in France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
In Germany, the report says, the proportion of racist crimes increased by 33% from 1999 to 2000, while in the United Kingdom the number of racially motivated acts of violence and aggression doubled in the course of the same period.
These figures should cause us concern, just as the recent election results in France have done.
Moreover, it is to be feared that the international situation will lead to a resurgence of such acts.
The European People's Party therefore welcomes the proposal for a framework decision on the fight against racism and xenophobia while suggesting amendments which, we believe, will clarify the decision and make it easier to apply.
I should like to emphasise the need to give the Member States a broad margin of discretion in the application and implementation of the decision, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, and in particular the need to specify that the decision does not prevent any Member State from adopting or maintaining provisions of national criminal law that prescribe a higher degree of protection against racism and xenophobia.
In addition, we support the amendments tabled on the initiative of my fellow Member, Klaus-Heiner Lehne, which define the scope of the decision, indicating clearly that it applies both to offences committed in a Member State and to those committed elsewhere if the offender is a national of a Member State.
Lastly, I also consider it important to point out that the aggravating circumstances in which maximum sentences may be increased ought to be extended to cases where the victim is a minor or where the offensive words or actions have been addressed to a minor or to a person who may be easily influenced.
Let me add that my group will support Amendment No 12 but not Amendments Nos 24 and 25.
Thank you for your attention, and thank you, Commissioner, for having brought this very important legal and indeed political issue before Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the impact and the development of the use of digital networks and the Internet - which we can only welcome, I hasten to add - have also provided new scope for the communication of racist and xenophobic messages.
This proliferation is encouraged by a sense of impunity deriving from the perception that such offences are merely virtual acts performed in cyberspace.
It is true that the Internet offers a public platform for everyone to express opinions.
But some people, as they sit in front of their computers, seem to forget the public dimension of their words or actions and their necessary accountability for the material they communicate.
The international dimension, the increasingly numerous intermediaries and the anonymity of the Internet have obviously encouraged and deepened the impression that cyberspace enjoys some sort of extraterritorial immunity from the law.
While cyberspace is virtual, criminal liability for offences committed there is real.
It is clear that if the Internet is to be counted among the instruments of free expression, if it wants to enjoy corresponding rights, it must be accompanied by the fulfilment of all obligations.
And if this tool, which transcends frontiers, is to contribute to the emancipation of societies, of its 'cybercitizens', it must not on any account be allowed to exploit the loopholes resulting from insufficient coordination of national policies to become a law unto itself or, to put it another way, to frustrate the efforts of the European Union to function as an area of peace, security and justice.
Thank you, Commissioner, for this proposal, which the report is intended to reaffirm.
In short, it is not a matter of ordering action but of encouraging it.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I welcome this proposal which aims, with the assistance of legislation, to tackle the growing xenophobia and racism in Europe.
This depressing development goes against everything the EU stands for: freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, the Rule of Law.
I feel that Mr Ceyhun deserves great praise for his excellent work.
It is vital to work together within the EU to strengthen the protection available to victims of xenophobic and racist crimes and to ensure that those responsible are punished and that we remove the loopholes in the law.
It must not be possible for differences in legislation in the various Member States to be exploited by those who commit crimes.
Racism and xenophobia must be tackled on a broad front, as happens in this report.
Crimes must be punished and crimes involving xenophobia and racism must be punished even harder. Racism must be considered an aggravating factor when punishment is meted out.
It is high time that we in this Parliament and the EU's institutions sent out a clear and unambiguous message that we will never accept racist outrages occurring in our Europe.
With the help of democracy, we must combat those who stir up their citizens to commit crimes.
Our Europe must be a safe place for everyone, regardless of ethnic identity, race, religion or sexual orientation.
This is not the case today.
We know that many people in Europe currently fear for their own lives and for the safety of their families.
They are afraid to go out.
They feel threatened.
This is totally unacceptable.
This desire of ours to create a society for everyone, without racism and xenophobia - a desire which, while it may be a dream, is an important one to have - must not encroach upon the right of every individual, which is set out in the European Convention on Human Rights, also to be able to express himself freely in speech and writing.
I therefore hope to see you support our Amendments Nos 24 and 25 which safeguard the freedom of expression of journalists, artists and others.
Freedom of expression is fundamental and in principle must never be curtailed.
In certain Member States, including my own, freedom of expression and freedom of the press are enshrined in the constitution.
Naturally, threatening or insulting other people, particularly for racist reasons, can never be allowed.
Nor, however, is it clear that punishment is justified in all circumstances.
It is a question of balance. I believe that it is important to bring the matter out into the open to be debated.
Once the issue sees the light of day, we can put it to rest.
I am therefore a little doubtful about some of Mr Ceyhun's proposals involving a ban on disseminating xenophobic material and about the proposals which in practice mean that membership of certain organisations may be criminalised.
My doubt and my concerns in this case are, however, not great enough to stop me wholeheartedly supporting Mr Ceyhun's proposal.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is correct that this report coincides with the upsurge in electoral support for populist xenophobic parties which we have been experiencing in Europe and which is now igniting the heart of our continent.
Every report, whether it comes from the institutions, from NGOs or from the Monitoring Centre in Vienna, emphasises the persistence and indeed the escalation of racially-motivated violence.
For my part, I applaud the rapporteur's clarification that racism is not an opinion.
Insulting or humiliating someone is not a matter of exercising freedom of expression; it is nothing short of a criminal offence.
Saying 'I don't like bread pudding' is not the same as saying 'I don't like Arabs'.
We know that these two statements have quite different consequences.
The important feature of this report is that, rather than merely dealing with the punishment of isolated individuals for isolated acts, it calls for the pursuit of those who supply the ideological weaponry that incites others to commit acts of violence.
From this point of view, the comments that were read on the Internet are very interesting.
We know that this marvellous communication medium, the Internet, can be used today to order revisionist magazines, buy tapes and CDs glorifying the Third Reich, preach anti-Semitism and, since 11 September, in the name of freedom of opinion, devote entire chat forums to outpourings of anti-Arab and Islamophobic invective.
This is unacceptable.
To my mind, we cannot plan to enlarge Europe and promote peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the Old World without raising awareness among our youngest citizens of the evil nature of racism.
The Constitutional Council in France has just decided to grant the SOS Racisme association the legal right to conduct spot checks to catch nightclub owners who refuse young people entry without good reason.
This is the example to follow.
Commissioner, Mr President, let me conclude by saying to you that this report will be voted down in any event, which I regret, for unless we grant economic, social and ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against racism and xenophobia is not a new concern of our institutions.
On numerous occasions, the debates in our Assembly have focused on combating racism.
Today we have a European monitoring centre as well as Article 13 of the Treaty, which enshrines the power of the Union to take action to combat discrimination.
The European countries also have national anti-racism legislation.
In practice, however, racial discrimination has never before been such an acute problem.
Let me cite in evidence the report produced by the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, which testifies to the upsurge in racism and xenophobia, including 'Islamophobia', a phenomenon reflected in the alarming rise of the extreme right.
The Council's proposal on combating racism and xenophobia, which we are examining here, is designed to strengthen and supplement the existing legal framework.
It is highly regrettable, however, to discover once again that Community responsibility for defining and penalising racist and xenophobic crimes is to be based on the lowest common denominator.
If there is no common definition of the recognised offences, how will it be possible to guarantee that the same efforts will be made to combat racism and xenophobia in each of the Member States?
One might well ask whether the aim of this proposal is really to combat racism or whether it is merely a way of salving our consciences.
This reluctance to take the bull by the horns is tantamount to offering racists the right to continue serving the ends of the extreme right or engaging in populism and rabble-rousing sophistry for electoral purposes and to do so with impunity.
Let us not forget that the purpose of combating racism is not only to protect foreigners but also to defend the values of our democracies, human rights and fundamental freedoms, which form the bedrock on which we are building the European Union.
Besides, why exclude the Member States from the implementation of this Decision when we know for a fact that institutional racism exists and that it must be combated with the utmost vigour?
This institutional racism, which manifests itself in a whole host of social, economic, professional, cultural and political exclusion mechanisms, is based on ethnic or religious considerations or sometimes on a system of national preference, which is now giving way to European preference.
If racism is to be combated more effectively on a day-to-day basis, it is not enough to adopt legislative acts.
We are convinced that granting equal rights, including political rights, to all citizens of the Union, whatever their nationality, is the only way to combat every form of racism, because it establishes a balance of political power that is rooted in the exercise of citizenship.
Unfortunately, the proposed framework decision does not go far enough in this direction.
Nevertheless, we owe it to ourselves to support every initiative that puts human dignity at the heart of the process of building the Union, and combating racism is an integral part of that process.
Mr President, I am speaking in support of certain amendments but also to remedy some serious lapses of memory on the matter of the rights of peoples and ethnic groups.
We should, under the subsidiarity principle, approve the set of amendments by which the decision to take criminal action should remain with each Member State.
There is a point of reference, indeed, that Parliament should never lose sight of, especially on such a sensitive matter, which is that the provisions under which action may be taken to combat racism must not overstep the limit marked by the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of opinion, as laid down in Article 9 of the European Convention.
That this concern of mine is well founded is shown by the current case of the proceedings brought before the French courts by a movement that considers itself anti-racist to have the book La rabbia e l'orgoglio ('Rage and Pride') by the Italian author Oriana Fallaci banned in France.
Leaving aside any consideration of the book's merits - in Italy, a non-racist country, it has been an enormous publishing success - the basic question remains open, which is the risk that so-called anti-racist rules can be used instrumentally for the purpose of political and ideological censorship and to curtail the freedom to express one's opinions, as guaranteed by the founding principles of the European Union.
According to the rapporteur, the Member States should punish crimes by their own citizens even if they were not committed within their own borders.
It seems obvious to me, however, that this may lead to interference by one State in the legal arrangements of another State, unjustly restricting its sovereignty.
Besides, in Europe there are entire peoples, groups and linguistic and religious minorities who, even within Member States that declare themselves protectors of the values of freedom, do not enjoy any protection at all as regards these fundamental rights.
Is it not perhaps racism to prevent or hinder the use of their mother tongue in the courts, or to have road signs in the local language removed, as has recently happened in the town of Bergamo, or to stop the mother tongue and local history from being taught in schools, thus committing not only terrible discrimination on ethnic grounds but also real and actual cultural genocide?
In some cases state racism, as now shown towards supporters of Breton independence, even denies fundamental rights of defence, such as the right enshrined in French law of free access without payment to court documents, as reported by me in a question to the Council.
The scope of offences involving discrimination should also be very clearly delineated; there must be racist or xenophobic intent and the offence must be threatening, abusive or insulting in nature.
This will better safeguard the complete freedom to circulate historical texts and documents and especially to do scientific and historical research and process information.
The difference between these activities and discriminatory acts may in some cases be very subtle, but it exists, and our liberal culture means we must guarantee total freedom for historical research and expression of one's opinions.
Mr President, we are talking about an eagerly awaited and sensitive report which, if approved with certain basic amendments tabled by the PPE, may genuinely contribute to resolving a very serious problem.
It will, in any case, help us to take a step forwards in our efforts to discourage any discriminatory attitudes towards people because of their race, religion or different nationality.
The purpose is to set up joint actions to be implemented by the Member States committed to facing the problem, in as coordinated a manner as possible. This is, first and foremost, to prevent offences committed in different countries of the Union from being tried and punished with measures that differ too widely, that are too incoherent.
The first part of the report aims to define as precisely as possible what a racist or xenophobic offence consists of.
In this respect, I should like to point out to the Commissioner the useful contribution made by Amendment No 12, which provides the means not only of preventing pointless witch hunts in this context, all too easy when talking of xenophobia and racism, but also of ensuring that we do not underestimate behaviour that may be genuinely racist or xenophobic.
The report then goes on to outline common minimum penalties for both natural and legal persons, but, most importantly, this report is up to date, because it does not just cover offences that occur in citizens' everyday lives but also virtual offences, in other words those committed every day in the virtual world of the Internet.
Of particular interest is the part which sees the racist component as exacerbating certain cases involving offences of other origins and types.
Lastly, what is really needed to achieve these objectives is a commitment to enhance cooperation among Member States in the field of justice.
This is a new initiative following on from other actions taken in the past and based on a parent action in 1996.
Let us hope that this parent will in future bear other children like this report.
Mr President, we all know how easy it is to unleash racist and xenophobic behaviour by using the migratory phenomena that Europe is currently experiencing.
This easy approach, which subliminally identifies immigration with violence in the citizens' minds, opens the door to appalling racist and xenophobic behaviour and undermines the bases of civic coexistence in Europe today, catapulting the populists into the seats of power.
Whereas this represents added value for Europe by helping to resolve a common problem, it loses effect as a result of coming up against the nationalist and police barriers that every Member State is now building for itself - simply sand castles that fall apart when the wind blows a little harder.
Despite all of this we must emphasise the genuinely European aim of this framework decision, which is intended to establish a European system of sanctions for crimes of racism and xenophobia, which have to date fallen under international law or under the national law of each Member State, a net with a very wide mesh through which the perpetrators of these crimes can slip.
Europe, Mr President, cannot protect itself by political inertia or by spouting fine words or by irresponsibly telling voters the easiest thing to say, which is that the fault is someone else's.
Europe can only protect itself through the law, using sanctions and prosecutions.
This is why, Commissioner, we support this initiative and hope that the Council will not shirk from approving it quickly.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the report kept the promise contained in its title, there would be nothing I would like more than to vote for it.
Yet this is the very thing it does not do.
Let me briefly explain why.
The key word is the Internet.
Already, everything that is illegal offline is also illegal on the Internet.
That is a fact, but word does not seem to have got round this House yet. It is thanks to other groups that providers really can only be prosecuted if they are aware of the illegal content of their websites.
The rapporteur has done everything he can to criminalise the Internet as a whole.
This, in my view, wonderfully reflects the rapporteur's true intention.
The second point about the approach adopted in the report is that it is thoughts, above all, which are to be punished.
There is far less focus on deeds. This takes us away from the principle of punishing hate crime - that is, acts that really are committed for racist motives - and moves us towards mind policing.
This leads to more censorship and less freedom of the press and freedom of speech. That is something we cannot support.
My final point is that anti-racism as it is defined here would mean achieving tangible improvements in migrants' living conditions.
What does the report do?
The report does not tackle institutional racism, whereby Eurodac is just the tip of the iceberg, and nor does it address economic racism or the pure racism which was agreed on once again in precise terms at Seville, namely not only expanding Fortress EU but going as far as to keep third states in a direct stranglehold.
This is why anti-racists cannot take this report at all seriously.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we congratulate Mr Ozan Ceyhun and regret the increase in the number of racist incidents in the countries of Europe.
According to the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the year 2000 saw an increase in hostilities and attacks compared to the previous year, which were particularly serious in some countries of the Union.
As a result of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the situation has grown worse, and we have seen an increase in tensions and violence, particularly of an anti-Islamic nature.
We must emphasise once again that racism and xenophobia constitute a clear violation of the principles of freedom, democracy, fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights as well as the Rule of Law - principles on which the European Union is founded and which are common to all Member States.
Discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin is prohibited in all States, but there are considerable disparities in the scope, the wording and the implementation of this ban.
The Member States must be able to introduce or uphold provisions that are more favourable to protecting the principle of equal treatment.
It is crucial, however, that minimum standards exist at European level.
Those who commit this type of offence must not be able to exploit these disparities and escape legal proceedings by moving from one country to another.
This proposal for a framework decision must lead to the approximation of national criminal laws, providing a common approach, which will enable racist acts in the European Union to be effectively prosecuted.
It can never be emphasised too much, however, that there must be an equitable balance between combating the scourge of racism and xenophobia and safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms, specifically the freedom of expression, the freedom of the press and freedom of association.
For the sake of truth, however, it should also be pointed out that clamping down on racist acts, especially violent ones, is not the only way to fight racism.
It must first of all be prevented, through education about equality and through the adoption of intelligent policies that do not provoke undesirable reactions.
This is a highly topical example of the measures to be adopted in the field of asylum and immigration policies.
Mr President, any positive measures proposed by the Council and in this report to tighten up the European Union's policy by strengthening measures to prosecute racism and xenophobia pale into insignificance beside the decisions taken on immigration in Seville, which came up with a policy to systematically prosecute and terrorise immigrants in keeping with the philosophy of the far right, which blames all the evils of capitalism on immigrants.
Immigrants who, at the end of the day, mostly come from countries which are the wretched victims of exploitation, including by countries in the European Union.
At the same time, many countries, such as Greece, which perhaps has the highest percentage of immigrants, apply practices which are crude, barbaric infringements of immigrants' fundamental human rights.
It was recently revealed that 2 700 immigrants were being held in such appalling conditions that they took to the streets in protest.
Against this nightmarish backdrop, the Council's proposal and the Ceyhun report, combined with current legislation on the European arrest warrant, are little more than measures to expand and conceal the racist and xenophobic policy of the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes Mr Ceyhun's report, which is in line with the proposal that we submitted for a framework decision to combat racism and xenophobia.
As the rapporteur points out, freedom of expression under the democratic Rule of Law has limits and, therefore, cannot be used as a justification for breaching the rights of third parties or for committing criminal acts.
Unfortunately, in various areas of Europe, we are still seeing expressions of racism and xenophobia, which are unacceptable in our democratic societies.
An integrated approach that includes both preventive measures and measures involving criminal proceedings is crucial in order effectively to combat this phenomenon.
Measures in the field of criminal law such as those laid down in the Commission proposal constitute one element of this approach.
On the other hand, however, the Commission has always stressed that this must be a fight of a cultural nature and has for this reason already adopted various awareness-raising measures to combat racism and xenophobia in fields such as employment, immigration, asylum policy and the education system.
With regard to the amendments to the Commission proposal for a framework decision, the rapporteur argues that the fact that an offence concerning racism and xenophobia is committed by means of mass communication should be considered as an aggravating circumstance.
The Commission is flexible with regard to other aggravating circumstances.
It might be more appropriate, however, in this House, to talk about material targeted at a large number of people, given that racist material distributed by one individual, for example, the manual distribution of racist propaganda, could also be intended for a large number of people.
Amendments Nos 6 and 12(b) refer to the directive on electronic commerce concerning the responsibility of Internet service providers.
Indeed, the provisions of the framework decision do not prejudice any instrument of the first pillar, specifically the "electronic commerce" directive.
In this regard, it should be emphasised that, according to this directive, the Member States cannot impose the general obligation on service providers to monitor content, but can establish the obligation to inform the competent authorities about alleged illegal activities or information communicated by users.
Consequently, providers' responsibility can be established provided that Internet service providers are genuinely aware that they are harbouring racist material. In other words, that their attention has been drawn to this fact by a judicial authority by means of criminal proceedings, if these providers have not, in the meantime, adopted measures to remove this material.
The Commission takes a slightly different view to that of the rapporteur on making the public condoning of crimes of genocide and of other extremely serious crimes illegal.
The conditions imposed by Amendment No 12 on this section are more rigorous than those recommended in the joint action of 1996 because they require the words or behaviour in question to be threatening, abusive or insulting and motivated by racism or xenophobia.
The joint action approved six years ago only required the public condoning to be undertaken with a racist or xenophobic objective.
Consequently, the conditions imposed by Amendment No 12 would establish a higher threshold for criminal proceedings to be initiated, and so we requested that this issue be considered by Parliament.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that our proposal is clear on the matter of the definition and classification of the crime, because we always deal in practical actions and not in opinions.
The proposal for a framework decision cannot be interpreted in a way that threatens fundamental rights, specifically the freedom of expression and the principles recognised in Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
In European law, however, as in the law of every Member State of the European Union, the appropriate balance must be guaranteed.
As laid down in Article 10(2) of the European Convention, the exercise of these freedoms, specifically the freedom of expression, can and must be weighed up against protecting order, against crime prevention and against protecting the honour or the rights of third parties.
In this context, we are not proposing to create some kind of thought police; we are simply calling for the Union as a whole to be faithful to the values of our common heritage as expressed in the European Convention on Human Rights.
Hence the clear political message, in other words, that racists and xenophobic crimes are fought vigorously and in an equivalent way throughout the European Union.
the next item is the report (A5-0217/2002) by Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Green Paper on the review of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 (COM(20021) 745 - C5-0159/2002 - 2002/2067(COS)).
Mr President, about two years ago a conference was held in Brussels to mark the tenth anniversary of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on the control of concentrations between undertakings.
During the conference, all the speakers spoke unanimously in favour of the virtues of this Regulation, which is somewhat unusual for expert opinions.
I agree with these opinions and with this positive assessment.
In putting forward the proposal to amend the Regulation, however, there is one opinion that must be pointed out from the start.
The positive assessment of the Regulation does not prevent suggestions being made with regard to partially reforming it or adapting it to the requirements brought to light by experience, but, in any case, these reforms will be limited.
The text of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 itself stipulates that certain aspects should be reviewed ten years after its entry into force.
Now that this period is over, the Commission has issued a Green Paper suggesting that not only the points laid down in the Regulation, but also those allowing the text to be updated, should be analysed.
This is a very positive initiative on which the Commission should be congratulated.
Perhaps the most important points of this Green Paper concern the definition of the thresholds at which concentrations are considered to have a Community dimension and, secondly, the hypotheses whereby a concentration notified to the Commission could be referred to the national authority or authorities for analysis and a decision and, vice versa, whereby a concentration notified to the national authorities could also be referred to the Commission.
In the first of these sections, the Commission suggests that the concentration should have a Community dimension if it needs to be notified in three or more countries, thus eliminating the complicated procedural rules contained in section 1 of Article 3 of the Regulation.
Certain national competition authorities have protested against the amendment of this section, or its replacement by criteria other than those of the Commission.
We cannot agree with these objections.
The rule on the automatic assigning of competences proposed by the Commission allows for greater clarity and simplicity, promotes uniform assessment criteria, increases legal certainty and saves companies money.
We therefore support it wholeheartedly.
The second of these sections, regarding the referral of cases, is more complex, and the European Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have therefore made some suggestions.
The first concerns the suitability of parties consenting to the referral of the case by the European Commission to one or more national authorities.
If joint handling is considered more effective and saves companies money, it appears that, under the referral process, companies cannot be obliged to submit different cases against their will.
In another section, the European Parliament warns the Commission of the problem caused by this referral process when the final decision rests with the political authorities and not with independent authorities.
Account should be taken of the fact that in several Member States, the decision is taken by a political authority, such as in my country, for example, where the Government takes this decision.
The criteria according to which concentrations are approved or rejected may therefore differ from the criteria used to analyse the effect on competition and its potential efficiency.
In an interview published in the Spanish press recently, Commissioner Monti emphasised the pressure that Governments apply in competition cases.
It is not hard to guess what the position of these Governments would be if they were the ones taking the decision.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists has tabled two amendments: the first concerns the need for the efficiencies that could counter the ill effects of a concentration on competition to include the maintenance or creation of employment.
In fact, this is a version of the failing company defence principle, which has already been applied by the Commission and which we believe would improve the report if reflected in the text.
I also believe the report would be improved by the content of the second amendment, which asks that, in concentration cases, not only competitors, but also consumers, and, where appropriate, representatives of the workers concerned, be considered as interested parties.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the aforementioned Committee with regard to Mr Berenguer's report. I congratulate him on his work, and I also congratulate the Commission, represented today by Mr Monti, on the initiative, which we feel is also very welcome.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has included in its report some of the conclusions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I would refer in particular to those concerning not extending ex ante control to new cases, simplifying the calculation of deadlines and rejecting the recording of oral submissions which could affect legal certainty.
I thank the rapporteur for his favourable position on these amendments and the competent committee for its approval.
There are, however, other items into which the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not been incorporated and which must be re-stated.
Specifically, we do not think it appropriate for the dominance test to be replaced by the criterion of substantially reducing the competence to authorise concentrations, nor for the Commission's powers of referral to be transferred to national competition authorities, nor for fines to be calculated as a percentage of turnover volume.
This is because we consider it inadvisable to take risks with regard to legal certainty in our eagerness to introduce new, more or less innovative procedures when they are not necessary.
It is therefore clear that, in my opinion, the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Amendment No 5 of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, which run counter to the tendency to clarify the procedures and which are obviously imprecise, and the other two amendments, which have nothing to do with the objective of achieving a better procedure for the control of concentrations, should not be accepted.
Congratulations, therefore, on the initiative, and take care not to reduce the effectiveness of a procedure that works well.
Mr President, the European Commission's proposal on the reform is welcome.
After all, it is far-sighted to embark on a process of modernisation and reform at this stage, notwithstanding the successful history of the Regulation on merger control.
I also think it is far-sighted since account is already being taken of the enlargement processes.
I endorse the rapporteur's report - as, indeed, does my group - but I also share the concern, for example, that some of the proposals set out in the Green Paper cannot actually be achieved in practice.
For this reason, it is very important to ensure that the Commission gives its pledge that the issue of definitions, but also the replacement of the dominance test, will not be held over until other occasions in the future when the Regulation is reviewed again.
I think this applies especially to the international dimension of the merger processes and especially to the innovative areas in which mergers are taking place.
The number of transnational corporate mergers has risen steadily in recent years.
Their growing number and complexity are undoubtedly one reason for reviewing the division of competence and adopting new arrangements on coordination between national and EU competition authorities.
I welcome the greater concentration on the Commission as a central contact point in the interests of efficiency, transparency, legal certainty, a shortening of deadlines and reducing the administrative burden on companies, and I also expressly endorse the Commission's indication that it may be necessary to create an additional judicial instance.
What must be examined in detail, however - and here I disagree with the previous speakers - is the major impact of mergers, especially on employment, and the criteria and procedures for examining the permissibility of a merger.
Throughout the EU, thousands of jobs have been lost as a result of such restructuring.
Companies should undoubtedly have the greatest possible freedom to make management decisions, but it is often the largest employer in a region which carries out these restructuring plans.
The resulting job losses do not only affect the individual workers; they also have an impact on economic and social cohesion in the region as a whole.
I would like to remind you in this context that the Nice European Council expressly described economic performance as being inseparable from social progress.
This must be taken into account in competition law and competition policy, also within the framework of merger controls.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Berenguer Fuster for his excellent work.
Commissioner, I have said it before, and have said it in Sweden. You are perhaps the most important Member of the Commission for citizens of my country, where issues of competition have never been high on the agenda.
Things have started to improve now, so there is cause for hope.
Competition policy is particularly important for small countries, where the risks of monopolies and concentrations of undertakings are obvious.
It is great that the EU is now prepared to carry out a review of the way acquisition control is to function in a globalised economy.
The world around is changing, which places new demands on EU merger control.
In my country, we have had a broad discussion on these issues since a number of high-profile intended mergers failed to happen.
I am not saying that the Commission has made incorrect assessments in these particular cases.
However, I feel that broader considerations could be applied in assessments of mergers.
Once again, this is particularly important for small countries.
I would like to mention a few particular points.
Firstly, acquisition control should be more focused on promoting the development and rationalisation of companies in the internal market as a whole.
We must create a complete market without obstacles and segmentation.
This is not currently the case.
Secondly, acquisition control must become more predictable.
Thirdly, the Rule of Law could be strengthened.
It is a sound principle that the authority investigating an issue should not be the same one which then makes a decision on the case.
Mr President, we need stronger companies in Europe.
We need more competition.
We need global players which can grow strong enough to handle increasingly tough international competition.
Therefore, there is a need for a more long-term and dynamic approach in the Commission's assessment of mergers.
In this respect, the EU may have something to learn from the US, entirely with the aim of creating an EU with better growth and more competitiveness, in line with what was said in Lisbon.
Mr President, Commissioner, given the increasing volume of business mergers and their profound social and economic impact, there is room for improvement on the proposals contained in the Green Paper.
As the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, points out, the control of mergers is one of the mainstays of Community competition policy.
Competition, however, cannot be used as the sole criterion when assessing the acceptability of a planned merger.
Other objectives defined in the Lisbon strategy, such as the dynamics of full employment and competitive industries, must also be included in the assessment.
Both types of objective should be accorded equal legal status with a view to preventing any lessening of competition but also with a view to advancing the interests of industry and employment, which have become the poor relations in our present-day economic policies.
The question of renewing the assessment criteria is therefore crucial.
Greater consideration must be given to the realities of global competition, it should be recognised that the idea of national markets is becoming meaningless in all but a few segments of the economy, that the European market is what counts now and, finally, that there is a need to develop the concept of contestable markets by moving towards the criterion of significant lessening of competition.
At the same time, procedures must be improved.
The One-Stop Shop principle for operations of Community interest is excellent, provided it is combined with good safeguards.
The notification conditions can be simplified and the two-thirds rule preserved without losing sight of the need for coherence within the Community.
However, it is on two methodological aspects that substantial progress must be made.
In view of the huge social impact of these operations, it is imperative that representatives of the workforce and the other interested parties be consulted before any final decisions are made, as proposed by Mr Goebbels and Mr Berenguer Fuster in their amendments.
The procedure used to test the market must be made completely transparent; to this end, it will be necessary to listen to the arguments of the interested parties and to respond to their observations.
The interests of industry have thus been protected, which was the purpose of one of my amendments.
More could be done, of course, with regard to the contestability of decisions.
Effective competition in the wider market on the one hand and development of industry and employment on the other: these are two aims on which further improvement is needed.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as all the previous speakers have said, we face a number of challenges here.
On the one hand, there is the greater integration of the markets, and on the other, there is economic globalisation, which is associated, not least, with an increase in corporate mergers, and finally, there is the challenge of enlargement.
Competition is a key instrument to achieve our economic policy goals while upholding our principles within the framework of the ecological and social market economy to which Europe is committed.
What is at stake is Europe's competitiveness in the global market.
The issue is competition within Europe, which we urgently need to achieve the Lisbon goals and to strengthen the internal market.
We do not want government monopolies to be replaced by private monopolies.
We want competition on the basis of common rules.
Competition as we define it safeguards and creates jobs, leads to consumer-friendly prices, and fosters the urgently needed dynamic process of renewal.
We face the additional challenge of enlargement, which urgently needs mutual agreement on fundamental aspects of the competition rules among the Member States and with the accession countries.
Commissioner, we naturally have wishes as well.
We want a clear definition of the relevant market, especially in the era of globalisation.
We regret that there is no separation between the investigating and decision-making authorities.
We underline the need for the division of competence and coordination between the Commission and the national competition authorities to be shaped in a coherent way.
We welcome the fact that venture capital investments no longer fall within the EU merger control arrangements.
The fact that we must embark on our own process of renewal is apparent from the example of Austria, where, since 1 July, we have had a new competition ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my thanks for this excellent report.
The Internal Market facilitates the existence of mergers, as does the single currency, enlargement of the Union and globalisation, actually a type of merger, and helps put global control of the economy and communications in the hands of the few.
Convergence itself has led to a situation where the IT sector, the media and the telecommunications sector are actually one inside the other, with the result that there exist enormous concentrations - mega-powers, in fact - in which economic and industrial power, the power of communications, and, in many cases, political power, are in practice concentrated in the same hands.
The media is also decidedly centralised, and I have not seen the Commission interfere very much in that.
The situation in Italy reminds one of Russia, although the Russian leadership at least does not own television channels.
There will perhaps soon be only a few companies or operators left in the telecommunications sector, and although they might not attain a dominant market position in one, two or even three countries, it might come about globally.
A company will thus have a considerable market share in a group of ten countries.
I do hope the Commission will address the situation and assess the globally important market position.
Companies that have benefited from economies of scale can manipulate markets.
The Union's binding principle of social cohesion requires that the business interface takes account of social welfare and labour law, and let us also mention the rights of shareholders, which is also part of the social cohesion system we have decided to embrace.
Mr President, the rapporteur expresses satisfaction with the European institutions' scrutiny of corporate mergers.
This self-satisfaction is ridiculous, because the heads of the large companies that engage in these activities pay infinitely more heed to the interests of their major shareholders than to the opinion of the European Parliament.
By affirming that these mergers boost competitiveness and hence economic growth and employment, the report reproduces the employers' mantra that what is good for entrepreneurs and their shareholders is good for society.
However, one need only compile a catalogue of the mergers that have taken place, listing the job cuts and plant closures they have entailed, counting the thousands of workers consigned to the dole queue and the entire regions condemned to economic ruin, to demonstrate clearly that the interests of shareholders are diametrically opposed to those of the majority of society who work for their living.
The Vivendi affair, the latest in a long line of similar cases in the United States, shows how your system transforms production into financial capital, into a mere object of speculation.
The stock exchange makes the rich grow richer and impoverishes some speculators, but most of all it impoverishes society.
Wealth is not born of speculation but of work, and the only purpose of the stock exchange is to squander the real fruits of labour and convert them into false values.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, on the excellent work he has done.
Over the last decade, financial investment has become increasingly important both quantitatively and qualitatively, geared towards better resource placement and anticipated cost savings.
Thanks also to developments in information technology, there has been a clear, decisive process of globalisation and concentration, which has brought considerable benefits in the development of investments and productive activities but has also generated crises that have destabilised banking and financial systems in developing countries.
The negative effects have spilled over into production and employment, and sometimes into the living standards of broad sections of society in these countries.
While it is true that concentrations have developed the economic systems of certain countries, which, through their tried and tested stability, have been able to benefit from the opportunities they bring, it is also true that concentrations should be able to favour initiatives to strengthen international support, which must aim at introducing reforms to encourage integration in world trade.
Often, however, market mechanisms, which encourage and sustain concentrations, show obvious limits and can create severe hardship in that part of the population that remains excluded from the advantages that such situations can create.
If economic concentrations are based only on the share golden value, or the optimisation of the value of the company, they will come into serious conflict with other market operators and consumers.
In banking markets, where the dominant trend is towards concentrations and the exclusive pursuit of profit, the consequences of this are easy to see.
The Cruikshank report - this is the second time I have reminded you of it, Commissioner - considers that the British banking market has a degree of concentration that is bad for the consumer.
The fact that the four largest commercial banks hold such large market shares leads to disproportionately high charges and prices and a poor supply of products and services to private and business customers.
Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament for the support it has given to the Commission's Green Paper on the review of the Merger Regulation.
Parliament clearly seems to share the Commission's objective, which is to strengthen the legislative arsenal for controlling concentrations.
Only by using up-to-date methods and instruments is it possible to face challenges such as the forthcoming enlargement, the strengthening of relations with the other competition authorities and greater international awareness of the importance of concentration control issues.
I should like here to express my gratitude to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, as well as all those who have contributed to this debate, particularly the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
The public consultation process has provided and is still providing a number of interesting and well documented opinions on jurisdictional, procedural and substantive questions raised in the Green Paper.
In my opinion, your report, Mr Berenguer Fuster, offers a very well-reasoned account of it and makes some particularly interesting observations.
You all know the high esteem in which I hold Parliament's contributions, and I can promise you that this report will be examined with the greatest attention.
On the basis of all this input, the Commission will adopt a proposal for a new Merger Regulation by the end of this year, for subsequent debate by the Council.
I consider this regulation to be part - an important part, yes, but just a part - of a package of reforms which will also include interpretative guidelines on the application of the substantial competition test - we have heard various opinions on the current dominance test and the possible alternative of the substantial lessening of competition test - which clarify in particular the procedures for analysing market influence in cases of concentration and the importance that should be attributed to efficiency considerations, which have been mentioned several times.
The draft regulation will naturally be made available for public consultation.
We also intend to come to an agreement with legal and enterprise circles on a new series of guidelines on best procedural practice, that is in the investigation of concentrations.
We must therefore think about the structural or management changes that will be needed to accompany this reform package, particularly how to take further the matter of rights of defence and the matter of strengthening our economic capacity and the role of economic analysis in our decision-making procedure.
Finally, Mr President, I should like to touch briefly on a matter that a number of Members of the House have raised this evening, which is the matter of a possible link between social policies and competition policies.
This is an issue which raises questions about the tests for assessing concentrations.
I want to be very clear on this point.
The introduction of further tests, different from those concerned with competition, in the concentration assessment system would complicate, confuse and, ultimately, risk defeating the primary function of the Merger Regulation, which is to maintain effective competition.
In no way does this mean not making employment policies a top priority.
The European Union has employment policies, the Member States have employment policies and the Commission and I myself are all for the strengthening of employment policies. Maintaining healthy competition, as has been pointed out, also encourages a growing economy over the medium to long term, and with growth comes employment.
I do think, however, that to mix up objectives and include an objective on maintaining employment in the Merger Regulation would make it less effective.
This does not mean that, when concentrations take place, the companies should not be reminded of their obligations to comply with social legislation, wherever this is required.
For our part, we want to give workers and their representatives the opportunity to express their views to the Commission during the investigation.
As I was saying, we examine the competition and, in this context, the viewpoint of dependent workers and their representatives may take on greater importance if it concerns the effects of the operation on competition.
To sum up, I believe that social legislation, which is important, and competition law, which is also important, pursue technically dissimilar goals by means of a variety of different but equally valid methods.
I am quite certain that mixing up the instruments would not benefit either policy.
I thank Parliament once again for this latest contribution to our efforts to refine the competition instrument.
The next item is the report (A5-0115/2002) by Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Fishery Resources in the South-East Atlantic Ocean (COM(2001) 679 - C5-0666/2001 - 2001/0280(CNS)).
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the creation of a new regional fisheries organisation to govern the South-East Atlantic, namely the South-East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO), and also the Community participation in this organisation.
As stated by Mrs McKenna, who I warmly congratulate on her report, the body will organise and manage an area in which the Community fleet fishes and in which we also have fisheries relations with the coastal countries.
As part of SEAFO, the Community will be able to contribute to research and to the adoption of measures to conserve stocks, applying high levels of responsible management to fishing, as laid down in the International Law of the Sea.
I would encourage the Commission and the Council to ensure that the Community participates in all the existing regional fisheries organisations and in those to be formed in future, in the interests of the Community fisheries sector, as the European Parliament requested of them in its resolution on the Green Paper.
I would like to point to two problems: the first arises from the fact that RFOs do not have a weighted voting system, so the Community is therefore disadvantaged by only having a single vote, like a micro-State that is a contracting party; and the second is the long deadlines for the transposal into Community law of the binding agreements for the Community, adopted within these regional organisations.
The administrative procedures need to be improved.
I should also like to ask the Commission to thoroughly prepare its position before attending meetings of the SEAFO and the other RFOs, by consulting the sector. This requires good communication and relations between the Commission and the industry.
I must not miss this opportunity to express my concern over an idea put forward by the Commission in its proposal for the reform of the common fisheries policy where it indicates, with regard to RFOs, that the Community should only intervene in cases of real interest to the Community fisheries sector.
What does the Commission mean by real interest?
I think this self-imposed restriction is particularly damaging to the principles of responsible fishing recommended by the Community, which the latter should advocate in all fora, in accordance with Article 174 of the Treaty, which states that the Community policy in this field will contribute to 'promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems?.
I believe that the Community's presence and leadership in the RFOs are necessary both in order to safeguard the sustainability of resources in European and non-European waters equally - as stated by the Commission itself - and in order to ensure that due account is taken of the interests of nations that practise distant-water fishing, in the same way that account is taken of the interests of coastal States.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore asks the Commission, within the SEAFO and the other RFOs, to coordinate Community policies as a whole, and vice versa, for the Commission also to coordinate all its policies to defend the interests of the Community fleet worldwide, because only in this way will European fishermen be adequately protected.
The Commission department dedicated to RFOs must therefore be given sufficient financial and human resources to be able to carry out these duties successfully.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, protecting, preserving and conserving fishery resources means respecting nature, considering our waters as a precious and irreplaceable livelihood and protecting life and biodiversity.
There is also an urgent need to ensure the survival of human activities that will disappear if our waters are brutally exploited and depleted.
No marine resource must be subjected to predatory activities, and it is therefore surprising that a maritime area as huge as the South-East Atlantic is not covered by the discipline and the management of any organisation.
We consequently welcome the Convention creating a regional fisheries organisation for this area of the Atlantic high seas, which was concluded, as a matter of fact, in April 2001 by the main coastal States and by other States with an interest.
The proposal for a decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Fishery Resources in the South-East Atlantic Ocean therefore deserves our full support.
There is also the possibility that the species covered will be highly vulnerable as a result of their biological make up and the environment in which they live.
The rapporteur, Mrs McKenna, was right to table only one amendment and, whilst making some points of criticism, to welcome the Convention.
We agree with her and thank her for her work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking you, Mrs McKenna, for your excellent report and Parliament for its sustained support for our efforts in the negotiations on the SEAFO Convention.
These efforts have paid off, for the Convention is about to be ratified by the Community.
Since we joined the negotiations on the Convention in 1997, the Community has taken an active role in them and will now be one of the first parties to ratify the Convention.
We will thus be making a key contribution to its speedy entry into force.
The progress towards this Convention was an outstanding example of positive and pro-active multilateral cooperation in the field of international fishing.
This Convention implements the latest developments in maritime law, and it is living proof of every participant's commitment to responsible fishing in a maritime region where stocks are extremely vulnerable.
In this context, I should like to emphasise three points.
Firstly, the Convention establishes a good system of monitoring and control of fishing in this region.
Secondly, it establishes a good balance in the allocation of fishing rights between coastal states and developing countries.
Thirdly, the Convention has adopted the dispute settlement mechanism provided for by international maritime law.
SEAFO thus has every chance of becoming an effective organisation for the responsible management of resources and resolutely combating illegal, unregistered and unregulated fishing, and it will be of benefit to a number of coastal states whose economies are heavily dependent on these resources.
Let me turn now to your amendment, Mrs McKenna, which the Commission can only support.
It is a fact that the UN Agreement came into force without being ratified by the Community.
The Council decision of 1998 provided for speedy ratification by the Community and the Member States simultaneously.
However, three Member States have yet to complete their internal procedures to ratify the Agreement.
This is impeding the Community's progress towards membership of the UN Agreement.
I myself have actively intervened personally in the Council and with the Member States to speed up this process.
As for your further concerns, namely that we should take account of the vulnerability of fish stocks, especially deep-water species - as you have already mentioned - within SEAFO's sphere of application, and that the Community must lobby harder for the widespread use of the precautionary approach in SEAFO's management of these stocks - these I can only endorse.
I can assure you, Mrs McKenna, that the Community will continue to take an active role in SEAFO's work.
In our Commission communication on the reform of the common fisheries policy, we made it clear that we are very keen to promote cooperation between all coastal states in the interests of sustainable and responsible fishing outside territorial waters.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0176/2002, by Mr Busk, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission report on the monitoring of the implementation of the common fisheries policy (COM(2001) 526 - C5-0008/2002 - 2002/2001(COS));
A5-0228/2002, by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on behaviour which seriously infringed the rules of the common fisheries policy in 2000 (COM(2001) 650 - C5-0197/2002 - 2002/2093(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has recently tabled a proposal for future reform of the fisheries policy and, in the light of this, the Commission's report on monitoring the implementation of the common fisheries policy, which is the subject of my report, is a very important tool.
We must draw upon all the experience garnered from the current fisheries policy so that the future fisheries policy can lead to some clear improvements.
Such improvements are necessary, moreover, for there are far too many loopholes in the present fisheries policy.
One of the most obvious examples is the MAGPs, which have neither permitted efficient monitoring of the number of fishing vessels, nor have secured either the necessary reduction in the fleet or efficient monitoring of the fleet's real capacity.
Certain Member States have neglected to comply with their obligations to inform the Commission of their vessels' catches or have only provided such information on an occasional basis during the period covered by the Commission's report.
There are, unfortunately, very big differences between one Member State and another in the way in which the conditions are fulfilled, as well as in the way in which the requirements for reporting catches to the Commission are complied with.
That is because many Member States are quite simply too slipshod about fulfilling their obligations under the common fisheries policy.
That also applies to the submission of data, the implementation of common decisions and the use of adequate resources to ensure full compliance with the common fisheries policy.
In order to ensure the implementation of a common fisheries policy, it is, quite simply, necessary to demand that the monitoring and enforcement system and the system of reporting be employed correctly in every respect in all the Member States.
It is also necessary for other reasons, particularly in order to obtain fishermen's support and respect for the policies decided upon.
Fishermen must also be left in no doubt that these policies are being implemented equally in all the Member States.
Responsibility for monitoring the application of Community legislation in accordance with Community principles naturally lies with the Member States.
There is a lot to indicate that the Member States need rather more help in fulfilling this responsibility, and it is, in the last analysis, the Community which has overall responsibility for satisfactory implementation of the legislation.
The Member States have established legal frameworks for control and have designated competent authorities within the traditions of their legal and administrative systems.
Member States have also invested fisheries inspectors with legal powers of control and the power to initiate sanction procedures. Everything ought, in this way, really to be in order.
The basis, in any case, is there as it should be, and the national authorities are in a position to enforce Community legislation. Unfortunately, we have to observe, on the basis of the Commission's report, that there are far too many differences, and that naturally makes fishermen feel they are being treated unequally within the Community.
My eye has also been caught by the observation in the Commission's report to the effect that the fisheries inspectors are not well enough trained.
Simply reading between the lines, I gather there are some fisheries inspectors who do not even know the difference between a herring and a sprat.
If I am right in thinking that this is the case, it is certainly something to be got to grips with, especially in view of the fact that the training of inspectors is partly funded by the EU.
It is, therefore, quite simply unacceptable that the Commission has seen fit to observe that there is a blatant lack of training and experience in how to conduct basic checks on compliance with applicable common rules.
It is high time that we got the Member States to give a higher priority to their obligations.
It is a question of increasing the efficiency of the way in which responsibility is exercised at national level, so that monitoring, inspection and surveillance are not - as is the case, for example, in one particular country - divided between seven authorities, meaning that no one has real responsibility.
There must be efficient follow-up of infringements, and adequate resources must be set aside to ensure that the monitoring and inspection functions are in order.
I have proposed to the Commission that a system of rewards be devised, for example in the form of extra quotas, for those Member States that comply with Community legislation. I have also, of course, proposed that tougher sanctions be imposed upon those countries that do not comply with what is required.
Commissioner, I am completely convinced that the key to success where our fisheries are concerned is in the area of control.
Mr President, there is something slightly surreal about rising this late at night to deal with infringements that took place more than two years ago and in circumstances where the Commission has already come forward with proposals for reform.
The exercise is nonetheless worthwhile for there are three main causes for concern; two are about the communication, one is about the proposal.
The first is to do with delay.
The Commission communication that should have arrived in June arrived in November.
The equivalent communication for 2001 is already more than one month overdue.
I hope that the Commission will be able to reassure the Committee on Fisheries that its appearance is imminent.
The second relates to content.
Not all the Member States reported, as required, in electronic form and the appropriate codes were not always used.
Some reports were incomplete or illegible.
One Member State did not report at all last year, although I understand it has subsequently done so.
My own perusal suggests that Member States were not entirely consistent in the way they classified infringements.
Some of the penalties appear to have been presented in aggregate form, making it difficult to identify the range imposed.
All of this is regrettable, since, as the Commission itself admits, it is impossible to draw clear, coherent conclusions.
Informal contacts with the Commission suggest that there has been better reporting for 2001.
The Committee on Fisheries hopes that they will afford a fuller and more developed analysis.
For example, the number of offences reported by Member States can only be properly understood in the context of the size of fleets involved.
I hope the Commissioner will not take it amiss if I suggest that one might expect considerably fewer offences to be reported from Austria than from some other Member States.
More generally, and even with much better data, a cautious approach must be adopted to interpretation.
Does a higher percentage of offences reported mean that a higher percentage of offences has actually been committed or that there is simply a better detection rate?
Similarly, should the fines imposed be comparable in absolute terms or only in the context of the cost of living within the Member States concerned?
Properly interpreted though, the information could be invaluable as a basis for dealing with infringements during the reform of the CFP.
There is sufficient evidence in the communication to show that a wide difference of penalties exists.
For example, in the case of falsification or failure to record data in logbooks the average in Member States appears to range from EUR 88 to EUR 16 020.
The Committee on Fisheries welcomes the fact that the Commission has addressed the issue of harmonised penalties in chapter 5 of its proposals on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources.
This brings me, however, to the third point of concern: the wording does not fully address the points in our report.
First, there is our call for the use of objective criteria in classifying and rating the types of behaviour and penalties concerned.
In this regard, we would stress the potential usefulness, properly interpreted, of the kind of data to which this report refers.
Secondly, the report calls for a uniform system of minimum penalties whereas the proposal makes no mention of a minimum.
Even in the case of a serious infringement, some types of activity may be more serious than others.
It is not unreasonable to expect that a distinction be made between a first and a repeat offence or between cases where the behaviour was clearly deliberate and where a genuine mistake was made.
What is important for justice is not that all cases are treated the same but rather that like cases are treated alike.
On these grounds and taking into account the whole doctrine of the separation of powers, it would seem unacceptable not to allow a measure of judicial administrative discretion in these respects.
With this caveat, I believe we can move a long way towards establishing a principle of equal treatment that, along with measures such as the establishment of regional advisory councils, will do much to create confidence in the common fisheries policy on the part of our fishing communities.
We look forward to the Commissioner's detailed proposals in this regard.
The Commissioner may be assured that we will scrutinise them well.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and Mr Busk on their very welcome reports, and also welcomes the two communications presented by the Commission, both concerning control.
We should also like to express - and I address this to Mr Fischler as well - our satisfaction with the progress that would be made in the area of inspection and control under the proposal for reform of the CFP adopted by the European Commission.
In this regard, we fully agree with the Commission's view that the current measures for control and compliance with standards have been insufficient to guarantee the establishment of equal conditions throughout the Union, meaning that the credibility of the CFP has been affected.
We support the proposal to create a common inspection and control structure, as requested by the European Parliament.
This will be a great step towards communitising the common fisheries policy, which we would also like to see reflected in other dimensions of this policy. It will also increase cooperation between national authorities, as demanded by the European Parliament, moving towards a common inspection structure at Community level and adopting uniform standards including on the amount of penalties.
This will make it possible to attenuate the current deficiency caused by the lack of human and material resources, which are currently limited to the sporadic control of landings.
In addition, there are substantial differences between the inspection methods of each Member State and between the penalties they apply, which leads to ineffective control.
We therefore asked, in the resolution on the Green Paper, a report for which I was the rapporteur, for a harmonised European inspection and control system applicable to all professionals, without discrimination, with a uniform system of penalty proceedings and provisions with a high level of compliance in each part of the industry.
Without this system, all the efforts towards the conservation of stocks and the rational management of fishing-grounds are destined to fail.
The control cannot be effective, however, without cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and unless the latter fulfil their obligation, as Mrs Attwooll said, to notify any infringements that take place in this area.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner to tell us, if possible, what action the Commission has taken in response to the non-compliances he describes in his communication with regard to Member States that have failed to comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 2740/1999.
I would also ask the Commissioner to tell us whether he has asked France for an explanation as to why it did not provide any information and what the response was.
As indicated by Mrs Attwooll, given these gaps it is impossible to come to a firm conclusion.
Lastly, we support the petition by my colleague Mr Busk for the Commission to draw up a catalogue of penalties that could be more effective and dissuasive, based on the experiences of the various Member States, that could serve as a guide for everybody.
We are sure that an effective, impartial system of homogenous control at European level will increase the support of fishermen for legislation on fisheries and will also increase their respect for it.
Mr President, it is clear from the excellent Attwooll and Busk reports that the systems of control and surveillance in the European Union leave a lot to be desired.
Very little has changed since I drew up my report on controls several years ago.
The application of the control regulation is extremely patchy across the Community, with some Member States applying parts of it well and other parts of it not so well.
The level of fines and penalties varies widely across the Community, despite having a common list of serious infringements.
We desperately need an EU-wide coordination of control and surveillance.
The credibility of the common fisheries policy is at stake in this area.
In other words, the Commission must be given far wider powers in this domain, as we have been saying in this Parliament for many years.
I therefore fully support the idea in the Commission's reform package to create an EU inspectorate and my group will be voting for both reports.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has been emphasised by our fellow Member Mr Niels Busk, rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries on matters concerning the monitoring of the implementation of the common fisheries policy, it is essential that the rules of the policy should be perceived by fishermen to be just, equitable and proportionate if these rules are to be observed.
As our rapporteur says, fishermen's support and respect for fisheries regulations will improve if fishermen's organisations are involved in the decision-making process.
This, Mr President, is a crucial point.
