There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a gangster, but if we are to have an international legal system, he must not be lynched, and we should not impose a collective death penalty, which hits innocent people.
Within the EU, we do not permit the death penalty for individuals even in the case of the worst of criminals.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to have an international legal system and not revert to a cross between the Middle Ages and the Wild West.
Mr President, I belong to that generation of Europeans which has always, not least because of the period of history we have lived through, seen the United States as our champion of democracy and freedom, the country which freed Italy and Europe from Nazi tyranny, the country which, for decades, led the Western democracies in the fight against the threats posed by the Soviet Union.
I am sad and concerned to see the United States now taking a path which is likely to lose it the moral leadership of the world, although it will, of course, still have political and military leadership.
Indeed, we have shifted from a firm, rational position in the face of the dangers of Arab and Islamic terrorism and the terrorism of Iraq itself to a situation of unilateral decisions, and we must realise that we cannot accept this situation without undoing decades of progress made in international law.
What will we do if, in the future, a country such as China or Russia decides it has the right to invade one of its neighbours?
Is Iraq really the most dangerous threat or is Korea not evidence of the existence of greater threats?
That is why, while confirming our great affection and esteem for the United States, we must now tell it, as its true allies and friends, that it has taken the wrong road and must stop and listen to the international community.
Furthermore, my regret is increased by the state of Europe, at the sight of a Europe divided as never before, in which the genuine problems - the lack of a political, strategic vision of the world - are starkly revealed and in which the legitimate, rightful diversities of the European countries are made worthless by their inability to agree on joint measures.
I welcome the Franco-German cooperation, although I do not support all the positions.
I welcome it because it has always been the driving force of Europe and can continue to be so in the future, but, if we do not want it to be restricted to what is quite simply irrelevant rhetoric, as has been the case thus far, it must be channelled into a position which will result in the creation of a European defence policy in the future, for only when Europe speaks with one voice will it become as influential as the United States.
Mr President, an overwhelming majority of the European public is opposed to a war in Iraq, and there is at present no occasion for such a war, other than the desire to seize Iraq's oil reserves.
A preventive war is nothing other than a deliberate and unilateral attack, something for which there is no justification in the absence of a UN mandate.
There are many who would be the losers in such a war.
The USA and Great Britain may perhaps be able to win the battles, but there is much more at stake.
One loser would be the civilised world, which is seeing a demonstration of how easy it is to displace and suspend international law, which was fought for over centuries, for the sake of a preventive war of aggression.
Mr President, in the light of the UN inspectors' report to the UN Security Council on Monday, and ten years of Iraq's deception, evasion and non-compliance with Security Council resolutions, it should be clear to everybody here that we are facing a very grave situation in the Gulf.
The starting point in this whole debate must be that we are representatives of democratic nations.
Saddam Hussein is a dictator who has no respect for democracy, for the rule of law or for the demands of the United Nations itself.
As democrats we have a responsibility to explain fully the reasons why it may be necessary to take action in order to uphold the will of the international community, which is that Saddam Hussein should unconditionally disarm.
This issue is not simply about the work of UN inspectors; rather, it is about disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction.
These weapons were there when the inspectors had to leave in 1999 - where are they now?
There has to date been no evidence of disarmament; and let us never forget: the burden of proof here must be with Saddam.
In my view, the British Prime Minister has a special responsibility to explain clearly the reasons why we must confront the threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
Sadly I must say that, to date, his own government has not been as united and clear on this issue as I feel we in the United Kingdom are entitled to expect.
We are disappointed at Mr Blair's inability to sufficiently persuade public opinion in the United Kingdom of the need to be prepared to take action, in the face of what is very clearly a real threat to the security of our people.
In the United Kingdom we have seen during the course of the last fortnight or so very clear instances of the existence of that real threat.
A collective failure to confront the gravity of the situation with unity and with determination only gives Saddam Hussein succour; not to be prepared to take action - if he continues to obstruct and to lie - would be an open invitation to any rogue state to do anything it likes and still not face serious consequences.
It would also leave the United States itself, and the United Nations particularly, weak and impotent.
Clearly, should the situation not improve in the weeks ahead, a second UN resolution may be required.
That is, however, the optimum option ahead of any military engagement in the Gulf.
Having listened to General Morillon, I take the view that the international Community still has the right to act without any such new resolution, as the powers are already vested in earlier UN resolutions.
The position of the French and German Governments in recent days, as well as many of the contributions and demonstrations that have been made in this Chamber this afternoon, clearly show that any prospect of a common foreign and security policy is fallacious.
I do not make any partisan political point on this, but we are surely fooling ourselves as European Parliamentarians if we believe that we are anywhere near developing a common foreign and security policy or anything like it - we clearly are not.
In the days and weeks ahead, we need steady nerves and an effective United Nations.
We must ensure Saddam Hussein understands that his failure to comply with the will of the international community will result in serious consequences.
Equally, we must also ensure that public opinion in the West and elsewhere understands and appreciates why we must be prepared to take action in defence of the international interest.
Political leaders must have the courage to face up to such threats; otherwise the credibility of the United Nations itself will be at stake and Saddam Hussein will have prevailed.
If the western nations had sent a stronger and more unified message to Saddam Hussein from the start and maintained their resolve, then perhaps we would not have to be contemplating military intervention today.
Mr President, there have been times in recent months when I have felt that we are conducting politics through the looking-glass, where all the norms are reversed and black has become white, so I think it is quite useful for us to get back to basics.
First of all, the United States of America is a democratic country which twice in the last century was prepared to lay down the lives of its citizens to defend peace, freedom and democracy in Europe.
Iraq is a country ruled by a dictatorship, where there is neither freedom nor democracy, and whose leaders murdered hundreds of thousands of its own citizens and is known to be a threat to peace and stability in the region.
It is not the other way round.
It is also worth remembering exactly what resolution 1441 actually says.
Paragraph 1 states that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations under UN resolutions.
Paragraph 4 states that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations.
Finally, Paragraph 13 recalls that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations.
Given Hans Blix's report, it could be argued that Paragraph 4 has already been breached.
Whatever is the case, the UN has to decide what it means by Paragraph 13 and by serious consequences.
Colleagues who have spoken are right that the future of the UN is at stake.
The UN cannot make threats without being prepared to carry them out.
The inspectors need more time and we need more information from the Americans.
But if further serious breaches are reported, resolution 1441 has to be followed through.
Failure to do so will only sanction the very illegal activity we have condemned, and it seems to me that some of the contributions today are attacks on UN resolution 1441 which we are all supporting.
No member of the Security Council should prejudge that debate; nor should they say now how they are going to vote before they see the evidence.
But we must be clear that, if a second resolution is forthcoming from the UN, we must all support it because that is what we have stated very clearly in our resolutions in this Parliament.
Mr President, everybody knows that we are currently on the brink of disaster.
The US Government, taking advantage of the terrorist acts of 11 September, is now imposing State terrorism on the entire world with the aim of establishing its economic and military domination everywhere.
Not content to allow the Palestinian people to be massacred, to allow 500 000 Iraqi children to die due to the embargo and millions of Africans with AIDS to die due to lack of care, President Bush is going to invade Iraq in order, in particular, to appropriate its oil.
Who can seriously believe for one second that the United States want to oppose a terrorist dictatorship because it fails to respect UN decisions?
We should not forget that Pinochet and Bin Laden were agents recruited and trained by the CIA, that Israel has never applied a single UN resolution and that fortunately, however, nobody is considering bombing Israel.
Human rights or profits: two weights, two measures.
That is the choice.
This war smells of oil, and the majority in this House knows it.
Without providing any support for Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, it is our duty to pass on the mass rejection of the people which will be expressed in particular in all the capital cities on 15 February in response to the Porto Alegre forum.
With or without the UN, this war is not ours.
According to estimates, it will cost almost USD 30 billion, while the UN food programme, under pressure from the United States, has just been reduced to USD 1.7 billion.
Rejecting the war by every possible means, using the sums allocated to war to eradicate poverty, and allowing the Palestinian people to live in a free State: those are the three imperatives of the moment.
Mr President, it is vitally important that the European Parliament sends a very clear message that there is no case for military action in Iraq.
Increasing numbers of people across the EU recognise that such a pre-emptive attack would be both illegal and immoral.
Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for anti-war demonstrations across the European Union.
In the United Kingdom, over 160 000 people have signed a petition against war organised by a national newspaper, the Daily Mirror.
They recognise that you cannot say you are upholding international law by breaking international law.
They know that a war against Iraq would also be hugely counter-productive - far from fighting terrorism, it is a sure-fire way to fuel terrorism.
There are alternatives and the EU has a key role to play in promoting them.
If this conflict is really about getting rid of weapons of mass destruction, there are many other routes we can take.
We need full implementation, for example, of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Five countries, including Britain, France and the United States, have been in material breach of this particular article of international law for over three decades.
The chemical and biological conventions could also be strengthened.
There are many other proposals.
There are ambitious and controversial agendas, but the EU is uniquely able to propose radical new solutions and it has a duty to do so.
Mr President, we are all agreed that every endeavour must be made to safeguard peace and that it is the duty of all of us to strive to avoid war.
I share the anti-war sentiments, but it is precisely in order to avoid war that the international community must identify with the United Nations Organisation and its decisions, thus giving authority to the role of the United Nations.
The decisions taken by the UN thus far have been very clear, Mr President, starting with the message sent to Saddam Hussein calling for the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction.
If Iraq does not respect the wishes of the international community, an armed intervention, which, of course, may only follow a UN decision, will be inevitable.
Now the ball is in the Iraqi dictator's court.
It is now up to Saddam Hussein to prove to the world that he does not have prohibited weapons.
If he genuinely wants to prevent war, he must tell the inspectors the truth.
I regret to say that, thus far, Saddam Hussein has been uncooperative towards the UN representatives, as is shown by Hans Blix's report to the Security Council which expresses clear suspicions regarding nerve gas and chemical bombs.
I quote: 'On 7th of December, 2002, Iraq submitted a declaration of some 12,000 pages ? [to] ? the Security Council. ?
Regrettably, the 12 000-page declaration, most of which is a reprint of earlier documents, does not seem to contain any new evidence that will eliminate the questions or reduce their number.'
The same applies to nerve gas.
Iraq promised that the poisonous substance had not been deployed for use as a weapon, yet UNMOVIC has managed to obtain information to the contrary: there are indications that Iraq has produced more than it declared and that nerve gas has been deployed for military purposes.
I will cite once again the report submitted to the Security Council in relation to chemical bombs: there is a discrepancy of 6 500 bombs.
I repeat: 6 500 chemical bombs remain unaccounted for.
Then Iraq has declared that it produced about 8 500 litres of anthrax, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991.
Iraq - the report continues - has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction.
There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared.
The report continues in this vein.
Today, I am pleased to say, Saddam Hussein is isolated.
In addition to this, the statement made by Mr Putin yesterday calling upon the Iraqi dictator to cooperate with the inspectors, failing which Russia would be forced to change its position, must not be underestimated.
The pressure on Saddam Hussein must be intensified.
I am therefore appealing to the Members of the European Parliament who are thinking of going to Iraq to give up their plan.
Saddam Hussein would use their mission to claim that Europe is divided and that he has some supporters in our continent.
This exploitation must be avoided at all costs.
Whether we choose war or peace now depends first and foremost on the decisions Saddam Hussein makes, and Europe must ensure that the Iraqi regime cooperates with the inspectors.
In this extremely problematic situation, Europe's duty is to use its influence to further peace.
The Union's document, approved by the Foreign Affairs Ministers the other day, is evidence that divisions can be avoided in our continent, divisions which Saddam Hussein could exploit to gain time and to create further setbacks for the United Nations.
By speaking with one voice, Europe has persuaded the United States to accept the postponement of war and has given the inspectors more influence.
The Old Continent can do a great deal to achieve peace, and this is why the initiatives being taken by the Italian Government at this time deserve our close attention and support too.
The interviews and meetings - held today, tomorrow and on Monday - could prove to be extremely significant, not least in that I believe the Italian Government is conveying messages from the other countries of the European Union.
The active quest for peace must not, however, Mr President, cause us to forget that we are all committed to safeguarding the values of freedom, tolerance and respect for human dignity, values which suffered attack on September 11.
It is not just the United States which suffered - each one of us has been affected.
Now, it is up to Saddam Hussein to prove that he is not supporting terrorism, that he has no dealings with Al Qaida and that he intends to bow to the will of the United Nations.
In short, it is he who will be responsible for what happens in the coming months.
Mr President, the High Representative started his speech this evening by saying that we must tackle this crisis from a European perspective.
All credit is due to him, but we must also acknowledge the work of the Greek Presidency, which played this card determinedly and, thus far, has obtained hitherto unhoped-for results, especially as regards the agenda and the time frames.
In this connection, I would remind you that Korea, the Middle East and Macedonia were discussed as well as Iraq, for they are all part of a very complex international situation.
I believe that Parliament will have no difficulty in supporting you, Mr Solana, on the four points you cited as European strategy. I would make it clear that, as regards the role of the United Nations, we - the Group of the European Socialists, in particular - want there to be neither excessive rigidity in the implementation of Resolution 1441 nor, should there prove to be a discrepancy between statements and reality, an automatic declaration of war.
However, to lend credibility to the desire - which you have rightly described as the desire of the majority of the European citizens - to both avoid war and be without dictators, I believe that Europe must have more confidence in itself and be more coherent and, above all, more united.
More coherent in the sense of believing more strongly in its values and showing some pride in them and more united in the sense of adopting a better thought out, consistent position.
In this regard, I would like to end with a question. Are this document, adopted on 27 January by the Foreign Affairs Ministers, and the coordination of the European Members of the Security Council an indication that the opposing Franco-German and Anglo-Spanish positions will be resolved?
Then, what will Italy - the subject of such eulogies from Mr Tajani - do when it has the Presidency?
How much continuity can there be between the Greek and Italian Presidencies, given that our Prime Minister oscillates continuously between support for President Bush and what then appears to be a preference for the European position?
Mr President, the twisted war mentality that the US administration has developed is extremely serious and warrants the increasing opposition of world public opinion.
As emphasised by the representatives of many countries at the world parliamentary forum in Porto Alegre, we must call on our leaders to firmly oppose the war and reject the concept of preventive war contained in the new strategic doctrine of the Bush administration.
The institutions of the European Union, and the governments of the Member States and candidate countries must reject all and any participation in the war against Iraq, including the use of military bases and other facilities on their territory, and reject any participation of soldiers or the provision of military and financial resources, without this implying any support for the Iraqi regime.
We must also ensure that the embargo on Iraq is ended, an embargo that has caused so much harm to the population, particularly to children.
What is particularly important are all actions demonstrating solidarity with the Iraqi people, such as visits to Iraq by delegations of Members of the European Parliament and the public demonstrations against the war and to defend peace planned for 15 February.
We must reject this unjust war, which is clearly a statement of the United States' hegemony, essentially dictated by oil interests and American and British military and industrial complexes.
Opposition to the war in Iraq is equally crucial in order to put an end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and to the aggression by Ariel Sharon's government and to attempt to achieve, by means of dialogue, a fair and lasting peace.
Our citizens want peace, so let us all work to make this possible, repeatedly expressing our protests, indignation and rejection with regard to the imminence of a new war against Iraq.
Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the overcoming of the Iraq crisis will not be helped either by the 'No War' placards on the Left of this House, or by the anti-American reflexes shared by that wing and the Members on the Right.
Faced with this crisis, none of the European Union's Member States can remain indifferent, and it should not be necessary to remind you, in this context, that the source and origin of this crisis is to be found in Iraq and not in the USA.
It is not through the USA's desire to unleash war on that part of the world that this crisis has come about, but because a despot remains in power in Iraq, and in possession of dangerous weapons of mass destruction, having already, in the past, demonstrated that he does not shrink from using them.
There are sufficient indications, my good sir, that Saddam Hussein is also pulling the strings of international terrorism and supplying it with funds.
Nor do I see it as legitimate to speak in terms of the USA and the international community, which includes the European Union, applying double standards here.
Double standards are not being applied, and asking where all the raids are to be carried out is actually out of order.
Anyone approaching this issue with a serious mind knows that North Korea may well be very dangerous, but that it calls for responses that differ from those appropriate to Iraq.
I do not think that a serious discussion is the proper place for assertions that the USA has weapons of mass destruction at its disposal and demands that it should therefore disarm.
Arguments of that sort are of no use to anyone except Saddam Hussein, whose aim is to split European and American public opinion in order to win time and secure his political survival.
If Saddam Hussein has nothing to hide, why then does he not put his cards on the table? Why does he not allow his scientists to give information without them having minders present?
Let there be no doubt about it: the key to a peaceful solution to this crisis is in Saddam Hussein's hands, and he must cooperate in the manner specified by the chief weapons inspector, Dr Blix, when he addressed the UN Security Council.
At the end of the day, too, the way in which the European Union handles this challenge will be crucial to the credibility of the plans for a common foreign and security policy, which are so much on our lips.
There is no getting away from the need for us to speak as one on this issue.
This applies not only to the Council's position on Iraq, but also, of course, to Parliament, and so I fully endorse the joint resolution that General Morillon has negotiated on behalf of our group.
We support every conceivable peaceful step towards disarming Iraq and getting it to cooperate.
We see action by the UN as having priority, and regard Iraq's build-up of rockets as a de facto breach of the UN resolutions.
We Austrians are concerned about the way Iraq is stockpiling such weapons as anthrax, and we therefore support all the political and diplomatic efforts at using channels that will bring a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
Although we Austrians attach the highest importance to a peaceful way forward, we are of course well aware of the fact that, being a small country, we cannot, at the end of the day, prevent anyone from taking military action as a last resort to secure peace and international security.
What that means for us in practical terms is that no Austrian troops will take part in hostilities, but that we will instead - in accordance with Austrian tradition - participate in maintaining peace.
It means, moreover, that aircraft will not be able to overfly Austria when taking part in hostilities, but only when taking part in action specifically authorised by the Security Council, and that the bottom line is that Austria's land and air sovereignty must be guaranteed.
It is in this sense that we have fully supported the content of the Greek Presidency's joint conclusions, and also Parliament's resolution, which we hope is the expression of a common mind, the only regrettable aspect of which is that it reflects the lowest common denominator.
I also repudiate the tendency of several Members of this House to allow themselves to be used by Iraq as propaganda tools, which contrasts with Parliament's fact-finding mission to the UN in New York.
This is an important instrument, and, if this delegation is equipped with a clear message to Saddam Hussein, it should be enabled to carry this message to Baghdad as well.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to put four questions to this Chamber.
Let me start with a photograph that I have seen in the German press, and in the French press as well; it shows the American defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld in Baghdad, shaking hands with Saddam Hussein in a friendly way.
The photograph was taken at a time when Mr Rumsfeld was President Reagan's special envoy for relations with the Middle East.
Might it be the case that, at that time, Mr Rumsfeld discussed the supply of armaments?
Let me put another question. Why will the American administration provide evidence only after 5 February?
If there were evidence that Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction, the United States of America would be under an obligation to produce such evidence at once and supply it to the weapons inspectors.
Why only from 5 February onwards?
My third question is this. Mrs Stenzel said that the measures needed to deal with North Korea were different from those that are appropriate to Iraq.
So let her tell us what they are!
Here is one state, North Korea, which announces that it is building atomic weapons. So the United States of America says, 'We shall negotiate with you.'
Another state apparently possesses weapons of mass destruction, and the response of the United States is to say, 'We are not negotiating with them; we shall declare war.'
Where is the logic in that, if that is not purely arbitrary?
Let me put my last question. Might it not be that the coalition against terrorism, so laboriously forged in the aftermath of 11 September, might be destroyed by a warlike act that had not been thought through beforehand?
Might there not be heads of Muslim states, prepared to work together with the Western community of states, but who would not be able to remain in the anti-terror coalition if there were hostilities in Iraq?
And might it not be the case that what is advocated by Mrs Stenzel and others - and obviously you, Mr Morillon, as well - might become the greatest campaign for recruiting terrorists that we have seen in recent years?
If you can answer all these questions in the negative, then you can count yourselves lucky. I fear that you will have to answer them with 'yes', and that is why my government is right to say that what this region needs is more peace, rather than war, of which it has already had enough.

(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, America is afraid.
It has been afraid since 11 September.
It has waged war on every continent.
It has little experience of war on its own soil; the last time was in the 1860s.
Therefore it is afraid, and when a country or a continent is afraid, it can make stupid mistakes.
America should listen to old Europe, this wise old lady, covered in blood and tears, the old lady that America itself came to save from dictatorship fifty years ago.
Let America listen to her!
This old lady would say: choose security through international law, bow to the decisions of the UN, agree to another UN meeting, which we must demand, for another resolution.
We know the Americans are the strongest.
We are forced to take note of it.
That is no reason to be unilateral.
That is no reason to stand firm on your own national interests alone.
It must be said that our fellow citizens can detect a strong smell of oil in this matter.
Some will say that this is untrue, but they can smell it and they know that three quarters of oil stocks are there, that America needs them, that tomorrow China will need them; they know that these stocks, these resources, must be made available for the development of our countries, certainly, but also the southern countries.
These are world stocks for everyone, and first of all also for those countries.
Lastly, a final word to young Europe, our Europe, this young girl that we are creating.
This will be her hour of truth and we must harmonise the positions of her four Member States and one candidate country that are on the Security Council.
What took place on Monday is not enough.
We should be able to coordinate our position to decide together what we are going to do with our two rights of veto in the Security Council, anticipating what might be our future.
In any case, there is no clear reason to give up, whether with regard to the meeting or the right of veto.
Mr President, the United Nations inspectors in Iraq are doing a good job.
If they find undeclared chemical or biological weapons, they have the right to destroy them.
If they do not find any, their duty is to pass on this information.
While this process is underway and provided that it produces the anticipated result, Iraq does not represent a threat to anyone.
In its current situation, it would not even dare to set off a firecracker.
There is therefore no reason to instigate a pre-emptive war.
In the next few days, the States of the European Union therefore have a pressing duty to prevent unilateral military action in defiance of international law.
Resolution 1441 excludes automatic recourse to the use of force.
It is a shame, therefore, that the ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE should have chosen to be ambiguous on this fundamental point.
Have they not read the statement from the Episcopalian conference of German bishops, which says, and I quote: 'a pre-emptive war is an attack and cannot be considered a just war'?
I do not think the bishops have been manipulated by Saddam Hussein.
Have our fellow Members in the PPE-DE not understood the churches' call to try everything to prevent a pre-emptive war which, and I quote: 'would remove all content from the principle of non-recourse to force laid down by international law and at the end of the day would weaken the whole system of the Community between the States'?
The socialists cannot express better than the bishops what they think of the war cries from the Washington hawks.
There is still time for the Christian-Democrat Members to recover, tomorrow, at the vote, and I am sure that Mr Morillon, who is a reasonable man, will use all his powers of persuasion.
Mr President, the international political climate is stormy, to say the least.
To misquote Tolstoy, it is no exaggeration to say that what we face is no more and no less than the dilemma of war or peace.
In other words what some people see as the dilemma, that is, should Saddam Hussein stay or go, is beside the point.
We are basically in the aftermath of a crisis which started back in 1979 with the Iran-Iraq war, continued with Kuwait, and is still going on today.
Former allies are now adversaries and former adversaries are now allies.
And what are we doing about it?
As the European Union, we need to act on one principle and one political commitment. The principle being that every decision must be passed by the UN Security Council and the political commitment being that we must all stand united at the UN.
Last Monday, the General Affairs Council started by defining the capabilities of the European Union; let us hope that these capabilities finally translate into policy.
We often say, when discussing Euro-American affairs, that the Americans are our allies.
Yes, they are and, as such, we supported and helped them in Afghanistan.
But every American policy does not automatically have to become European policy.
Let me ask you one simple question.
Was Clinton's policy on the Middle East, on Iraq and other countries, the same as Bush's policy?
No.
Therefore, the political autonomy of the European Union and the principles which underpin it must always be the cornerstone of mutual respect between America and Europe.
We need to answer a number of questions about crisis management.
You remember what we said about the crisis in the Middle East?
And nobody listened to us.
There is the issue of democracy in the Gulf, in Iraq and elsewhere, but this is not the time to go into that.
What I would say, however, is that the democratic changes in central and eastern Europe, where we have found new partners, did not come about by taking sides and engaging in conflicts.
They came about by backing off and improving relations and by paving the way for these countries and nations to move towards democracy.
Mr President, High Representative, almost everything has been said today.
I would like to welcome the efforts of the Greek Presidency to resolve the situation we find ourselves in.
The European Parliament will perhaps adopt a common resolution tomorrow on Iraq, a resolution which I support.
But I am appalled that the minimal consensus it reflects, which underlines the central role of the United Nations Security Council, is so timid.
Although defence and security are clearly intergovernmental matters, I believe that world peace and stability cannot be restricted to one pillar.
You have said, Mr Solana, that the overwhelming majority of Europeans are unambiguously against the war.
And we, in this Parliament, in order to safeguard European cohesion and our trans-Atlantic relations, vacillate and pay a high price, that of silence, and at times hypocrisy, since we are pretending to believe certain things.
We are pretending to believe that the non-existence of something can be proved.
We are pretending to believe that we are fighting terrorism, when there is every indication that we are going to make it infinitely worse.
We are pretending to believe that Iraq is a threat to the world, when actually it is a country on its knees.
We are pretending to believe that only that country has weapons of mass destruction, when the entire region is a powder keg.
We are pretending to believe that the 150 000 men amassed on the borders of Iraq are only there to put pressure on Saddam Hussein.
We are pretending to believe, as Mr Poignant has said, that this war does not have a terrible whiff of oil and that Bush's real objective is to return Iraq to the Iraqis.
We are also pretending to believe that democracy can be built by force on a site littered with mines and bombs.
And we are pretending to believe that we will never be accomplices in a massacre and that the UN, that arbiter of international law, will play an impartial role and is not subject to horrendous pressures.
Mr President, I am ashamed today!
Mr President, Mr Solana, war is never something inevitable that one just has to resign oneself to.
Man decides to go to war; and man can put a stop to war.
War can never be the right way to destroy weapons of mass destruction or combat terrorism.
We are on the verge of a war that would have devastating consequences for the people of Iraq, for the whole region and the whole world.
In this situation, we cannot stay silent about the legal and moral problems surrounding a war.
All politicians should analyse what a war with Iraq would lead to.
Millions of people would be forced to flee - refugees that the neighbouring countries cannot take care of.
The war could spread to Israel and Palestine, and opposition to the West could grow, resulting in more terrorist attacks.
Very great humanitarian efforts would be needed for Iraq's 23 million people.
Is it worth the cost?
The war with Iraq is not about Saddam Hussein's dictatorship or breaches of UN resolutions.
If that were the case, the USA, the UN and the EU would be involved in many wars all over the world: for example, in Saudi Arabia and Israel, to name but a few.
What it is really about is power over oil and power in the region.
The United Nations Charter permits the use of force for the preservation of peace only as a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted.
Only the Security Council can make decisions on this.
Neither the United Nations Charter nor international law permits the use of force for preventive purposes, however.
A preventive war is the law of the street, the justice of the powerful, which sweeps aside the international law on which the world is founded.
The EU must protest strongly against this.
There is no justification for Saddam Hussein's devastating politics.
His and all other weapons of mass destruction must go, even those in the USA, the UK and Israel, but we have never recommended that force be used to this end.
Give the inspectors a decent amount of time, and use the time for cooperation between the EU, the Arab countries, Russia and the UN to find a peaceful solution.
Mr President, I have a poster in front of me here which says no to war.
I am saying no to unilateral war.
I am not a pacifist - although I do not suggest that there is anything wrong with being a pacifist - but I am seriously concerned about the impact that a unilateral war against Iraq will have on the future of the world order, and the kind of world we will live in, if we do not, as a Parliament, make our position clear: unless we have international law moderated through the United Nations, we will have no law.
We cannot have the most powerful state on this earth, which regards itself as militarily invincible, deciding which target it chooses to attack, which to disarm and how and when it will launch such an attack.
That is the road to anarchy; a road which will give no security for any state on the face of this earth - least of all the small state which I represent here in this Parliament.
War is a failure of politics.
The United Nations has an opportunity - as is made clear by the inspectors who have reported to it this week - to peacefully disarm Saddam Hussein if they are given enough time and providing Saddam Hussein pro-actively cooperates with them.
We are talking about giving time to the inspectors; we are not talking about allowing Saddam Hussein to maintain - assuming he has them - weapons of mass destruction.
I take a dim view of the attempt by Mr Watson, the leader of the Liberal Group, to demean the motives of myself and my colleagues in travelling to Baghdad this weekend to try to persuade whatever authorities we have the opportunity to meet there to cooperate actively with the inspectors and, indeed, to see first-hand the impact which sanctions are having, particularly on the children of Iraq.
Finally, I know that time is up but I wish to make two short points.
No link has been made in the inspectors' report to international terrorism.
No evidence has been found which establishes that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction - the contrary in fact.
We must give the inspectors more time.
Mr President, war is a grave thing.
Erasmus said that war is sweet to those who do not know it.
I believe we must condemn those who employ hypocrisy, double standards, half truths and total distortions in order to take us to war.
It is unacceptable to hear prominent speeches which, rather than promoting a genuine fight against terrorism, that is, against Al Qaida, disseminate fallacies about supposed ideologies of power and domination which are equated with militarism, when at the same time the speaker boasts of having the best army in the world.
A little self-analysis on the part of those who accuse the Iraqi dictator of representing a world of constant alarm and chaos would reveal who really represents an ideology of power and domination and who provokes constant alarm in the world.
Nevertheless, I believe we should be pleased to see the continuous growth within the Member States of a movement rejecting war, and positions such as that of General Schwarzkopf who, taking the approach of Erasmus, has just accused the Minister for war, Rumsfeld, of undervaluing the army and of relishing the idea of going to war, or such as that of the Democrat Senator Joseph Biden, who has accused Bush of promoting the greatest wave of anti-Americanism for 30 years.
Furthermore, the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has just said that he is in favour of peace but that he cannot share the responsibility for backing down in the face of those who threaten our security, freedom and democracy.
I believe that, with sophisms of this type, it is we who endanger our freedom, our democracy and our principles and of course our security, because a society which allows lies and distortions in order to dominate the oil market and indulge in strategic whims of an imperialist nature weakens itself in the medium term and thereby jeopardises its cohesion and security.
Mr President, if the European governments are unable to arrive at a common position - and the Greek Presidency's painstaking efforts here do it credit - then we must raise a loud, clear, united voice in the European Union against this war for oil and against unilateral intervention which flies in the face of international law, the resolutions passed by the UN and global public opinion.
Yes, Mr Solana, we must give the UN inspectors what they are asking for: time, money, resources and information.
We must give peace another chance.
Unfortunately, war and violence are your preserve, the preserve of the men who rule in the decision-making centres, while the victims of war are mainly women and children.
We in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have repeatedly emphasised the need for conflicts to be resolved by peaceful means.
War with Iraq will not only signal the resounding failure of diplomacy and policy, it will also mean that we have betrayed our values and our culture.
It will mean that old Europe has no new, alternative standard to raise against the philosophy and culture of violence being promoted by the USA.
The rulers of Europe have a huge responsibility at this crucial stage.
Mr President, I have the justifiable suspicion that with regard to this Iraq crisis, Prime Minister Aznar has made secret commitments of a military nature to the Bush administration.
I can provide the European Parliament with proof of this in the form of a series of significant public statements by Prime Minister Aznar in Spain, in which he demonstrates through the media his unconditional support for Bush, including for a unilateral attack.
Does this attitude show loyalty to the European Union?
Is this position which breaks European consensus loyal?
Are these televised comments by Aznar in which he states that he will back Bush unconditionally in a unilateral attack loyal?
Are they loyal, given that we know that that would violate international law and the United Nations Charter?
I would also like to make it clear, Mr President, that not even his own country supports him in this, and that it does not support these positions.
The enormous majority of Spanish society is against a unilateral attack.
Spain opposed the unilateral attack on Libya and on Panama at the time and now it fully supports the common European position.
Representatives of the Council and the Commission, has Prime Minister Aznar informed you of his unconditional unilateral support for Bush?
With regard to Mr Galeote's recommendations, they would be cynical if they are not first applied to Aznar.
Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the many honourable Members who have accompanied me during this sitting for their tenacity and perseverance.
Thank you.
I would like to speak briefly, without exceeding the time allotted to me, to explain various issues.
Firstly, there can be no doubt that this is a difficult debate.
It is a debate which goes to the heart of the European Union's foreign policy and beyond. We have a new world situation which may undoubtedly have consequences for the future which are hard to predict today.
But I would like to say that we must not indulge in a sort of pessimism about the European Union's inability to reach common positions.
We are talking about such serious issues as war and peace.
We are talking about something extremely grave; life or death.
And it is therefore natural that so many Members of Parliament have spoken in very different ways and that the governments have also at times said so many differing things.
Hence the first consequence; it will be very difficult to take a decision on war and peace, on life and death, by means of a vote on one particular day.
Peace and war, life and death, belong to the States and one State will never be prepared to allow another State to impose on it the obligation to go to war or, conversely, to impose that obligation to go to war on another.
I say this within the context of the European Union.
On the second issue, I believe that if we cast our minds back to the end of August and the beginning of September of last year, I believe that the majority of Members of this honourable Parliament thought, with fear or horror, that we were at the beginning of a unilateral action against Iraq.
There was pressure, very significant pressure from many countries, the majority of countries of the European Union.
And we should also recognise the courage of the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, at that time.
Amongst all of us we managed to ensure that that operation, which appeared to be under way, was brought within the context of the United Nations.
And in September of that year the Iraq dossier, which was kept outside the United Nations Security Council, outside the framework of the United Nations, was brought to the United Nations.
And for seven long weeks Resolution 1441 was debated.
All of this action was unquestionably led by European countries in order to achieve a unanimously approved Resolution.
It has been a long time since a resolution of such importance has been approved unanimously, and countries such as Syria, for example, and a few days later, as I said at the beginning, the Arab League, the Arab countries, unanimously supported the content of Resolution 1441.
I do not believe that the Europeans are the only people responsible for Resolution 1441, but it would be pessimistic for us not to say that we have been very instrumental in the existence of Resolution 1441.
So let us reassess our feelings of pessimism or optimism: our actions have been significant and they continue to be so.
Resolution 1441 obliged the inspectors, Dr Blix and Mr ElBaradei, to produce a report.
They were kind enough to speak with the President of the European Parliament yesterday by videoconference.
The Members of this Parliament are well informed about what Mr Blix thinks.
You have an in-depth knowledge of what he thinks, not only from what he has said in public, but also from what he said in that videoconference.
And all the honourable Members of this House know that Dr Blix, a great European by the way - as he said himself yesterday ?and a man who believes in the values of Europe, spoke to you yesterday with a degree of pessimism in his heart.
This pessimism was not the result of ignorance, since he is a wise man, who has worked on the inspection of weapons of mass destruction for many years.
He was somewhat pessimistic because he recognised that there had not been the cooperation he had hoped for.
He had hoped, with his skill, his experience and generosity, for greater cooperation.
So, the first consequence we have in our hands, the first report, is a report which does not satisfy us in terms of the cooperation between Saddam Hussein and his regime and the inspectors.
But despite all of this, we must continue and we have therefore asked the countries of the European Union to give all possible assistance to the inspectors.
And I insist: what kind of assistance can we give?
There are three types: assistance in terms of time, giving them more time; material assistance, giving them more resources if they need them; and assistance in terms of information and intelligence.
Another achievement yesterday was that the evidence in existence which was not being distributed beyond a certain number of people, some of them amongst Dr Blix's colleagues, will now be discussed on 5 February within the United Nations Security Council.
The United Nations Security Council is still, therefore, the centre of gravity of the debate, and I believe that the countries of Europe have had a hand in this, not in every respect, but to a very considerable extent.
There is therefore a dynamic of pressure which must be maintained - and the inspectors are asking us to maintain it ? and at the same time a political dynamic in the debate taking place in the Security Council, which will take time.
There will be other sittings and no doubt this Parliament will analyse within a few days the reports which will be produced in the United Nations Security Council.
On the 14 February there will be a second report from the inspectors and we will see how the situation is developing.
As the honourable Members may imagine, I am in constant contact with many people, with many important countries in the Security Council, and with non-European countries and non-members of the Security Council.
The honourable Members will remember, because you follow this issue as closely as I do, that a few days ago in Ankara there was an important meeting of the most significant Arab countries.
I would urge you to read the declaration which emerged from that meeting.
That declaration is not so different from the European Union's declaration on Monday, quite the contrary, although it is perhaps less forceful.
We are therefore working in the right direction.
Will we achieve a good outcome?
We will see, but we have a political dynamic which nobody would have expected a few months ago.
We must therefore continue working, continue cooperating in this way with the other members of the Security Council, we must continue working with the other countries and amongst ourselves so that, at the end of this journey, we may have, as I said at the beginning, a solution to this extremely serious conflict.
Because there is absolutely no doubt that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is going to be the great issue which we Europeans are going to have to deal with in the coming years and we will have to genuinely take on board the importance of this issue.
And I believe that we are sometimes not sufficiently awake to the possible consequences of this, but I hope that in this case it is resolved and that the solution is a good one.
In any event, for my part, I will always be prepared to appear before this Parliament, however many Members are in attendance, in order to try to move forward and overcome the difficulties facing all of us at this historic moment for good or for bad.
Let us hope that it is for good.
I have received six motions for resolutions
The European Parliament must speak out clearly against war as a means of disarming Iraq, because the vast majority of our citizens is against it.
The UN has shown the way: by forcing disarmament through inspections and demanding answers to the inspectors' questions.
All further action must take place within the framework of the UN.
Human rights remain a dead letter in other countries as well; other countries also have weapons of mass destruction - Iran, Pakistan, North Korea and India for example.
It is inconceivable that a superpower would be able to unilaterally solve the problem by military means.
The fact that Iraq has been weakened by the Gulf War ten years ago and has oil wells does not justify making an exception to this.
There are many other problems waiting to be resolved, such as the Palestine issue, the Middle East, Kashmir and so on.
It is not only the Kurds in Iraq who are waiting for recognition of their rights as a people, but also those in Syria, Turkey and Iran.
The pressure on Saddam must be maintained until the regime falls or conforms with the international rule of law.
Arming a dictator, as the Russians and the Americans but also the British, French and Germans did with Saddam during his war with Iran, is costly in the long term.
The road to a durable peace must be coupled with disarmament and development.
The oil in Iraq changes nothing.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the withdrawal of North Korea from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Mr Yiannitsis, the President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor to make his statement.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is deeply concerned about developments on the Korean peninsular over the last three months.
The entire international community must make every possible effort to stop any action which will give the peninsular a nuclear capability, to restore the sunshine policy between North and South Korea and to ensure that North Korea continues to integrate smoothly into the international community.
I believe the High Representative, Mr Solana, referred at the last session to consultations over the telephone with China, Japan, South Korea and the USA, following the escalation of tension.
The European Union is ready and waiting to offer its good services to support the negotiations currently under way.
However, it is not prepared to allow anyone to challenge the international framework for the control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
We believe that nuclear weapon programmes pose a serious threat to both world peace and the fragile environmental balance, be they for peaceful purposes or other, uncontrolled uses which, unfortunately, do not exclude the possibility of their being traded.
I should like to start with the parameters and background to the problem, so that we all come at this from the same starting point.
In pursuing its current nuclear weapons programme, North Korea has broken every international agreement to which it is party, either implicitly or explicitly, and in stating that it is entitled to do so, it has failed to honour its obligations under at least four agreements, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency's Safeguards Agreement, the North-South Joint Declaration on Nuclear Disarmament and the framework agreement which, if violated, undermines the agreed KEDO framework on oil supplies.
North Korea has ignored international demands and specific suggestions that it clearly and openly abandon its nuclear weapons programme and has exacerbated the situation by reacting to the halting of oil shipments under the KEDO agreement, which does not allow it to receive oil and run a nuclear weapons programme at the same time, by expelling the IAEA inspectors and reactivating its nuclear facility.
Finally, it replied to the Agency's demand for inspectors to be readmitted by announcing that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is a most unfortunate and worrying development. Especially at a time when, from what it said, the United States was willing to talk.
The European Union has issued a series of statements expressing its deep concern about these developments. It has called for North Korea to reverse its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty immediately and to readmit the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and has also stated that it undertakes, mainly in agreement with the USA but also in collaboration with the most closely affected countries in the region, to work towards a peaceful solution.
Our aim is to resolve the problem as quickly as possible, which is why yesterday's General Affairs Council discussed recent developments in North Korea and international efforts to alleviate the situation and find a solution, and what preconditions would attach to its sending a high-level Union mission to Pyongyang.
Yesterday's meeting agreed in principle that a mission was a good idea, with almost everyone emphasising the importance of involving North Korea in the whole procedure at the highest possible level, including ?im Jong-il personally.
It was decided that the preconditions, timing and composition of the mission would be determined in the immediate future and that, in the meantime, close contacts would be maintained with the main protagonists and our main counterparts.
I think that, if we want to work within this framework towards a peaceful solution, one of the basic things we have to do is to take account of North Korea's security concerns and try and reassure it on this count by offering the necessary guarantees.
The international community needs to focus on normalising relations between North Korea and the countries in the region as a whole and efforts in this direction need to be stepped up, without overlooking the fact that its citizens need support in their daily struggle to survive in the face of a shortage of energy resources.
A policy of persuasion, accompanied by measures to respond to North Korea's needs and concerns and find a way of allowing it to back down without losing face, will be the most effective way forward.
For its part, North Korea must understand that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency's Safeguards Agreement serve the wider interests of every country and every nation and must be respected by one and all.
We support the Agency and the resolutions it has passed on this issue.
Developing nuclear weapons is not an effective defence policy.
Developing peaceful and open mutually beneficial cooperative relations with every country in the world is, I think, a much more effective policy and this is the approach adopted by the European Union, which has a history of good relations with North Korea.
We again call on North Korea from this tribune to reconsider its decision and honour all its obligations under its international commitments.
May I also say that we are pleased with the approach to this issue taken by the international community, which has remained firm and united in a bid to achieve its common purpose.
The European Union is determined to continue sending humanitarian aid to North Korea and the Union bodies responsible are continuing to discuss ideas as to what future part the Union can play in supporting a peaceful solution.
We expect and encourage any action predicated on maintaining democratic principles throughout the world; as history has taught us in many countries and regions in the world, there lies the way to economic development and peaceful international relations.
Mr President, just three years ago we all hoped that the Korean peninsular could look forward to a much better future.
North Korea, traditionally isolated from just about every other country and consistently hostile to South Korea, had for some years been in very severe economic difficulties and eventually Pyongyang was forced to call upon the international community for assistance with food and medical supplies and for help in tackling the effects of a series of disastrous floods.
The international community responded and, in the wake of that, the mood of the regime in Pyongyang seemed to soften, raising the prospect of some change, however slow.
In South Korea, the election of Kim Dae-jung as president in the late 1990s meant that the economic crisis there was tackled effectively and also resulted in efforts to implement the sunshine policy of trying to achieve normalisation of relations with North Korea.
The summit meeting in Pyongyang in 2000 between President Kim Dae-jung and North Korea's Chairman Kim Jong-il encouraged hopes of further constructive developments.
Against that background, the majority of our Member States who had not already done so established or restored diplomatic links with North Korea and agreed to increase assistance, with a promise of more, if North Korea continued its cautious opening to the outside world.
The high level EU visit led by Prime Minister Goran Persson to Pyongyang in May 2001 was regarded as a further important step that reinforced our nascent dialogue concerning, inter alia, human rights, and brought from North Korea a promise of a continued moratorium on missile testing.
Since then, however, progress has not been so evident.
Political level contact between North Korea and South Korea continued, as did family reunions and business contacts, but the promised second summit did not take place.
Hopes of reconciliation are kept alive, but the patrol boat clash last summer shows how fragile those hopes are.
With the visit of Prime Minster Koizumi to Pyongyang last August, Japan also took a major step forward in opening up dialogue about normalising relations, nearly sixty years after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea.
But the admission by Chairman Kim Jong-il that over the years Japanese citizens had been kidnapped and that, tragically, some of the abducted people had died in North Korea understandably caused emotional reactions in Japan.
All that has generated justified concern, but it is the deterioration in the relationship with the United States that has generated most worry.
The initial determination of the Bush administration not to follow the policies of President Clinton in relations with North Korea fed Pyongyang's suspicions that the United States was implacably hostile.
The antagonisms have obviously been increased by the discovery last November that North Korea has been carrying out a covert programme of uranium enrichment in violation of the engagements it undertook in 1994 under the agreed framework, when the Korean Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) was set up to ensure that nuclear energy supplies to the DPRK under international supervision reduced the risk of war.
We all, I am sure, share anxiety about the developments over the past two months.
North Korea is now the only country ever to have left the non-proliferation treaty.
It expelled the IAEA inspectors and said it was restarting plutonium production at Yongbyong.
Clearly, if North Korea begins to process significant quantities of plutonium for military use, the situation would deteriorate quickly and seriously.
That reality is understood by all our partners and, of course, not least, the United States.
This is not however just an issue between the DPRK and the United States.
It is a regional issue which carries grave risks for both Korea and Japan.
It is also a crisis with global impact in terms of the non-proliferation worries which it raises.
Clearly, if the situation worsens, there are likely to be adverse economic effects on the global economy including the European Union.
The development crisis therefore calls for common efforts by the main partners to find a diplomatic solution which can satisfy the demands of the international community, including the European Union, that North Korea must return to conformity with the non-proliferation treaty and which also gives North Korea the assurance that it will not be attacked by the United States.
Plainly, if the international community is once again willing to help North Korea to address its enormous internal problems of shortages of energy, food and all other basic needs, this could also assist to get the country out of the crisis.
But it is also clear that the European Union is not a major participant in the affairs of that region.
We are of course a significant participant; we have provided nearly 300 million euros in different types of aid to the DPRK since the mid-1990s.
Our most significant contribution politically is our participation in the KEDO, where we are board members together with the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan, and contribute 20 million euros annually.
The European Union has also consistently been involved as a humanitarian donor - a role that was symbolised most recently by the 9.5 million ECU emergency food aid package for nursing mothers.
This is assisted and delivered through the World Food Programme, as much of our humanitarian food assistance has been over the years, and the conditions for doing this are very clearly spelt out in a way that creates very tight monitoring procedures.
The European Union, for this and other reasons, has some credibility vis-Ã -vis the DPRK.
We can consequently raise the question of whether the European Union can find an effective role in persuading the DPRK to see reason and back down from its current threatening posture and in helping to promote a diplomatic solution, particularly in a way that helps the United States and the DPRK to get back to dialogue and negotiations.
Those were among the issues discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council last Monday, when foreign ministers decided to give a mandate to the Presidency to organise a high level visit to the DPRK.
The timing, composition of the delegation and modalities are to be decided later and preparations for such a visit can now be undertaken.
A clear condition, however, is that the delegation must be received by Chairman Kim Jong-il.
Naturally, in our contact with the DPRK, we will not lose sight of the need for that country to address the human rights abuses that also add to the problem of the dialogue.
I can report that our South Korean friends have pressed strongly for an EU initiative and there has been general encouragement from other partners.
The timing of such a visit must however be decided only after careful consultation with the partners concerned and when we are certain that our delegation will be received at the highest level.
Plainly, we also need to prevent a wedge from being driven between the efforts of the international community to counter the recent DPRK decisions.
Further contact may therefore be needed with our closest allies and the United States in this case in particular.
As the situation develops, the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed.
In the meantime, we hope for the continued and valued support of Parliament in our efforts to foster temperate and constructive attitudes on all sides.
I would end by saying that the world is not in acute need of more conflicts.
Mr President, I have been the co-author of two resolutions in quick succession with Jas Gawronski and Jacques Santer, who are experts on this very isolated country.
North Korea presents one of the most threatening humanitarian crises and military flashpoints on the globe.
Run by a vain and maverick dictator, Kim Jong-il, whose disastrous Stalinist economic policies have brought the country to its knees, the DPRK is now resorting to nuclear blackmail and dangerous brinkmanship with the world community, in breach of the 1994 framework agreement and other previous binding international agreements.
Mr Kim has chosen to withdraw from the NPT and to expel IAEA inspectors, and threatens to reactivate his nuclear weapons programme by switching on the Yongbyong nuclear power station, ostensibly to generate electricity, but no-one is really fooled by this as it is really a source of weapons-grade plutonium for him.
Rather than feed his people, he has chosen to maintain one million men under arms, with an immoral diversion of food and resources to the military, irrespective of the sufferings of the civilian population, many of whom are rotting in political re-education camps or dying of starvation.
North Korea remains a failing, rogue state and a very dangerous one at that.
It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it is technically still at war, and it has ten thousand artillery pieces aimed at Seoul.
I am at a loss as to why out-going President Kim of South Korea is so flattering about his Pyongyang counterpart.
I suppose the sunshine policy requires a very sensitive approach to such a strange man who has just rebuffed the South's special envoy, Mr Lim, who returned empty-handed yesterday from his trip to the North.
Also, our so-called ally Pakistan needs to consider the consequences of its actions in its alleged provision to North Korea of uranium enrichment technology in exchange for help in weaponising its Ghauri-2 long range missiles with nuclear warheads by adapting North Korean Nodong missiles.
Already many are suspicious of the genuineness of Pakistan's commitments in its war against terrorism and the disappearance of the records of Pakistan's relations with North Korea is worrying.
There are also suspicions that both countries are helping Iran's covert weapons proliferation programme.
The international community must close ranks against this rogue state and stop it becoming a nuclear proliferator if it is not one already, not only because of the threat posed to the South and the 37 000 US troops stationed there, but also the 40 million civilian South Korean population.
It also has a track record, no doubt worsened by its desperate self-inflicted poverty, of exporting arms, including weapons of mass destruction, to any willing buyer irrespective of the danger posed to world security.
In this respect, China and Russia, for once, have a common agenda with the West in preventing a nuclear arms race in the region, which will quickly spread to the South Korean part of the peninsula and to Japan, with very dangerous consequences for the whole world.
The EU must assess the situation carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid.
It must also, however, send a very clear and strong signal to North Korea - which, rather surprisingly, listens carefully to our pronouncements - that it will not tolerate nuclear blackmail in the event of UN sanctions.
It must also urge strongly against any further provocative testing of ballistic missiles over Japan, as happened a couple of years ago, or moving the sealed spent nuclear fuel rods which are currently sitting in water tanks, which therefore would effectively show that they are very serious in their intent to progress to manufacturing plutonium weapons.
The DPRK cannot pursue a policy of ignoring the collective will of the United Nations and must cease its nuclear proliferation immediately.
Mr President, while the entire world is currently focussed on Iraq and the Chamber was full when we talked about it just now, it is the case that the attitude of North Korea is perhaps more worrying and that the danger it poses is very real.
I do not have many real differences with our fellow Members from the PPE-DE on this issue.
North Korea is withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, refusing inspections by the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and re-launching its nuclear programme.
And what are we doing?
Are we going to threaten war?
No!
Thank goodness for that and I am glad to see such wisdom.
I entirely agree with the motion for a resolution.
I would like to highlight three points from it.
The first point relates to Pakistan's role in this issue.
Pakistan is one of our supposed allies, an American ally, which, solely due to the fact that it claims to be fighting terrorism, could, furthermore, without anyone taking any notice, provide North Korea with enriched uranium.
We find this completely unacceptable and it should be condemned.
Secondly, I welcome the decision of the Council and the Commission to also view the North Korean problem from a humanitarian perspective.
From a humanitarian perspective without cutting humanitarian aid, but also trying to find other solutions to the problem of energy, which is a very serious problem in North Korea.
Finally, the point which is probably closest to our hearts, which is dialogue.
We believe it is urgent that we initiate dialogue between the seven major powers, which are the European Union, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, North Korea and South Korea, on economic, security and peace issues.
I believe that it is really this firm dialogue which could lead to a solution to the issue.
Mr President, only two weeks ago North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it had been a party for 17 years.
This decision was made in a climate of international uncertainty, especially when weapons of mass destruction are concerned.
The threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons is grave and we are currently balancing on the brink of war in Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states.
The North Korean withdrawal is not only a threat to regional stability.
Destabilising the Korean peninsula would have more far-reaching consequences.
Neighbours in far-off countries alike have an interest in making North Korea change its mind.
Besides displaying a lack of respect for international security, the North Korean decision also shows complete disregard for the well-being of an already impoverished population.
Human suffering in North Korea is immense.
Every human right is being violated, including the most fundamental of all: the right to live.
In the past eight years, more than two million people have starved to death in North Korea.
More will suffer the same fate if donors feel forced to restrict aid as a direct consequence of North Korean withdrawal from the NPT.
A concerted effort by regional partners and international organisations is the best way forward.
China, Japan and South Korea along with the United Nations, the EU and the United States should be active in seeking a solution.
The recent resumption of talks between North and South Korea demonstrates that dialogue is possible.
Some groups here have worked together to table a joint resolution expressing a reaction to the current situation in North Korea.
Together we share the view that the North Korean position is untenable.
Besides condemnation and calls for a change of course, we have underlined the need for dialogue and repeated our position on human rights.
North Korea must change its decision for the sake of regional and international stability as well as its own people.
Our joint resolution sends out a clear signal from the vast majority in the Parliament that condemns the current situation and state of affairs in North Korea, but at the same time suggests a course of action which, given the right amount of commitment, could remedy the problem.
Mr President, US President Bush branded North Korea as part of an axis of evil with Iraq and Iran.
These unwise words evidently caused North Korea to believe they were on George Bush's hit list.
The proliferation of nuclear weapons in east Asia opens up an appalling vista.
This is potentially a much more serious conflict than that in Iraq.
Already last October, the government of North Korea was reportedly running a secret uranium enrichment programme in blatant violation of the KEDO Agreement.
In December, North Korea cancelled its membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, expelled the International Atomic Energy Authority weapons inspectors and announced that it would reactivate a nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant producing weapons grade material.
I believe, however, that KEDO was ill designed from the start, neither addressing North Korea's immediate energy needs, nor delivering technology adaptable to the country's infrastructure.
The developments on the uranium enrichment programme led the European Parliament in October last year to freeze the EUR 20 million EU contributions to KEDO for 2003, and the US administration to stop its oil supplies to North Korea under the KEDO Agreement.
It is now inconceivable that Commissioner Patten, as he himself has acknowledged, could come to the European Parliament and request money from the EU funds for nuclear transfers.
Even if he assures this House that the funding will be used for the non-nuclear components of KEDO, the transfer of such technology is now so evidently dangerous that a complete review of KEDO, deleting the nuclear technology transfers, is necessary.
I would ask the Commission to respond to this point in particular, and to ensure that the money be spent on a proposal to provide clean energy from North Korea's electricity plants, by reconstructing its ancient conventional energy plants so as to make them efficient, by contributing to the proposed gas pipeline from Irkutsk as well as developing the great potential in Korea for wind and solar energy, bio-mass and geothermics.
Mr President, the whole world pays homage to the 'Sun of the 21st century', the successor to the 'Great Leader'.
He only has to threaten and the heads of government come begging for concessions on bended knees.
This is the vague picture of his absolute rule that millions of North Koreans get.
How do we find a sensible answer to the real threat from this tyrannical Sun King?
The regional leaders appear not to have the power, the will or the opportunity they need to free themselves from the threat of North Korea.
On the other hand, one cannot expect the Americans to solve this global problem alone.
The Security Council is the organ designated to act in this case.
Section 7 of the Charter states that the Council should adopt a resolution that contains clear steps towards de-escalating this dangerous conflict.
The first objective of the EU delegation to Pyongyang must therefore be to bring about discussions with the UN rather than the US.
Mr President, I am pleased to see that both the countries of the European Union and Parliament have achieved a common position on the subject of Korea with less difficulty than they had with regard to Iraq.
I believe that this is proof that the threat of North Korea to world security is seen as greater and more real, as, moreover, both Commissioner Patten and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have said this afternoon.
Clearly, there can be no possibility of military action to destroy nuclear plant in Korea.
In his account of the facts with which we who are concerned with these issues are already quite familiar, the Commissioner mentioned a possible US attack.
I feel that this is to be completely excluded, for it could lead to war, possibly even nuclear war, on the Korean peninsula.
Therefore, unlike in the case of Iraq, here, a peaceful approach is the only possible way forward, and that could take two forms: the isolation of North Korea or diplomacy and an attempt at dialogue.
The United States, which favoured isolation at the start of the crisis, now appears to lean more towards dialogue.
I believe that this is the opinion even of those Members who were here just now but have just left the House holding up placards saying 'No to war', not realising that, in doing so, they are making war more likely.
Every initiative which supports Saddam Hussein's cause makes him more stubborn and less inclined to bow before our requests and pressure.
Now, there are two mistakes we must avoid in negotiations with North Korea.
Firstly, we must not fall into the trap laid by Pyongyang, which is trying to create a division between the United States and South Korea, an attempt which is furthered by the fact that north-south relations have not been very good for some time, to the extent that the outgoing President was moved to describe Kim Jong-Il as a very astute man whereas, judging from what he has done with his country and the way his people, the population live, one might be induced to think the opposite.
Secondly, we must not give other countries, other potential Kim Jong-Il-style dictators - and they do exist - the impression that one only has to violate the non-proliferation treaties in order to be rewarded with support and assistance from the United States.
There must, however, be two indispensable conditions in our negotiations with North Korea.
Firstly, we cannot tolerate the existence of a nuclear weapons programme in that country.
Secondly, any agreement must lay down exceedingly rigid, pervasive control measures to prevent North Korea from taking us for a ride once again.
On this basis, the conference we propose in our joint motion for a resolution would be extremely useful as a European Union initiative.
Mr President, in my capacity as chairman of the ad hoc delegation on North Korea, I am naturally shocked by the attitude of North Korea, which, having subscribed to the sunshine policy inspired by President Kim Dae Jung and supported by the European Union, has reneged on its international commitments by withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and expelling the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
We strongly condemn these decisions by North Korea, just as we should equally strongly condemn the decision of the Pakistani Government which provides the technology for the enrichment of uranium.
On the other hand, we recall that our policy has always been, and still is, aimed essentially at the promotion of peace, stability and economic development in the region.
If these objectives are to be shared by North Korea, we strongly urge the parties to engage in constructive dialogue.
In order to fulfil the conditions for this dialogue, I believe it is essential that North Korea state that it is prepared to entirely respect its obligations in accordance with the international treaties and that it is returning to the course it itself traced two years ago.
I entirely agree with the proposals of the Council and the Commission aimed at continuing humanitarian aid and providing the technical assistance necessary for the operation of coal mines in order to provide that country with the energy it so cruelly lacks.
It is also an important element in terms of the dismantling of the nuclear programme.
These are all clear signs that the international community does not intend to isolate or marginalise North Korea.
On the contrary, it is up to the North Koreans to understand the substance of our message.
I have received six motions for resolutions
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 59th UNHCR meeting to take place in Geneva from 17 March 2003 to 25 April 2003.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have this opportunity to report to you on how the Community is preparing for the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
One of the aims of the Greek Presidency is to step up the human rights dialogue between the European Parliament and the Council.
The conclusions adopted by the Council on 10 December 2002 contain recommendations on closer cooperation between us, in a bid to bring about a more open and transparent European human rights policy, and I should like to outline the basic principles which underpin this policy and shape the Union's overall approach to what we all agree is an extremely important and sensitive issue.
On 25 June 2001, the Council reaffirmed its commitment to promoting the European human rights policy and the policy of democratisation in third countries and issued a series of basic principles designed to bring about a more creditable, coherent, consistent human rights and democratisation policy.
We need consistency between Community action and the common foreign and security policy as well as development policy through close cooperation and coordination between the competent bodies of the European Union.
We need to integrate and mainstream human rights and fundamental freedoms into all EU policies and actions. We need openness of our human rights and democratisation policy through a strengthened dialogue with the European Parliament and the civil society and we need regular identification and review of priority actions in the implementation of this policy.
The European Union has a long history and has managed to create an area of legal security and inviolable freedoms of which we are rightly proud.
Our aim at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to incorporate the codified acquis communautaire on human rights and fundamental freedoms, as contained in the European Charter, into the Treaties.
We hope that this will respond to our citizens' expectations and increase their level of protection.
The clearer and more unequivocal our absolute respect for human rights inside the Union, the more creditable and persuasive our foreign policy on these issues will be, and we shall be able to demand more effectively that all members of the international community abide, if not by all, then at least by the basic principles and values which give man and society their dignity.
As you know, abolishing the death penalty and torture, combating discrimination against women and protecting children from exploitation are our main lines of approach.
Respect for these principles must inform all aspects of the Union's foreign policy, even if there is an economic or political price to pay.
This approach will guarantee our credibility.
Ladies and gentlemen, before detailing the preparations we are making for the meeting in Geneva, I should like briefly to recount the results of last year's meeting, to give you an idea of the challenges facing us in March and April.
As you know, last year was a trying time, due in part to the composition of the Commission, some of the members of which have a poor track record in human rights.
It was also the first time the United States was absent from the Commission and the Middle East dominated the discussions and overshadowed every other initiative.
European motions on Iran, Chechnya and Zimbabwe were thrown out for the first time in the Commission's history.
I should point out that, apart from the return of the United States, the composition of the Commission is more or less the same as last year.
I should also like to point out that the way in which the Human Rights Commission functions reflects the complicated and difficult power struggles with which we have to work.
This became clear during last year's elections in the Commission, when the calming and stabilising role of the European Union demonstrated the value of a sober but pragmatic European approach, defusing the tension and circumventing a painful and dangerous impasse.
Nor must we forget that this situation may be complicated in the immediate future by the prospect of unilateral intervention in Iraq, the worsening situation in the Middle East and the possible rekindling of terrorism, fed by conflicting arguments from all the forces involved as they try to pass the buck from one side to the other.
Ladies and gentlemen, with this general context in mind, I should like to say a few words about how the Council is currently preparing for this meeting.
The COHOM working group organised its first two-day meeting on preparations for the work of the Commission two weeks ago.
Delegates from the various geographic working groups were invited to this meeting for a presentation of this year's priorities.
With the help of senior officials, COHOM has already managed to identify which countries are willing to agree on an action package.
It has also identified which countries need further discussion, rapprochement and information and has called for reports from the heads of the Community representations in these countries.
I must stress that no final decisions - and hence no initiatives - have been taken.
The COHOM working group will decide on as many issues as possible at its meeting on 5 February and any particularly thorny issues outstanding will be discussed in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and, where necessary, referred to the Council.
This debate has come along at exactly the right time, because the COHOM meeting on 5 February will be able to consider your ideas and comments.
I can, however, report that the working group has already provisionally agreed that the Union will vote in favour of item 9 on the agenda on the five countries of Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Myanmar and the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
At the same time, the European Union is moving for parts of south-eastern Europe to be transferred from item 9 to item 19 on the agenda, so that they can be provided with consultancy services and technical know-how in the human rights sector.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have deliberately not gone into all the European Union's actions in this area for the current period.
The Union's traditional report on the human rights situation in various parts of the world will cover the countries which give cause for concern.
A draft is already under way and we are endeavouring to give this report weight by covering about twenty or thirty countries.
Here too, the views of the European Parliament on the countries which we need to support will be vital.
As far as thematic decisions are concerned, the final decisions will again be taken in February.
What I can tell you is that motions are already being prepared on the death penalty and children's rights.
Finally, supporting declarations are also being prepared on issues which are major priorities in the European Union, such as racism, sexual discrimination and xenophobia, women's rights, modern forms of slavery and supporting and encouraging all types of personal and collective initiatives to protect human rights.
These are just a few examples but I think I have given you an idea of the European Union's commitments and expectations for the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
Before I finish, I should like to comment on one particular issue which is a priority for the Greek Presidency and that is the importance of taking an organised approach to the waves of illegal immigrants flooding into Europe.
We believe that this will also help combat serious forms of crime and human rights abuses, such as slavery, prostitution and what is often total disregard for human life.
In order to protect the human rights of immigrants and refugees, the presidency considers that, apart from third pillar issues which have to do with this question, we need to do something about the social rights of these people inside the Union.
Finally, I must point out, especially as things stand today, that the Union needs to strike the right balance between security and the unobstructed exercise of people's rights, between cooperation and pressure, between control and protection, between the demands of others and what applies to our members.
It is a difficult path to tread, but it is the only path.
Having said which, the Council welcomes the entry into force of the Statute for the International Criminal Court which, we believe, will do a great deal to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to respond to Parliament's resolutions on the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the clear indication of Parliament's country and thematic priorities for that session.
Eleanor Roosevelt was unanimously selected as the first chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1946, which was charged with the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
She might well have turned in her grave at the recent events in Geneva.
The election of a Libyan chair to the primary UN body dealing with human rights has rightly prompted wonderment at how this can be.
It may simply be because the election of individuals to the Commission on Human Rights bureau is based on nomination by regional groups: it was the Africans' turn to nominate, and they chose an individual from Libya.
The secret vote called at the behest of the United States led to a common abstention by seven EU Member States in the Commission on Human Rights.
The strong concern of many in the international community, including the EU, has rightly been registered at what is a significant blow to the credibility of the Commission on Human Rights.
The performance of the new chair will undoubtedly be closely scrutinised.
It is now time for the EU to focus on the initiatives it will take in the 59th session.
The challenges facing the EU constitute a decidedly uphill task.
At the 58th session last year we saw the Commission of Human Rights vote down EU initiatives on Zimbabwe, Chechnya and Iran.
Those results prompted a bout of soul-searching as to how the EU could improve the prospects for its country and thematic resolutions.
At the UN General Assembly - a third committee in New York - several innovations were put in place by the Presidency: earlier preparation of drafts, more concise resolutions and improved burden-sharing amongst EU partners.
These are important measures because they free up time for lobbying - diplomatic groundwork can, of course, make all the difference between failure and success.
It is true that the EU will need all the diplomatic finesse it can muster in Geneva when faced with an array of CHR members with poor human rights records, many disputing the legitimacy of tabling country resolutions.
The EU has rightly defended the need for country resolutions alongside thematic resolutions.
In many instances, those resolutions form the basis for the mandates of the special representatives and rapporteur who, when permitted by the country in question, seek to illuminate the human rights difficulties requiring attention.
This constructive system is not embraced by the vast majority of the international community, with over 150 states declining to issue a standing invitation to the UN special mechanisms.
I would add that, in view of this, it is interesting to note that the African nations have agreed to have the African Union organise a peer review process which, whilst weaker and different from this, nevertheless represents a step towards arriving at a situation in which some collective measurement of performance in these areas is actually taking place.
It is undoubtedly a difficult process to determine which countries should be subject to EU action in the Commission on Human Rights.
The EU has sought to develop its approach this year, with the Council Working Group on Human Rights taking soundings from all relevant geographic working groups in the Council as to which countries most warrant attention.
Discussions are set to continue at the COHOM meeting on 5 February 2003.
It should be stressed that no final decisions have been taken by the EU, but initiatives on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Israeli settlements, Burma/Myanmar and Iraq have been provisionally agreed upon and other countries remain under consideration.
The European Parliament's resolution on priorities for the Commission on Human Rights will constitute an important contribution to that debate, as will the presentation of priorities by NGOs at the forthcoming session of the Human Rights Contact Group.
Clearly, the EU's approach to Iran and China at the Commission on Human Rights will attract a great deal of interest.
The EU is engaged in human rights dialogues with both countries, with the primary aim of achieving concrete progress on the ground.
That is why we have designed a set of clear benchmarks to measure results.
As the EU guidelines on human rights dialogues make clear, and as we have made fully apparent to the Iranian government, such dialogues do not in any way preclude the tabling of resolutions in international human rights fora.
That decision must be made on the basis of our assessment of the human rights situation on the ground.
At the same time, however, the EU's decision on a resolution cannot be divorced from an assessment of the prospects for progress within the framework of the dialogue.
For the first round of dialogue with Iran, the initial assessment is cautiously positive.
Whilst the mandate of the special representative to Iran, Mr Maurice Copithorne, disappears with the defeat of the EU's resolution at the 58th Commission on Human Rights, last year Iran issued a standing invitation to the UN special rapporteurs, and it has announced that it will accept visits by four UN thematic rapporteurs during the course of this year.
It is worth noting that Mr Copithorne was not allowed to set foot in the country to implement his mandate, illustrating that, in the face of intransigence on the part of a third country, resolutions do not always secure the progress sought.
After a year's absence, the United States returns as a member of the Commission on Human Rights.
It is important for the EU and the United States to pursue their common interests in advancing human rights in the often hostile climate at the Commission on Human Rights.
It is true that there are several issues on which the United States and the EU do not see eye to eye, including such fundamental advances as the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and the International Criminal Court.
Those differences should neither be artificially papered over nor allowed to block meaningful cooperation.
That is why the EU and the United States have launched regular informal consultations on human rights which complement the existing human rights troika and include scrutiny of the language used in our respective resolutions and the thinking behind our approaches.
The next round of consultations is scheduled for 6 February 2003.
Finally, I welcome the European Parliament's intention to send a delegation to the 59th Commission on Human Rights following last year's successful visit, which provided the opportunity for productive exchanges between the EU Heads of Mission and the Commission's delegation in Geneva.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must warn you that we are running late and we will therefore have to administer the debate very strictly.
Since I have no desire to use my repressive powers, I would ask you to administer yourselves in a disciplined fashion.
Mr President, to save time, could you perhaps only give the floor to people who are present in the room during the introductions and who are also willing to listen to the answer.
You might then have fewer problems with the speaking time, and this auditorium would also be better populated; I am embarrassed on behalf of my fellow MEPs because they are not here to listen to the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, human rights is a topic which unites the political families in Parliament to a substantial extent, so we had no great problem when it came to agreeing on a joint resolution in preparation for the 59th meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
In preparing for this 59th meeting, we are, of course, aware of how difficult it is to achieve substantial results within the UN framework, something that the Council and the Commission have already illustrated to some extent.
We should not, though, be creating difficulties about the UNHCR's standing in view of this year's chairmanship having been entrusted to Libya, of all countries.
I find it a particular cause of embarrassment that this was made possible by the European Union abstaining when it came to the vote.
I know that this was a deal done with the African states, but if a nomination of this sort is to be avoided, we should perhaps be doing more in-depth work with this continent in the area of human rights, rather than only when it comes to haggling for jobs and positions in the corridors of the UN.
I have heard what the representative of the Council has said.
He quoted the fine declarations that were made in June 2001.
At the General Affairs Council this week, we learned how the absence of any agreement has meant that the opposite has been the result, in Zimbabwe for example.
Obviously, considerations of human rights were seen as less important than issues of economics.
Apart from that, it strikes me as important that the meeting should be followed - and promptly - by the public debriefing from the Council and the Commission here in Parliament.
A review of the last meeting is of little use to me right now; I would have been very keen to hear it once the meeting was over.
Parliament and the public have a right to know what the Council and the Commission did at the UNHCR meeting, and why they did it.
I am glad, though, when a dialogue on human rights is got underway with a country, and the Commissioner mentioned Iran as being one of them.
As the rapporteur for Iran, that is something that I welcome.
Iran should, though, demonstrate the seriousness with which it takes such a dialogue by cooperating with the United Nations.
I found a number of positive things in what the Commissioner said, and I hope that we can make them a reality.
We have tabled an amendment expressing our wish that a successor for Mr Copithorne should be formally nominated, and I hope that Iran will also be prepared to work together with him.
In this resolution, we have listed a number of countries as illustrations of the indisputable deficits in the area of human rights.
We in the PPE-DE Group do take the view, though, that this resolution is not suited to illustrating the dimension of present-day human rights violations in their entirety, by, for example, incorporating a plethora of individual cases under specific headings.
We will therefore be rejecting the relevant amendments - not because of their content, but for procedural reasons.
Mr President, first of all I would like to welcome the statements from the previous speaker on a debriefing from the Council and the Commission following the UN hearing.
I think that would be extremely welcome and I say that as a delegate who has attended the three previous sessions.
We recognise the importance of the UN Commission as a forum to effect real change, but we feel that the Council, Parliament and the Commission must act together if we are to achieve our real aims.
Of course, there were regrets about the lack of cohesion last year between the EU Member States and the so-called Western Group and we have better hopes for this year.
We must recognise the fundamental importance of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and we call on the EU Presidency to address this important issue.
It should also tackle the important issue of the abolition of the death penalty, and again, we call on the EU to sponsor a resolution inviting all states to introduce a moratorium on executions with a view to the total abolition of the death penalty, and we reiterate our request to the US, China, Saudi Arabia, Congo, Iran and other states to immediately end all executions.
But let me turn to the rights of those sometimes forgotten, namely women, children, minorities, lesbian, gay and trans-gendered people who suffer inhumane and degrading treatment merely because of who they are.
The case of the Cairo 52 in Egypt is still unresolved after more than 18 months, and again more people have been arrested for alleged homosexuality.
The complaints of the three British men, Nesbitt, Nawaz and Pankhurst, who have made serious allegations of abuse, have yet to be investigated.
I agree with the Council that we must be consistent in our applications and our approach, and must be determined to end human rights abuses wherever they occur.
Where we have association agreements and human rights clauses, we should not hesitate in criticising those countries which fail to uphold human rights and, where necessary, suspend such agreements.
Mr President, do the violators of human rights have much to fear and the victims much to expect from the UN Human Rights Commission?
I do not think so.
The most important forum in the world is once again missing the mark by a mile: it is not the severity of the violations that is the deciding factor but the ability to mobilise political support.
Some countries also manage to repeatedly avoid censure; this produces a distorted picture of the human rights situation in the world and tarnishes the legitimacy of the Commission.
Regrettably, having a notorious violator of human rights such as Libya as the chairman of the Commission is an example of this.
It is high time for reform that will prevent these kinds of undesirable developments.
The European Union can play a greater role in the UN Commission if it is properly prepared, prepared in time, speaks with one voice and is persistent and courageous - in short, if it operates differently from the way it operated last year.
Europe's abstention in respect of Libya's chairmanship, however diplomatically tactical that was meant to be, is an admission of weakness and creates a lack of clarity with regard to Europe's position.
In order to exert maximum influence, coordination must take place with the United States on as many aspects as possible.
I understand that that does in fact happen.
It is very important to my group that the European Union makes efforts particularly in respect of resolutions on slavery, immunity from punishment, torture, brutal interpretations of Sharia, discrimination against women, freedom of religion, the situation of indigenous peoples and certainly the protection of human rights activists as well.
We place great importance on the resolutions on the 17 countries in which Iraq, Iran, Burma, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, China, Russia and Colombia are in particular named.
Selection is inevitable, but that certainly does not mean that all countries that have not been named will get off scot-free.
I would also like to draw particular attention to the renewal of the mandate of the special rapporteur for Iran, the strengthening of the position of the High Commissioner in Colombia and the approval of special rapporteurs in Chechnya.
The European Union must integrate the outcomes of Geneva into its policy and resume the political dialogue with the countries concerned.
As the human rights rapporteur for this Parliament for this year I say: let the European Union do everything it can to restore the authority of this UN Human Rights Commission.
We cannot do without it, there is no alternative.
A meeting is only successful, however, if it is feared by the violators and applauded by the victims.
Mr President, I am a critical person, and I am very sad to have become afflicted in this period with pessimism regarding the future of our world too.
Over and above our high-sounding declarations of principle, human rights are being violated in far too many countries: Chechnya, China, the African countries at war, Israel, the USA with the death penalty and so on and so forth.
The blame lies not just with those violating these rights but also with those who see what is happening but do not intervene and genuinely enforce international law.
In this sense, governments are often indifferent towards the work of UNHCR and their recommendations go unheeded.
Like many of you, I feel indignation when fundamental human rights - the right to life, freedom of thought and movement - are ridden roughshod over in countries professing to be democracies too, and, today, illiberal, death-dealing acts are being carried out in the name of the war against terrorism, although that is not to say that terrorism must not be combated, as in the case of the massacre in Mazar-I-Sharif.
I would like a measure to be taken in March which would make Israel, for example, which is a signatory State, respect, if not the UN resolutions requiring an end to military occupation, at least the Geneva Convention.
Collective punishments, the demolition of houses, schools, hospitals, factories and shops, the uprooting of trees, arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial assassinations, vandalism and theft perpetrated by Israeli soldiers, which I personally witnessed in Ramallah, are tragic, daily occurrences in Palestine, like the attacks against civilians in Israel.
Three hundred and fifty Palestinian children and 80 Israeli children have been killed in the last two years, innocent victims of our failure to act.
We have the means to do so but we often use two different sets of checks and balances: it is our alliances, not our values, which carry most weight.
Europe is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
If we are not consistent, first and foremost in the context of European Union affairs, employing all the means available to us, including the suspension of the association agreements with countries which have blatantly violated human rights, how can we be credible as promoters of these rights within the United Nations?
We need the provision of enough UNHCR financial and human resources to be able to act more effectively.
At the March conference, we must take tangible decisions such as sending a peace-keeping force to protect the civilian population in the occupied territories and refusing to allow Israel to obstruct or even fire on humanitarian missions.
The resolution on which we are going to vote outlines effective, valuable priorities and commitments - such as the operation of the International Criminal Court, human rights monitoring in Iran and the cooperation of the institutions with associations and NGOs from civil society - which will further education and respect in the field of human rights and democracy.
Mr President, Geneva for us will be the moment of truth.
There once again we will ponder whether we are able or unable to defend, in a way that is consistent, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights in a world in which the human rights situation has got significantly worse and the general political climate is becoming worryingly brutalised.
With the Iraq crisis reaching an acute stage, the Member States decided to adopt the process laid down in Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union in the UN Security Council.
Still more important in the long term will be how we can actively effect closer cooperation, in accordance with Articles 19 and 20, in the area of human rights in the UN and other international forums.
We will not be able to do this if we lose our ability to act consistently.
We will no longer appear credible and we, old Europe, will be left without that moral authority we need so much.
We cannot then expect our citizens and NGOs to take us seriously.
Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to a number of issues, a number of dossiers which have received wide coverage in the international press but which we appear to have overlooked somewhat in our political activities.
The first concerns an African country which is travailed by daily violations of the most fundamental human rights, Zimbabwe, where a Head of Government and his regime of violent, brutal racism towards the settlers, the farmers of European origin, have encouraged the perpetration of incidents which, along with the attacks on the democratic rights of the local African opposition to this regime, place this country wholly outside the realms of democracy.
I am dumbfounded by the debate in which our European authorities appear to be bogged down, as if there were any question of allowing the head of this bloodthirsty regime which is brutally riding roughshod over human rights to take part in the France-Africa Summit in Paris in February or the EU-Africa Summit due to take place in Lisbon in April.
I believe that the Council and the Commission must act resolutely, and I feel that a committee whose very raison d'Ãªtre is to safeguard human rights must not overlook repeated brutal incidents ?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, Lobsang Dhondup, a Tibetan, was executed three days ago, despite all the appeals made by world public opinion and the human rights organisations, and the approaches of ambassadors of EU Member States notwithstanding.
Nor did our debate in this House, and the resolution we adopted unanimously on 19 December 2002, have any effect.
On 26 January 2003, the People's Court in Chengdu confirmed the death sentences that had been passed on Lobsang Dhondup and on the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek.
They were accused of involvement in an attack using explosives and of sabotaging national unity.
Lengthy solitary confinement without contact with family or legal representatives is a manifest breach of the UN's minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners.
Their trial was neither fair nor in accordance with the rule of law.
A public hearing in open court - demanded by this Parliament among others - was refused on the flimsy grounds that state secrets were involved.
There was no free choice of legal representation, and public defence counsel were appointed by the court.
Lobsang Dhondup's execution resulted in immediate protests by the EU Member States.
It will also be on the agenda of the human rights conversations between Germany and China.
Great Britain has reiterated the demand for the death penalty in China to be at last abolished, and the human rights dialogue between the EU and China must now at last concern itself with this serious case.
It is a disaster; while China is trying to cut a credible figure on the world stage, the most basic conditions of the defence of human rights are being disregarded.
On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and as President of this Parliament's Intergroup on Tibet, I call upon the Council, the Commission and the Member States to intervene without delay and prevent the death sentence with which Tenzin Delek has been threatened from being carried out.
For decades, this lama has worked in the religious, cultural and social fields - with such manifest success that all hardliners see him as a threat.
This appalling event can leave us in no doubt that China's violations of fundamental rights should be on the agenda of the Human Rights Convention in Geneva, and the European Union must take the lead in this.
Mr President, I welcomed the reference made by the Council representative in his speech to a calm, pragmatic position, and I am thinking, in particular, of the need for pragmatic action to call strongly, for example, for ratification of all the international conventions, which are the tools available for the States and the citizens to use to protect their human rights.
I would like to mention two, in particular, which are considered to be of particularly minor importance: the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
I then feel that we should continue to call strongly for a moratorium on the death penalty, not least in that it has become clear that, resisting any fatalistic tendencies or ideas of inevitable destiny, it is actually possible to persuade some US governors of the worthlessness of this barbaric practice: the fact that the governor of Illinois commuted 167 sentences shows that this is a battle that it is actually possible to win.
We call upon the European Union, first and foremost, to fight to ensure that there are no off-limits zones in the protection of human rights.
One such off-limits zone could be the fight against terrorism, which should be based firmly on respect for international humanitarian law.
Another free zone could be the fact that the Rome Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court continues to be treated by some countries, particularly the United States, as extremely insignificant.
The authority and effectiveness of this Treaty are in danger of being increasingly diminished by the attitude of the United States and its decision to adopt bilateral agreements with some countries.
Lastly, Mr President, I would like us to go to Geneva with a conviction which I hope we all share - that the first and highest form of defence of human rights is to avoid the destruction, ignominy and violence of war.
Mr President, one cannot but agree with the general principles expounded by the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, but what matters is how we apply them and I have three comments to make here.
First, we should not be mild-mannered psychotherapists in one country and unrelenting public prosecutors in another.
The criteria applied to Turkey should also apply to Iran and the criteria applied to Iran should also apply to Turkey.
And while we are on the subject of Turkey, it is about time that Leyla Zana, the woman awarded the Sakharov prize, saw the light of day.
And it would be an important achievement if that were to happen under the Greek Presidency.
Secondly, the United States. In addition to what the Commissioner said, there is the question of the death penalty in the United States and we need to address this issue in the same way as we have addressed it in other countries.
And while we are on the subject of crossed swords between the European Union and the United States, I think it is perhaps about time we awarded a Sakharov prize to an American in 2003, the outgoing governor of Illinois, who has pardoned 150 people on death row.
Thirdly, we must look at new rights being violated by measures against terrorism.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, knowing how important and irreplaceable this 59th session of the Commission on Human Rights is, we must not allow its work, its functions and its presidency to be weakened.
Who other than the Commission on the rights of men, women, children, minorities, etc. could demand reports on countries that imprison people for crimes that they have not committed?
I am thinking for example of Mr Bandajevski, whose health is deteriorating in prison in Belarus; I am thinking of Lemine Ould Cheikh MelaÃ¯nine who is wasting away in a Mauritanian jail.
We must give all of our support to the proper functioning of this Commission so that it can fully play its role.
For this we need to ensure that an appropriate amount of speaking time is granted to the Commission rapporteurs and humanitarian NGOs who, on the ground, are often the real witnesses and representatives of those without a voice.
The debate is also the opportunity to highlight the rights of indigenous peoples as, when too many States are violently breaching fundamental rights, what can be said about the rights of indigenous peoples in the absence of practically any information about their definition or their legal guarantees?
We must strongly support the UN's initiative to have a permanent forum on these issues in order to raise awareness and promote the cause of indigenous peoples.
We must also do everything we can to ensure the maintenance of the working group, which is the only one of its kind dealing with indigenous peoples' issues.
Also, ladies and gentlemen, it would be to the European Parliament's credit if it, for its part, were to set up the European Parliament indigenous peoples' delegation that was decided upon when a resolution was adopted in 1992.
Mr President, although Member State governments have strongly criticised human rights abuses, regrettably they adopt a different approach in relation to larger countries like China and Pakistan, where there are huge trading and geopolitical interests at stake.
Our inconsistency is a form of political prostitution and undermines our moral authority in this field.
I welcome this joint resolution and, as mentioned in paragraph 16, the EU Presidency should support further resolutions on a number of countries.
I would like to refer to three in particular.
With regard to China, the strike hard campaign continues to be extremely worrying, having dramatically increased the number of executions in China, often carried out in reliance on insufficient evidence in summary trials.
Severe restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information persist.
Pro-democracy campaigners and political activists are often detained without charge and, in some cases, charged with inciting subversion.
It is essential that the Presidency make human rights a core part of all dialogue with China.
In the Middle East, I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism, especially suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian extremists.
But I also condemn the state terrorism inflicted on the ordinary people of Palestine by Israel.
With regard to Iran, EU leaders had expressed the hope that engaging Iran in political dialogue would strengthen reformist elements and improve human rights.
Sadly, stoning seems to have been only stopped temporarily, for reasons of image.
Numerous newspapers are being closed down daily and unfortunately the number of executions has increased significantly.
The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental principles of the EU.
It is imperative for the EU to show consistency in its stance on human rights on the global stage and particular at Geneva; otherwise, no one will take us seriously.
Mr President, I should like to thank the speakers for their comments and observations.
I think they will be most useful to the Council, as will the references made to a number of countries and regions such as China, the Middle East and Zimbabwe, which not only reflect the Council's position, they also reflect the action being taken by the Council and the Commission on a whole series of issues.
We are not sparing any effort to persuade everyone we can of the need to implement human rights.
Of course, what is important in the final analysis is for the pressure we exert to bring about results and not just remain political pressure.
Of course, I also agree with many of the other comments made but there is too little time to go into them, such as turning our attention to the problems in Africa.
Before discussing our position in various international fora, I should like to take this opportunity to comment on Mr van den Bos's reference to the European Union's abstention from last year's vote.
I personally believe that the decision to abstain was not an expression of indifference.
That would not be in the nature of the European Union.
It was a considered decision which, it was hoped, would help the Commission on Human Rights operate smoothly under the political circumstances which arose last year.
I should also like to point out that of course we are interested in abolishing the death penalty, it is one of Europe's crowning achievements.
This is clear from numerous discussions under way, including with the United States, where a number of agreements, especially as part of the fight against terrorism, cannot proceed unless there is a guarantee that the death penalty will not be applied to people extradited to the United States.
We take a keen interest in the question of the death penalty everywhere.
Mr President, I have noted that the issue of the death penalty has been raised by almost every speaker.
I agree that this needs to be pushed and is an issue which is, in fact, the same in every system, in every country.
As such, this issue deserves strong attention and more activity.
In response to Mr Fava's remark - that by defending human rights we can avoid or prevent terrorism - I would also say that I only wish that were true.
It would be extremely good if this really were the case.
The world is more evil than that.
There is extremism and it is not possible to avoid the problem totally by having our own record straight or even having global decency really move forward.
This involves a number of fundamental problems, but having said this, I agree with the approach expressed in this formulation.
Certainly, we have to be extremely careful not to damage these ideals by fighting terrorism.
It is extremely important to maintain that balance.
On the vote in the Commission on Human Rights, and as a reaction to Mr Gahler's remarks, it is not correct to state that the seven EU members of the Commission on Human Rights contributed to the election of the Libyan chair.
I would like to mention for the record that this is not what appears from the figures in that vote.
I have received six motions for resolutions
First of all, I wish to apologise, on behalf of Parliament, that the debates have been somewhat protracted.
We shall take account of the views that have been put forward and shall of course endeavour to avoid this kind of situation arising in future.
The next item is a continuation of the debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before commenting on the question of the exploitation of the wealth of the Congo, I should like to say that, by reason of my position, and I speak here for the presidency of the Council, I am obliged to respect the presence and the modus operandi of the European Parliament and I shall do just that.
I wonder if the European Parliament might find a way of establishing some sort of mutual respect or paying heed to the issues that arise from the functioning of the presidency, bearing in mind that the Greek Presidency will have to go back to Greece at some point within the not too distant future.
In all events, even if Parliament cannot find a way and cannot abide by a few rules, we shall abide by them, as befits our position.
Now on the question of the illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Congo, I have this to say: the international community has started to evince a keen interest in the illegal exploitation of natural resources in Africa over recent years, especially where they are used to fund long-term, catastrophic armed conflicts.
The chairman of the United Nations Security Council made a statement in June 2000 calling on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to set up a committee of experts to investigate the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This committee was set up and started work in September 2000 and published its final report in October 2002, in which it points out that high-ranking political, military and business figures in Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe, as well as the Congo, are plundering the natural - mainly mineral - wealth of the Congo on a massive scale for personal gain or, in the case of Rwanda, for their country's benefit.
At the same time, again according to the committee's findings, Rwanda is funding its massive military budget mainly from resources taken from the Congo, occasionally using forced local labour.
The European Union has refrained from passing a resolution on this recent report by the committee of experts until the Security Council does so.
However, the European Union is in favour of introducing a ban and of imposing sanctions as and where necessary, preferably through the United Nations Security Council, rather than by individual countries or groups of countries.
As far as one particularly controversial product is concerned - so-called blood diamonds - both the international community and the European Union have taken specific action.
To be precise, thirty-seven countries and the European Parliament finalised a certification process for uncut diamonds at Interlaken in Switzerland in November 2002, the so-called Kimberley process, precisely in a bid to fight the trade in illegally mined diamonds from conflict zones, especially in Africa.
The European Union also adopted Council resolution 2368/2002 on the application of the Kimberley certification process on 20 December, which is when it became operational.
I should like to finish by pointing out that there is a basic vicious circle here that needs to be broken.
Internal armed conflict opens the way for the illegal exploitation of the basic wealth of a country and in turn this wealth is exploited to perpetuate the internal armed conflict and the lack of development and stability mechanisms in the country.
Madam President, the Commission is extremely concerned by the fact that the plunder of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to be one of the main elements fuelling the conflict in the Great Lakes Region.
With this in mind, the Commission has worked actively with the panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo since its establishment.
The Commission organised a meeting in Kinshasa between the experts and the heads of Commission delegations in countries covered by the investigation.
The Commission stands ready to continue this constructive cooperation in the future, if required to do so.
The Commission has taken careful note of the report of the panel of experts, which was the subject of a resolution in the UN Security Council last week.
The Commission welcomes the fact that measures have been taken by the Congolese authorities in relation to officials named in the reports and that the government of Uganda has established a judicial commission of inquiry.
The Commission shares the UN Security Council's call for all states concerned, in particular Zimbabwe and Rwanda, to conduct investigations and to take appropriate measures in relation to their nationals cited in the report, where the circumstances are justified.
The Commission agrees that the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which really took hold of the country during the war, will only come to an end once the rule of law is really established.
Saying that it is restored is a euphemistic reference to the historic reality of that country, but with rule of law and viable administration things can be different.
This needs to happen not only in the zones controlled by armed rebel groups, but also over the entire Congolese territory.
In that context, the Commission calls on all parties to the Pretoria Agreement signed last December to implement it without delay and to do so in the spirit of the agreement.
Moreover, the Commission welcomes the decision taken in Sun City in the framework of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue, to establish a special committee to examine the validity of economic and financial agreements made during the war which relate to the exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Together with other donors, the Commission is prepared to support the Democratic Republic of Congo in the transition process and in its efforts to establish an efficient public administration.
Recently, the Commission adopted a decision for the grant of EUR 16 million to support capacity building in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This is not a new problem we are discussing.
Extraction of mineral wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not a story of transparency and good governance.
This was the case long before, during, and after the Mobutu regime.
In the footsteps of Laurent Kabila's advances towards Kinshasa, mining concessions changed hands - as did ownership, town by town - as new warlords became masters locally and militarily.
This became the subject of the aforementioned investigations.
The Commission considers that, in order to ensure effective action against the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the entire international community must work together.
The United Nations Security Council is the appropriate forum to ensure such concerted action.
However, given the cross-border nature of the problem, the Commission considers that regional integration bodies such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) should also address the issue.
The Commission welcomes the initiative by the United Nations to organise an international conference on peace, democracy, security and development in the Great Lakes Region.
This conference could address the different aspects of illegal exploitation of natural resources from a regional perspective, as part of a long-term strategy and also for the purposes of conflict prevention.
It is very important that we guarantee ownership rights and a steady progress towards transparency in these matters, even without UN Security Council resolutions which have a limited reach.
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for that very insightful analysis of what has been going on.
This resolution is an important step forward in favour of international law and the rule of law.
As we speak, there are some 48 civil conflicts around the world - the majority of them in Africa - being conducted largely in the promotion of one or more supposed sectional or tribal interests.
Sub-Saharan Africa has seen millions of people massacred, genocide committed, whole tribes ethnically cleansed in the last 20 years.
Ostensibly, these conflicts have been based, as in Angola or Rwanda, on so-called historic divisions.
But the reality is that an underlying factor in most of these cases has been commercial gain, based on supposed tribal protection.
Various sectional and commercial interests, some of them based in Europe, have tried to exploit these differences for commercial gain to procure the supply of diamonds, timber, oil, gold, cobalt, titanium and vanadium.
Africa is supposed to be one of the richest continents in the world, inhabited by the poorest people in the world.
How can this be so?
This is so because the rule of law and international law has not operated in Africa for a long time.
The Democratic Republic of Congo has been exploited, looted and robbed.
Its people have been set against one another, encouraged to massacre each other and sometimes to commit genocide, so that powerful vested interests outside Africa can collude and gain advantage.
This report by the United Nations Security Council is a seminal report in that it sets out for the first time to establish that international law incorporates a moral right to a concept of shared sovereignty, that sovereignty is not merely what is defined in the Montevideo Convention or President Wilson's 14-point rule, and that in a global trading environment as we see now with the WTO and global rules on trade, we have to share our sovereignty when the rule of law becomes paramount.
If we can penalise the United States for doing something wrong with its steel, why is it that we are not able to do something in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where millions of people have been exploited and killed for commercial gain?
So I welcome this resolution and I commend it.
Madam President, Parliament has long been concerned about the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes Region in Africa in general.
Fortunately, armed conflict in the region has ended. It is now time to launch the process of reconstruction.
The future of the Democratic Republic of Congo and peace in that country depend on establishing democracy and sustainable development.
As regards establishing democracy, we trust the Pretoria Agreement will prove an effective measure and will be implemented in sensible stages. The Pretoria Agreement is truly an all-encompassing and inclusive agreement.
An all-embracing system of democracy can only be established if all associations and political groupings are included in the process. This is especially important in the Great Lakes Region where a breakdown in social order was the root cause of the wars that laid waste to the region.
I welcome the meeting of the General Affairs Council held in Brussels yesterday and also the Commission's decision to send a significant amount of humanitarian aid to the worst affected areas.
A number of major problems are still outstanding, however.
They must be resolved to assure the future of the region. Such problems can only be tackled through sound political institutions, once implementation of the agreement is under way.
The major problem I have in mind is that of a system of justice.
Impunity is incompatible with democracy and there can be no peace without a system of justice.
In this connection, I would like to table an amendment to indent 4 tomorrow. I would like to replace the phrase referring to other places, when these acts have been committed with one referring to other places, including the acts committed.
The other element crucial to the future of the Democratic Republic of Congo is sustainable development. The countries and the companies of the European Union have a key role to play in this process.
Companies can play their part by adopting an ethical code of conduct demonstrating commitment to sustainable development. Countries can be involved by establishing measures to limit the importation of goods of dubious origin.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists will relentlessly pursue its campaign demanding transparency and ethical standards from multinational companies in the developing world.
In this regard, we attach great importance to compliance with rules on child labour, the ILO labour standards, the sustainable exploitation of resources and the OECD's guidelines on multinational companies.
The United Nations report adopts a clear stance on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
We hope Member States, the Commission and Parliament will all insist on implementation of the report's recommendations.
Madam President, my group has not added its signatures to the joint resolution.
Of course we too agree that the illegal exploitation of the natural resources in Congo must be strongly condemned.
Of course we too agree that people and companies who enrich themselves from war must be stopped and punished.
We therefore welcome the fair analysis, the first in the hundred years since the plundering of Congo began.
It is, therefore, quite simply a shame that the report is so sloppy and that it contains so many unfounded accusations and inaccuracies.
This list of shame could have been an historic precedent, a warning to all leaders and business people who unscrupulously exploit the misery of millions for personal gain.
Instead it has become a weak, contentious document based on rumours and war propaganda.
Indeed, it has created an amalgam of illegal and illicit activities, and the persons and companies named in it were never heard, let alone given the opportunity to defend themselves.
This is why the report was weighed and found wanting by the Security Council this week.
The mandate of the experts was extended by six months.
The Security Council is absolutely right to urge that all the named countries institute their own investigation on the basis of which legal action can be taken.
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.
Even more fundamental, however, is the question as to how illegal exploitation can be avoided and counteracted in the future; in other words, how a new stable and democratic order can be established in Congo that will ensure that the country's resources are exploited in a controlled and sustainable manner in order to benefit the entire Congolese population.
The United Nations bears a colossal responsibility for this.
It is to be hoped that the Security Council will also search its conscience, review MONUC's mandate, increase the number of troops and do everything necessary to speed up the application of the peace accords and the installation of new structures, so that in a few years' time it will not be faced once more with the realisation that Congo is still being plundered.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo's geostrategic situation has always, in my view, caused it to be considered as a power with great potential on the African continent.
Unfortunately, under the dictatorship of President Mobutu, the country has fallen into economic and political crisis.
We should be aware that the GNP per inhabitant has decreased to one sixth of what it was twenty years ago.
I believe this to be linked, among other things, to the disappearance of the official channels and administration, so that informal activities have acquired an importance that is unheard of elsewhere.
While it has enormous potential in terms of agricultural, forestry and mining resources - on which subject I agree with my colleague - the paradox is that the Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the poorest countries in the world.
This situation is, I believe, the result of bad management, including bad management of the economy and of the failing infrastructure, but also of the illegal exploitation of wealth.
That is the important thing about the United Nations report.
As mining resources are already largely diminished almost all over the world, and exhausted in several countries, those being exploited in the Congo are quite economically attractive, particularly due to the low costs involved in their sale.
I think that we have a real responsibility in this respect.
The United Nations report warns us about the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the DRC by private European companies, which is particularly of concern to us, and by neighbouring countries, which also have responsibilities.
In view of the Johannesburg Summit, the provisions laid down by the International Criminal Court and the Cotonou agreements, and in response to this scandal which I believe threatens the global ecosystem and to the reign of poaching and violations of human rights, I believe that the European Union should ask the UN Security Council to initiate proceedings against those who are implicated, particularly by freezing assets and conducting enquiries into pogroms and other acts of violence committed against the people.
The Council and the Commission should also equip themselves with a restrictive legal framework and demand, in particular, greater transparency in the way that markets are allocated.
On a more general note, I would like to say that, in this battle in which we are all engaged against physical attacks on people and for peace and sustainable development, the key notes must be the preservation of the environment, social justice and good governance.
Madam President, the situation in the Congo is tragic.
Millions of citizens are living in appalling conditions.
Famine and AIDS are the daily lot of men and women in the grip of an interminable conflict, stirred up by the presence of so-called elite networks who are taking advantage of a chaotic situation in order to make a profit.
The top political leaders, regional and foreign companies and the armed forces have established what appears to be a real war economy.
They are stirring up, under the cover of political or ethnic opposition, a conflict whose only goal has become to simply plunder the natural resources of the DRC, to the detriment of the local populations.
The United Nations report that we presented to the Committee on Development and Cooperation is, in our opinion, a significant opportunity to put an end to this human tragedy.
The list of people involved in this damaging trafficking should be the spearhead for us to launch genuine and forceful action.
Ladies and gentlemen, we now need to put pressure on our own companies to stop taking advantage of confused situations or even creating them in order to make a fraudulent profit.
We should not delude ourselves any longer.
The responsibility of companies is now closely linked to that of our governments.
If we do not promptly give a strong political signal by taking restrictive action against them and stressing our support for the principles of the OECD, they will continue to violate the law and human rights without batting an eyelid.
We can no longer turn a blind eye to what is nothing more and nothing less than neo-colonial plundering in disguise.
By forcing European companies in foreign countries to make their accounts public, we will enable greater transparency and will also limit the illegal misappropriation of which the Congolese people are the prime victims.
It is clear that establishing the rule of law and democratic institutions will be essential.
But prior coordinated action among Member States aimed at putting an end to their own companies' activities has become essential.
It is high time that the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo benefited fully and directly from their land's resources and achieved the level of development that their mining resources would allow if they were not constantly being illegally exploited by foreign powers.
Madam President, what is so outrageous about the illegal exploitation of the Congo's natural resources is that it is all too apparent that Congolese politicians, as well as politicians from other countries - whether or not these countries have been called upon to provide military assistance - have helped themselves to an equally shameless degree, as have high-ranking military personnel, particularly from Zimbabwe.
Numerous private undertakings have also joined in helping themselves to the country's raw materials.
Although firms from outside Europe are also involved, we should very definitely be working through and analysing the list naming European firms and private individuals.
This should be done in the individual Member States and with a view to criminal prosecution.
I do not think that there is much of a distinction of substance to be drawn between this case and the way in which corrupt African regimes grant licenses for the extraction of raw materials, with part of the license fees or indeed of the proceeds going straight into the ruler's personal bank account.
Some of this may even be listed as a receipt in the state's budget, but it is virtually unheard of for the people to benefit from it in the shape of infrastructure or health provision.
The fact that these regimes can only keep themselves in power because they are kept by Europe means that what we need is a debate, in plain words, on the principles by which we Europeans are guided in our dealings with Africa.
There is an unspeakable and unacceptable discrepancy between, on the one hand, the text of the Cotonou Treaty and the honeyed words that we will get to hear in Lisbon over the coming weeks at the Franco-African and EU-African summits, and, on the other, the brutal reality of Africa.
We cannot fail to observe that certain governments collude and collaborate with European firms that then provide certain regimes with a lifeline in order to maximise their own profits.
If we do not speak frankly about these things, we will bring about no real change in the situations in Africa.
Madam President, I come from what was once a colonising country, Belgium, whose emotional ties with the Democratic Republic of Congo have never been cut.
It was therefore with despair that I saw it swallowed by war and with relief that I welcomed the Pretoria agreements, which are a promise of peace and democratisation in this martyred region.
The Congo has exceptional natural resources.
In 1997, the value of the resources in the North was estimated at USD 25 billion.
The minerals: zinc, lead, iron, tungsten, cadmium, cobalt and germanium are unique, and germanium has semi-conducting powers that are now used to make the most powerful microchip in the world, to say nothing of radium, lithium and niobium, which produce superconductive alloys at high temperatures, or diamonds, silver, platinum, and so on.
It is probably the country with the greatest resources in the world.
This is why, along with the neighbouring countries concerned, it has to be said that Western predators have pounced on it under all sorts of pretexts, exterminating its population and using Africans to fight a Western war.
It is a veritable holocaust.
People are quoting figures of 4.5 million Congolese victims since 1998, 2.5 million people displaced, 16 million condemned to death, thousands deported to Rwanda and Uganda, and I prefer not to mention the details of the massacres that have taken place, which are unbearable.
So yes, I am in favour of this resolution, and if it turns out that my country, as has been suggested by a panel of experts, is harbouring any of the predators that are fuelling the war, Belgium will not evade its responsibilities.
It will conduct the necessary enquiries and will ensure that there are repercussions.
It will not add complicity in the present to the burden of past colonisation.
However, there is one condition: the UN resolution last week on the same subject stressed that the panel of experts is not a judicial power and that therefore, the results that it gives cannot be considered to be established facts and cannot therefore automatically lead to penalties.
The right to defence must be preserved.
Madam President, as a Belgian, this resolution appeals to me particularly because Congo used to be a Belgian colony.
Other countries too in old and new Europe are, however, guilty of plundering the natural resources of Africa.
It is simply not acceptable that this is still going on.
It is now no longer the old mother countries but, deservedly or undeservedly, European companies who are named in the UN report.
Europe must in any event take measures, because we have a collective historic responsibility.
I have just returned from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
I also listened to the Africans there.
They are expecting a lot from Europe - for example, reparations of a kind.
A committee of enquiry has been set up in the Belgian Senate which will look into the illegal trade in raw materials in the region of the Great Lakes.
The main issue for Europe is that the Commission should propose a directive on the control of European companies that operate outside the European Union and that this directive should be quickly made law by every Member State.
On the other hand, a control mechanism for the exploitation of raw materials in Congo must be set up.
The United Nations has a more urgent assignment here than in Iraq.
Madam President, much of the United Nations report refers to the role of Zimbabwean interests and gives startling evidence of how the actions of Mugabe's corrupt henchmen impact not just on their own people but also on neighbouring countries such as the Congo.
The Mugabe regime is a criminal racket and a major factor of instability, not just in southern Africa but, as the report makes clear, in central Africa as well.
The report describes the conflicts fought over minerals, farm produce, land and tax revenues by criminal groups linked to the Zimbabwean armed forces which have, for example, transferred at least five billion dollars' worth of assets from the state mining company in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to companies under its control.
It is ridiculous even to think the Zimbabwean government could be asked to investigate its own activities.
The report not only provides evidence of the involvement of Mugabe in these activities, but names a numbers of other senior Zimbabweans, four of whom are subject to the EU's restrictive measures but four of whom, to my astonishment, are not.
The political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe is worsening with serious implications for the security situation.
Two days ago, the United States government issued a travel warning urging United States citizens to consider departure from Zimbabwe.
Is it not therefore bewildering to the oppressed people of Zimbabwe that two European governments now seek to delay the renewal and dilute the force of the travel ban and other restrictive measures that the European Union has put in place against the Mugabe regime and which are due to expire on 18 February 2003?
Is it not deeply offensive that one European Union government has invited Mugabe to a summit conference in Paris?
One reason why our measures have been ineffective so far is that they have not been rigorously enforced and their scope is too narrow.
This is not the time to be reducing pressure on the Mugabe regime; instead, international action must be intensified.
May I ask the President of the Council and the Commission, in accordance with the clearly expressed wishes of this House over a year or more, to insist that sanctions be renewed unequivocally and that the EU measures be extended to include all of those involved in this racket in Zimbabwe and the Congo.
The European Union must be determined and consistent in its tough policy in relation to the Mugabe regime and see this matter through, for the benefit of all Zimbabweans.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad, but true, that if Iraq had nothing but dates, war against Baghdad would not even be on the agenda, even if the country were ruled over by a dictator.
If the Congo did not possess such an incredible wealth of natural resources, Africa would have far less in the way of problems.
The United Nations report has spelled out, albeit with perhaps insufficient clarity, the shameful forms of greed that give rise to the illegal exploitation of this wealth.
The global community must find ways and means of putting a stop to this exploitation.
There is a lamentable lack of responsibility, not only on the part of criminal elements, but also on the part of governments who would rather line their own pockets, and also in European business circles.
European enterprises must be made aware that the unscrupulous exploitation of Africa's natural resources is not a petty offence, and so Europe's policies must set a good example.
Illegal actions must be punished, and commercial undertakings must be made to comply with a code of conduct.
Madam President, Mr Rod asked if we found his choice of words a little too direct.
I certainly do not think the terminology was incorrect.
We need to work on a much broader basis on the issue of transparency and the principles of licensing.
I just came back from Angola and the discussion about creating more transparency on oil revenue for the government is an extremely important matter.
Even if there are not conflicts as such, progress in this area is important also for economic reasons.
In the event of conflict, it becomes totally brutal and perverse.
Mr Gahler related what we discussed here to the broader issue of Africa, mentioning also the coming summit in Lisbon.
One conclusion is that raising these problems with our friends in Africa collectively injects serious substance into the debates we can have at summits such as the one in Lisbon, which is one good reason why we have to ensure that the summit is a success.
We can use those types of meetings to push these issues.
Of course, this will be more effective if we have a clear and clean conscience ourselves.
This is not just an issue in the form of a narrow debate.
I definitely regard the link to using the OECD principles relating to this as a way of advancing transparency in relation to the issue.
For the Commission, this is of the utmost importance.
It is not enough to look at the public budget in a narrow sense when we talk about governance in our partner countries.
I would mention, by way of example, the good effort which is now being tried out in the funding of the oil pipeline in Chad.
This has now been incorporated into a framework of strong conditions governing transparency and the use of the revenue from that pipeline, in the context of the discussions between the World Bank, the IMF, ourselves and the government of Chad.
This is just to illustrate that there are many things that it is possible to do in this.
But definitely the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo is the worse of them all.
In connection with this debate, I have received five motions for resolutions, submitted in accordance with Rule 37(2)
The next item is a report (A5-0002/2003) by Mr McCartin, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action taken by the Commission on the observations accompanying the decision giving discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 2000 financial year (Commission) [COM(2002) 696 - C5-0610/2002 - 2002/2189(DEC)].
Madam President, we granted a discharge to the Commission in April 2002 but we raised quite a number of questions in our motion for a resolution.
The Commission has responded with a hundred comments and answers and explanations in a 60 page document.
We now report in the follow-up, in our comment on the Commission's response.
We underline once again that the Commission under the Treaties has an obligation to make available to Parliament all the necessary information.
It is on this basis that Parliament can examine and investigate all the transactions so that the discharge is not only a procedure, but rather a substantial assurance to the European public that Parliament supervises on their behalf and that a rigorous and thorough investigation is carried out.
In its work, Parliament relies heavily on the Court of Auditors' annual report and its special report.
This forms an important basis for the issues that we raise and investigate.
I believe that, in recent years, the Commission has tried very hard to supply Parliament and the European public with all the information necessary to produce a valid and fair assessment on how the budget is spent.
In the on-going reform process, the Commission is moving in the direction of a system of control and accountability.
This has, I believe, been said by the President of the Court of Auditors in this House.
The Commission is moving towards a system of accountability which will compare with the highest standards of the Member States.
An important point made again in the follow-up to the report is that 80% of the budget is actually administered by the governments of the Member States, while the Commission has final responsibility.
A satisfactory outcome can only be achieved with the full cooperation and efficient administration of the individual governments of all Member States.
The biggest problem still existing, as identified in our discharge motion for resolution, is the fact that, in the administration of the budget for the year 2000, there was under-utilisation of resources in the order of 14%.
Again, we have commented on the recurrence of the same problem in the 2001 budget.
This of course is a failure in the budgetary procedure but various comments have been made by different people and we have asked for a simplification of the regulations.
I believe, however, that what is necessary is a simplification of regional policy and the bringing about of economic and social cohesion.
The cohesion fund and the structural funds will have to be tailored to a more simplified policy if we are to pursue an efficient regional policy, particularly in the enlarged European Union.
