The situation in Iraq and the upcoming difficult situation with Iran do not help to improve the stability of the region.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every human being has the right to live in peace, to live in a democracy and indeed to life itself.
Extremist factions must therefore understand that no nation may be wiped off the map.
This was attempted in the past, even in Europe.
Fortunately, such attempts proved unsuccessful, although they did lead to unspeakable suffering and to tragedy on an unprecedented scale.
At this stage in the history of the Middle East, we should be focusing on the elections in Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
Let us hope that the results of the elections will allow both peoples to move closer to a peaceful solution.
The European Union should now concentrate on the political context.
The Neighbourhood Policy, infrastructure, education, and social issues are certainly important, but the key to a permanent solution lies in politics.
Unless the political situation is resolved there will be no progress along the road to peace in the Middle East.
Â Â  The situation in the Middle East remains a cause for concern, and is of direct relevance to us in Europe given the energy dependence of the EU on foreign powers, much as my own Scotland is in the happy situation of being a net exporter of energy.
The political reforms underway in some Middle East countries are to be welcomed, and the EU could do more to support the growth of democracy in these countries.
Current tension between the EU and Iran over the resumption of the Iranian nuclear programme can only be resolved long term by dialogue, and if we seek the position of honest broker then we must endeavour not to avoid double standards in our dealings with Iran.
Â Â  I would like to inform you that the Conference of the Presidents has just adopted its proposals on the membership of the Equitable Life Assurance Society Committee of Inquiry and of the Temporary Committee on extraordinary rendition.
These proposals have been sent to all Members by e-mail and are now on Parliamentâs website.
The deadline for tabling amendments is this morning at 10.30 a.m. and the vote will take place today at 12.00Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Mrs Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, on the future of the Lisbon Strategy from a gender perspective (2004/2219(INI)) (A6-0402/2005).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, gender equality has not been at the forefront of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
Yet without the active involvement of women, the Lisbon agenda is bound to fail.
Unfortunately, the gender dimension is conspicuous by its absence from European discourse and, more importantly, political action.
Most of the documents produced by the European institutions and the Member States come very much from a male perspective.
It is unacceptable that, in the 21st century, ten years after the Beijing Platform for Action, women still suffer every form of discrimination â be it at work, in the family, in politics or in society at large â and that the reconciliation of family and working life has yet to be achieved, even though family life is acknowledged to be the main factor holding women back in the labour market.
Unemployment stands at 10% for women and 8.3% for men.
Women earn lower salaries, even though they have more qualifications; 58% of graduates and 41% of holders of higher degrees are women.
Politics, business and society as a whole have yet to realise that reconciling the different areas of womenâs lives is a politically and socially relevant question.
Maternity must not be viewed as a problem for employers and for the economy.
Rather than being problematic, in fact, it is actually a service provided to society, which helps to combat low birth rates and the ageing of the population, and to guarantee the sustainability of the social security system.
It is therefore crucial that women should not be penalised for motherhood.
The truth, however, is that women do not make progress in their careers, do not receive regular productivity bonuses, do not receive a share of company profits, and have to accept less significant and less professionally rewarding jobs.
What is more, when a worker of either sex sees that company bosses are more understanding of those who want to leave early to pick up the car than those who want to leave early to pick up the children from school, this says everything about the mentality of those who hold economic power and about the way in which the tasks traditionally assigned to women are undervalued.
It should also be remembered that society is organised along lines drawn by men.
It is they who set the timetables without regard for the fact that children need to be picked up from school and that the fridge needs to be stocked to feed the family.
This is a problem for everyone, not just for women.
Appropriate policies should be put in place to encourage people to share tasks in the home.
Fathers should therefore be granted an inalienable right to parental leave following childbirth or the adoption of a child, without losing any employment rights.
It has been demonstrated that the sharing of family responsibilities between men and women is the first step towards achieving much-needed reconciliation between home life and working life.
With the same rights to a career as men, women must not be forced to do the same work as men outside the home and three times as much in the home.
The involvement of women in the political, social and economic spheres is an essential factor in social progress.
Gender equality is very much a modern, contemporary issue that needs to be part of the EUâs day-to-day political agenda.
One of the EUâs key objectives should be equal representation in the political decision-making bodies.
Integrating women into the decision-making process is a modern-day necessity and an absolute prerequisite in strengthening democracy.
The time has come to abandon the notion that women are capable of working but incapable of making decisions.
The road is long and full of obstacles but we must make our way along that road without wasting any more time.
Women cannot sit around for more generations waiting for mentalities to change and for the system to regulate itself.
They need to be proactive in the fight for the right to be on an equal footing with men, both in the public and private spheres, because nobody voluntarily hands over the power that they have held for centuries.
One thing is for sure: if you have privileges you do not want to lose them; if you are sitting comfortably in the seat of power you will not get up unless you are required to do so.
History has shown that men are less inclined to show their traditional chivalry in such circumstances.
This report seeks to redress some of these problems.
I therefore ask for Parliamentâs support for this report and hope that once it is adopted the Commission and the Member States will take account of the proposals and recommendations contained therein.
I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the contribution of the policy unit, of the secretariat of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality and of those Members who tabled amendments.
Thank you, everyone.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and the motion for a resolution on the future of the Lisbon Strategy from the point of view of the gender perspective.
It is a very useful contribution to our common agenda for growth and employment.
You are clear and very much to the point in showing what the policy of gender equality can bring to the Lisbon Strategy.
The persistence of major disparities between women and men really is a matter of grave concern.
It is essential that we continue our efforts and consolidate the integration of the gender dimension, gender mainstreaming, into all policies.
The need to tackle the disparities between men and women in employment or education and, in particular, the pay gap and its causes must be at the centre of our concerns.
It is important that we tackle the structural inequalities between men and women so that all can participate equally in economic and social life.
This will mean implementing Community law better.
It is important, however, that we tackle all the factors behind these discrepancies, such as the predominance of women in lower paid sectors, the persistence of stereotypes, especially in education and training, or, as you clearly point out, the difficulty of reconciling professional and private life.
The questions of reconciliation between professional and private life are a key aspect of questions of equality.
They must cover all possible aspects: the care of children and dependants, the organisation of working time, new forms of working, etc. Men must also be fully involved in reconciliation measures.
You also underline that we all have a duty of good governance, involving in particular proper coordination between different policies, partnership between institutions and with the competent players, and statistical and analytical monitoring of our policies.
The Commission fully shares these points of view, as evidenced by the annual report on equality between women and men that has been presented at the spring summit since 2004.
The report identifies all these points as priorities for future action.
The Commissionâs commitment to equality between men and women will also be reflected in the roadmap for male/female equality that the Commission will be presenting shortly.
It will highlight the governance aspect in particular, the importance of which you yourself have also very usefully emphasised.
The Commission is also constantly monitoring equality policy in analyses and studies and by developing specific statistics.
Studies are regularly carried out by experts.
These studies are published.
There was a study on reconciling professional and private life in 2005, for example.
Finally, the Commission analyses the gender aspect of Member Statesâ national reform programmes in order to make an important contribution to the âemploymentâ chapter of the annual monitoring report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate MrsÂ Estrela on the excellent work she has done in this report.
It forms part of the work begun with the Lisbon Strategy and, in my view, has highlighted an extraordinarily important factor for men and women in general and for women in particular: the ambitious target of attaining full employment in Europe by 2010.
This target has been set because it is only by reaching that position that Europe will succeed in ensuring that its people have access to the welfare state, which is part of its history and culture and constitutes one of its greatest achievements.
That is the first point I wished to highlight.
The second relates to the target of full employment â 70% of people in work in Europe â taking account of the fact that some countries in northern Europe, like the United States, have already exceeded that threshold: there is no doubt that the presence of women in the job market is not only what women want but also what our entire Community needs.
MrsÂ Estrelaâs report, which we put forward and which the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality adopted, promotes the contribution of women with a view to fulfilling this objective.
How?
Firstly, by emphasising the statistic that has changed our approach to assessing the data.
I very much welcome the fact that, for many countries, having to talk of âemployment ratesâ now rather than the somewhat malleable concept of âunemployment ratesâ signals an important departure, in the same way as having very accurate and precise statistics on all work-related activities and on the role of women in the job market will signal an important departure.
The employment figures are still worrying.
Clearly, what has happened in Europe over the past four years has not helped us to fulfil the Lisbon objectives.
Some factors undoubtedly harm employment levels: the pay gap, which certainly does not make those women who do not need to go to work enthusiastic about doing so; and the need for lifelong training, particularly for older women who, like older men, are among those excluded from the workplace.
Nevertheless, I believe that this resolution represents an important contribution to the Lisbon Strategy and that, together with the â as yet non-existent â resources, it will help us to meet the targets that have been set.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the Social-Democratic Group has taken on the task of drawing up Mrs Estrelaâs own-initiative report and carrying out the mid-term review, and it has found that the gender dimension is being short-changed in the Lisbon Strategy.
The motto âequal pay for equal workâ has already been mentioned.
We have had that on paper for years, but it has not been put into practice.
The reality is an EU average of 15% to something over 30%.
Things cannot go on like that.
In business, women are largely absent from executive positions.
We even have good models outside the European Union â take Norway, for one.
In Norway, the government has passed a law requiring 40% of supervisory board members in quoted companies to be women.
Have the courage to take such initiatives, Commissioner, and make this part of the road map.
The demand for independence must not be left only on paper.
The social partners must be more active here.
I am getting sick and tired of always hearing that it is because of womenâs qualifications.
As we have already heard, women are now better educated and there are far more women graduates than male graduates, but we have still not broken through the glass ceiling.
There must therefore be other reasons why women are not coming through, and I have to say there is a lack of political will here.
Again and again there has been much talk of good will here in this House and in the Commission.
So where is the snag?
Why is it that women â even in politics â are still not achieving the breakthrough?
Here Mrs Estrelaâs report is helping to stir us up again and to ensure that the role of men changes.
Reconciling family and working life and gender mainstreaming are not matters for women alone.
I am therefore asking you to increase the pressure.
I am asking the Commission at long last to present the road map and not merely to describe the facts again but to be really courageous and move forward.
The new Gender Institute will be an important and courageous step.
It will enable us to demonstrate that Europe is taking equality seriously.
I am therefore asking you to translate words into action.
The Lisbon Model and the Lisbon Strategy can only be successful if women are fully integrated.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact is that the Lisbon Strategy, reworked in Gothenburg to include the sustainable development strategy, is aimed at achieving economic growth and social cohesion and at reducing poverty in the Union and, to this end, it states that the three complementary pillars on which it should be based are the economic, the social and the environmental.
All three are equally important, Commissioner.
Given that social inclusion within the Lisbon Strategy relates specifically to women, I would like to congratulate MrsÂ Estrela on her report, because it offers an excellent opportunity to remind the Council and the Commission of the need, where the gender perspective is concerned, to incorporate a transversal dimension into all of the Unionâs policies.
As the report states explicitly, better coordination is needed between the policy of gender mainstreaming, on the one hand, and the Lisbon Strategy on the other, with a view to taking systematic account of the gender perspective in achieving the ambitious Lisbon objectives, particularly in the broad economic policy guidelines, the employment guidelines, environmental policy â i.e. the REACH Directive â internal market policy â i.e. the Bolkenstein Directive on services â and, finally, the policies on integrating immigrants.
Furthermore, there is also an obvious link between the Beijing Action Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy, and the need to take advantage of the productive potential of male and female European workers is therefore crucial to compliance with both agendas.
Finally, as has also been said, we support the amendment presented by Mrs GrÃ¶ner and Mrs Estrela calling on the Commission to make the reconciliation of family life and employment one of the priorities of the gender equality road map, which is currently under discussion, and, in cooperation with the Member States, the social partners and other actors, to review the suitability and effectiveness of Directive 96/34/EC.
That review should focus on how to improve the situation of women and men with a view to reconciling family life and employment for both genders, which would be a key factor in terms of achieving gender equality in all aspects of life.
Mr President, EU leaders promised to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by 2010, yet more than half way through the ten-year period of the Lisbon Agenda this has not happened.
In the light of this, the Lisbon Agendaâs pledge to tackle gender equality must also be viewed with a degree of scepticism.
Mrs Estrelaâs report put forward practical measures for ensuring gender equality, including employment opportunities for women, and I thank her for her very good work.
The creation of employment opportunities is not about providing women with low-paid jobs or with less favourable working conditions.
Such opportunities must have at their core equality for women on a par with their male counterparts.
On average there is a pay gap of 15% across the EU, but in a recent survey in my country, Ireland, it emerged that the gender pay gap has grown: it has increased for women in spite of Irelandâs economic growth.
Irish women are paid 17% less than Irish men for the same work, so it is clear, as Mrs Estrela says, that growth and jobs alone will not bring gender equality.
President Barroso told Parliament yesterday of his commitment to the roadmap for gender equality, dealing amongst other matters with employment and with reducing the pay gap.
I commend Mrs Estrelaâs report to him and to Commissioner Michel as a good basis for progress in this area.
The present emphasis on achieving growth at the expense of social inclusion, of working conditions and of environmental protection will not in any way lead us in the direction of greater gender equality.
That needs to be addressed through positive action and not simply lip service.
Â Â  . Mr President, when the Heads of State or Government of the Member States met in Lisbon and adopted the Lisbon Strategy, they acted as if they were directors of production companies.
According to the aforementioned Strategy, the European Union was to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, and was to overtake the United States of America.
One of the long-term aims set was a 70% increase in the employment rate. This is to be achieved by raising the retirement age, thus depriving citizens of the restful retirement they are entitled to.
Another aim set is to use human capital to greater advantage by making workers more productive.
Europeans themselves are opposed to this, as they wish to have more leisure time and longer holidays.
Certain Members of the House are very familiar with pressure of this kind. It was a feature of the Soviet Communist era, especially of the 1950âs.
People were worked so hard that they would achieve 200% of the target set only to die of exhaustion before being awarded posthumous medals.
In the spirit of gender equality, women are now also supposed to go out to work, instead of bringing up their children.
The Strategy calls for the provision of day-care facilities for at least 90% of children over three years of age, and for at least 30% of children below three.
Sadly, we are all too familiar with the results of a similar experiment that took place during Socialismâs darkest and most misguided period.
Society needs to understand that no institution can ever replace a mother when it comes to caring for young children, even up to the age of seven.
Only a mother can provide the kind of love that is essential for a child to develop properly.
It would therefore be more appropriate for the Strategy to provide payments and pension rights for mothers bringing up their children.
This would help reduce unemployment.
More importantly, it would be the best investment we could make for our future, because children and young people are our future.
We are opposed to treating individuals simply as units of labour and to the exploitation of women.
Women should enjoy special protection, as it is they who bear and bring up the next generation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, at the March 2000 Lisbon European Council, the European Union set itself the ambitious target of reaching a 60% employment rate for women by 2010.
I fully support those ambitions and very much hope they will not be in vain, because many ideas are put forward, plans made and dossiers and reports written on the subject of equality between men and women, but few concrete results are seen.
Social, pay and professional disparities are always a live issue in France and throughout Europe, too.
Whether it is the improvement of childcare services â in particular by increasing the number of facilities available â or the promotion of new forms of working such as teleworking to make it easier to reconcile professional, family and private life, all these measures are much more effective in helping to promote equality between men and women than the systematic forced application of the concept of non-discrimination advocated by certain feminist lobbies that are very active in the European Parliament and which they use at every opportunity and always for highly ideological purposes.
I am pleased to say that my colleague MrsÂ Estrelaâs report is along these lines.
We will all gain from showing pragmatism and common sense.
Finally, I think it is also particularly important to take account of the distinctive cultural and ethnic characteristics which often stand in the way of promoting equality between men and women.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time we have debated the problems of the participation of women in the productive process and their implications for our progress and social cohesion.
However, it is the first time that we have had an integrated and global approach to the matter as in MrsÂ Estrela's report, which highlights the central position of the gender dimension in achieving the Lisbon objectives.
I thank Mrs Estrela for her initiative and her work and the members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality who took part in this endeavour.
Other speakers have spoken about discrimination and the problems which women face today on the job market as regards their access and deployment and the particular problems which vulnerable groups face in our society, such as female immigrants and elderly women.
Today we can see that no social model in the European Union has addressed this matter with any noteworthy success.
However, the various experiences are worth studying and researching in depth, so that they can be used in the policy guidelines of the European Union and in efforts by the Member States.
That is why I should like to ask the European Commission to address the issue of the different concepts and methods used to calculate participation in the job market.
We do not all have the same definition of unemployment, seasonal unemployment and long-term unemployment.
We therefore need to address these concepts in as uniform a manner as possible, so that we can record the actual situation and give the real dimensions and directions to our task, both in the European Union and in the Member States.
Similarly, the Commission should take account of the significant differences in concepts and policies concerning parental leave, use of rights and so forth. We cannot talk about efforts to achieve the Lisbon objectives when there are so many different concepts and approaches in the Member States.
I should also like to emphasise the importance which must be attached to the proposal in the Estrela report for a collective and global approach to the question of women.
Mainstreaming, which is a European Union philosophy, must be incorporated into all policies and evaluations both in the European Union and in the Member States' action plans.
Finally, I should like to ask you, in the European Commission's evaluations of progress made in achieving the Lisbon objectives and in evaluations of the various funds, to ensure that we always have this mainstreaming dimension.
Our committee will be your ally in this endeavour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur, MrsÂ Edite Estrela, who has done an excellent piece of work on which I hope you will be able to draw, Commissioner.
How can we continue to aspire to making the European Unionâs economy the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 without eradicating the continuing disparities between men and women?
Half way through the Lisbon Strategy, we can unfortunately only note a failure to achieve these objectives.
The gender dimension cannot remain confined to only a few areas of this strategy.
It is a horizontal and transverse element that cannot be ignored and cannot be reduced to a mere box-ticking exercise in an impact assessment.
It means concentrating on the systems and structures that create and maintain inequalities and accentuate differences.
Three percentage points more women than men are unemployed. 33% of women work part time involuntarily compared to 6% of men.
Only 10% of women achieve high-level positions.
The pay gap ranges from 6 to 30% for the same work, despite equal treatment having been a fundamental principle of Community law since 1957.
If Europe wants to reach its growth and employment targets, it is time to change the way people think.
Womenâs working hours must remain a choice and not a constraint that makes their position insecure.
Womenâs access to lifelong learning must be optimised.
There must be a real political will to create measures for the family that will allow men and women to reconcile professional, family and social life: more childcare facilities at affordable prices, and more parental leave for men to allow them to give themselves more to bringing up their children.
We must make the gender perspective an absolute priority as a matter of urgency and fulfil the promise of a Europe based on the values of democracy, equality and social justice for allÂ âÂ women as well as men.
Â Â  Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy must not be confined to economic policy objectives, but it must also contain principles for strengthening social cohesion and sustainable development.
We must make clear that gender equality also has a central role to play in the Lisbon process. We must also make clear that the Member States really must implement the Barcelona guidelines on childcare.
Reconciling family and professional life must stop being pie in the sky and mere empty words; it must be at the forefront of the Lisbon process.
We must also make the Member Statesâ responsibilities clear on this.
We must also point out, however, that a lot of things need to be put under the microscope, such as social security and pension systems in the Member States, which are biased in favour of the childless and discriminate against families with children.
We must have the courage to put all that under the microscope at last.
We must also draw attention to the gender-specific wage gap that still exists in the European Union; it is between 15 and 33%.
That must be a wake-up call for us to do more for gender equality in the European Union.
We must make clear, furthermore, that alongside these better childcare objectives we also need to fight against the massive discrimination to which women are still subject despite having a higher educational attainment than men; we see this repeatedly with the wide pay gap in the European Union in particular.
Greater flexibility in working hours in order to reconcile family and professional life should also be much more central.
We are aware that demographic trends are an enormous problem in the European Union and that we must do all we can to really encourage people here.
We must make clear that having children also brings happiness and enriches life, and we must provide incentives for families.
We cannot stand by while child allowances and the like are basically only alms for families with children, which are quite clearly discriminated against by social security and pension systems.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, reality has borne out our frequent warnings that the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy only prioritised liberalisations and the flexibility of the labour market. Alongside the Stability and Growth Pact, this is having a detrimental impact in the social field, affecting women in particular.
Stating that urgent measures must be taken to promote jobs, high-quality jobs and the social inclusion of women in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives is simply not enough.
What is needed is to reverse the policies that are jeopardising equal rights and fomenting discrimination against women, especially in the workplace.
As such, in addition to increased unemployment among women affected by the restructuring and relocation of multinationals and by industrial sectors affected by the liberalisation of internal trade, such as textiles, clothing, footwear and many others, the new jobs being created are increasingly precarious, badly paid and discriminatory, and fail to respect the rights of female employees.
Even so, within the scope of the so-called âLisbon Strategyâ, there are new proposals for a directive on the table that may exacerbate discrimination against women, worsen the unemployment situation and deepen social exclusion still further.
These include the proposal for a directive on the organisation of working time and the notorious Bolkestein Directive on the liberalisation of the services sector.
For this reason, it is impossible to go on claiming to be defending womenâs rights while systematically undermining those rights, be it via the broad economic policy guidelines, or via policies and measures aimed at creating an internal market.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is crucial that, at the very least, the Community institutions and the Member States take this report on board.
Â Â  Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy set out the objective of an employment rate of 60% for women to be achieved by 2010 and a full employment rate for those available for work by 2010.
This will not be achieved.
The Lisbon Strategy is yet another way of damaging European economies through state interference and over-regulation.
This report is typical of the socialistic approach so beloved of this Parliament.
It recognises the problem, which is that the economies of Europe need to be more competitive and that Europe is rapidly losing its competitive position, but then sets about devising measures that are either irrelevant or will actually make the problem worse.
The report recommends that Member States take measures to ensure that the most disadvantaged women, especially single parents, are guaranteed a minimum income.
What could be more calculated to create unemployment than guaranteeing a minimum income for not working?
The report states that earnings and working conditions in many Member States, particularly in large commercial chains, are an affront to womenâs dignity and are often the cause of miscarriages and disability.
Absolutely no evidence is produced for this outrageous statement.
I can assure you that any commercial chain in Britain that caused miscarriages and disability would soon find itself in the law courts.
The way to ensure maximum employment for those people, both men and women, who want to work, is to get off the backs of businesses and deregulate.
There should indeed be equal pay for equal work, and to help those parents who wish to stay at home and look after children we should lessen the tax burden on the parents who work, as indeed we should lessen the tax burden on all who wish to work.
Such policies will never happen in the socialistic EU, which is another reason why Britain should leave the European Union and take the actions required to ensure economic regeneration and prosperity while it still can.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Strategy is an excellent document but, as European Commission president Mr Barroso has told the European Parliament, it lacks realism.
This is why IÂ would like to welcome this report and to express my thanks to the author, who seeks to address in her text the issues of gender equality.
Are we still trying to identify the goals of the Lisbon Strategy when the process is already into its second half?
To me this seems somewhat late in the day.
In section IÂ of the report the distinguished MEP refers to the Beijing Platform Fraction.
It is deplorable that I was the only EU representative to attend, when the womenâs rights conference in Beijing subjected the Beijing Platform and its practical implementation to its tenth assessment.
My concern is that this report will turn out to be one of those that describe accurately the situation and status of women in the EU Member States, whether in terms of employment, social situation or health, but whose substance will not be applied in practice.
IÂ still entertain the hope that the report will not be put on the shelf, however, and my hope has been strengthened by the Austrian presidency, which includes womenâs health among its priorities.
Here again we encounter another problem, though, as the health care systems of the Member States are, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, subject to the purview and decision-making powers of the Member States.
Since we know that the health sector in the EU member countries is going through an extremely difficult reform, health protection should be coordinated at an EU level.
For a woman to be able to fill her position in society, be an equal partner in the workplace and a good mother, she must enjoy good health.
The protection of female health in an ageing population should be one of the most important goals of the Lisbon Strategy, whether in the form of preventive examinations to detect breast cancer and cervical cancer or research into the causes of premature birth and increasing infertility.
Â Â  â Allow me first and foremost to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, and to the shadow rapporteurs and other members of the Committee for Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality for the work they have done in support of this own-initiative report.
The report by Mr Wim Kok has convinced us that the Lisbon Strategy requires thorough revision from aÂ gender equality standpoint as well.
We must not forget the competencies of women and the special nature of their important role, and this applies in a context broader than the economies of the Member States.
Finding a proper work-life balance requires us to take account of the social mission of women in improving the demographic situation in Europe.
Under no circumstances should we overlook the formally unrecognised and still unpaid work that women are doing.
To this end, we should develop the relevant methodology, along with evaluation techniques and statistical reporting.
I am convinced that the social recognition and financial remuneration of this work will significantly enhance the economic situation and social status of women.
Let me remind you of one of the conclusions and objectives of the European Council formulated in March 2000 â full employment in Europe, in aÂ new emerging society that is better attuned to the personal choices of women and men.
It is not enough to ensure that all people are employed.
Under the communist regimes there was one hundred percent employment and we know what economic standards were like then.
It is not enough for all citizens to be able to use computers and to apply the available information effectively.
The primary focus of the Lisbon Strategy is an economic one, but the strategy can succeed only if it contributes to the cultural advancement of Europe as well.
European cultural standards cannot be divorced from the issues of equal opportunity and gender equality.
Europe will be credible only if the women, men and children inhabiting it do not have to endure extreme poverty and social exclusion, and only if its citizens can in their everyday lives think critically, comprehend social phenomena and communicate well, that is, humanely, with each other.
Â Â  Mr President, in the third millennium, a woman has to have the opportunity to decide whether she wants to work or stay at home.
If she chooses to work, she has to be judged according to her performance, not according to her sex.
Women hold the key to achieving the Lisbon Strategyâs overarching goal of creating more growth and jobs in the European Union.
Increasing the participation of women in the labour market must be a top priority for the EU.
Higher participation rates for women will help tackle Europeâs demographic challenges, as well as increasing growth and productivity.
However, these advances must go hand-in-hand with greater gender equality in the labour market.
Discrimination against women, occupational segregation and pregnancy discrimination exists on a large scale.
Moreover, the gender pay gap persists across Europe.
It currently stands at 15% for full-time jobs, but is as high as 40% for part-time jobs.
The PSE Group believes in targeted actions to help promote the employment of the most vulnerable groups of our societies, namely older women, those belonging to ethnic minorities and women with disabilities.
The development of a knowledge-based society makes high demands on the educational level of the labour force.
Girls are outperforming boys at school and more women than men participate in adult education and training.
We must make better use of this potential and there must be a lifelong approach to ensuring gender equality from education through to career development and adequate pensions for women.
We need to fight for a gender-equal society which is fit for the 21st century and forms an integral part of our European social model.
Some progress has been made in recent years, but there is still so much to do.
The onus for achieving the overarching goals of the Lisbon Strategy ultimately lies with Member States, which must urgently take up their responsibilities to ensure these ambitious goals are made a reality.
Â Â  â Mr President, the measures being proposed in the report being debated appear to want to address female unemployment and equality problems, but really result in cutbacks to and the abolition of any positive arrangements and rights achieved by women through the hard struggle of the working-class, grass-roots and women's movement.
They relate to the application of the Lisbon Strategy.
They promote part-time employment, employment with flexible hours, shift work and fixed term contracts in the home care, social, health and other sectors, thereby resulting in more intensive exploitation of women, less secure employment and, consequently, increased levels of unemployment and uncertainty.
Commissioner, it is working women, it is working-class women who are being crushed by the anti-grass roots policy, because wealthy women have no such problems.
The report also highlights the standard model and philosophy of the family as a production unit which solves the needs of its members.
In our opinion, it is very, very dangerous.
The responsibilities of the man are being increased in order to convince working-class families that responsibility for the reproduction of their members lies with them.
Thus, you are putting the entire burden on the family, the problem of children and of health and of education and, at the same time, you are putting these sectors in the hands of crude traders, of dealers who buy and sell, and leading the working classes into an impasse.
We consider that the measures lead away from the demand for women to be integrated into the social opus alongside a state policy which will help women and mothers and protect children and the elderly.
These are proposals which ultimately aim to downgrade and further privatise and commercialise existing social services, with the consent of women and working class families.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Edite Estrela, for this own-initiative report.
The recommendations in the report challenge the countries to take urgent measures towards attaining the Lisbon agenda goals of advancing employment, employment quality and the social inclusion of women, bearing in mind the major economic potential to be tapped by higher rates of womenâs employment.
If we are to meet the Lisbon objective of 60% employment among women in the Union by the year 2010, we must start implementing the relevant measures in practice.
The Member States and the Commission should continue to focus on taking effective measures in support of growth, primarily among Europeâs poorest regions, where the lack of jobs forces people, primarily women, to accept jobs with large retail chains in many Member States involving humiliating working conditions, unacceptable hours and extremely low pay.
I know what I am talking about, as I live in the outlying region of PreÅ¡ov in Slovakia, where the average unemployment rate is around 23% and the average [monthly] pay is about SKK 12,000, which is approximately EUR 300.
It is extremely important to establish a business-friendly environment, to promote the business spirit of women and ensure the availability of micro-credit to help women start up their own businesses.
The position of women in countries with a functioning micro-credit system has changed significantly.
Additionally, it is necessary to ensure that women enjoy better access to post-university level education and life-long learning, as well as to new technologies and the Information Society so as to enable them to cope with the competition in the labour market.
To ensure that EU enlargement acts as a catalyst for improving gender equality policy in the new member countries, we must also improve the standards for implementing measures in national legislation that are intended to eliminate gender inequality in employment, remuneration and/or political representation.
Ladies and gentlemen, IÂ am convinced that women are aÂ key to meeting the Lisbon objectives and, hence, deserve the attention of European institutions and governments of the Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurâs report highlights a worrying and, unfortunately, often overlooked fact: the inequality between women and men in research persists and is preventing compliance with the Lisbon objectives.
In the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we had hoped to obtain more resources for research in the new budget.
More and better research and, therefore, more resources for research together constitute the most crucial weapon in the fight for competition and growth in Europe.
Unfortunately, the budget negotiations recently struggled through resulted in insufficient priority being given to research. That is a great pity.
The strategies in the Lisbon Agenda are the guarantee of Europeâs future.
Even though the EUâs research programmes only constitute a small portion of total resources for research in Europe, we must think very carefully when we set our priorities.
The very fact that European women are still under-represented in the research world, despite women now being better educated than men, signifies that Europe has huge potential that is not being exploited.
That is something that, emphatically, we must do something about.
Few high-ranking female academics have spouses and children, while their male counterparts, more often than not, do.
Young female candidates have difficulty obtaining research posts.
Throughout Europe, most newly qualified candidates are, in actual fact, women but, higher up the career ladder, men are still firmly ensconced.
Now, in particular, it is important to be aware of the fact that women are more vulnerable than men, for the competition for research funds is tough.
We must increase the proportion of top women academics and PhD students in order to meet the challenges we face.
Investing in education, research and innovation is our only opportunity for coping successfully in the knowledge-based economy.
The unexploited female potential for research is the nuclear power of the future.
We must become better at encouraging young women to choose a research career, and we must at the same time secure better conditions for both women and men in the research world.
For example, by far the majority of research posts in Europe are at present temporary and, if we do not remedy that state of affairs soon, public research will end up taking second place behind private research.
In the longer term, this may mean that most university teachers will be women, reflecting the situation further down the education ladder in the school system, while men find employment in industrial research, which is better paid and more prestigious and in which only 15% of researchers are at present women.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a lot to be done if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and one thing must be clear: we will only get there with women.
There is still an unreasonably wide pay gap between men and women in many Member States.
There is still discrimination over promotion.
The family still has to fit in with the job. Jobs ought to be geared to the needs of families, however.
All areas certainly need to be thought through with an eye to gender mainstreaming, but they must also be thought through with an eye to family mainstreaming.
New approaches need to be found here.
We agree and do not like saying all that, but women still need greater support to develop their entrepreneurial spirit.
Women make a contribution to Europeâs economic efficiency and competitiveness.
Education and lifelong learning are the keywords.
The greatest potential of Europeâs citizens is and remains their knowledge and that must continue to be promoted on a basis of equality.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, for going into the many issues thoroughly in her report.
MrsÂ Thomsen has referred to the area of âwomen and researchâ, and I would like to highlight another field, namely domestic employment in the private sphere.
There is basically no sensible reason at all for treating a job in the household differently from a job in industry or commerce.
If a husband and wife go out to work and someone is engaged to do the housekeeping, that is a job, not a private pleasure.
On the other hand, if our families were provided with competent domestic services â both in caring for and raising children and young people and in looking after and nursing the elderly â large areas of social work would be effectively covered and valuable jobs created at the same time.
A recognised, insurable employment also brings in contributions to social security systems and opens the way for many women to leave moonlighting for legal work with social provision for old age and sickness.
I think these are also reasons why such work is unpopular.
Something that costs nothing is not accorded equal status and is not recognised as being worth anything and nobody wants that.
We must create awareness in this area instead of further devaluing it with subsistence wages.
The Member States must raise prospects: financially and fiscally as well as in the mind.
Because a family-friendly society in Europe is the only way we will achieve the Lisbon objectives.
The Lisbon Strategy is an opportunity for us to focus on these important areas. We must do this to crank up the process and keep it moving.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when the European Council met in Lisbon in 2000, it approved a number of strategic objectives aimed at making the European Union a dynamic and competitive economy over ten years.
That economy was to be capable of high economic growth rates and poverty reduction.
Five years have gone by, and the results have yet to be felt.
Most of the measures agreed remain on paper.
Concerns are being expressed not only about the lack of results in the economic field, but also about the lack of progress in combating discrimination.
Women continue to fare worse than men on the European labour market. This is clear from the significant pay gap between men and women and from the obstacles the latter are confronted with when seeking employment.
Although the percentage of women in employment in Europe rose slightly in 2003, it remains the case that only slightly over half of European women work outside the home.
New jobs created for women tend to be insecure and poorly paid, and womenâs pension rights are considerably lower than menâs.
Currently, 58% of people with higher education qualifications in Europe are women.
Nonetheless, they tend to be promoted less frequently and still earn between 15% and 40% less than men for work of equal value.
If the Lisbon Strategy is to be implemented, priority must be given to specific actions aimed at supporting and promoting employment for women and female entrepreneurship.
Changes to an employment policy that discriminates against women are essential, especially in view of the theories propounded recently according to which a womanâs so-called natural role is in the home, and that in the 21st century womenâs role in society should be simply to keep house.
If women withdrew from the labour market men might be able to fill the vacancies created.
A number of Polish politicians believe that this would be an effective way to combat unemployment.
Is this really the road an innovative and competitive Europe should go down?
I very much hope not, and therefore strongly support MrsÂ Estrelaâs report.
Â Â  â Mr President, it has been said repeatedly that the European strategy on employment is a basic means of applying the Lisbon Strategy and makes provision for a European employment rate of 70% and, more importantly, a female employment rate of 60%.
The own-initiative report on which we are being called to vote today, whose rapporteur, Mrs Estrela, I honestly congratulate, together with the committee and honourable Members who participated today in the debate â because they truly have enriched the subject with their ideas â will help to realise this objective, while safeguarding the much-debated equal treatment and the qualitative improvement of the opportunity for women to participate in the job market.
Women in the Union not only account for over half the overall population, but also represent 58% of university graduates and 41% of PhD graduates.
They are a resource which must be maintained through lifelong learning and developed in quality jobs and new forms of services, such as part-time employment, teleworking and flexible hours which are chosen of their own free will and will not end up splitting women's personality to the point at which they become schizophrenic.
Situations such as these arise not only from unequal treatment on pay, but also from a lack of legal protection in professional development, which is affected by family life and, whether we like it or not, it is on this family life that the demographic development of the Union depends.
Inequality begins in the training period.
From this study period onwards there is a difference of treatment which obstructs family development.
At the same time, there is no harmonisation of predictions in order to safeguard these times as working times.
Objectives to meet 90% of the demand for day-care facilities for school-age children and 33% for infants are not enough, unless quality preschool education is provided, which is only the case in a few European countries.
These places must be cheap and must not be accompanied by a reduction in women's income. However, women's income is reduced by different treatment of their tax and pensions.
Another issue which was raised and which I too for my part wish to emphasise is the acknowledgment of non-standard work by women.
Help must be given not only to mothers of single-parent families, but also to mothers in general bringing up one, two or more children.
This is the only way we shall be able to be proud of the fact that we are trying to make Europe the leading world power and to support the development and prosperity which will come from social cohesion.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Estrela on her report and add something to what has been said so far, most of which I agree with.
Ladies and gentlemen, if, as paragraph 23 of the report states, the aim is to achieve greater coordination between gender equality policies and the Lisbon Strategy in order to take better account of the gender perspective in fulfilling the objectives set out for the European Union in 2000, I would like to draw attention to what is still the very small number of women both in the scientific and technological fields and in important decision-making positions in the business world.
If, as the Lisbon objectives state, we want Europe to become a dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, then science, technology and innovation must play a fundamental role in it, yet the participation of women in these fields, at all levels, still far from matches that of men.
This is a question not only of justice, but also of efficiency.
Women make up approximately half of the population, and to use just half of the brains available to us is neither intelligent nor efficient.
The studies prior to the negotiation of the Seventh Framework Research and Development Programme, which is underway, showed us that Europe needs 750Â 000 new, properly trained male and female researchers.
This is the time to take the necessary measures to ensure, without giving up on excellence, that men and women have equal access to these new jobs.
The majority of studies carried out have also stressed the lack of data broken down by gender in scientific and technological fields.
This is a further difficulty in terms of implementing effective policies that tackle the roots of the problem.
The European Institute for Gender Equality will have to play an important role and deal with this deficiency as a matter of priority.
We would call on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to take the action necessary in order to make progress on resolving this problem.
To do so is essential if the Lisbon Strategy is to bring the success that all women and men want to see.
Â Â  Analysis of growth in the European Union has shown that we are not taking a sufficiently effective or serious approach to the fulfilment of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy.
The fact that in the area of employment and wages women are still in a markedly worse position than men is something that is quite unbelievable and completely unacceptable for the countries of the European Union in this day and age.
In view of the fact that we are encountering a serious problem in Europe, namely an aging population and a low birth rate, we must deal with the issue of inequality in the workplace in conjunction with these problems.
This should be of sufficient concern for us to direct all our efforts, both in the European Union and in our individual Member States, towards determining the causes of this issue and to finding as effective and serious a solution as possible.
We need the genuine cooperation of the whole of society, since responsibility for the present situation cannot simply be lumped onto women, who are no longer prepared to assume total care of children and at the same time to find themselves often financially disadvantaged, first in the short term, and then in the long term when they retire.
What we need, therefore, are appropriate legal measures, the consensus of the whole of society, and the readiness of both female and male citizens to take on the responsible yet wonderful job that we call parenthood.
In this we must enhance societyâs positive attitude to life and encourage women not to miss or renounce that most beautiful mission and joy in life that motherhood brings.
Motherhood does not necessarily preclude a professional or political career, you just need to choose the appropriate time for each thing.
We may even look to the women Members of the European Parliament as a model, since some of us can boast three, five and even nine or ten children.
And these very Members did not come to Parliament to rest, but are working very responsibly and effectively, since they know how to work with a feeling for the needs of the individual, and they also have a feeling for the community.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the very few men who have been present at this debate and the even smaller number who have spoken.
It all goes to show that women are right to say there is still a lot of work to be done.
I therefore wanted to truly congratulate those who have taken part in the debate, because it deals with a subject that does not concern women alone, but is the concern of all of society and everyone involved in society.
That is the perspective in which the Commission intends working on this problem.
I would also like to say that I share the main ideas that have been expressed in this Assembly and to which I have listened most attentively.
I do not, on the other hand, agree with certain speakers who want to keep women in stereotypical roles, I would go so far as to say roles of another age.
Working women are not the cause of unemployment.
That is an argument we hear all too often in some quarters and it is clearly against such arguments that we need to fight, because they are preventing significant progress being made in some countries.
That being the case, what is the Commission doing?
I would like to point out that, for the most part, the demands that have been made are matters for national policy.
It is still up to the Member States to legislate on the major questions that have been raised.
I do of course recognise that the Commission has its part to play and I am going to explain the areas where it intends taking action and how.
The new integrated guidelines clearly restate the necessity of making the gender dimension, gender mainstreaming, part of all employment policies and they reaffirm the need to promote equality between men and women in every action undertaken.
The new strategy for employment takes up the target of a 60% employment rate in 2010.
In particular, it includes in the guidelines the elimination of gender disparities and the promotion of reconciliation between professional and private life.
The Commission has also made mainstreaming a fundamental principle of Community action.
May I remind you that it is included as such in Article 3 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community.
Mainstreaming is implemented through a Community framework strategy for equality between women and men.
This strategy seeks to establish a framework for action in which all Community activities, including economic activities and policies and employment policy, can contribute to achieving the objective of eliminating inequality and promoting equality between women and men.
The Commission is currently preparing a roadmap for equality between men and women, which will take over from the framework strategy starting in 2007.
Like the framework strategy, its aim will be to implement gender mainstreaming effectively in all Community policies, and more particularly the Lisbon Strategy.
I would like to say a word about the pay gap.
The pay gap between men and women is a complex phenomenon and discrimination is not its only cause.
In fact, it results from a number of factors, such as segregation on the employment market, the persistence of stereotypes, especially in education and training, and the difficulty of reconciling professional and private life.
We therefore need to respond to all these underlying factors.
I would like to emphasise the particular attention we intend paying to reducing the pay gap in the employment strategy.
Two guidelines call explicitly on the Member States and the social partners to work towards this.
It should also be noted that the Austrian Presidency has announced its intention of organising a conference on the subject of the pay gap in Brussels at the end of May, and I think it will be quite a special opportunity for making new progress in this field.
A word on the method of studying and analysing the changing position of women on the employment market from the point of view of awareness of their rights and of the role of men.
The Commission is constantly monitoring equality policy and regularly undertakes or commissions analyses and studies of the economic and legal aspects of equality.
The annual report on equality between men and women, which the Commission has presented to the spring summit of the Heads of State or Government since 2004, is a very important document for monitoring the question of male-female equality in the European Union.
The report sets out the main changes in the respective positions of women and men in education, employment and social life.
It identifies the progress made and the challenges still to be taken up.
From this point of view, too, the Commission is also analysing the Member Statesâ national reform programmes under the Lisbon Strategy, and this will be an important contribution to the âEmploymentâ chapter of the annual monitoring report.
How does the Commission intend improving the statistical methodology to take account of the gender aspect?
The gender dimension is of course included in the statistics.
This is done by using a statistical methodology and statistical data that take account of the gender aspect.
As the draft resolution underlines, the availability of adequate, consistent and comparable statistical indicators is absolutely essential for policy monitoring.
Eurostat is collaborating actively with the national statistical institutes in order to put in place a common methodology that will enable reliable and comparable data to be collected at European level.
It is in fact important that such data should be collected at that level.
The future Institute for Gender Equality should also make a significant contribution to improving the statistical monitoring of equality policy.
I would nevertheless like to point out, because I believe it is useful to tell things as they are, that this institute will be primarily a technical instrument and will certainly not be a political body or a supplier of financial resources.
Such, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the Commissionâs response; it fully shares the concerns expressed in the report and once again congratulates the rapporteur on her excellent work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0080/2005 â B6-0345/2005) by MrÂ Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on disability and development.
Â Â  . Mr President, you, the Commissioner and I all live with a disability.
If we are without our glasses, we cannot operate; I cannot read, I cannot drive or avoid bumping into things, but I live in a society where I am helped to overcome that disability and therefore to function, even as a Member of this Parliament.
However, if I lived in a developing country I would be less fortunate.
One in ten people in developing countries live with disabilities.
One in four families in poverty in developing countries has some member living with a disability.
That is the challenge, but this debate is not just about long faces, sympathy and pity; it is about celebrating the abilities of people with disability and seeing how we can enable them to function and to contribute to their own lives, economies and communities.
Our policy, or resolution, is all about ending rejection, ending the concept of a scrap-heap, ending stigma where disability is concerned.
We want a policy of prevention, of care, of enablement and of human rights.
We want an end to no-go areas for people with disabilities.
We want, if I can use the phrase, to see disability .
We want to see a break with that link to poverty so inevitable for people with ill health and disability in developing countries: no wealth without health, but no income without medicine.
No income means no medicine; no transport means no school; no health certificate means no work; no access means no opportunity to prove oneâs worth.
It is not just about mobility, it is about all the disabilities that we have to learn to cope with in our different ways, whether it is sight, hearing, learning difficulties, respiratory problems or seizures.
Our policy must be twin-track, and I use that word advisedly: it is in the guidance that the Commission has produced.
It is the twin-track of prevention and care services. It is the twin-track of policy for people with disabilities and policies developed by people with disabilities, decided by them, with their involvement in policy making.
We remember with pleasure those Ugandan members taking the seats specially reserved for them in the Ugandan Parliament for people with disabilities.
We want to see support for organisations of disabled people.
We want recognition that neglected diseases are some of the biggest causes of disability.
Some need those new partnerships to develop drugs; many need access to the drugs that we in the West take for granted.
I live with diabetes.
I have said that on many occasions.
However, I can function with the pills, blood tests and specialist attention that I receive to overcome that and to live a reasonably normal life.
But when I was in Mali and went to see the services there for people with diabetes, I saw one room in a clinic and one in a hospital with people with amputations of legs and arms, losing their sight, their liver destroyed and facing early death.
We need a policy that helps people to overcome.
Those people could be contributing to the economy of Mali.
Our ACP adopted resolutions in Brussels in 2001, in Cape Town in 2002 and in the Year of People with Disabilities, in 2003, in Europe, we got the guidance note.
But that is one of the best-kept secrets in Europe and in the developing world.
My plea to the Commissioner is to draw out the excellent words of that and put them into practice.
In particular, we do not want to see any more public European money used to continue building barriers for people with disabilities.
The years 1999 to 2009 are the African Decade of Disabled People, set up by the African Union.
That target date coincides with the end of our term as Parliamentarians and Commissioners.
By that date I hope we will look back and say that we made the effort to help disabled people achieve, to enable them, and to make them real, whole people in the economies and communities in which they live.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the guidance note on disability serves as a benchmark for taking account of disability issues in development policy.
Incidentally, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the specific and obviously very interesting light he has shed on this very serious problem.
The note provides a series of guidelines and practical suggestions; it is not therefore really a question of implementing it as such but rather of ensuring it is circulated widely among the personnel concerned.
It has already been widely circulated in the RELEX family of directorates general and the delegations.
In addition, a training session on disability was held in September 2005.
The Commission has also distributed its note externally.
It has been published in the form of a brochure in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese and placed on the Internet.
The inclusion of disability in development policy is also covered by point 97 of the European Consensus on Development, which you approved a few weeks ago.
That point is concerned with preventing social exclusion and combatting all forms of discrimination, including that based on the condition of disabled persons.
To that end, it stipulates that the Community will promote social dialogue and social protection.
The national level is the most appropriate for implementing this dimension.
Preventing exclusion and fighting discrimination will therefore be done on request and on the basis of dialogue with the partner countries.
Any disability-related programmes will therefore be developed on that basis and at that level.
Obviously, the Commission is in favour of improving outcomes in health and education by means of projects and, increasingly, by budget support.
Political dialogue is an integral part of that support and it is within the framework of that political dialogue that the Commission is able to answer the calls made in this debate.
The Commission will therefore try to encourage the inclusion of disability or of disabled persons in our partner countriesâ development strategies while respecting this principle of appropriateness.
We will be trying to convince governments that it is important to tackle these questions effectively.
Obviously, we will be throwing all our weight into the battle so far as this is concerned.
I am fully aware of the tragic situation of disabled persons, a situation that is all the more tragic in the developing countries and especially among the poorest, because I witness these human tragedies very regularly; that is why I am very happy to be speaking to you about it now.
I also have to confess that I also sometimes witness the lack or total absence of interest in the disabled, not to say their exclusion, in some utterly deprived societies.
I am therefore entirely convinced that your desires, your attention and your concern are justified and I will not fail to use all the power at the Commissionâs disposal to deal more specifically with this question.
Â Â  .
Mr President, 10% of the worldâs population has a handicap, but, as Mr Bowis has just said, the percentage is often much higher in the developing countries.
When discussing handicapped people in developing countries, we are talking in terms of people with both physical and mental handicaps, not only the blind but also children traumatised by war, and that adds up to hundreds of millions of people.
Developing countries often lack facilities for handicapped people, who often live isolated lives.
UNESCO estimates that 98% of children with a handicap in these countries do not go to school.
The figures speak for themselves; policy-makers need to be particularly aware of this group of people.
It will, moreover, be all the more difficult to achieve the millennium objectives if such a large segment of the population is left out of consideration.
After all, handicapped people do not benefit automatically from programmes to combat poverty, an area in which there is no mainstreaming for them.
The problems were, and are, plain to see; the question is what we are doing about them.
As has already been said, it was in 2003 that the Commission produced a guidance note for all delegations and services that gave handicapped people a place in development policy.
In view of what the Commission has already said about the priority given to political dialogue, I would like it to tell us whether there is anything more to be said about the results.
Is it possible for more action to be taken for the specific benefit of handicapped people?
Have practical solutions been found for specific problems, for example in the educational field?
Education is, after all, fundamental to the combating of poverty and social exclusion, which affects most handicapped people.
Have handicapped people themselves been involved in the design and implementation of programmes?
This is what is done in the Netherlands, and the results are very good.
In conclusion, what is the Commission doing about exchanging knowledge and combining learning in this field?
Â Â  Mr President, this debate demonstrates that disability is a significant issue and that it must be taken into account when drawing up the European Unionâs development cooperation policies.
It is clear that disability and poverty are very closely related, and disability is also closely linked to disease and lack of health care.
We already knew this in Europe, where disability is much more widespread in the marginal sectors of society and where, furthermore, disabled people from those sectors suffer much more as a result of their condition than those from other more comfortable sectors.
What we are seeing now is that, in a similar way, disability affects the developing world much more than our industrialised countries and that disabled people in the South suffer as a result of their condition much more than those in the developed North.
The resolution that we will adopt identifies this situation and calls on the European Union to take responsibility for combating it.
The Commission will receive a recommendation from Parliament, calling on it to take account of the phenomenon of disability in all of its actions, both in the European strategy for the development of Africa and in the European consensus on development.
This resolution should also help increase awareness of this problem on the part of our governments and populations.
Having said all of that, however, and though the Socialist Group is committed to making every possible effort in this field, I feel that it is important to highlight the actions of certain developing countries that are demonstrating an admirable degree of solidarity in combating those forms of disability most closely related to poverty, lack of health care and underdevelopment itself.
Cuba is unquestionably one such country: It has not been content simply to have a policy aimed at preventing and alleviating disabilities within its own society but, for some years now, has also been providing very significant assistance to other countries in relation to this phenomenon.
An example of this is what is known as âOperation Miracleâ, as a result of which, and with resources provided mainly by Venezuela, more than 208Â 000 blind Latin Americans and Caribbeans had their sight restored in 2005 following free operations in Cuba.
The recently elected President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, signed a series of agreements in Havana.
One of them is intended to allow more than half a million blind Bolivians to be treated firstly in Cuba and then in several ophthalmological clinics that will be set up in Bolivia by Cuban specialists and using Cuban technology.
Similar projects are underway in Venezuela and other Latin American countries, and talks are being held with South Africa in order to explore similar initiatives.
These actions should be valued in the European Parliament, just as they are in the countries in question, much more than fine words and well-intentioned resolutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the chance to debate this issue, and I should like to thank Mr Bowis for this opportunity.
Disabled people, as we have heard, make up about 10% of any population, but 20% of the poorest are disabled.
Eighty-two per cent of disabled people live below the poverty line in developing countries.
They are even more excluded than disabled people within the EU.
They are excluded from social, economic and political life and, in many cases, are denied access to food, water and shelter.
When we talk about disability and development, we are not talking about charity but about basic human rights.
All people â disabled or otherwise â should be treated as equal.
That is why I am pleased that we are stressing the rights-based approach.
We must ensure that disabled people and disabled peopleâs organisations are involved in discussions about what is needed and in the delivery.
I am pleased that we have made progress on the UN Convention on Disabled Peopleâs Rights.
Hopefully we will see something by 2007.
Many of you know that I was rapporteur for Parliamentâs position on this.
We must ensure, however, that monitoring and enforcement procedures are included within the Convention.
That is why I called for a legally binding Convention.
It is important that whatever we bring forward, real action is taken and that action is monitored and evaluated.
Part of that action is to prevent more people becoming disabled.
One way to eradicate this is to ensure that landmines and cluster bombs are not used.
We must take action against all countries that manufacture, sell or use them.
Â Â  . Mr President, the burden of avoidable disability and disease in developing countries should weigh heavily on our conscience: when a child develops a disabling parasitic disease from contaminated water because its mother cannot afford two tablespoons of bleach to add to the familyâs bucket of drinking water; when a child develops HIV from the shared needles used by aid agencies; or when a man or woman is disabled by dangerous exploitative work that creates cheap consumer goods for us.
We are so well, healthy and rich.
We must give something back and more.
We must not take from poorer countries in destructive and disabling ways.
We like to put provisos in our aid packages.
The proviso we need to include in aid packages is that aid should include people with disabilities and funded projects should include schemes designed to meet their special needs and open up new and equal opportunities.
We must include enablement in all our approaches to development in developing countries.
And I would remind you that disability is, in itself, still an area for development within the EU.
Â Â  â Î€he next item is voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, under the Rules of Procedure concerning voting, you have just said that it is the right of every single Member to call for a check.
It is also the right of the President to point out that there is an overwhelming majority in favour; and when colleagues from UKIP start shouting at the back, please ignore them!
Â Â  â Mr Beazley, that is the decision of the President directing the proceedings in the House.
My decision is that the vote will be checked in order to satisfy everyone that that indeed was the result.
Â Â  Mr President, is it your wish that certain Members of this House be regarded as second-class citizens or not?
Â Â  â I have no wish to continue this discussion.
Â Â  Mr President, I refer to Rule 168 in conjunction with Rule 53 of the Rules of Procedure and would like in this connection to ask the Commission whether it is able to accept the amendments adopted by Parliament in this report, in particular Amendment 14, under which 50% of the restructuring funds, which total EUR 6 billion, will go to the producers.
This amendment was voted on by the Committee.
The amendment was tabled by Mr Goepel.
I would also like to ask the Commission to accept Amendments 10 and 11, which require an economic development plan to be submitted for the region when restructuring measures are to be introduced, such development plans to be notified by the Commission and the Member State in question.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe it will be helpful to answer this question by clarifying this point.
The Commission is able to agree to at least 10% of restructuring aid amounts being reserved for sugar-beet growers and machinery manufacturers.
This amount could be increased by the Member States, depending on their specific situation.
Â Â  Mr President, speaking on behalf of my group and further to Rule 168, I rise to request that this report be referred back to the Committee in order that we might negotiate with the Commission and the Council and get these two points accepted.
The Council stated in its decision that only 10% of these restructuring funds should go to producers â including those in the developing world â and that the remainder should go to the sugar industry without conditions imposed, thus enabling it to fund its decommissionings without having to take job losses and the needs of the region into consideration in any way whatever.
We would therefore like to see negotiations opened in what would be a hearing.
The only possibility left to us for getting the Council to negotiate is that we send the report back now and use the four weeks that are left to us between now and the next part-session to secure an increase for the producers.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf is right in the sense that we tabled the amendment on the understanding that at least 50% of the restoration fund would be deployed.
Instead, the Commission has proposed a minimum of 10%, with each Member State being entitled to increase this amount without limit and at its own discretion, and so our group believes that this is no longer an issue.
I ask the House to reject this amendment.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I fully agree with what the representative of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has just said: that was one of the things the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was calling for.
As the Commissioner said two days ago, the Commission is willing to allow the Member States to increase the 10% level.
The question is therefore settled and for my part I am therefore against referring it back to committee.
Â Â  Mr President, if we are to vote now, I should like the vote to be by roll call.
It was not possible to table a motion for a roll call vote earlier on, as we did not know whether we would be voting.
It follows that the request can be made only now, and orally.
I therefore request a roll call vote.
Â Â  ). MrÂ President, I refer to Rule 138 concerning translations.
Amendment 1 tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group proposes an alternative draft resolution that heeds and respects our nationsâ rejection of any super state and therefore of any constitution.
The translation of this amendment, the English version in particular, distorts the sense of the original in several places.
For example, where we refer to âthe pursuit of European constructionâ, a politically neutral expression, the translation refers to âEuropean integrationâ, an expression for the supranational process that we reject.
It is no doubt a Pavlovian reflex that has contaminated many offices in this building, still not accepting that a different Europe is possible.
I would therefore like to point out that only the original French version is authentic.
Â Â  . Mr President, unless I have misunderstood you, you called the honourable Member who has just spoken under my name.
I would not want the impression to be given that the rapporteurs are in agreement with his interpretation.
This desperate attempt to use translations as a means of altering substance must not succeed. The rapporteurs will have nothing to do with it.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish, as chairman of the committee, to thank the rapporteurs for working through one of the most important issues to concern us in 2006 at a time when much is in flux, and, in my capacity as a German MEP, to give the services a series of corrections.
The German translation is sometimes misleading and sometimes wrong, with â to give just one example â the term âEuropean papersâ translated as âEuro papersâ.
It is not paper that we want to produce, but political substance.
I shall let you have a series of corrections.
Â Â  . Mr President, to bring the text into line with the Treaties, we would prefer the wording âEU outermost regions adjacent to the European continentâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, the rapporteur and the PPE-DE Groupâs voting list objected to the Liberal proposal to insert the sub-heading âMaghrebâ.
You went too quickly and were not looking in my direction.
The PPE-DE group opposes the sub-heading âMaghrebâ after paragraph 33.
Â Â  .
Mr President, just for the sake of completeness, to call the Vatican City State a âcountryâ is stretching the definition a little far, so I have changed the wording to âsovereign statesâ. (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote) (vote)
Â Â  Mr President, my group does not agree that Amendment 2, tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, lapses if our Amendment 24 is approved.
As we see it, they do not contradict one another but are mutually compatible, so that it is possible to vote in favour of both of them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I agree that Amendment 2 does not fall.
We can have a separate vote on it.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we propose to replace the word âHezbollahâ with the words âall Lebanese and non-Lebanese Militiasâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is quite a complicated oral amendment.
As you may appreciate, negotiations are going on today in London.
They are very delicate, regarding finding a long-lasting peaceful solution to the Ngorno Karabakh dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
To bring the wording into a more neutral stance, I would like the paragraph to read as follows:
âTakes the view that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is impeding the development of Armenia and Azerbaijan and regional cooperation as well as the effective implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy as such; calls on both parties to refrain from unilateral actions and aggressive statements and to work for settlement of the conflict in a constructive dialogue with all the forces concerned, on the basis of respect for minority rights and on the basis of the principles of international law;â â that is key â âemphasises the importance of continuing democratic reforms for the development of the region and its relations with the EU; urges all parties concerned to find ways to permit the gradual return of refugees on the basis of minority rights, in particular with regard to the return of Azerbaijanis to the occupied territories; calls on the member countries of the OSCE Minsk group to coordinate more effectively their action with the EU Special Representative for South Caucasus in order to move forward with negotiationsâ.
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, what is the point of this so-called amendment to the rules against heckling in the Chamber when this Parliament is one of the dullest, dreariest and most unexciting assemblies in the world?
Moreover, it will not apply only to the Chamber, but also to what goes on in the corridors!
A number of our colleagues were made to remove an authorised display showing the similarities between the culture of death of the Hitler regime and the culture of death of todayâs hedonistic society, both inspired by eugenic principles.
As I now speak in this Parliament, however, another display is boasting the supposed merits of Chinese Maoist democracy, where even today there are still tens of millions of prisoners in labour camps, held because of their beliefs, and where the communist totalitarian ideology that still holds sway has committed its worst atrocities!
MrÂ Onesta, the author of this report, is a respectable man, but he belongs to a group that was responsible for the most unbelievable uproar directed against a Head of State who was present in this House, President Jacques Chirac, who had just been elected at the time.
What is right today is wrong tomorrow: two standards, depending on whether you belong to a large group or a small one!
Â Â  Mr President, I too have some qualms about the Onesta report, despite having voted for it.
I have great respect for the rapporteur, who is a truly nice man and has helped me on many occasions.
However, my concern is over how the rules will be interpreted by a partisan President of Parliament such as our current President, who does not seem to understand the concept of free speech and is very authoritarian in the way in which he deals with Members of the House.
At the solemn sitting in homage to the victims of terrorism held in this House in March 2005 he wisely counselled us not to use such terrible events to push political messages, and then did so himself.
Therefore, how will he police the new rules in this House?
Â Â  . It is necessary to tread very carefully when drawing up a code of conduct for MEPs, as this is a thorny issue.
Parliament is the institutional embodiment of freedom.
Political representation was found to be the very embodiment of democracy; legislation as an act of the will of the electorate, in a spirit of mutual consent and sovereign expression.
Democratic political systems heralded parliamentary institutions, because of the openness and transparency of their debates and because the people could monitor the Members at election time.
Representatives do have a âspecial statusâ which is conferred on them because they are seen as a âcross-section of the populationâ.
Their freedom is a right and a duty, their responsibility is politics, and, as Popper once said, their judgment day comes on election day.
This is why the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has advocated a cautious approach to the issue in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
After all, a code of this nature has limits, and those limits arise from the integrity of Members exercising their mandate.
They are the limits of freedom with which the people made Parliament, within which they are represented in Parliament and which they do not wish to see removed from Parliament.
Â Â  The report by the French member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Onesta, on the penalties imposed on Members causing a disturbance inside and outside the Chamber is a blow to freedom of speech, especially for political minorities.
It is the beginnings of regimentation, a form of concealed totalitarianism, of normalisation as they used to say when communism was at its height, and coming from the Greens that is not surprising.
Clearly, it is not enough for the European Parliament that its minorities, especially the non-attached Members, should be victims of outrageous discrimination as regards Parliamentariansâ rights; we have to go further and punish them, even punish them financially, if the majority considers their behaviour âpolitically incorrectâ.
This regulatory is intolerable and destructive of freedom.
When there are more than 20 million people unemployed in Europe and immigration is swamping our nation states, I think the European Parliament has better things to do than flout parliamentary democracy, even if it is European.
Â Â  . I voted for this report.
It is an indictment of the conduct of a minority of members that this report is even necessary.
Â Â  . This report comes from a pen of considerable scientific authority in parliamentary law, and it is clear from reading it that he has used the great authorities in the discipline, such as EugÃšne Pierre.
It is based on a philosophical choice: the choice of oligarchy, in other words, in the language of Aristotle, 'the rule of a few'.
Thus, thirty or so MEPs (session presidents, and those who impose penalties, hear those penalised and confirm the penalties) will be responsible for supervising their colleagues.
As all Members owe their position to sovereignty, be it popular or national, it is sovereignty itself that will find itself under supervision.
France invented parliamentary sovereignty back in 1791, supplanting popular sovereignty.
However, as Parliament, by virtue of its composition, represented only one social classÂ âÂ the bourgeoisie and the other so-called liberal professionsÂ âÂ it seized popular or national sovereignty for its own benefit.
In this report, this little band of oligarchs is setting up instruments to neutralise any representatives of the people who might get through the electoral and media filters.
Consequently, this report, which should have restricted itself to a single word â 'freedom' of the people's representatives â can be summed up with a different word: oligarchy.
Â Â  . â The new amendments to the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure relating to standards for the conduct of Members of the European Parliament is an attempt, in the name of the smooth functioning of Parliament, to use policing and sanctions in order to restrict and control the expression of reaction, protest or disagreement and terrorise those Members who wish to express their opposition to the anti-grass roots policy of the ÎU, to aspects of it or to serious political events.
The new autocratic measures make provision for financial penalties, exclusion from meetings and institutions, even a proposal to be removed from parliamentary office.
In this way, they are attempting to restrict any reactions with placards, pickets and so on, noting 'daintilyâ that they are not tolerable if they create 'clashes' or disrupt parliamentary business.
Similar threats and sanctions are provided for in cases where provisions are infringed governing confidentiality relating to 'closed meetings' and the publication of documents which, it should be noted, often circulate on the media.
We are voting against the new autocratic amendments and declare that we shall not be disciplined and shall try in every way to project the problems of the working classes and inform the people to whom we give account.
Â Â  . The sense of responsibility, respect and high intellectual rigour expected of the MEPsâ mandate has never hindered their ability to express their views openly; far from it.
While there have been a number of well-documented, unacceptable abuses, it is also true that some countries have developed certain practices and customs that actually enhance the prestige of their parliamentary assemblies and lend them their own particular character and flavour.
Take the United Kingdom, for example.
I feel that, quite apart from the provisions of the regulations in force, rules and behaviour are primarily dictated by precedent, which, by definition, is very much a work in progress in the case of the European Parliament.
The mandate of MEP is the exercise of both freedom and responsibility, and there is no reason to believe that the elected representatives are lacking either of these.
Â Â  . I am in favour of much of the measures in this report, though am firmly of the view that Parliament should have an individual vote on changes to our procedures, where this one vote covered a number of points in one.
On these grounds I abstained, though welcome the adoption of the report as a whole, as it is clear that, for one example, a number of members have taken advantage of our pretty lax rules to date.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of MrsÂ Vlasto's excellent report on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises, as those small enterprises are at the very heart of the creation of wealth and social progress for a very large number of our fellow European citizens.
I support the proposals that aim to give international collaboration between Chambers of Commerce an important role in terms of the competitiveness of small enterprises and the recognition of craft enterprises.
This report quite rightly emphasises that neither the European Commission nor some of the Member States have grasped the scale of the considerable challenge presented by the retirement of millions of people who run small enterprises.
Finally, we must make every effort to make the day-to-day running of this economic stratum, which is so vital for growth, employment and consumer satisfaction, simpler and more secure in legal, fiscal and social terms.
Â Â  . The British Conservative delegation is content to endorse the content of most of Mrs Vlasto's report but has decided to abstain because of the wording of paragraph 22.
We believe that tax competition is beneficial and does not constitute illegal state aid; we do not favour the creation of a common, consolidated corporate tax base.
Nevertheless, we congratulate Mrs Vlasto and restate our commitment to the creation of an environment that encourages small businesses to flourish.
Â Â  Small enterprises are crucially important to creating jobs in the Member States and thus to Europeâs future development.
This is not, however, a cross-border issue.
On the contrary, each Member State must decide for itself how it wishes to design its small enterprises policy.
Institutional competition, in which the Member States are able independently to find sound solutions without being locked into rigid EU regulations is incredibly important to the development of small enterprises.
Precisely for that reason, we believe that the EU is not the solution when it comes to bringing about an environment friendly to small enterprises.
The report states that there are obstacles to the development of small enterprises, for example in terms of obtaining credit and dealing with complicated tax systems and with administrative procedures for gaining access to Structural and Development Funds.
The Member States must do more to make things simpler for small enterprises, and concerns are expressed about there being big differences in respect of education in entrepreneurship and the cultivation of the spirit of enterprise in schools.
It also states that the Charter should have the force of law and be binding because the Member Statesâ involvement would then be greater.
Believing that a European Charter and annual reports are the solution is just another example of the EU not being sufficiently rooted in reality.
The June List has therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  . Small and medium-sized enterprises play a vital role in competition and innovation, in vocational training and even in spatial planning.
They create jobs and wealth.
This is all the more remarkable when you consider that they are often collapsing under fiscal, social and regulatory burdens that are as much as they can bear; that they have to face unrestricted global competition without the weapons of the big companies to defend themselves; that they find it more difficult to access capital, which is so vital to investment; and that a change of ownership often threatens their very existence.
Could the solution come from Brussels?
I doubt it.
Europe's policies have never really taken account of the interests and characteristics of SMEs, even though they make up 99% of businesses.
Aid and Community programmes are mainly accessible to firms with specialised departments to deal with them.
European legislation is staggeringly complex, and the standards imposed are expensive to implement.
The policy of opening up the market to unbridled and unfair global competition only adds to the problem.
It is true that free enterprise creates wealth and employment, and it is true that we need to promote it.
But if the European Union is to play a part in this, it cannot continue to be a technocracy that is more committed to European ideology than to the interests of Europeans.
Â Â  . This Charter is a good thing, and even a success, in that it has been implemented in 35 countries.
However, this implementation leaves much to be desired, as illustrated by this fifth report which, moreover, relates to only three of its ten lines of action.
I tabled an amendment in an attempt to rectify an omission in this Charter, which fails to take account of the fact that, in many Member States, the owners of these small enterprises and, above all, the millions of spouses working for them, are not covered by social security.
Since 1997, Parliament has been calling for a framework statute for this invisible workforce.
We proposed an amendment to the 1986 directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity.
The European Commission has ignored our requests.
I find that particularly regrettable given that the report on which we are voting does not include my amendment and that some arcane procedure has prevented me from putting it forward again in plenary.
However, since the resolution makes reference to social security systems for stimulating business enterprise, I hope that my suggestion will be taken into consideration when applying the Charter's third line of action, focusing on better legislation and regulation.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate MrsÂ Vlasto on her important report on implementing the European Charter for Small Enterprises.
I lend my full backing to this report, and particularly welcome the idea of extending the Charter to cover a wider range of countries, not only EU candidate countries but also Mediterranean countries, which will help develop the European neighbourhood policy.
It is essential that specific, simplified measures and investment programmes be adopted, namely the creation and development of local funds of risk capital and âbusiness angelsâ financing programmes, which will pave the way for increased investment in innovation by local and regional small businesses.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on the implementation of the European Charter for small and micro-enterprises.
The focus of the Charter should be kept and the participation of these enterprises in various EU programmes further encouraged.
Â Â  . The report on the European Charter for Small Enterprises is of major importance given the fabric of European business, which is mainly made up of small enterprises.
As the rapporteur on sustainable tourism for the EU, I have no hesitation in welcoming the measures being taken in this key area for tourism, which is clearly one of the most important economic sectors in European economic growth and development.
In our view, the priorities of a qualified workforce, training in entrepreneurship and better legislation will make it possible to play to the sectorâs strengths, to address any shortcomings and to support growth in the various countries parties to the Charter.
I therefore voted in favour of the Vlasto report.
Â Â  . SMEs are the backbone of the European economy, job creation and regional development.
The involvement of SMEs is therefore a vital factor in implementing the objectives set in the Lisbon Strategy aimed at fostering sustainable growth and creating more and better jobs.
I therefore welcome the implementation of a European Charter for SMEs, which will enable EU Member States to enjoy the benefits of exchanging good practice.
The purpose of this report is to strengthen the SME dimension in Community policy.
To this end, it recommends streamlining existing European instruments.
This report once again draws attention to the difficulties experienced by SMEs in accessing European Union programmes and related funding.
In addition to these obstacles, the situation will only become worse, given that the financial envelope for the next financial perspective 2007-2013, as adopted by the Council, fell victim to swingeing cuts of some 50%.
I refer to projects from which the SMEs benefit under the heading âCompetitiveness, growth and employmentâ, and more specifically the Seventh Framework Programme for development and the programme for competitiveness and innovation.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I voted today in favour of Mr Fruteauâs reports on reform of the sugar market, I did so quite deliberately, for the sugar market in the EU is a very sensitive one.
Sugar beet is an important product for many of our farmers, being one that can be cultivated in places where the conditions are too adverse for other agricultural produce, and so well-considered reform is vital if the survival of farms â the small and medium-sized ones in particular â is to be ensured.
Reform is needed, but the Commissionâs ideas about it again far overshoot the goal, and so we are today calling for even smaller cuts in the price of sugar and beet, more support for the cultivation of sustainable raw materials as a substitute for the cultivation of beet and higher compensation payments.
The Council, too, has seen the need for adjustments and has, in its decision, referred to many of our demands.
The Council decision in itself amounts to a triumph for this House and for Europeâs sugar-beet farmers, but the cuts still go too far.
In the light of these events, I think it sends completely the wrong signal that the Council should, at the Commissionâs insistence, formulate a statement of intent even before Parliament has voted.
I believe that the amendments we have proposed today represent an even better way.
What we have here is a good reform; I want a better one.
It is for that that I stand, and for that that I, today, have voted.
Â Â  . We have to stop giving with one hand and taking away with the other!
This report tries to strike a balance between protecting the income of European farmers and that of farmers in the ACP countries.
It thus provides for a smaller reduction in price, spread out over time, so that the ACP countries are better able to absorb the impact of reform, and a substantial increase in access to the European market for sugar from the least developed countries.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament's two amendments also move in the right direction, by providing for the complete elimination of European export subsidies (by 2013 at the latest) and compensation for the restructuring of the sugar sector in the ACP countries, based on an estimated requirement of EURÂ 200 million a year.
Admittedly, I would have liked the EU to go further, by providing the funds for this restructuring immediately, instead of the miserly EURÂ 40Â million that has been promised (we proposed twice that amount in the Committee on Development).
I would also have liked the 'everything but arms' initiative to enter into operation as of 2009 and the EU to make it impossible to export sugar at low prices under quota C.
We will continue the battle as part of the ongoing negotiations on the financial perspective.
Â Â  .
The reform is essential. However, the collateral damage of this reform should not be felt by small, vulnerable ACP economies with whom we have a very special relationship.
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries rightly feel that they have been abandoned and betrayed by what has been agreed in the Council.
What has been proposed by Parliament today is equally unsatisfactory and for this reason I voted against the resolution.
Parliament has today voted for a delay in the implementation of the Everything But Arms (EBA) Agreement.
Such a move would seriously limit the promise of an initiative designed to provide least developed countries with duty-free and quota-free access to the EU's sugar markets.
I call upon the Council to honour its commitment to EBA by implementing no delay or safeguard mechanisms.
We now must look to the future and make sure we provide ACP countries with adequate financial support for their restructuring.
Compensation amounting to EUR 7.5 billion has been offered to European farmers, whereas so far the ACP has only EUR 40 million.
Today, Parliament agreed that the Commission's estimates of ACP needs of EUR 200 million must be met with new and fresh funding.
I hope this will be listened to.
Â Â  . I welcome the decision taken by Parliament today to endorse the much-needed reform of the EU Sugar Regime.
This reform will improve the competitiveness of the EU sugar sector by removing the artificial supports to production that have encouraged overproduction and dumping of subsidised EU sugar on world markets at prices often below the cost of production.
To this end I voted in favour of ending trade-distorting EU export subsidies at the latest by 2013.
These subsidies depress world market prices, have an adverse affect on the ability of developing countries to trade and contradict the Union's own development policy objectives.
I also voted to ensure that the EU honours its commitments to some of the poorest countries in the world to allow duty-free and quota-free access from 2009 to our markets for their sugar through the Everything-But-Arms Initiative.
There should be no further delays and no restrictions as an incentive to these countries to develop their infant industries.
I regret that no new money has yet been agreed to help producers in the 18 ACP Sugar Protocol countries in view of the generous financial package available as part of this reform to EU producers.
Â Â  . The Commission's philosophy is Malthusian; its slogan is 'No future'.
It takes its inspiration from nihilism.
Destroy: destroy the coalmines, the steelworks, the textile industry and, above all, agriculture.
We have arable land: they leave it fallow.
We have milk: they impose quotas.
We have vineyards: they tear them down.
But all of that was not enough to kill us off, so they overhauled the common agricultural policy.
They invented decouplingÂ âÂ in other words, being paid for not producing anythingÂ âÂ because that is their philosophy: do not create.
They have just one ideal: a vast continental retirement home, fed by mass redundancies.
The overhaul of the common organisation of the market for sugar is a perfect example of this ideology.
We have sugar refineries: the Commission is going to pay them not to produce anything.
For every tonne of sugar they do not produce, they will be paid EURÂ 400, 500 or 600.
For four years.
After that, there will be no producers left, just consumers who have no means to consume, and it will only remain for them to be eliminated.
Long live death!
That was the rallying cry of the Brahmans.
Â Â  . We very much welcome the reform of the sugar regime, but there are many parts of this report drawn up for Parliament by its Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for which I will not be voting.
The sugar regime had been in need of reform for at least 15 years when the Court of Auditors carried out an extensive study on the sugar regime (Special Report 4/91) and concluded that the system suffered from oversupply and inefficient production patterns and that it was not budget neutral.
I cannot accept the call for the 'introduction of modifications'.
We need radical overhaul, not just modifications.
I cannot vote for lesser price cuts, increased compensation, and less quota cuts than proposed by the Commission.
I will not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers.
Large amounts of CAP funds are already available for EU farmers.
I agree that we need to control imports from Lesser Developed countries (LDCs) and guard against triangular trade, but we are talking tiny amounts here: 125Â 000Â tonnes from LDCs. EU sugar production is around 17.4 million tonnes.
Why are we focusing so much on LDC imports here?
Market imbalance is not going to come from LDC imports.
Â Â  . The reform of the EU sugar regime will require a great deal of restructuring by EU producers and farmers, as well as by farmers in the Sugar Protocol countries, whose livelihoods have been structured by trade with the EU for over 40 years.
Whilst necessary compensation and support schemes are available to EU farmers as part of a generous financial package, I regret that no new and fresh money has yet been agreed to help producers in the 18 ACP Sugar Protocol Countries.
I believe that the EU has a duty to provide adequate funds for restructuring assistance to these countries under the financial perspectives, above and beyond the 40 million euros committed so far for 2006.
I therefore voted in favour of an amendment to enshrine EU assistance to the ACP countries within the Direct Support proposal.
I believe the Commission proposals for the new financial perspective, allowing for an amount of 190 million euros per year to help ACP producers adjust to the sugar reform, are the basis for a more acceptable adjustment scheme for our ACP trading partners.
Â Â  . The British Conservative delegation voted against this report because its main recommendations do not serve the interests of efficient UK sugar producers, nor would they, in our view, bring about the reduction in EU sugar production needed to avoid linear quota cuts in future.
It is unfair that our growers, who tend to produce more than 300 tonnes per year, should be punished for their efficiency by receiving only 50% compensation.
This figure is considerably lower than that proposed by both the Commission and Council.
Furthermore, the idea that Member States may retain an unspecified amount of their subsidies linked to production flies in the face of the recent CAP reform and would allow less efficient producers to maintain overall production at an unsustainable level.
However, we support the report's direction in terms of increasing the energy crops premium and increasing the maximum guaranteed area for such production so as to encourage the promotion of biofuels.
Â Â  Mr President, I have always accepted the need for a review of the common agricultural policyâs sugar regime, but I object to the total destruction of the sugar industry in my country and in other EU Member States.
Ireland is facing the prospect of closure of its only processing plant.
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, world sugar consumption in 2004-2005 was 144.8 million tonnes, with production at only 149Â million tonnes.
We can expect an exponential increase as China, India and many other rapidly developing economies increase their sugar consumption from the present 10Â kg per capita per annum to the European average of 35 kg per capital per annum.
We must retain production and processing capacity to face these future challenges.
Having lost the vote on the common organisation of the market, I logically supported the other two reports â on direct support schemes and the temporary restructuring of the sugar industry â in order to secure the best possible deal for Irish, EU and ACP growers.
Overall, Parliamentâs position is an improvement on the proposals from the Commission and the Council, but it does not go far enough.
Â Â  . I acknowledge that the European sugar sector is in need of reform.
In order to make it fair and effective, however, the reform needs to strike a balance between:
international trade commitments entered into;
the proposed objectives for increasing the sectorâs competitiveness;
the stability of the EU market;
the sectorâs viability and sustainability, with particular regard to guarantees of income for European producers;
and the preferential trade arrangements granted by the EU to ACP countries and the least developed countries, not least via incentives to export sugar to the EU, under the âEverything But Armsâ initiative.
To this end, I welcome the broad guidelines for reform proposed in this report, along with the amendments to improve upon the Commissionâs proposals for reform, as follows:
a less drastic reduction in prices;
the establishment of a trade regulation;
the implementation of measures aimed at absorbing the economic shock of the reform;
and support for developing different products to provide sugar production with an alternative outlet.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . They say it is better to give a fishing rod than a fish.
Of course, if we are going to callously shut down sugar production in Ireland and the EU, we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers....even if just to salve our consciences.
But are we crazy?
Why are we shutting down sugar production when we desperately need to find alternatives to petroleum fuels?
Why are we paying to have empty fields and rusting equipment, when we need sugar production more than ever.
Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
On the one hand, we are warning of the disappearance of oil and promoting alternatives. On the other hand sugar - one of the viable alternatives - is being made to disappear.
One hand doesn't seem to know what the other is doing.
How can we accomplish anything?
And while we are planning our own compensation package, remember third countries like Mauritius which are being devastated by our sugar reform.
Â Â  . There is broad agreement that the sugar sector needs to be reformed in order to make this important industry more sustainable, in line with the latest reform of the CAP and with the EUâs international obligations.
Despite these noble objectives, however, the reform proposed by the Commission would cause serious problems for Europeâs farmers, not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar.
I therefore endorse Mr Fruteauâs report, along with the work carried out by the various political groups in the Committee on Agriculture, which I feel sends out a very clear message to the Commission and the Council.
In addition to capping price reductions to 30% in the Common Organisation of the Market in sugar, I wish to highlight Amendment 3, on support schemes for farmers, which refers to the possibility of Member States continuing to enjoy production-linked subsidies, at least to some extent.
This will help prevent the rapid disappearance of the sugar sector in the regions most under threat from this reform.
I would also highlight the safeguarding of the possibility of the restructuring fund supporting those giving up on part of the quota, Amendment 7, which will enable some businesses to effect their conversion.
Â Â  We support a radical reform of the sugar sector within the EU.
It is absurd to prop up an uncompetitive market through extensive protectionism and significant financial aid.
The European Parliament is attempting to impede the Commissionâs proposals for reform.
The European Parliament wants the reform to be implemented over a longer period of time, price reductions to be limited, restructuring aid to be increased and production in areas with âclimatic structural conditionsâ to be accorded special forms of support.
As a consequence, necessary structural adjustments will be postponed.
Overall, the Commissionâs proposals for reform are more far-reaching.
We have thus chosen to vote against the European Parliamentâs proposals.
Â Â  . I would explain my votes against Amendments 73, 18/rev. and 18 to the Fruteau reports on, respectively, the COM in the sugar sector, common rules applicable within the framework of the CAP, and the scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the EC.
I have followed this extremely closely, given the social and economic repercussions that a bad reform could have for many European regions, many of them Spanish.
I well remember the arguments put forward both by the Commissioner and by the chairman of the European Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture, defending the possibility that the Council might adopt a political agreement before the parliamentary procedure had been completed.
The Hong Kong Conference was not going to wait for us, and nor was the sowing season.
President Daul explained this by means of a letter to Commissioner Fisher-Boel.
The arguments were powerful, and we understood that.
I cannot therefore, in relation to this dossier, vote today in favour of this entirely unjustified criticism of the Council.
For all of these reasons, and because the agreement reached is as close as possible to the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have voted against these three amendments.
Â Â  . The sugar sector needs to be reformed in order to make it more sustainable, following the latest reform of the CAP.
This reform, however, would cause serious problems for Europeâs farmers, not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar.
The fact that the Commissionâs proposal was drawn up more from the point of view of the interests of the major surplus producing countries than that of the smaller countries which do not even produce enough sugar beet to satisfy consumption, as in the case of Portugal, only serves to remind us that it is not countries like Portugal that are unbalancing the international market.
I should accordingly like to point out the possibility, proposed in this report, of Member States continuing to enjoy production-linked subsidies, at least to some extent.
This will help prevent the rapid disappearance of the sugar sector in the regions most under threat from this reform.
It strikes me, therefore, that the possibility of the restructuring fund and support for those giving up on only part of the quota has been safeguarded.
In this way, the sugar industry in some countries, such as Portugal, can move away from the agricultural sector towards sustaining the processing side of the industry.
I therefore voted in favour of the Fruteau reports.
Â Â  .
I voted for this resolution. I strongly condemn the continuing abuse of the human rights of innocent citizens on a massive scale in Chechnya.
Democratic, human rights and governance aspects must be an integral part of the EU's policy for cooperation with Russia.
A Russia characterised by democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights is a Russia that is more attractive to foreign investment.
It is also a neighbour that is more stable and more predictable.
Â Â  . Chechnya was conquered by Imperial Russia in the 19th century, its people were intermittently deported by Stalin, and, more recently, under Yeltsin and Putin, they have been bombed and murdered.
Following the first war, in the 1990s, the peace negotiator Alexander Lebed agreed, on Russiaâs behalf, to the democratic choice of independence being made possible following a transitional period, but this has never come to pass, and so one can no longer expect the Chechens to regard their country as part of Russia.
No people is willing to subject itself to those who have been most brutal in murdering and oppressing them, and so the resistance will never come to an end, and, I fear, nor will its suppression by means of a military superpower.
This resolution is relatively mild about the intimidation and deception that marked the elections that have now been held, with the intention of conjuring up majority support for Moscowâs puppets.
Moreover, the text again lays emphasis on the territorial integrity of Russia, even though the retention of this region as part of Russia is founded upon nothing more than violence.
Given the present desperate situation, this resolution, which rightly draws attention to the many abuses, is preferable to continued silence in the face of the misdeeds of our principal supplier of energy, and so I have voted in favour of it.
Â Â  . I was glad to support this resolution and the work of my group colleague Bart Staes who I know has been working closely with the Chechen community.
The situation in Chechnya can be ameliorated by EU involvement, and this motion contains ideas which we must ensure are taken forward.
Â Â  Mr President, the Duff/Voggenhuber report amounts to the European Parliament itself wiping the floor with democracy and is an expression of its belief that the referendums in the Netherlands and France are an irrelevance and that the Constitution must enter into force in 2009 by whatever means and no matter what else happens.
That is actually even worse than the European Commissionâs simply acting as if it is no concern of theirs.
That is actually just as bad.
We in this House are in very bad company when the EU is under the presidency of Austria, whose Chancellor, Mr SchÃŒssel, is actually so shameless as to call for new referendums in France and the Netherlands, the idea being that the people must carry on voting until they vote the way the Eurocrats want them to.
That itself is perhaps not that bad, given that there are also countries in which the people are not getting a vote at all â my own, for example, where there be no vote on such things as the European constitution and the monstrous thing has to be whipped through the parliaments without democratic consultation.
In any case, all the European institutions are manifestly united in their contempt for national democracies and for the democratic will of the public.
This is not the way to do something about the great repugnance that our people have for Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, having listened to the debate yesterday on this subject, I decided I had to say something about the bizarre concept of democracy that some Members in this place and the Commission have.
I heard it said that in the referenda so far, more people have voted âyesâ than ânoâ across all countries and that therefore we should be going ahead with this wonderful Constitution.
As a group of my very wise constituents from Northampton and Daventry said to me during the general election in the UK last year, in England my party â the Conservatives â polled more votes than the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrats.
So, maybe, using this wonderful Eurocrat vision of democracy, we should be the ones in power.
Democracy is about following the democratic wishes of the people and ensuring individuals have the power to choose the direction in which they would like their local council, Parliament or Europe to go.
It is not about stripping power from people, ignoring their views and giving it to a political class that believes it knows best.
That is why I voted against this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, during the discussions on the Duff-Voggenhuber report, some Members have made some very amusing comments, comparing Members who disagreed with them with ostriches.
They have done so with good humour, and I congratulate them for that as, on the same subject last year, they did so rather violentlyÂ âÂ which just goes to show that we were right to amend the Rules of Procedure.
I would like to come to the defence of this much-maligned bird, because no naturalist has ever seen an ostrich put its head in the sand.
On the contrary, it is well known that, when approached by a lion, an ostrich will sacrifice itself to protect its young, by moving away from the nest and allowing the beast to eat it.
The ostrich, therefore, is there to sacrifice itself for future generations: it is a symbol of courage and devotion!
So, for any scientist or naturalist, being described as an ostrich is not an insult, but an honour!
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make a brief statement on how I voted on the Voggenhuber/Duff report.
It is a good report, the main gist of which is that Europe needs to move on, and that is important, because those, too, who voted ânoâ in the referenda were not happy with the present state of Europe.
The report argues that popular support is essential, and that a variety of options are available, and that too is important since the referenda are a matter of fact, with the ânoâ votes in the referenda in France and the Netherlands and the âyesâ votes in those in Spain and Luxembourg.
I am also very glad to see that the present text incorporates Amendment 18, which explicitly states that the objections of citizens in countries like France and the Netherlands must be met halfway.
That is clear as daylight; it is what makes this such a good report, the gist of which is that we must move on, that we must be bold enough to get out of this impasse, but that we must do so by way of the various options open to us; the period of reflection in which we now find ourselves, taking the public into consideration, including in the countries where things have gone wrong.
That strikes me as a healthy approach, and that is why we, in the CDA delegation, are enthusiastically supporting this course of action.
Â Â  Mr President, half a year on from the French and Dutch ânoâ vote, we see the European Parliament consigning to the wastepaper basket the democratically expressed will of the majority.
It appears that the Constitution absolutely must, come what may, enter into force at some point during 2009.
It is ironic that one reason cited in the report for why a European constitution is necessary is that, following the accessions of Bulgaria and Romania, no further enlargement will be possible under the terms of the current Treaty of Nice.
It is a matter of common knowledge that opposition to further enlargements, and certainly to the possible accession of Turkey, was one of the most important reasons for the rejection of the Constitution.
Today sees this House proving once more just how remote it is from the citizens that it claims to represent even so.
Â Â  . In this report on the period of reflection, Parliament had a unique opportunity to do something useful: it could have been the first European institution to reflect on realistic options for resolving the situation created by the 'no' votes in France and the Netherlands, based around two aspects: a constitutional text refocused on Parts I and II and a revision of Part III on policies.
That was what the co-rapporteurs from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, whose ceaseless efforts I welcome, wanted, and I co-signed their amendments advocating a 'constitutional core'.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejected this pragmatic and worthwhile policy, and restated their commitment to the current text of the Constitution.
This is the idea that it is still possible to make the French and Dutch vote again on the same text.
This denial of the popular vote is futile, whatever the positions of the various parties: that is why I am pleased that the French socialists, with a few exceptions, abstained.
In the end, the only useful message to be taken from this report is that the period of reflection will need to continue until JuneÂ 2007.
Â Â  . The pause for reflection on the European Constitution has so far been characterised more by silence than by debate.
Although Parliament, by means of this resolution, is making a creditable attempt at re-launching the debate, the resolution also gives voice to the expectation that one result of the period of reflection will be the retention of the present-day text of the Constitution, something I regard as deceptive and undesirable, in that it takes no account of the rejection of the Constitution by the French and Dutch electorates.
It is lamentable that Parliament has, on this point, disregarded the warning given by its rapporteurs, Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, and it is for that reason that I have abstained from taking part in the final vote on the resolution.
The period of reflection must be used to prepare agreement on a procedure that is as democratic as possible for a new reform of the Treaties.
In saying ânoâ to the Constitution, the French and the Dutch were certainly not saying âyesâ to the way Europe is today.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the report on an assessment of the debate on the European Union.
We believe the report to be mainly sound, but we wish to emphasise that it is not the European institutionsâ task to convince people about which changes are necessary or constructive.
Opinion forming and political debate must have their basis in the commitment of individuals and be inspired by those who play a role in democratic society, by political parties and by other voluntary associations.
Â Â  . The Duff/Voggenhuber report misjudges the political realities, both in the Netherlands and in France.
To call, as it does, for the Constitutionâs entry into force in 2009 to be guaranteed is an insult not only to the Dutch voters, but also to the rule of law within the EU.
Other passages (paragraphs 1, 5, 7, and 31) also fail to do justice to the unambiguous no vote in the Netherlands.
It is for that reason that I find it impossible to vote in favour of the report.
I also think that the Netherlands has to make clear precisely what it wants â whether it wants to renegotiate the Constitution, continue on the basis of the Treaty of Nice or begin the whole process anew.
If the Netherlands opts for renegotiation, it will have to state clearly what it wants.
A clear message to the Netherlands from this House would have been all the more helpful in view of the fact that, in the Netherlands, the debate has been cancelled.
Â Â  . I support and voted in favour of the report before us.
The European Constitution has not âdiedâ.
The ânoâ votes in the French and Dutch referendums on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe were not a âdeath certificateâ, but merely the adjournment of the ratification process under way at the time.
Nevertheless, in light of the negative results in France and the Netherlands, it does not seem possible to continue to try to ratify the current text without amending it.
That being said, the idea of abandoning the draft Constitution is out of the question.
A constitutional agreement, as the rapporteurs point out, is essential if the EU is to (re)gain the confidence of European citizens, to maintain the dynamic of European integration and to play a credible role on the international stage.
Against this backdrop, the âperiod of reflectionâ should serve to relaunch the draft Constitution, based on wide-ranging public debate on the future of Europe, involving the citizens, civil society, the social partners and national and regional parliaments.
The purpose of this debate should be to clarify, deepen and perfect the Constitution, to examine the criticisms levelled at it, to find solutions to the constitutional crisis and to address the concerns of Europeâs citizens.
Â Â  . We voted against this report, which we consider to be unacceptable pressure on the Member States and their democratic institutions, following the rejection of the so-called European Constitution by the people of France and the Netherlands.
Although Parliament acknowledges that ratifying the Constitution now faces âdifficulties that could prove insurmountableâ, unless measures can be taken to address the concerns expressed in France, the Netherlands and in other Member States, the majority will still go ahead and transform the current period of reflection into the relaunch of the draft Constitution, on the basis of broad public debate on the future of European integration.
What the majority in Parliament would like to see is a major propaganda campaign to pressure the citizens into accepting the so-called European Constitution.
Although we agree that the Treaty of Nice does not constitute a foundation for the future â and this is why we voted against â we object to attempts at following the path of deeper neoliberalism, federalism and militarism.
We want a Europe in which there is greater cooperation between equal, sovereign Member States, greater economic and social cohesion, greater solidarity and genuine commitment to peace and social progress.
Â Â  . The failure of the Constitutional Treaty is less a problem of text than of context.
From the outside, Europe is seen as the political entity with the highest level of public freedoms, social rights and environmental protection in the world.
On the inside, though, our people have their doubts about an integration project for which the Member States refuse to provide the resources.
Parliament's report has no answer to the doubts, the fears and the national egotisms.
Instead of tackling the problemsÂ âÂ lack of growth, unemployment, tensions in the countryside and in the citiesÂ âÂ the Commission and Parliament are advocating dialogue and forums, in other words 'idle chit-chat'.
Dialogue, yes, but about what?
About questions to which the political classes are unable to find answers?
The Union lacks not only a concrete vision for the future, but also true statesmen.
I did, nevertheless, vote in favour of this report, but only to avoid siding with the opponents of a more integrated Europe with greater solidarity.
Â Â  . The debate on the great European issues that has gone on over the last few months has been characterised more by emotion than by thought.
Whether we are talking about the Constitution, the services directive or Reach â to name but a few â the challenge before us is to simplify the language we use and the way we communicate, in order not to leave the field to the so-called populists.
Scarcely any other institution possesses so many structures and so many means for supporting communication, yet scarcely any other institution uses a language the complexity of which leaves it wide open to deliberate or involuntary misinterpretations.
All too often, the two things that fall by the wayside in any debate about Europe are common reference to what has been achieved and an explanation of the new in that context.
There are in essence two great schools of thought where the future of Europe is concerned.
One of the things that the Constitution did was to show how those who want more Europe and those who want less combine to bring Europe to a standstill â not in the way they think, but in the way they vote.
If these contradictions are made clearer and more readily comprehensible for the citizenâs benefit, a new and real European debate will be the result.
The Duff report goes in the right direction; all that is needed is action.
Â Â  . The majority in Parliament, including the Portuguese socialists and social democrats, has adopted an all-singing, all-dancing report.
Under the cloak of a âperiod of reflectionâ, it says that there must be debate, yet, throwing caution to the wind, has already announced its conclusion: âto relaunch the constitutional projectâ; âto avoid another defeatâ; âto deepenâ the âconsensus around the Constitutionâ; âpublicisingâ, with âadequate fundingâ, to âreassure and convince public opinionâ; and to âensure that the Constitution enters into forceâ, âduring 2009â.
Quite apart from the fact that it does not have the power to do this, Parliament is trying to muddy the waters and make the fraudulent claim that the âEuropean Constitutionâ has not actually been rejected.
It was rejected by the French and by the Dutch, whereupon it ceased to have any value, at least according to the Treaties.
It is no coincidence that UNICE, the European employersâ association, said in a letter to the Austrian Presidency: âthere is an urgent need to find a way out of the current institutional crisis in the EUâ.
It goes on to say that the âpause for reflectionâŠ seems to be marked more by pause than reflectionâ.
Europeâs captains of industry and the political forces carrying out their guidelines are, once again against the wishes of the people, trying to regain the initiative.
Â Â  I have voted in favour of paragraph 27, but I am not in sympathy with its second sentence.
Public opinion does not need to be reassured.
People can think for themselves and adopt their own view of the Constitution.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber on their excellent report on the period of reflection: structure, subjects and context for an assessment on the debate on the European Union.
I agree with the proposal that this period of reflection should be used for the purpose of relaunching the constitutional project on the basis of a broad public debate about the future of European integration.
I also agree with the suggestion that this new democratic dialogue, which should be seen as a chance to promote European democracy, should be conducted and coordinated across the Union, structured by common themes and in realistic stages according to an agreed framework for evaluation, and designed to lead to decisive political choices.
I also recognise that it is strategically important for political institutions to encourage a pro-active attitude on the part of the media (in particular television, the press and local radio) and to enlist them for the purpose of publicising and intensifying the debate.
I agree, moreover, that the conclusions of the period of reflection should be drawn at the latest during the second half of 2007, and that a clear decision be reached at that stage about how to proceed with the Constitution, and that, in any case, every effort should be made to ensure that the Constitution enters into force during 2009.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which clarifies, after the French 'no' to the Constitution, where we are in terms of future constitutional reforms of the EU.
The rapporteurs are right to note that there are a number of options available to the Union, ranging from abandoning the constitutional project altogether, continuing to try to ratify the present text unamended, seeking to clarify or add to the present text, restructuring or modifying the text or embarking upon a complete rewrite.
No conclusions should be reached on these options until the conclusion of the period of reflection, which should be in the second half of 2007.
Â Â  . The Constitution, which the voters in the Netherlands and France so overwhelmingly rejected, was a mixed bag.
Most of the electorate are all in favour of Council meetings being open to the public, of a subsidiarity test for national parliaments, or the tentative moves towards a citizensâ initiative in Article 47.
These things could have been brought in long ago, even without a constitution.
Far more contentious were the economic and military policy choices that this text was to set in stone, such as free unhindered competition being one of the EUâs main objectives, the constantly-extended liberalisation of services, or the constant upgrading of the Member Statesâ weapons systems.
The practice of tied sales, which involves good points being taken hostage by bad ones, is one that the two rapporteurs want to adopt, in the belief that approval is only a matter of time.
They even want to put a stop to the admission of new Member States until such time as the constitution has been approved.
My party, the Socialist Party, is the largest of the parties that, in the Netherlands, waged a successful campaign against this draft Constitutional Treaty.
After it was rejected by the voters, we tabled proposals in the Dutch Parliament for openness, a subsidiarity test and citizensâ initiative, similar to what Mr Brok recommended to this House on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the very same alternative that I had put forward in Amendment 6, the rejection of which represents a missed opportunity.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the scant attention paid to the historical and religious roots of the Union, the unimaginative âcut and pasteâ approach to inserting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty without anyone having the opportunity to intervene on its contents, the non-existent or, at any rate, limited information that reached Europeans regarding the decisions being taken within the Convention and an enlargement process which, despite undoubtedly adding value to and enriching the whole of Europe, was presented to Europeans without an effective media campaign that explained the reasons behind the enlargement and the opportunities it offered to everyone, are only some of the reasons for the breakdown in the ratification process of a Treaty that should have been a fundamental part of a Union with which, even today, its own people sadly find it difficult to identify themselves.
I am convinced that the improvements made to the Constitutional Treaty are necessary and, with this in mind, we hope that at the end of the reflection period we can embark on a new path that enables us to clarify todayâs controversial issues in a more effective and intelligible manner.
For that reason, we will be voting in favour of this resolution in the hope that, with the involvement of all the Community and national institutions and of the representatives of civil society and the academic world, we can quickly arrive at a new and perhaps simplified text, but one that is endowed with a common soul with which all Europeans can identify themselves.
Â Â  . â The report constitutes an unacceptable attempt to distort the will of the people of France and the Netherlands, who jubilantly rejected the reactionary European Constitutional Treaty, and attempts to reintroduce it through the back door.
The report does not even bother to negotiate minor amendments to the content of the European Constitution, which it takes as given.
With the most insolent disdain for the will expressed by the people, it attempts to organise a misinformation campaign in order to coerce the workers into finally accepting the European Constitution, so that it can enter into force in 2009.
That is why it aims to organise an arranged 'social dialogue' and gives the media an even more active role in the attempt to brainwash the masses so that, with a gun to their head, they will consent to the adoption of the European Constitution.
That is why it proposes that there should be a River Pactolus of money, in order to achieve the objective of changing people's minds.
They need to accept the fact that the European Constitution is dead and no campaign to coerce the masses will resurrect it.
The peoples of the ÎU need to understand that there will never be a good European Constitution from the imperialist union of European capital.
The only positive development for the workers and working classes is the policy to weaken the ÎU and finally bury any attempt to reintroduce any so-called constitutional arrangement of this reactionary body.
Â Â  . These are the reasons why I still reject the EU Constitution:
1. If we are to have any hope of a social and civil Europe, the Constitutional Treaty for the EU must once and for all be consigned to the archives.
2. The EU Constitution is intended to significantly accelerate the militarisation of the EU and (in III-311) lays down a whole range of militaristic projects.
3. The EU Constitution is intended to prepare the EU to be able to wage war on a global scale.
It opens up scope for worldwide military interventions (I-41,1 and III-309).
4. The Constitutional Treaty for the EU includes an explicit obligation to rearm (I-41,3).
If it were to be ratified, there would be an even greater tendency to spend more money on armaments.
5. With the Constitutional Treaty for the EU, the EUâs foreign policy would be bound only by the principles of the UN Charter rather than by the Charter as a whole (I-3,4).
This would make it possible for the EU to interpret them in such a way as to be able to wage war even without a UN mandate.
6. The Constitutional Treaty for the EU serves as a programmatic blueprint, making it possible to push the militarisation of the EU forward without reference to the treaties as they currently stand.
Among the examples of this are the extension of the EU Armaments Agency (III-311) and the establishment of the Battle Groups (III-312).
7. The Constitutional Treaty for the EU is intended to put neo-liberalism on a constitutional footing (III-177), something of which the anti-social Bolkestein directive is but an initial foretaste.
The proposal by the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, that a repeat vote be engineered in France and the Netherlands by adding to the EU Constitution a declaration on the âsocial dimensionâ of Europe which would not be legally binding is nothing short of scandalous.
Â Â  . One of our most pressing concerns is to prepare the EUâs institutional structure for forthcoming challenges, such as future rounds of enlargement.
I therefore agree that we will soon have to resume the institutional debate.
I also feel that the debate that began with the âConstitutional Treatyâ needs to be concluded.
The idea that there must be reflection, debate and closure on this issue would be one which I would accept and support.
On the other hand, the idea behind what some have been saying, namely that there is only one possible outcome, whatever that may be, is one that I would neither accept nor support.
Debate, and in particular the much-needed debate with the citizens, is by definition open and free, and I would strongly object to any attempt to restrict it.
Â Â  . The draft constitution was just not the way forward for Europe, so attempts to rehabilitate it are not welcomed.
I would be the first to say that the EU needs a new way of working, and indeed a new constitution, but not the flawed text so comprehensively rejected by the voters of the Netherlands and France.
We need to take the EU back to first principles and establish what it is for, where it adds value and where indeed it does not.
Across the EU, the institutions and practices of the EU find little favour in the eyes of our electorate, and we cannot blame them, we must alter our ways of working.
If the EU did not exist we would need to invent one, but not under the draft constitution and not in its current form.
Â Â  . I voted against this Report because I am wholly opposed to any initiative to resurrect the European Constitution.
The welcome failure of the Constitution should have presented an opportunity for genuine reflection by the leaders of the European nations on the nature and direction of the European Union.
Certainly the British people, and the people of many other countries, do not wish to subsume their nationhood into some state called Europe.
Many share the British Conservative vision of an EU that is a loose community of sovereign nations, focused on the single market and cooperating closely in other areas where there is real added value.
I note with concern the determination of the euro-integrationists to reintroduce a European Constitution by 2009, to spend more public money on propaganda campaigns to support this objective, and to introduce geographical and political limitations on the EU.
Â Â  .
I have voted against Amendment 26, 2nd part. This should not be taken to indicate that I am against a Europe-wide consultative referendum.
In fact, I am very much in favour of that. However, all the academic and practical experience of referenda indicates that they should not be held on the same day as elections to a representative assembly or parliament.
Â Â  . The conclusions of this report do not reflect the current situation in the European Union: how can we declare that the European Constitution must be ratified in 2009 and that the Treaty of Nice is completely useless?
How can we talk of a 'period of reflection' when the current draft Constitution was rejected definitively by two founder Member States of the Union?
The current treaty is certainly inadequate, but it has its uses.
It needs to be improved gradually by means of other treaties and agreements, which could include some elements from Part 1 of the Constitution.
At this stage of European reunification, is a Constitution not a bit premature?
It is now more vital than ever, in the interests of the Member States and the citizens, and in the interests of Europe itself, to come closer to the reality of life as experienced by the citizens of the new Member States and not to ignore them, otherwise the democratic deficit will worsen further.
Can we give the new Member States confidence so that they can believe in the European project?
We must not draw premature conclusions, on behalf of the citizens of our Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, it is well known that this Parliament struggles to communicate with the people it supposedly represents.
I recently talked to a group about how best to solve that problem and they told me that, in general, politicians were seen to be boring, grey and used language that is completely out of date.
They kindly made the following suggestion, using the words of a contemporary recording artist, Tony Hatch, on how to make the European neighbourhood policy better understood.
They said: âNeighbours, everybody needs good neighbours; just a friendly wave each morning helps to make a better day.
Neighbours need to get to know each other; next door is only a footstep away.
Neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours; with a little understanding you can find the perfect blend.
Neighbours should be there for one another; thatâs when good neighbours become good friends.â
For all those that know the work of Tony Hatch, they would be very proud of the fact that this was read out here today.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I supported MrÂ Tannock's report on the European Neighbourhood Policy, which was adopted on the same day as the Duff-Voggenhuber report on the future of the constitutional process.
Parliament has thus taken a consistent and ambitious political position that I very much welcome.
The Constitutional Treaty will not be ratified without clearly established borders, enabling us to say which of the countries of Eurasia are not cut out to join the EU and which should be making active preparations for accession.
In addition, the European Union's ambitions include a common foreign and security policy that, before putting the EU on the grand international diplomatic stage, should concentrate on its sphere of influence, and partnerships with the States and political communities around us.
The whole point of this valuable contribution from Parliament is to define the future content of our policy towards Russia, Turkey, the Middle East and the Maghreb.
Finally, I would like to welcome the report's reference to the need to define this neighbourhood policy in the near future, in agreement with the existing pan-European organisations such as the OECD and the Council of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I was pleased to vote for the report on the European Neighbourhood Policy.
