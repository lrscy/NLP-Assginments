Different interpretations of the regulation by national regulatory authorities obstruct the creation of a level playing field for competition in the European Union.
We therefore support the amendments that aim to achieve qualitative and quantitative improvement of the controls.
This also applies to amendments that are intended to achieve international harmonisation amongst regulatory authorities.
In short, the emphasis must lie on simple, enforceable provisions, adequate controls and identical assessment standards by regulatory authorities.
We believe that the report provides a good starting point for this.
My thanks to the rapporteur for his work.
Mr President, I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on the essence of what the proposal means to people in my constituency.
This report, and the original proposal behind it, would have grave implications for business and individuals alike.
Even though several important derogations were won in committee, the concept of the proposal remains impractical, untenable and unenforceable.
This is why, along with a number of colleagues, I have submitted an amendment which would have the Commission proposal rejected in its entirety.
Indeed it seems to me that recent times have seen the transport industry being hit hard by piece after piece of excessive legislation.
The by-word seems to be: if it moves, regulate it.
I have to justify to my constituents the ethics of a report which originally sought to bind road rescue services and public utility vehicles - all absolutely essential to society - to strict new working hours.
These requirements about working time prevent professionals from doing their job efficiently by imposing strict terms on when breaks have to be taken.
Once again we see Europe hamstringing business rather than liberating it.
The introduction of a common range of penalties in particular is worrying.
This clearly gives licence to interfere in matters of national sovereignty and national autonomy.
Indeed the subsidiarity and extraterritoriality issues apparent in this report are clear examples of the report itself being over-extended.
British Conservatives by their very nature oppose such restrictive legislation being piled on business.
We believe that this particular piece of legislation is unnecessary, highly excessive and has little relevance to the needs of business and employees alike.
It takes no account of the need for flexibility in key areas of transport, pays scant regard to the consumer and seems contemptuous of the need for Europe's industry to remain competitive, a cornerstone of the Lisbon Declaration.
I therefore have no hesitation in urging this House to support our key amendment to reject the proposal in its entirety.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the plenum we value your presence in the debates of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
The fundamental axis of this report is road safety.
As some honourable Members have said, lack of safety leads to 40 000 deaths and 1 750 000 injuries per year in the European Union.
And there is great consensus on the part of all the groups with regard to the need to achieve the objective of safety.
But here the differences begin, and we are producing proposals which will give the Council work, because the Council will have to take a position on many points on which in this House we are naturally not going to achieve unanimity.
Specifically, we are talking about one of the factors of safety.
It is true that there are technological factors, there are infrastructure factors, there are many agents involved in the question of safety or lack of safety, but I believe we must focus on the essential factor, the human factor, the driver in this case.
On the basis of Mr Markov's proposals, and with his cooperation, the report has developed, leading to greater flexibility for the driver, because it is the driver who is aware of levels of tiredness at any given moment and it must be they who call the shots in terms of rests and the distribution of working time.
There is a gremlin which creeps into all these debates and that is that sometimes this flexibility can be used by the transport company to counter the driver's capacity to decide.
If this were the case, the system of controls on companies would have to be extremely strict, since we are talking about risking lives, in particular that of the drivers themselves.
We are also talking about a very important European small or medium-sized enterprise, the transport enterprise, which we must promote and whose competitiveness we must defend.
And we are talking about a transport problem in a Europe which is not equal, a Europe which has peripheral areas for which transport has an importance which is different to that of central areas.
I believe that this report has important objectives, but we must continue to work on it until we reach a consensus.
Mr President, I too think it good that we obtain clearer rules and that the regulation be revised in such a way as to take account of the changes that have occurred in the transport sector over the last 15 years.
I think it important, however, that, in connection with regulating the safety of road transport, we obtain a clear definition of the rules relating to driving time and rest periods, viewed partly in relation to features supplementary to these rules, such as the rules governing drivers' working time, as well as checks that the rules governing driving time and rest periods are being complied with.
My country's geographical situation is such that it is particularly important for us that transport be efficient at the same time as being safe.
It is therefore important that the concept of driving time be defined as the period during which the vehicle's wheels are turning and that there be no confusion with the rules governing drivers' working time.
I want to warn against the proposals to change the present rules so as to extend rest periods because such changes could entail major expenditure without providing drivers with greater safety or better conditions.
That is because the quality of a rest is not necessarily directly proportional to its length, and it is also important that drivers themselves be able to organise their rest periods and choose where they are going to rest.
Everyone may agree that there are problems with the safety of transport on our highways, but that is not necessarily always because of unduly lax rules but, rather, because of inadequate checks and insufficient efforts to ensure that the rules are being complied with in practice.
That is something we must do something about.
I should like to add that I very much agree with my fellow MEP, Mr Blak, that we must also look at another problem for drivers.
It is important that they be safer when they take their breaks.
It is disgraceful that drivers should live in fear of assault and robbery. The Council has accepted that countries must make efforts in this area, and I am looking forward to seeing some practical initiatives soon.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Regulation (EC) No 3820/85, which is currently being replaced, deals with problems on roads, safety and all sorts of social problems.
We all know that we have had, and still are having, very great problems supervising and enforcing this.
All sorts of special cases such as the Willy Betz formula, the Kralowetz affair, etc., and most particularly the regular occurrence of road accidents with all the consequences of these make it clear that we really have our work cut out.
I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Markov and Mr Andersson, for their constructive collaboration on this work.
It will be clear that we are very much in favour of bringing this proposal into line with the proposal about the organisation of working hours, about which we had such intensive arguments in this Parliament not so very long ago.
Of course, this also applies to the reinstatement of a wide range of definitions so that they are not open to multiple interpretations.
We do not need flexible weeks; difficult definitions of driving times must be replaced; opting-out clauses must be restricted; and enforcement must be intensified.
I would, however, particularly like to focus attention on a couple of amendments which we are in favour of.
Firstly, Amendment No 90 on the reduction of the 90-hour driving time over two weeks to 80 hours.
We think that this is an important safety issue.
Secondly, the amendment concerning improving checks by linking the digital tachograph directive to this regulation.
Finally, we have a joint amendment from a number of parties about reducing the shortened daily rest periods of not less than 10 and not more than 12 hours, for which I request your attention.
Mr President, in this legislation I detect a worrying and sinister extension of the scope of Community power.
It seems to me that the Commission is no longer content just to set harmonised standards; it is now moving firmly into setting standards and priorities for enforcement.
Within the narrow confines of this legislation, ensuring standards for adequate enforcement certainly has its own internal logic, but there is more to it than meets the eye.
Road transport enforcement is carried out by a variety of agencies, most of which have multiple responsibilities and duties.
In this instance, the main burden will fall on police forces whose duties also extend to dealing with a wide range of criminal matters outside the scope of this regulation and the scope of Community law.
With resources painfully limited, the decisions on how these resources should be employed should be local decisions, based on an assessment of the needs of the local communities and their different patterns.
In this context, where the officers who deal with transport matters also deal with crime, such as burglary and other accident prevention, Community requirements in this specific area will almost certainly lead to a distortion of priorities, dictated not by local needs but by a supranational authority which has neither knowledge nor understanding of local conditions.
As a result, national authorities, in their haste to conform with the requirements of the Commission in this area, will be neglecting other duties which are actually far more important.
It is not unrealistic, therefore, to suggest that burglars will be able to roam free because police management, under pressure from national authorities, is more concerned with satisfying Community requirements.
This is simply not acceptable.
I will therefore be voting against this regulation.
I would normally thank the Commission for a proposal it sends to Parliament, but this time I am not so grateful.
I have objections to the proposal concerning driving times and rest periods in road transport in the form in which it was originally sent to Parliament by the Commission.
The amendment by Mr Bradbourn, myself and a large number of fellow MEPs is therefore intended as a signal to the European Commission to stop using this old method of legislating.
It is time we became aware of the bureaucracy we are causing.
Making new regulations does not mean that they will be enforced any better than the old regulations, which were satisfactory but were not enforced either.
Many of the new regulations cannot be monitored at all.
Other regulations are only being amended on account of the technology used for monitoring, which had worked well for 17 years.
An example of legislation that cannot be monitored and is therefore poor is the new attempt to tell self-employed contractors how long they may work.
My colleague Mathieu Grosch has improved the proposal a great deal, and it will be thanks to him that there will in fact be a directive.
The question remains, however: what possessed the Commission to come up with such poor legislation in the first place?
The last thing the sector needs is more new regulations.
What it does need is well -thought through, intelligent and harmonised monitoring that also creates a climate for honest competition, monitoring that will apply equally to the 15, soon to be 25, Member States.
I know that the European Commission supports attempts to create more extensive and more intelligent monitoring of freight traffic.
I also know, however, that cooperation often depends on personal input and sympathies and therefore still takes place on a relatively informal basis.
This difficult process must also be given more political support, and it is a pity that business must sacrifice flexibility for the sake of regulation, flexibility being the keyword in the sector.
The sector has always managed to make its way through the increasingly stringent requirements and the difficult market with great creativity, but when I look at the profit figures, I fear that even this creativity will miss the mark.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to welcome the overall objective sought by the Commission's proposal, namely of making our roads even safer.
I am therefore grateful to all of the Members who have worked on it in the committees to bring us closer to this objective.
Allow me, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and as someone from a rural constituency, nevertheless to make a number of critical comments.
At first sight, the title 'harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport' does not appear to have any relevance for agriculture policy.
However, the Commission proposal contains a number of points which are also important for agriculture.
Alongside vehicles that the layperson would imagine to be passenger, goods or towing vehicles in the conventional sense, namely cars or lorries, the Commission proposal also affects vehicles that are used in farming.
Hitherto these were excluded by virtue of the old Article 13.
If courier and express delivery services are frequently involved in serious accidents then it may well be justified to include them in the scope of this regulation.
But for milk collection vehicles and tractors to be made subject to provisions of this kind as well does seem to me to be very arbitrary.
Imagine what this means in real life: tractors - and some are really very small - with tachographs, or the driver of a milk lorry, who goes from farm to farm and can no longer have his little chat (rest period) with farmer X because he has to respect a very particular sequence of driving times and rest periods, as if he were travelling from Rotterdam to Munich.
Let me give you another example: Article 13 provides for an exemption for the transport of live animals within a 50-kilometre radius.
For vehicles transporting animal carcasses and offal there is no such exemption.
What is the reasoning behind this?
I view the restrictions that are to be introduced on breakdown vehicles in a similarly critical light.
The current regulation, which provided for exemptions in the areas that I have mentioned, certainly did not penalise the weaker members of society, but it was practicable.
Thankfully my group has tabled amendments that mitigate some of these shortcomings in the Commission proposal.
Nevertheless, I am certainly of the opinion that there will still be much more to correct before the second reading, precisely in the agricultural sector, if we want legislation that the public will understand and also accept.
Anything else just causes bad feeling towards Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you for your constructive comments on our proposal and say, in order to dispel any doubts, that this is not a social policy proposal.
That would be the responsibility of Mrs Diamantopoulou rather than me.
That is not my competence.
I am talking about road safety. That is the objective of this proposal.
If the social aspect were the primary objective, we would have to consider other issues.
I am talking about safety on our roads in the transport sector and, of course, distortions of competition.
In view of the large number of amendments proposed, I will present a list in writing to the Secretariat of Parliament indicating the Commission's specific position on each of them.
I would like to make a few general comments on the most important issues which have been raised here today, however.
Firstly, the adoption of the sectoral directive on types of work, which lays down a method for weekly calculation, makes it necessary to adapt our Regulation, above all the provisions relating to working and rest times.
The Commission therefore accepts the amendments - some with modifications to the wording - which clarify the text in this respect.
We also accept those amendments - some reworded - which call for improvements in the control and application of the regulations.
We will incorporate these suggestions into the proposal on road controls which we will present soon, bearing in mind that this is a different proposal - and this is my response to one of the speakers who referred earlier to this aspect.
We also accept the amendments which call for compatibility between the rules of the European Union and those of third countries and which call for the inclusion of smaller international transport vehicles in the legislation, especially those which provide courier services, as well as all those amendments which request a degree of flexibility in terms of permitting all existing practices which do not have a negative effect on the application of the Regulation.
Mr President, we cannot accept the arguments that this proposal is not necessary, however.
Seventeen years have passed since the original Regulation entered into force and both the nature of the market and European realities and technological developments, specifically the digital speedometer, have developed and changed considerably.
The changes therefore have to be incorporated.
The Commission will ensure a balance between flexibility and the control of application.
We cannot accept those amendments which ask for more controls and imply an excessive increase in administrative burdens.
And with regard to the exceptions and derogations, the Commission accepts those which are based on concrete realities, but not the generic ones which could be used to evade the rules.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Markov, for this wonderful work, since he has had to deal with a real sea of amendments, but I believe that in the end he has been able to propose a balanced report which the Commission generally agrees with.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Mr President, there was a minor incident yesterday involving myself and the Presidency of the sitting.
Pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to be given the floor when the Minutes are approved.
Can you confirm that the Minutes will be approved at the beginning of this afternoon, as they were not ready this morning?
Mr Gollnisch, my services tell me that the Minutes will be tabled for approval at 3 p.m. today.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.37 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.)
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
In some parts of the European Union, such as the rural and island areas of Scotland, there is simply no alternative to road transport for the distribution of goods or passengers.
For that reason, excessively restricted working hours for lorry and coach drivers would add to the difficulties already faced by residents and businesses, bringing further increases in costs of essential goods and services.
I will therefore vote against amendments which seek to apply even greater reductions in driving time than contained in the Commission's proposal.
If EU regulations are to be seen as relevant, due account must be taken of the realities facing rural and island communities.
I hope that the final proposal in relation to drivers' working hours will recognise that some areas, such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, require a flexible approach to be taken and I hope that the Council and Commission will agree.
Mr President, for unfortunate technical reasons the amendments I made to my report have not been tabled.
Before we vote on each individual amendment, I would like to explain straightaway that to ensure the whole package is coherent I have decided to table some of these amendments as oral amendments.
There are two amendments relating to the proposed new draft of Article 3 on the Agency.
There is a recital relating to the amendment of Article 29 on safety.
There is also another amendment which details my wish to pose the question of funding.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would welcome your views on this.
Mr President, I think we can make things easier for ourselves.
My group opposes the oral amendments.
I am sorry, but having discussed these reports in detail in the committee and voted on them as a package, it is simply out of the question to untie that package by making changes at this stage.
That is why my group opposes all oral amendments to the Ainardi report.
Mr President, I just wanted to point out that Amendments Nos 45 and 78, both of which have been adopted, are contradictory.
We actually intended to request a separate vote yesterday, but that all fell through.
I should therefore like to inform the administration that both amendments need to be reformulated.
Mr President, I would like to question the order decided upon for the votes. In my opinion, Amendment No 9 is the amendment which is furthest from the text adopted in committee.
However, it is for the President to decide.
Mr President, Amendment No 9 is the furthest from the committee's paragraph, but if the rapporteur is of a contrary opinion, I bow to his superior experience.
Given the level of entente, I shall also bow to that experience.
Mr President, I indicated beforehand that I wished to raise a point of order before the vote on Amendment No 24.
I refer to Rule 139(6) of the Rules of Procedure, which states that amendments have to be distributed and translated.
I have various language versions in front of me, none of which contains this particular amendment, Amendment No 24.
In addition, a number of Members, from both the conservative and Social Democratic groups, were under the impression that this vote would not be taking place until tomorrow.
I would therefore firstly move that the vote should not take place.
Insofar as it is possible for me to assess the situation as one of the proposers of the original right to bring cases before the court, I do not think that a proper decision can be made if these amendments are put to the vote first and not Mr Duff's amendment.
In any case, Members are free to exercise their independent judgment.
I refer here to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure.
Give us an opportunity actually to vote on the right to bring cases before the court, that is, on the original wording of Paragraph 8.
Mr President, I would like to call on Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo to withdraw his amendment. He is asking us to make a decision on a crucial issue that I know is very important to the Spanish people.
We are indebted to Felipe GonzÃ¡lez, the former Prime Minister of Spain, for introducing the concept of European citizenship into the Treaties. He was also responsible for developing the concept to such a great extent.
I do not however consider this to be a purely linguistic or philosophical issue. It is an issue of crucial importance.
It forms the basis of the legitimacy of the European Union.
Does Parliament want to discard the traditional definition of a Union of States and of peoples and adopt the concept of a Union of States and citizens?
It seems to me that if we want to preserve the good name of the European Union, it would be better to give this question the attention it deserves, rather than to take hasty action in approving an amendment to one of the recitals of a report on a totally different subject.
Just to clarify matters for the House, Mrs BerÃšs, you have requested that the author withdraw his amendment.
Mr President, I do not agree with the last observation by Mrs BerÃšs.
It is not a question of having an amendment passed.
It is a question of reflecting, in relation to a text which is important in terms of the Convention, on something which is of great importance to this Parliament, which is the legitimacy, the double legitimacy, of the Union.
Mr Tsatsos and I, in our report on the Treaty of Amsterdam, speak of the double legitimacy of States and peoples.
The concept of the people seems to us to be an archaic one.
We want to talk of citizens, because we want to bring Europe closer to the citizens.
I am not therefore withdrawing my amendment and I would ask that it be put to the vote.
And I would also ask the Socialist Group to take on board that this is truly the modern way to act and not the old-fashioned one.
Once upon a time there was a white dove (Europe) and a wicked eagle (the United States).
The fairy tale told in this report would not even convince a child that the United States is the only country to subsidise its airlines.
Are we to believe that the European Union does not likewise subsidise the European Airbus consortium amongst others!
Are we to believe that Member States do not support their airlines, whether they are in public or private hands!
Let the Commission publish the accounts detailing the huge direct and indirect, acknowledged and unacknowledged subsidies that the European Union and the Member States grant to the aviation and aeronautics sectors and their shareholders!
The wording of this report is hypocritical and its content scandalous. We did not support it because we are opposed to the so-called compensations the report recommends.
These are actually nothing more than further subsidies for the capitalists of the aviation industry. Above all, we reject your entire system based on competition and commercial conflict, which come at a high cost to society.
Air travel has become cheaper and cheaper over the last few decades.
In addition to the traditional national air carriers, a number of other airlines have entered the arena offering conspicuously cheap rates.
Some of these companies come from outside the EU.
What is now being proposed is aimed at these companies from outside the EU.
They are often based in countries in the developing world or countries in the former Soviet Union.
These are poor countries that think that they can make money as low-cost competitors in the European market.
For example, the Brazilian airline Varig flies people very cheaply between Amsterdam and Paris.
We need to act on this, not least because these companies make unnecessary amounts of noise and apply less stringent safety standards.
Barring these companies, however, is only part of the solution.
The low-cost airlines based inside the EU, like Ryanair, Easyjet, Virgin and Germanwings have been ignored.
The freedom from taxation enjoyed by the airlines, which gives them an unfair competitive advantage over international rail travel, likewise remains in place.
The proposals on which we are voting today are therefore a half-measure that inflicts the pain one-sidedly on other countries.
I am voting in favour of this proposal, but I think that it is one-sided and inadequate.
When will we see the essential other part that puts an end to the risks associated with the low-cost airlines?
In principle, I regard the Commission's proposal for a regulation as something to be welcomed.
Most of Parliament's amendments complement it well, but I regard the following points as problematic in view of current Community rules and practices:
a new and higher standard through substituting 'significant material injury' for 'material injury' in the area of goods, resulting in uncertainty due to the new definition, as well as the potential weakening of our negotiating position on this point at the Doha follow-up negotiations, and discrimination in favour of the service sector to the detriment of the manufacturing sector (Amendments Nos 9, 25, 26, 38);
the lack of any scope for legal action afforded to 'allied enterprises', these being defined by the existence of an alliance agreement, which, in practice, because of the worldwide network of alliances, results in marked reduction in the scope for legal action (Amendment No 39);
the need for Amendment No 60 to be clarified to ascertain whether it is to be read as meaning that a decision by the Commission shall be regarded as confirmed if no agreement on it can be reached in Council.
In any case, Amendment No 62 (qualified majority in the Council) sets a higher standard for the imposition of measures in the area of services than in that of goods.
When determining where the Community interest lies, there is a departure from the original assumption that the imposition of measures is in principle in the Community interest, unless the opposite is established to be the case, in the sense that measures are imposed only when their application is in the Community interest.
I hope that these points can be examined closely during the remainder of the proceedings.
I voted in favour of this report concerning the Commission communication on the annual report on humanitarian aid in 2000-2001, because I agree with the rapporteur's diagnosis of the situation and also with many of her proposals.
As the draftsman of the opinion of the AFET Committee says: 'the key objective of EU humanitarian action is to respond promptly and efficiently to the needs of the victims of humanitarian crises, in order to alleviate their suffering in a spirit of human solidarity.
It goes without saying that political considerations have no place in such an area'.
I attach particular importance to the rapporteur's warning that there has been a downward trend in the amount of emergency humanitarian aid, 'aid making it possible immediately to save lives'.
I consider it vital, in order to counter this trend, and as has indeed already been proposed, to strengthen action under ECHO, and to develop awareness-raising campaigns for the citizens of the European Union, so as to bring these actions closer to the public, and of course to reverse the negative trend identified in the budget.
One of our priorities should be to improve coordination of humanitarian aid and of aid providers so as to avoid the kind of situation that recently occurred in Angola when aid was 'guaranteed' but was very slow in coming through on the ground.
Our response mechanisms need to be made far more flexible.
Mr President, I am sleeping very well at the moment and I have had a lot of dreams.
In one of them, at the Palais de l'Europe casino - which does not really exist but is there in my dreams - four players were sitting at the table: Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx, Mrs Ainardi and Mr Savary.
It was an animated, very convivial game.
Mr Jarzembowski, who was dressed as a guard, was talking to the other players and said: 'The railways must be developed!'
He was illustrating his report, pleading zealously and astutely the cause of the development of the railways in Europe.
He spoke so eloquently that he convinced me to vote for his report.
I will tell you what the other players were saying when their turn comes.
We Swedish Social Democrats present the following explanation of vote regarding Amendment No 4:
A complete opening up of the market for national rail passenger services by no later than 1 January 2008 must take place under certain basic conditions.
There must, for example, be guarantees that, in the future too, rail services will cover the whole of the EU and not leave less profitable stretches of track unused, something that would be devastating for countries with large surface areas and small populations, such as Sweden.
Moreover, there must be guarantees of safety, quality and social rights before railways can be purchased.
Mr Jarzembowski's report seems to us to have benefited from the Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the process of opening up to competition to a sector where we believe the concept of public service is fundamental.
Opening up the sector to competition in this way, and also opening up Members States' rail networks infrastructure within a short timescale, could be detrimental to the development of Europe's railways. In particular, the process would introduce instability and uncertainty into a market that requires technological solutions and a high level of long-term investment.
We are aware that, on the one hand, public services must ensure that they treat all their users throughout the country equally, regardless of their individual circumstances. On the other hand, opening up the sector to competition could reduce or even do away altogether with any such concept of public service.
We therefore oppose all moves towards liberalisation unless it is first proved that it will have genuine added value. The current situation in a number of Member States demonstrate the shortcomings of a system whose sole aim is to make the greatest possible profit.
Unfortunately the Commission has not taken account of the consequences of such a system.
They can easily be quantified but have been disguised for purely dogmatic reasons.
This is why we voted against the Jarzembowski report.
With this rail package the European Commission is proposing a new version of Directive 91/440, which seeks to increase the liberalisation of rail services, in particular for freight.
The amendments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism broadened its scope to include the liberalisation of passenger services as well.
I will vote against both these measures.
We should ask why we are speeding up the liberalisation process when the 1991 directive has only just been revised.
We should ask why we are reconsidering an agreement, a balanced agreement, reached with some difficulty just over a year ago. The Member States have not even finished the transposition of the revised directive of 2001.
This means that we are moving ahead with liberalisation, with no going back, before we have even assessed the effects of the beginning of the process.
It is simplistic to assert that the main reason why rail has become less competitive than road transport for freight is because the sector has not been liberalised.
We did not have to liberalise rail passenger services to achieve cooperation between national operators in the case of Thalys.
What works for passenger services could be applied to and developed for freight services.
The will must be there though, and European and national investment at the ready.
Let us go for rail rather than for lorries!
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) Opening up Members States' rail infrastructure to competition to the fullest extent within a short timeframe could have disastrous consequences for the public service role played by national rail companies.
It entails the risk that profitable trans-European lines would be monopolised by a number of big operators, while less profitable secondary networks would be left to small operators.
Thus far, the Commission has failed to present an assessment of the consequences of rail liberalisation and the separation of rail infrastructure and operations. This proposal for complete liberalisation is very premature.
This is why I voted against it.
We are conscious that the Commission's second railway package, and in particular the proposal for a directive on the development of the Community's railways, which is the subject of the Jarzembowski report, touches on important long-standing issues in various Member States, including my own - Portugal.
Although it is not long since the previous package was adopted - agreement with the Council was only reached in 2001 - the Commission's current proposal attempts to go somewhat further with measures designed to liberalise this sector, particularly in the field of freight transport, coupled with measures to strengthen safety standards governing this mode of transport.
We believe we should support the greater liberalisation proposed by the Commission, while rejecting the amendments establishing a specific timetable for the total opening of the market in rail passenger and freight transport.
That is why we were also unable to give our support to Amendment No 13 tabled by Mr Miranda, because this amendment reflects a rigid approach to the need to revitalise a mode of transport that is environmentally clean and which has a contribution to make in the area of freight transport to reducing congestion in European road transport, but which requires substantial financial investment that only opening up the market can make viable.
The proposals for a second railway package set in motion important initiatives towards strengthening Europe's railway system.
Opening rail freight services within Member States, and accelerating the process of opening up the international ones, represent a significant step towards deregulating the railway sector.
The objectives set by the White Paper for European transport policy up to 2010, as well as the constantly increasing volume of traffic on Europe's roads, mean that absolute priority must be accorded to transferring goods traffic from road to rail.
Diverting the flow of European freight traffic can succeed in the long term only if railways are high-performing and competitive.
The planned harmonisation of the European railway network is therefore to be welcomed, provided that a maximum of safety in rail travel can be guaranteed.
In the same dream, Mr President, still at the Palais de l'Europe casino, another player at the table was Mr Sterckx. Now, Mr Sterckx was dressed as a cyclist.
Why was that?
Who knows!
Probably the fact that the names Merckx and Sterckx rhyme had made me imagine him to be a cyclist, and a very fast cyclist at that, given that Eddy Merckx won all his races, as we all remember well.
Indeed, Mr Sterckx was talking to the others and illustrating his report, stressing the importance of high speed in the railways in Europe and, in particular, the need for high-speed trains to contain especially comfortable accommodation for pensioners.
Listening to this, I could only vote for Mr Sterckx' excellent report the next morning, as, indeed, I have done.
. (FR) You are using the pretext of ending the national fragmentation of the European rail network, which should have been integrated long ago, as an excuse to impose an even worse type of fragmentation between competing private interests.
The claim that a so-called Community safety system will be developed at best reflects your concern given the likely scenario. Private interests will be concerned with maximising their profits.
They will not prioritise investment in human resources and materials to ensure adequate safety standards.
In truth, you only refer to the issue of safety to ensure that 'additional national requirements' cannot 'restrict market access'.
The safety standards you refer to are minimum standards, which will lead to disasters on the railways.
We rejected the report and we maintain that the public service ethos of rail services should not be altered.
We are also opposed to the concept of public service being lost in the pursuit of profit.
I voted for this report because I too believe that if we are to make the Community's railway system safer and raise the standard of international rail services, we need to encourage a progressive move towards a system of common safety standards in the Member States.
I am delighted to see what excellent safety indicators the European railway system has. This only goes to underscore the urgent need to increase the use of rail transport and to reduce the use of road transport, especially heavy goods vehicles, which has a poorer safety record.
The report before us describes a package for the liberalisation of railway services, which is intended to take place by 2008. In this respect, however, it is important to learn from the British experience over recent years, which indicates that the public authorities need to carry on supervising and checking compliance with rail safety regulations, particularly as regards infrastructure maintenance.
I have also been looking at some of the suggestions emanating from the relevant committee as regards the introduction of a safety certificate for train operating companies and for those responsible for infrastructure management.
It also suggested appropriate training leading to a qualification for railway staff, together with access to all information on safety for all new rail companies, and the adoption of a single working language for all international transport, as in the world of aviation.
Referring to the second rail package we have just voted on, Commissioner de Palacio said this morning that without liberalisation, we would soon be left with nothing but a railway museum.
It is my belief that liberalisation would leave us with nothing but a cemetery filled with passengers!
The Jarzembowski report advocates speeding up the liberalisation of both freight and passenger services. The report's lack of realism and its relentless pursuit of ideas despite the evidence are frightening.
In outlining his vision of liberalisation, the author has overlooked the time needed to alter structures and has totally neglected both the social and the human factors.
Dreams outlined on paper, especially those concerning liberalisation, often turn into nightmares for those who have to implement them.
The Sterckx report presents a vision of a standardised safety system achieved through harmonising rules and procedures and so on.
Although this would be useful, unfortunately the report makes safety standards subject to profit imperatives and completely neglects the issue of working conditions.
To prevent the liberalisation process leading to communication problems, railwaymen must communicate in terms everyone can understand, as is the case for air transport.
I would have no objection to this if railwaymen were selected and paid in the same way as pilots are.
This would actually be good news for all rail workers, but I doubt it could really happen.
This being the case, I cannot support these two reports.
I therefore voted against them.
Mr President, Mrs Ainardi was also playing at the Palais de l'Europe casino in my dream - a game of poker in this case - with the other rapporteurs on the European railways.
She was extremely elegant and beautiful and surrounded by many young admirers, but when it came to her turn to play, she always said, 'Pass'. When the other players asked her why, she replied: 'We must avoid breaks in our game, just as, at Europe's borders, we must avoid breaks between railway networks.
See how much less time the game takes if there are no breaks.
Of course, therefore, I could not fail to vote for the Ainardi report.
We do of course support the interoperability of the trans-European rail system and some of the measures proposed in this report.
The measures relating to interoperability are however contained in a rail package which propounds extending competition to the rail transport sector and opening it up to privatisation.
The report stresses long-term profitability and is expresses concern about a reduction in the competitiveness of rail transport. It does not however take a clear stand against privatisation and competition or against the consequent dismantling of a public service.
In essence, this report reflects policies that seek to do away with public services.
We therefore abstained from the vote on this report.
I must congratulate Mrs Ainardi on her excellent work.
Her report is part of a 'rail package' that seeks to promote the development of the rail sector through the creation of an integrated rail system.
This would involve achieving the interoperability of the trans-European rail system, crucial to ensure that international traffic can flow freely.
Until now, the fact that different countries have very different specifications and technical standards, that are often incompatible, has created difficulties in using rail transport.
As a strong supporter of the railways, I think this is a deplorable situation. It has repercussions for both the protection of the environment and passenger safety.
I therefore very much welcome the Commission's proposal to attempt to coordinate the different TSIs (technical specifications on interoperability).
That said, safety standards must never be harmonised to a lower level!
We must also make it necessary to assess the expected benefits of each and every proposed TSI in terms of market share, traffic growth, environmental concerns, safety standards and social issues.
Advocates of the concept of public service must keep an eagle eye on these issues, given the prevailing philosophy on this subject!
Mr President, Mr Savary was also playing at the Palais de l'Europe casino with Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx, and Mrs Ainardi, but he was wearing a fireman's uniform in my dream and was saying to the others: 'I am wearing a fireman's uniform for two reasons: firstly because, with my report, I am rushing to the aid of rail passengers, who must have safe railways, and secondly, because who is better qualified than I am to ensure safe railways?
My name is Savary, as derived from the words 'safe' and 'save'.
I am in the best position to make the railways safe!
Moreover, I saw from his report that this is, indeed, the case, and I therefore decided to vote for Mr Savary's report on the safety, specifically, of rail transport.
In order to guarantee the safety, quality and efficiency of transport on our continent - including both passenger transport and freight - we need to give absolute priority, once and for all, to transport and in particular to rail transport, not to mention short sea shipping and maritime cabotage.
I therefore think that the idea of setting up a European Railways Agency is a very important one; this agency would work with the Commission to promote greater cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders involved in rail policy and the operability of the railway system, whilst also making an ongoing contribution to the debate through its recommendations and opinions.
If proper publicity is given to its remit as regards consultation, monitoring and submitting proposals, this will result in ever greater awareness, on the part of both the Member States and the European public, of the enormous advantages of this mode of transport, especially as compared with the increasing problems and dangers associated with road transport.
Still on this subject, I would like to mention the White Paper European transport policy for 2010: time to decide which refers in various places to the need to reverse the trend away from rail and towards road transport.
I therefore hope that this will represent a further step towards the objective of creating a genuine internal market in rail services which will above all make it possible to effectively reduce the volume of traffic on our roads, and especially the enormous volume of freight transported by heavy goods vehicles.
This, Mr President, is a revolutionary proposal, the proposal advanced by myself and the Pensioners' Party, and I therefore hope that it will meet with great attention from all the many, esteemed Members of the European Parliament here today.
The Markov report organises, inter alia, the working hours and rest periods of drivers engaged in the carriage of goods and passengers by road.
Well then, my proposal is as follows. Why do we not organise pension years in the same way as we regulate the daily working hours: ten years of work and then five years of pension, then another ten years of work and five years of pension, then another ten years of work and five of pension?
In this way, I am sure we could start to enjoy our pensions between the ages of 25 and 30, for example, from 35 to 40 and so on. My figures might not be exact but I believe the concept is clear.
I propose that we decide to start to draw on our pensions and have a rest from work not when have grown old but at intervals throughout our working lives, as I have endeavoured to illustrate.
Mr President, when I read yesterday's newspapers from Luxembourg, I was amazed at the fuss created by the Greens, who have made themselves out to be the prime movers behind the revision of the Regulation harmonising certain social security provisions in the area of road transport.
If our rapporteur had read these articles, he would surely also be astonished, as, out of the 269 amendments with which the committee had to get to grips, a mere 16 originated from the Greens, and - thank God - 14 of those were voted out.
It takes a certain kind of sheer nerve to muster the whole of Luxembourg's press in order to give them to believe that this report would bear the stamp of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, whereas it in fact saw the light of day in consequence of an agreement between the rapporteur and the three largest groups in this House.
Today, I have voted against the amendment on driving times that the Greens have put before us, my reason being that it does not guarantee the necessary flexibility and would do the drivers a disservice.
A solution as inflexible as this one would in fact not permit those who have to drive at a great distance from their base to apportion their rest periods in such a way as to allow them to spend more time with their families and friends.
I welcome the opportunity given to us at first reading to make a sensible contribution to a regulation on social provision that is clearer, safer, and more controllable.
I hope that, from 2004, the digital tachograph will prevent black sheep from finding new boltholes!
. (FR) First of all I would like to express my satisfaction with the report by Mr Markov supporting the Commission proposal of October 2001 for a new regulation on road transport.
This report includes in particular the improvements made by the new regulation to the current situation, with the dual objective of increasing road safety and improving working conditions for drivers.
Measures such as removing the possibility of dividing breaks, extending scope, increasing penalties for infringing the regulation, which are measures that appeared in the Commission proposal and are reiterated in the report, represent important milestones.
The Markov report reinforces the regulation further, for example, by opposing the creation of a flexible week through the introduction of a limit on working time, by setting a fixed driving time or encouraging the participation of the social partners.
I would particularly like to highlight the importance of the measure aimed at extending the scope of the regulation to all lorry drivers operating within European territory, whether or not they are EU nationals.
This measure might consequently considerably reduce social dumping while encouraging third countries to strengthen their national legislation to improve working conditions for their drivers.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (FR) The text proposed certainly represents some progress for countries where there is currently no legislation at all or legislation that is extremely unfavourable to workers in this field.
It is sickening, however, that a text entitled 'social legislation' would allow drivers to work 56-hour weeks.
Furthermore, we feel it is unacceptable to make the situation worse in countries with higher levels of protection in order to improve it in others.
The only acceptable form of harmonisation would standardise social protection and working conditions to the highest level.
That, moreover, is the only way to prevent haulage companies in France from employing workers who are less well-paid and have less protection as they are nationals of countries whose legislation, in particular concerning the length of the driving period, is non-existent or unfavourable to lorry drivers.
Furthermore, the laws that provide protection, however minimal, for workers must not remain a dead letter, as is often the case, but must be made mandatory for employers.
Whilst this proposal was submitted in the name of safety and simplification, its contents provide for little more than further bureaucracy and regulation.
We are particularly concerned about the effect that these measures would have on minibuses operated by the voluntary and non-commercial sectors.
Whilst the British government has expressed an intention to apply for a national derogation within this area, it is our opinion that the interests of the voluntary sector are best protected by the existing exemptions.
Changes to rest requirements and driving times will severely reduce the ability of schools and coach companies to offer trips abroad at an economically viable rate.
These proposals impose further burdens on an industry that is already heavily regulated, yet the Commission fails to provide any cost-benefit analyses to justify its arguments.
The British Government has described many of these proposals as being either unnecessary or disproportionate to any benefit.
We are happy to support this line and trust that they will act accordingly when these measures are considered by the Council.
. (FR) The aim here is to simplify the rules governing the organisation of driving times and rest periods within the Union in order to increase road safety and improve working conditions for the people covered by the regulation.
This proposal also aims to make the current rules compatible with the use of new digital recording equipment in order to improve compliance with the rules in force.
Mr Markov's report is along the same lines as the positive proposals by the European Commission: removing the possibility of dividing breaks, reducing exemptions, repealing measures concerning a minimum age for drivers, and introducing more stringent penalties for infringement of the rules.
The rapporteur, however, has also succeeded in introducing amendments which I consider to be crucial.
The report rejects provisions concerning the flexible week, increases controls and penalties in cases of non-compliance with the provisions of the regulation, and increases the participation of social partners.
On the other hand, the rapporteur did not achieve a vote in favour of the amendment rightly proposing to reduce the working week to 45 hours.
It was therefore tabled again in plenary and I naturally voted for it!
. (FR) We fully agree that there is a need to harmonise social legislation on road transport.
Our concern is not to prevent distortion of competition with third countries, but to guarantee lorry drivers the best pay, status and working conditions.
We cannot be content with half-measures in this sector, which has been abandoned to capitalist brutality.
It is right to oppose the flexible week, restrict working times and specify the minimum age of drivers engaged in the carriage of goods.
We need to increase controls, penalise employers who fail to comply with the provisions of the regulation and increase the participation of the social partners.
The Markov report, however, does not go far enough with regard to weekly driving time and the possibility of dividing breaks.
It is insufficient to reduce the weekly driving time, which is currently set at 56 hours, to 45 hours.
It is unacceptable to authorise the division of rest time.
These two measures perpetuate the fact that drivers are employees who are forced to break the law for greater market profits.
That is why, although we are in favour of progressive social measures, we did not, in the end, vote for this report.
Decisions on safety are usually preceded by fatal accidents.
Other considerations are all given priority until regulation becomes unavoidable, and then the emphasis is on freedom for business, limiting costs and free competition.
Yet everyone knew beforehand that allowing professional drivers to drive too long would result in accidents.
Unfortunately that has never stopped people in this industry from being allowed to work for longer consecutive periods than in other industries where less harm can be caused.
Businesses want to avoid taking on a second driver and avoid waiting times at all costs, as these measures cost money.
What is more, drivers want to be protected against overworking and overtiredness, but they also want to get home quickly after a long trip.
Self-employed drivers even believe that they are exempt from the regulations, and businesses who want to exploit this have sold their lorries to their drivers.
If we give in to such counterforces, honest hauliers and the railways will be driven out of business.
Getting all lorries and courier services that drive within the EU, even those driven by self-employed drivers or those from outside the EU, to comply with the standard of not less than 12 hours' rest a day and working not more than 9 hours a day and 90 hours over two weeks is therefore an important step in the right direction.
We were happy to vote for the Markov report.
At a time when efforts are being made both at European and national level to adopt measures to reduce the number of road accident victims - an area in which Portugal unfortunately tops the list - it would be very hard not to agree with a report which aims to improve the social and working conditions of drivers engaged in road transport.
The report we have now approved considers measures that are undeniably positive: removing the proposal for a flexible week; imposing limits on driving time and working hours; setting a minimum age for drivers engaged in the carriage of goods; limiting possible derogations; increasing the involvement of Europe's social partners; and encouraging the extension of these regulations to cover all drivers on the EU's roads.
These measures deserve our approval, given that they will make a serious contribution to improving road safety.
However, we very much regret that a majority of Members of this House did not support the rapporteur's proposal to reduce weekly driving time to 45 hours.
We nevertheless hope that the Commission and the Council will be sufficiently open-minded towards the amendments that have now been adopted.
Mr President, I would just like to say that I voted for this message to the Convention on the recognition of the role of the regions and local authorities in European integration. The Convention has been rather silent on this point.
Given the phenomena of regionalism, devolution and decentralisation present throughout Europe, the importance of the regions is clear in practical terms.
The Napolitano report may well have needed more genuinely federalist solutions, taking the principle of subsidiarity to its most far-reaching, logical conclusion: this is a goal to be achieved in the coming years.
I regret to say that the expectation that regional electoral colleges would be set up for the European elections has been disappointed in the report, the call for the direct participation of regions with legislative powers in Council meetings has been disappointed and the proposal to give regions direct access to the Court of Justice has, regrettably, been rejected.
These are issues to which the Convention will have to return for the good of regionalism.
Mr President, in 1990, as Parliament's rapporteur on what became the Maastricht report, I urged the establishment of what we now know as the 'Committee of the Regions'.
I did so because local authorities in regions play a vital role in implementing European law.
Given that role, I felt it was right that they should have a say in the adoption of European law.
The Napolitano report takes that principle and moves it forward in the context of today's Europe.
I welcome what Mr Napolitano has argued for in terms of the higher status of regions and local authorities in European decision-making.
But I also accept that he is right to do that in a non-prescriptive way that does not interfere with the internal constitutions of the Member States.
By making a case for the regions but leaving it to the individual Member States to decide how to implement his recommendations, he has struck the right balance.
For example, we have just heard an argument for regions to be involved in the Council of Ministers.
I support that argument, but each Member State must do that in the context of its own constitution.
Finally, the one weakness in the Napolitano report is that it has not given enough emphasis to the role of regions with legislative authority.
I hope that the Commission will look at that and find a way of engaging them more coherently in EU activities.
Mr President, like other speakers, I am glad that in relation to the Napolitano report we have moved forward on some important points.
It is recognised that, in appropriate constitutional circumstances, regions will have access to the Court of Justice.
It is recognised rather clearly and in good terms that the principle of subsidiarity is iterative and applies down the line, not just between the Union of the Member States, but to the regions and local authorities as well.
There are some points I regret.
I particularly regret that the opportunity was not taken to comment about the odd composition of the Committee of the Regions.
In future, for example, it seems probable that there will be five Members from Malta in the Committee of the Regions, as against 21 from Spain and 24 from the United Kingdom.
That means that there will likely be five times as many Maltese as Galicians in the Committee of the Regions, if any Galicians get there at all - or Catalans or Scots.
This is not a satisfactory situation.
The Committee of the Regions is supposed to counterbalance the Parliament.
The balance of populations and regions on the Committee of the Regions is not at all a reasonable one.
This report will not convince those in my party at home who think that being an independent Member State would be better than being a constitutional region, as things stand.
Mr President, last night, I dreamed about Mr Napolitano too.
Mr Napolitano, who is the rapporteur of this document on the role of the regional authorities, was the President of the WUR - the World Union of Regions - in my dream.
Already, since, in my dream, a single world government had been established made up of the regions, the individual States no longer existed and the regions had assumed such importance as to form, all together, a worldwide association, the WUR - the World Union of Regions - with Mr Napolitano as President.
I know that this is only a dream and that the dream is unlikely to come true, but since these regions had ceased to fight with each other, as, I regret to say, some States still do now, it is my hope and desire that, step by step, as per the Napolitano report, we will genuinely achieve the WUR, the World Union of Regions.
I therefore voted for the motion.
Mr President, I, like many other Members, found it impossible to vote against the resolution arising from the Napolitano report, because the report, first of all, and then the resolution, are innovative texts with regard to the regional dimension.
Unfortunately, numerous votes in plenary have damaged this remarkable work.
Furthermore, as Mrs BerÃšs pointed out so superbly, it is imprudent and dangerous to improvise at voting time by proposing, in plenary, the adoption of concepts which, as it happens, were neither discussed nor even raised in committee.
Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo replied that the concept of 'people' was outdated.
That, in fact, is what the right has continually repeated in Europe over previous centuries and it is not convincing.
Surprisingly enough, however, the text, which is presented as forward-looking, has the effect of strengthening the concept of States within the Union, which I am sure was the desired objective.
That is why I abstained.
Mr President, I voted for the report, although I am quite aware that this is not a decisive document but just a recommendation and we do not know how it will be received.
I hope that the Commission and the Member States take into consideration many of the points adopted, although I must lament the fact that some fundamental parts have been rejected, such as those providing for the participation of regions with legislative powers in the European Union's Council of Ministers.
I feel that this is an area in which, in any case, it is for the Member States to decide.
My political party has already supported amendments and legislative proposals to that effect in Italy, and I hope that the European regions will be able to have more influence, notwithstanding the fact that this matter must continue to be the competence, for the most part, of the individual States, without interference from the Union.
Mr President, I knew that Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo was reactionary on issues of European diversity, but I did not know that he was so ignorant.
To call the concept of a people archaic not only runs counter to the fundamental principles of our civilisation, it is also contrary to many constitutions, such as that of the United States of America, which starts with the precise phrase 'We the people'.
Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo's statement conflicts with the constitution of the United States, and also with the views of his boss, JosÃ© Maria Aznar.
Mr President, we believe that the European Union is at present an historically unprecedented union of shared sovereignty, and the stateless nations, such as Galicia, want to make progress through their participation in these institutions, and are even working towards a kind of internal enlargement.
What we ask is why Malta and not Galicia?
Why Cyprus and not Scotland?
Stateless nations very often have a history, a political will and a demography that justify this participation.
Nevertheless, the Napolitano report was a step in the right direction, but it has to some extent been frustrated by the reactionary Jacobinism of people like Mr Aznar and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, a Jacobinism that is now negated by the reality of the European Union itself.
. (FR) During yesterday's debate here in Parliament, I pointed out that the participation of the regions in the European decision-making process advocated by the Napolitano report would open a Pandora's box, which would then release all kinds of surprises.
We were given a foretaste of these at the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which voted, probably swept along by its own momentum, for strange provisions, such as the right of regional and local authorities to adapt European legislation according to local needs.
Naturally, the committee members who voted for these provisions were then disowned by their groups, and Parliament has just made corrections in plenary.
It has only, however, ironed out the most obvious problems.
The rest, which bypasses the Member States more insidiously, has been retained.
These mistakes have simply brought to light the direction this report would take if it were implemented.
Furthermore, Parliament voted for an amendment which revealed that the Union would henceforth be based on the legitimacy, not of the 'peoples' (each taken as a whole), but of the 'citizens' (taken individually).
This kind of development would change the nature of the Union and make it more similar to a Nation-State.
We have therefore voted against this report.
- (DA) We shall vote in favour of compromise Amendment No 30 and Amendment No 21 if Amendment No 30 is not adopted.
We would point out, however, that the content of the amendments must not be included in a possible future European constitution but be included in a future treaty.
The June Movement does not, in fact, wish to see a European constitution that will take precedence over the national constitutions.
The proposal in the report to give the Committee of the Regions the right to bring before the EC Court of Justice cases in which the principle of subsidiarity may have been breached and to appear before the Court in order to defend its rights is unfair.
The Member States are not homogenous. They range from federal states to centralised unitary states.
It is therefore difficult to design political forms of cooperation within the EU when it comes to the role of the Committee of the Regions and to that of the regional and local authorities.
The Committee of the Regions lacks democratic legitimacy, and we believe it should be phased out, not developed.
With the democratic deficit in today's EU, it is more important first and foremost to develop the role of the national parliaments.
It is in actual fact states, and not regions, that are members of the EU.
. (ES) This Parliament has just missed a great opportunity to act in accordance with its role as representative of the peoples of Europe as laid down in the Treaties.
Firstly, and this is the most serious thing, because by approving amendment by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo - whose 'care' has been noted - we are depriving the European peoples of their capacity as holders of some of the Union's legitimacy, which, in accordance with the philosophy of the Treaties, they are entitled to.
Secondly, because the final text lays down that the regions with legislative powers will not be able to bring cases before the Court of Justice on their own behalf, and that they must do so with the prior agreement of the State.
The Socialist amendment, proposing that the case should be presented through the intermediary of the State, was not much better.
Thirdly, nor are these regions explicitly guaranteed the right to participate in Councils of Ministers which deal with matters falling within their competence, leaving this capacity to arbitrate to the respective governments whose lack of political will in relation to this issue is, in the majority of cases, including Spain, notorious.
The Napolitano report, however, still contains some very positive aspects and I have therefore decided to vote in favour of it tomorrow.
We agree with regionalisation and with the idea of strengthening the role played by regional and local authorities within the constitutional framework and within sovereign decision-making processes in each Member State. For that reason, we support those aspects that the report emphasises in this respect.
For the same reason, we think it is important that there should be a forum at EU level, and indeed one already exists, the Committee of the Regions, for exchanging experience on the work of these authorities and to provide them with a means of presenting their views at EU level on matters relevant to them.
Nevertheless, although some positive amendments have been adopted, the Napolitano report is still inspired by the more or less explicit objective of trying to create direct links between the institutions of the European Union and regional and local authorities, thus bypassing the Member States' sovereign decision-making powers. We cannot agree with this, because internal organisation is a matter for the Member States alone, especially when it comes to how decisions are made.
So, although we agree with reinforcing the role of the regions, we reject any federalist approach that aims to circumvent the sovereignty of the Member States of the European Union.
I would like to congratulate Giorgio Napolitano on his excellent and timely report on the role of regional and local authorities in the building of Europe, which I support.
I particularly support the need for the Union to find new ways for regional and local authorities to participate in Community activities without neglecting the important role of the Committee of the Regions.
I also very much support the need to ensure that regional and local authorities are involved when Community policies and legislative acts are being conceived and drawn up, as it is most often those authorities that are responsible for implementing such policies and acts.
Nevertheless, I believe that these links should be established at the level of individual Member States.
I very much support Mr Napolitano's desire for consolidation of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, which concerns the outermost regions.
It is certainly necessary to take steps so as to allow us to take full advantage of the scope for action provided for in the current provisions governing the outermost regions, thus making it possible to put into practice a genuine Community policy for the outermost regions, a policy genuinely committed to overcoming the limitations imposed by their location.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs believes that the hierarchical and pyramid-like structure of the EU's institutional system should be abandoned in favour of a system involving regional and local authorities more in Europe's decision-making process.
One of the key questions addressed in this report is, quite rightly, the role of the Committee of the Regions. The report stresses the legitimacy and the vital role of this committee as an institutional partner for regional and local authorities within the framework of the Union.
Against this background, genuine changes to the Treaties are envisaged at precisely the point when the Convention is moving forward with its work, such as granting the Committee of the Regions the right to bring cases before the Court of Justice in the event of a breach of the principle of subsidiarity - a right also to be extended to those regional and local authorities that have legislative powers - in order to protect their rights, in many cases against their own Member States.
This, and other proposals such as the proposed addition to Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union, would mean that the Member States, which are the sole members of the Union, would overnight be reduced to playing a secondary role in the building of Europe, quite apart from issues of constitutionality that would doubtless be raised in some Member States.
I was therefore forced to vote against the report, despite the fact that it included some positive proposals such as the defence of linguistic diversity and the promotion of the outermost regions.
I generally support the diagnosis contained in this report concerning the clearly diverse nature of regionalisation and of the very concept of a region, just as I support the view that regionalisation has 'to a large extent been the result of institutional and political developments specific to each of the countries concerned'.
Although I agree in principle about the effective existence of different traditional and specific administrative approaches in each Member State, I part company from the report when, politically speaking, it tries to relegate the Member States to a subordinate role, encouraging interference in the Member States' decision-making processes, promoting their legal and institutional fencing-in with powers being assumed by the European institutions and the regions, and advocating that the political legitimacy of the regions should be artificially equated with that of the Member States in the Treaties.
As I see it, the attempt made in this report to water down the functions and the importance of the Member States on the grounds that it brings the people closer to the Union's institutions is tantamount to an at times covert new version of federalist opportunism. There seems to be an attempt to make us forget the inter-state approach that underpinned the creation of the Union, whilst neglecting the pivotal and vital role of the Member States as privileged vectors and actors in the process of building Europe.
I accordingly voted against the report.
However, one important positive point in this report is the recommendation that Article 299 of the EC Treaty, which relates to the outermost regions, should be consolidated.
The Minutes of Monday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, allow me to reassure you right away. I shall not use my three minutes of speaking time for personal reasons as I am authorised to do under Rule 122(2) of the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament.
I would simply like to raise a minor incident over which I disagree with the President of the sitting, Mr Provan, and which is not serious in itself, but which I find unpleasant all the same.
I, like other Members, asked to speak in relation to the setting of the agenda.
I wanted to raise the issue of British aerial attacks on Iraq and ask Parliament to hear Mr Javier Solana to see how these actions would fit into the framework of common foreign and security policy.
This speech does indeed, therefore, concern the agenda.
Mr Provan cut me off before I could finish my one-minute speech, which prevented him from understanding that this speech was indeed about setting the agenda.
I can, at a pinch, understand how Mr Provan could have misunderstood me on this matter.
What I find entirely unacceptable, however, is that, in a way, he prevented me from speaking on all the other matters on which the Rules of Procedure allowed me to speak.
In particular, I think I was the first to want to speak on the proposal made by one speaker with regard to setting the agenda on North Korea.
Mr Provan conspicuously disregarded my request for the floor, even though I was the first to make such a request.
Lastly, pursuant to Rule 121(a) of our Rules of Procedure, I was also entitled to speak for one minute.
I had an assistant check that I was indeed listed.
Mr Provan, once again, refused to give me the floor, even though he had been told by the nearby administrative staff for the sitting that I was listed pursuant to this Rule 121(a).
Mr Provan said in a way that he knew what I wanted to talk about and that consequently he had decided, since he did not agree with my first speech, not to give me the floor.
I find this interpretation to be somewhat offensive.
I believe the President of the sitting should, as part of his duties, give the floor to Members who are exercising their rights under the Rules of Procedure, without prejudging what the Member is going to say.
Mr Gollnisch, for your information and that of the House, there will be a debate on 29 January 2003, led by Mr Solana, on the question of Iraq regarding Mr Hans Blix's report to the United Nations.
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)
The next item is the Council statement on the work programme of the Greek Presidency.
I should like, on behalf of the House, to acknowledge that Prime Minister Simitis took the time in December, before the formal launch of the presidency, to meet with the Conference of Presidents of Parliament.
I thank him and his ministerial and public service colleagues for that meeting.
We look forward to working closely and productively with the Greek Presidency.
It gives me great pleasure to call upon the Prime Minister to make his opening statement.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am both honoured and delighted to be here today, in my role as President-in-Office of the European Council, to present the priorities of the Greek Presidency.
As chairman of various Councils in the past, I have been involved in proceedings with the European Parliament and have appreciated at first hand how useful and indispensable this dialogue is.
The Greek Presidency plans to cooperate with Parliament to the maximum possible extent at all levels.
It plans to cooperate not merely as a formality, but because cooperation is, I believe, a necessary and fundamental factor in achieving our joint objectives.
We shall grab every possible opportunity for fruitful cooperation between us.
Greece is one of the countries which believes that developing the European Union will help to strengthen the role and authority of the European Parliament.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an historic phase in the ongoing development of Europe.
All of us, the Council, Parliament, the Commission and our citizens, are expected to help with this phase.
To support the move towards European integration, to a Europe of the 25 and/or more Member States, a Europe constructed and developed on the basis of our common values, the values which have informed our actions over the past fifty years.
A Europe which creates the potential for everyone to grow and prosper, which strengthens every country's society, and which promotes cohesion and solidarity.
A Europe which, in a multipolar global system, works for peace, cooperation and justice.
Working in this direction is not our only responsibility.
It is important that we make these policies convincing, that we convince people that the Europe we are building is focused on caring for its nations and citizens and ensuring that everyone shares a common future in a community of values.
The presidency's programme has not been planned solely to meet the challenge of the ongoing development of Europe; it has also been planned to meet the challenge posed by today's international economic climate, the global recession and all the sources of insecurity waiting to ambush our societies: the lack of competitiveness and stability in the economy, unemployment, social exclusion and so on and so forth. We need to respond to this insecurity with decisive action, to hit at the heart of individual and collective insecurity and to create a more rational, a fairer and freer living environment which offers everyone more opportunity.
At the same time, we need to turn our attention to the international crises that create insecurity.
International crises which originate in the fragile states on the fringes of the Union, international crises rooted in the Middle East, international crises caused by international terrorism.
What we need is a Europe which has a constant presence and speaks with one clear voice on the international stage.
Ladies and gentlemen, under the decisions taken in Seville, we were required to plan the Greek Presidency in collaboration with the next presidency, the Italian Presidency, so that an annual operational action programme could be formulated.
We did precisely that and I should like to comment on our five main sets of priorities.
It goes without saying that our first priority post Copenhagen is enlargement.
We need to continue with all the basic, procedural arrangements so that the accession treaties can be signed in Athens on 16 April.
Your role is paramount in these arrangements because the European Parliament has to assent to the accession of the new Member States.
At the same time, we shall continue negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in application of the new pre-accession strategy for these two countries.
Our aim is to keep to the timetable for their accession in 2007.
We shall be actively working on Turkey's progress towards accession.
Greece believes that Turkey should take its place in Europe on the basis of the decisions already taken by the European Councils.
We must give Turkey the opportunity to carry out the reforms its country needs.
That is why the Copenhagen European Council decided to follow a strategy, a plan aimed at starting accession negotiations with Turkey.
The next two years will be crucial here.
Greece, both as the country holding the presidency and as a Member State, wants to help with this new process, which is why one of our objectives is to draft a new partnership agreement with Turkey.
We also aim to develop relations with the countries of the Western Balkans, so that they can join the process and accede to the European Union at a later date.
I should like to comment at this point on the question of Cyprus.
We want Cyprus to join the European Union as a united country.
We want it to overcome and resolve its political problem.
We want the two communities to share a common future and enjoy the benefits accession has to offer.
We felt right from the start that the Annan plan gave Cyprus a chance to resolve its political problem.
We have been working along these lines and we hope that a solution will be found by 28 February.
Whatever happens, Cyprus will accede to the Union, as agreed in Copenhagen, although the way will still be left clear for the Cyprus problem to be resolved and the acquis communautaire to be applied to the whole island.
Our second priority is to reform the European economy and promote social cohesion.
The spring summit in 2003 will be held in a political and economic climate beset with both problems and opportunities.
The introduction of the euro last year was an historic process.
We believe that, although progress has been made, the Lisbon strategy is now more topical than ever.
We need to implement the economic decisions taken over recent years which we have not done enough to promote.
This is a vital opportunity to update the European economic and social model.
Ladies and gentlemen, we shall be working on six issues.
First, macro-economic policy; we want a reliable European economic policy, an intergovernmental economic policy in Europe.
Secondly, we want to create more and better jobs.
This will help to consolidate social solidarity and cohesion.
It is important that we review the European Employment Strategy and a debate on the subject will allow us to make more of the social pillar in the Lisbon strategy.
Our third aim within the Lisbon framework is to encourage entrepreneurship and support small enterprises.
The presidency sets great store by support for entrepreneurship, which is important to economic development, not to mention employment and regional development.
Our fourth aim is to build up the European economy of knowledge and innovation, because we cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives unless we develop knowledge and technology.
As you all know, a number of issues are still pending, such as the Community patent, and we intend to try and wrap them up.
The presidency will also be tackling other issues, such as developing research in cutting-edge technologies, including defence research.
Our fifth aim is to improve links within Europe, by which I mean full and operational liberalisation of the energy and transport markets, extending the trans-European energy and transport networks, promoting the single services market and unifying the financial markets.
Our sixth aim is to safeguard future prosperity through sustainability.
This mainly means reviewing the Union's strategy on sustainable development in the light of the outcome of the world summit in Johannesburg.
We want to make more of the Union's leading role in environmental protection.
So much, ladies and gentlemen, for our second set of priorities which relates to the Lisbon strategy.
Our third set of priorities covers the sensitive issue of immigration, illegal immigration, external borders and asylum.
We all know that immigration in one form or another has now taken on such proportions that we are forced to act.
And we need to act in two directions.
We need to ensure that the Union becomes a genuine area of freedom, justice and security for its citizens, free from any form of organised crime, xenophobia and racism.
That it becomes a multicultural area of understanding for man's problems, that we fight the causes of problems such as poverty, falling living standards and political suppression.
We hope here to adopt directives on the reunification of families of long-standing immigrants.
In the asylum sector, we want to push ahead with directives such as directives on refugees.
The second strand in our action on immigration will be to protect the Member States of the European Union from illegal immigration, share out the costs of protecting our common external borders more equitably, promote repatriation policies and speed up negotiations on readmission agreements.
Our fourth set of priorities concerns a matter which has already taken up a great deal of our time and energy. The future of Europe.
We believe that the enlargement of Europe should go hand in glove with greater European unification.
Our institutional system needs efficient, democratic functions and policies which reach our citizens.
The question is: what route will the Convention on the future of Europe take and how will this fit in with the work of the presidency?
As you may remember, the Copenhagen European Council decided that the Convention should complete its work before the European Council in June and that, at the spring European Council, we should focus on the institutional aspects of the future of Europe.
So we hope to achieve three main objectives at these two Councils:
First, we want to carry out a review without taking any decisions, because that would prejudge the outcome of the Convention.
Secondly, we intend to hold a substantive debate on the outcome of this work at the June Council and set the starting and/or the finishing date for the work of the new Intergovernmental Conference, because some Member States have already expressed a wish for an interim period and we will need some time between when it starts and the June summit.
Thirdly, we want to lay down the remit for the Intergovernmental Conference; in other words we need to be prepared at the end of June for subsequent procedures as and when they start.
Our fifth set of priorities concerns the Union's international profile and strengthening its role on the international stage.
The European Union has proceeded in leaps and bounds with its common security and defence policy.
What we now need is to ensure that we have full operational readiness in the crisis management sector by developing our military and non-military capabilities.
We therefore intend to concentrate on achieving the general military objective and finalising permanent arrangements for collaboration between the ?U and ????.
We are keen to ensure that European operations in Bosnia Herzgovina and the FYROM, which will be the first field test of the European Union's operational readiness, are properly prepared and executed.
Over and above this defence policy, we need to examine relations with the Union's neighbours in order to ensure that no new divisions are created.
A summit meeting with Russia is scheduled to take place in St Petersburg in May, attended by the countries of the Western Balkans, the Ukraine, the Caucasus and the Mediterranean, and we shall be attaching great importance to Mediterranean cooperation.
We may have to deal with war with Iraq over coming months.
We hope not.
We want peace.
However, we are giving this issue our utmost attention, and rightly so; it is one of our priorities.
We want to work and we shall work for peace and a peaceful resolution to any differences.
We trust efforts by the UN will have a positive outcome.
The will and the resolutions of the United Nations must prevail.
Iraq has to respect and apply Security Council resolutions.
The presidency wants to speak for Europe as a union of countries with a common, strong voice and opinions.
Safeguarding international stability, wiping out the threat of weapons of mass destruction and peace are common virtues; they are what we are all striving towards and the countries of the European Union need a clear common policy along these lines.
(Applause)
We need to break our old habit of having different countries saying different things and seeking different objectives.
It is not easy but we must fight for it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to finish by commenting briefly on two or three matters of particular interest to the European Parliament.
First, the status of MEPs.
A great deal of work has been done and we have spent a fair amount of time discussing this.
I think this issue is ripe for a final solution and we shall endeavour to reach a solution at the European Council in Thessaloniki.
Secondly, the interinstitutional agreement on improving European Union legislation, which has done a great deal to improve the quality of legislation.
We hope that there will be agreement here too during our presidency.
Thirdly, and lastly, we shall endeavour to complete the rules on European political parties, which are well overdue.
I have commented on a number of central issues, although there are a great many other important issues.
There is too little time to talk about the review of the CAP, the development of the European defence industry or measures on safety at sea, which many of us are working on.
We want the Greek Presidency to give extra momentum to the development of the Union.
We want to strengthen every aspect of the Union and convince our citizens that Europe is close to them, that it embraces them all in a society of values and that it offers everyone a common future.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I look forward to the best possible collaboration with you.
The success of the presidency depends on it.
The success of the European Union depends on it.
So let us put our heads together and deal with the problems.
(Applause)
Mr President, Prime Minister of the Republic of Greece, ladies and gentlemen, we have just closed the chapter on that quite remarkable year, 2002, which began with the launch of the euro and ended with the decision to carry out the largest enlargement in Europe's history.
This coming year will in many respects be equally crucial.
In 2003, we will have to prepare to implement enlargement and we will have to carry out the institutional reforms. Above all, we must provide the new Europe with much more solid economic and social foundations.
Prime Minister, in setting its priorities for the first six months of the year, the Greek Presidency has shown that it is keenly aware of the major challenges before us.
This was clear throughout your speech. There is absolutely no need for me to go over the main points again - we fully endorse them: the intense focus on immigration, patents, energy and the major obstacles to lasting peace in Europe - the Balkans question and the Mediterranean question.
I want to focus closely on these last two issues because the Balkans are a European Union issue - they are our responsibility and in our hearts - and, in the situation described by Prime Minister Simitis, whether the future holds peace or war depends on the Mediterranean.
I also endorse the far-reaching decision by the Greek Presidency to choose peace: I endorse it and I call for unified peacekeeping measures from the countries and the European institutions.
Before us is a unique opportunity, a huge presence of European countries in the Security Council, a European Presidency, and, most importantly, we have a public opinion which is deeply disturbed and concerned to see what war might involve and, in particular, what the consequences of war might be.
The European governments may have had their disagreements and different perspectives in recent months, but their citizens are closely united in the desire to avoid war as far as possible.
Of course, this does not mean that they do not have an equally strong desire to combat terrorism, to present a united front before this new threat.
However, war is considered to be the last resort and our peacekeeping measures must therefore be strong and unified.
We therefore feel that we are in complete harmony with the Greek Presidency and its programme for Europe, both as regards its intention to develop the work that needs to be done within the institutions on matters such as the Members' Statute and the issue of rules on parties and as regards the two major themes which were at the heart of Prime Minister Simitis' speech, enlargement and unification: we want a wider Europe but we also want a more unified Europe.
There can be no objection to that and there is no need for clarification.
I would now like to mention briefly the fact, following on from what Prime Minister Simitis said, that the Spring Report, the Commission's contribution to the work of the Spring Council, was adopted by the institution today and will therefore play a major part in the work of the Greek Presidency.
We also adopted a number of related documents, most noteworthy being the report on the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines and the general principles of a new European Employment Strategy.
I would like to thank the Greek Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, wholeheartedly, for she really has done some absolutely first rate work in this area.
I would now like to tell you a little more about the key points of the Spring Report, although the Commission is, as always, at Parliament's disposal should it want to organise specific debates on these important issues.
The Spring Report is a general report which does not just outline our programme but enters into specific aspects of it.
The Lisbon strategy seeks to achieve far-reaching economic and social renewal by the end of the decade and will be the right course for an enlarged European Union too. That means - and we must not forget it - that it does not lose any of its value with enlargement but actually becomes more important.
It is the best way of delivering what concerns our citizens most - greater prosperity, better jobs, greater social cohesion and a cleaner, sustainable environment - and it is the only way of making sure that these are achieved sustainably for future generations too.
The Spring European Council must drive forward this process in the face of the two-fold challenge of enlargement and, in particular - and this is the real problem - the continuing deterioration of economic conditions.
We must not be discouraged by these challenges. Quite the opposite: they must spur us on to greater endeavours, for the Lisbon agenda is the best way to integrate the new Member States and boost the economy.
The Lisbon process is already starting to bear fruit.
In many areas, reforms are already generating growth and jobs but, and I tell you this frankly, ladies and gentlemen, much of the European Union's production potential continues to remain untapped.
The Lisbon objectives are still within our reach, but if we do not display much greater political will from this moment onwards there is no firm guarantee that we will succeed.
This time last year, I laid stress on the unsustainable delivery gap between agreement on policy and action to turn policy into legislation.
Thanks to the combined efforts of Parliament, the Commission and the Council, this gap has now been reduced.
However, a similar gap is now forming in the area of the transposition of Community directives and decisions into Member States' law.
Thus, the problem of the practical implementation of these decisions is still partly to be resolved.
Moreover, many of the national policy reforms which are necessary for the achievement of the Lisbon objectives still remain to be implemented.
On the other hand, it is encouraging to see that there are Member States meeting and even exceeding many of the Lisbon objectives.
These countries are a benchmark of world-beating performance and prove that the right policy mix can bring development on all fronts: economic, social and environmental.
Progress has not been uniform throughout Europe, however.
The unsatisfactory performance of some countries is holding back the overall development of the Union.
This is why coordination at Community level is vital to encourage all the Member States to work towards the objectives that are in their own interest as well as in the interest of all the other Members of the Union.
They will all benefit from macroeconomic stability, growth, more jobs and social inclusion.
The Commission's proposals for strengthening the coordination of budgetary policy and the proposals on the employment strategy point the way forward, and I welcome the fact that the Greek Presidency shares this commitment and is determined to play its part fully.
We will make a good team.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon strategy is an integrated strategy for sustainably boosting the European Union's economy and meeting the major medium and long-term challenges before us.
This is why, today, in the context of our strategy, I want to highlight the importance of investment in knowledge and innovation.
We have made it our priority for this year.
In addition to a list of things to do, with which we are all familiar and of which everyone is quite aware, there are moments when some factors assume more importance.
I believe that, this year, knowledge, innovation, research and education are the genuine top priorities in a European Union which is lacking in human resources, which are falling in number, and which needs there to be an improvement in the quality of these resources.
I have to say that this observation is a result of an analysis of the policy - implemented, in some cases against their will, by some of the Member States as a result of the restrictions - to reduce, in accordance with budgetary requirements, in some cases even because of the limits we ourselves have imposed, research expenditure first of all.
If we look at the policy of many of the Member States, this has been the result, with a shift away from the 3% we set out in the major objectives of the Lisbon process.
We must not make this mistake: we must help each other to avoid making this mistake.
I am speaking so emphatically, if you will, because remarkable things are happening in the world.
Asia's capacity to absorb new technologies, the growing dynamism of the international markets, the market shares of many European countries which are eroded every year: all this means that the problem facing us is no longer theoretical but a question of our future survival, of the future balance of our economy, of preserving our wealth.
Thus, knowledge and innovation are the driving force of sustainable development. Without investment and innovation, we will not achieve growth and we will not be able to maintain our present levels of prosperity.
Many things are necessary: computers in our schools, lifelong learning, skilled, flexible employment.
It is vital that we promote research into world-beating products and clean technologies, and we must help businesses turn knowledge into commercial opportunities.
In my opinion, it is at precisely this last step - converting discoveries into innovation and exploiting them commercially - that European businesses fall down.
Although the Union has made progress towards a knowledge-based economy and an analysis of the past three years is not discouraging, the fact remains that others are moving even faster and it still lags behind its main international competitors in terms of investment and performance.
We still have far fewer researchers than the United States or Japan.
Levels of public expenditure on education and research and development vary too greatly throughout the Union.
Businesses need a dynamic environment that will stimulate this economic activity.
Today, in Europe, such conditions are not widespread enough.
Significantly and surprisingly - and I will give you just one statistic for this is not a theoretical discussion: we are here to take decisions - our largest companies are carrying out 40% of their research activities outside the Union.
A startling figure.
This is critical, for it means that researchers and resources are staying outside the Union.
Clearly, we must invest in the future.
We must be better coordinated and set more ambitious national targets in the fields of education, research and innovation, and we must do more to share our best practices.
The accession of the candidate countries with their strong skills base will offer the Union enormous opportunities.
Great emphasis has been placed on the fact that, after enlargement, these countries - those which have actually entered, having been given the political green light - will make up 20% of the population but only provide 5 or 6% of income.
Yet this represents a 25% increase in applied scientists and engineers. In many cases, they are working in specific sectors, but once part of the European circuit, they will genuinely be able to give us great impetus.
We must therefore make sure we are ready to absorb these human resources, to put them into circulation, to ensure that they become an active part of our economy.
In this connection, the Commission will be launching an action plan for research and development.
We must also as a matter of urgency address the matter of the legislative and administrative framework for the business world.
Before I conclude, I would like, if I may, to make another personal observation. We can devise all the Lisbon processes we like, but if Europe does not become the centre of attraction for young talent, for the whole world, we will never achieve economic and scientific leadership.
The United States are succeeding by using human resources from all over the world.
Whereas our young people, who are going to the United States in ever-increasing numbers, stay there for the most part, I can tell you that the majority of Asians and Chinese - and there are currently tens of thousands of Chinese studying in the United States - go back home.
Well then, if we do not find a way of inducing our young people to return home, if we do not build some large, top-level schools of excellence which are the symbol, the attraction of the future, which convey the impression that we are working for the future, we will never attract the young people, the best brains from the other continents, and we will never succeed in getting our own young people to stay in our continent.
This is the crucial challenge, and this is why the Commission and I personally have called strongly for this matter to be taken up, as it must be, at the level of all the European countries, for if our young people are leaving Europe, if the situation is such that our businesses are setting up research laboratories outside Europe, particularly in the United States, I warn you that our horizons will become narrower and narrower, I warn you that, if we go on like this, all will be lost.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have clear responsibilities towards our present and future citizens and towards the whole world in this field.
We set ourselves the target of creating a competitive, knowledge-based society based on sustainable growth.
On our success will hang the future of the European social model too.
We do not believe we can achieve the goals Commissioner Diamantopoulou and I set ourselves so carefully, the goals behind all politics such as social equality and class promotion - we do not believe we can do it without a knowledge-based society.
It will also, therefore, determine our ability to honour the international commitments we made at Monterrey, Doha and Johannesburg and to implement policies which can secure peace and stability in the world.
Mr President, Prime Minister, time and time again, the European Union has confounded the most sceptical critics with bold, resolute initiatives.
We have achieved many goals and I know that we will continue to do so in the future, but I implore you to understand that this matter of centres of scientific excellence, of a research effort, of rules to attract laboratories, the centres of innovation, to Europe, of becoming once again the catalyst and centre of culture and science, as Europe has always been throughout the centuries, is vital for our future.
Quite frankly, the present generations have fewer opportunities, fewer options than most of us sitting here had.
I believe it is our duty to restore to them these options, these opportunities, for they are entitled to them and we need them too.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, wishes the Greek Presidency every success ...
Interruption by Mr Cohn-Bendit: No, I said you were the bourgeois party ...
Look, whenever Mr Cohn-Bendit butts in, we lose time for debate.
We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish you every success, and you will find in us a very fair partner.
I want to make it clear that I say this with the agreement of our Greek friends, and Mr Trakatellis will speak immediately after me.
We think it is particularly splendid that the treaty with the countries that are to join the EU should be signed, on 16 April, in front of the Acropolis or in its immediate vicinity, that being a symbolic expression of the fact that it is at the site of democracy's foundation, Athens, that we are giving the green light to the membership of the Central European countries that have achieved democracy after the horrors of the Communist era, and before that, the years under National Socialism.
Mr President, we are of one mind with you as far as a peaceful solution to Cyprus is concerned, and also as regards the pre-accession strategy for Bulgaria and Romania, and we have an urgent request to make of you in connection with the Balkans.
Whilst sharing your belief that these countries must have the prospect of joining the European Union, we must always affirm - and you yourself used the word 'later' - the long-term nature of that prospect.
For the people of the European Union will first have to cope with the accession of ten countries, to which they will have to adjust, and we may not demand too much of them, nor must we give the impression that the Balkan countries are to be added to them overnight; hence our constant reiteration that this is a long-term process.
We wish to strongly encourage you to seize the initiative in relation to the Mediterranean region and the Barcelona process.
I am horrified by the sight, repeated week after week, of boats sailing from Morocco in the hope of reaching the Spanish coast, capsizing under stormy conditions, and the people on them being killed.
I regard this as unacceptable, and we have to give the countries where these people live a chance of development - not only in the context of immigration policy, but as part of helping the countries of the Mediterranean to help themselves.
Governments themselves must also help, of course.
Any initiative by you in this area would meet with our full support.
Turning to the Convention, Mr Papandreou, as Foreign Minister, will of course be one of its members, and I am sure - and I hope - that we will, if he follows the examples set by others, see and hear much of him in Parliament.
Speaking on behalf of the PPE half of our group, I can say that we want a European constitution.
We want a European constitution, we want European democracy, we want Europe to have capacity to act, and we want it to be transparent.
And such a Europe must rest on the foundations of the Community Europe.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are sure that you support that too.
We want the Convention to complete its work by the end of June and to be followed by a brief Intergovernmental Conference, so that the Italian Presidency will find us gaining a constitution for Europe.
Let me move on to the Lisbon process. There is much truth in what has been said about this, but, Mr President of the Commission, we agree that we will only get qualified scientists to stay in Europe if we actually manage to reform our tax systems in such a way that it is again worthwhile to make investments, in such a way that Europe is a place where achievement is worth the effort, if we are willing to reform our labour laws and make them more flexible, and if we are able to change our social security systems so that they are characterised by greater self-reliance, so that subsidiarity and solidarity are intertwined.
Such a Europe must become more competitive, and so working in it must again be made worth the effort.
We need to encourage people to take the initiative, and, above all else, we must not make the citizen promises that the European Union is unable to keep.
So let your coordinating efforts be directed towards tax cuts for businesses, reform of the labour market, and reform of our social security systems.
There are two important foreign policy issues, Mr President-in-Office of the Council; Iraq is one of them.
We must see that weapons of mass destruction are a menace and that, when they threaten us or regions of the globe, those who have them at their disposal, must relinquish them, but what we do and have to do, we do within the framework of the United Nations.
We support your efforts towards a common European position on this issue, on the basis of action by the United Nations.
It is not acceptable for a European government to say, 'Leave us out; no matter what the United Nations decide, we're not taking part', or for another government to give the impression of saying, 'Whatever happens, we stand alongside the United States'.
No, any European policy must be a responsible one, and I would encourage you, and us, to go about it as Europeans, and together.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned cooperation with Russia, and in May of this year you will be travelling to a meeting in St Petersburg.
Appalling things are currently happening in Chechnya.
The Russian Government's unwillingness to extend the OSCE mandate in Chechnya violates the humanitarian principles that we share.
I urge you and beg you to raise these things not only when you are in St Petersburg, that beautiful city, which is Russia's window on the world, but make it clear to the Russian Government even before you get there that we expect the OSCE mandate to be extended, that we expect this Parliament's ad hoc delegation to Chechnya, which we have decided on, to actually be allowed to travel to that country.
Mr President, I welcome the way you have often encouraged us by referring to our values, but we will gain credibility only if we lay hold of these values not merely for ourselves in this wonderful European Union, which, taking everything into account, is democratic and in a good position both economically and in terms of human rights, but also for the people on our doorstep and throughout the world.
That is why we have to speak in a loud voice, and I would encourage you to do just that in St Petersburg.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this six-month period, the Council is going to deal with five historic challenges which the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned.
Firstly, enlargement.
It is a fortunate coincidence that enlargement to ten is going to be signed in Athens, the cradle of democracy; and in a country such as Greece, which will hold the next Olympic games.
Two inventions dating back 2 500 years which are foundation stones of the current Europe.
And the Olympics were the first organised system of peace.
All they need is access to the airport, but work is being done on that.
During this six months, we must finish the first phase of enlargement: the ten countries.
And you have also mentioned some other important challenges.
Firstly, a reunified Cyprus.
We entirely support any action you may take with a view to supporting the policy of Kofi Annan and we believe this is a very decisive step.
Furthermore, and you have mentioned this, for the first time, you have in your hands -and I welcome Greece's intelligent and courageous policy in relation to Turkey - the opportunity to play an historic role in terms of bringing us closer to Turkey.
We are counting on your intelligence and flexibility.
Secondly, the Lisbon Strategy.
In this regard, we have seen that you insist on full employment, on technological development, on training and on social cohesion, which is an essential prerequisite for economic growth and not an obstacle.
You have also held the Presidency of the monetary union since the middle of last year.
In this regard, I would like to say that it is important that we increase our economic coordination.
I am not going to ask you to employ such an interventionist and brutal policy as the United States, but it is important and necessary that Europe can be an economic driving force and end this stagnation.
This is one of the Greek Presidency's responsibilities.
I would also address the President of the Commission.
Mr Prodi, why do you not propose a world-wide Socrates in order to attract brains?
This falls within the competence of the Commission and of course we in Parliament would support a proposal of this nature.
In the economic chapter, the Greek Presidency has dedicated a section to maritime security, and following the drama we are witnessing of globalised shipwrecks, which are desolating our coasts - the Prestige being just one more, not the only one - I believe that the Greek Presidency must play an important role.
You have more than half the Community's gross tonnage and plenty of experience.
You have spoken of sustainable development and the protection of the environment.
All of this must be integrated into a European maritime area, which could be one of the Greek Presidency's great pieces of work.
In terms of the policy on the third pillar, especially on immigration, the Greek Presidency is the first, since Tampere, to propose a proactive policy and not just a repressive one.
In this regard, you can rely on Parliament in terms of the proposals you are going to make and I believe that, in this field, the Greek Presidency is showing the right way.
With regard to the future of Europe, the Convention has passed its half-way point - as President Giscard d'Estaing reminded us in an article which has appeared today in the press.
Under the Greek Presidency, we want the Convention to prepare a draft Constitution.
In this regard, both the work of our colleague, Mr Giorgos Katiforis, in completing the social dimension, and of Georgios Papandreu, as an addition to the Presidium of the Convention, are important.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you must defend the Community method, which has allowed us to come this far, and which can inspire and organise our future.
We would also ask you to carefully study the timetable for the inauguration of the European Parliament, so that we can carry out our investiture of the Commission correctly and in a manner which is agreed amongst all of us.
Finally, Mr President, with regard to external relations, I would like to say that a war with Iraq can be prevented, that the European Union must speak with one voice and that we await with interest the result of the meeting you are going to hold in Brussels with Hans Blix, the head of the inspectors.
You have a very important job: to coordinate four members of the Security Council, plus one candidate, and everything possible must be done so that, within the multilateral and civilised framework of the UN, we can make progress and prevent a war which is not only unnecessary, but also extremely dangerous, and so that we can impose the principles of international law.
In this regard, Mr President-in-Office, and I will end here, please also continue an active policy in the Middle East.
It is very important, everything is related, and you are our border with that region.
It is essential that we are able to re-launch the Middle East peace process.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to offer you our support and I thank you for mentioning the Statute for Members of Parliament and parties, which is a sign of Greek capacity and wisdom.
I wish you lots of luck.
Mr President, I have heard it said that there is nothing left for the Greek Presidency, other than providing the after-sales service for Copenhagen.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
The Greek Presidency will have a key role in the birth of a reformed and enlarged European Union.
But to ensure a smooth birth a good midwife is essential and I am pleased to see that the Greek Presidency seems well prepared to play that role.
With regard to the reform of the Union, the Convention is due to report in Thessaloniki.
As every good midwife knows, it is important to keep pushy relatives out of the delivery room and while the discussions in the ElysÃ©e Palace tonight will be important, they must not dictate the outcome of that Convention.
It is also important to ensure that the baby is not strangled at birth by Member States fearful of an ambitious constitutional Treaty.
I would therefore take issue with the President-in-Office and say we should not have a lengthy interim period.
We need a short IGC, which should be a tidying-up exercise to ratify quickly the outcome of the Convention quickly.
2003 will be the year when politicians must sell enlargement to the voters.
Nine out of ten of the new countries will have referenda between March and September this year.
We need to put far more effort into making the case for a 'yes' vote in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe than we have put recently into convincing citizens in our current Union that Europe is a 'good thing'.
Liberal Democrats in this House and beyond are committed to campaigning in the new countries to make sure that we get a 'yes' vote and we call on others to join us.
We hope in particular that the Greek Presidency can use its privileged relationship with many on the island of Cyprus to ensure that a united island joins our Union.
Time is short, but recent developments, both on the island and in Ankara, have created a window of opportunity and I hope that you, Mr President-in-Office, will work with all parties to craft a compromise.
I welcome the generous aspirations that you have expressed today in that regard.
If the European Union is to succeed, however, for its current citizens and its new ones, it will need reform.
As we approach the third anniversary of the ten-year Lisbon strategy, it has to be said that progress to date on productivity, growth, employment, investment, research and development has been disappointing.
The continued economic slow-down is making structural reform more, not less, urgent and governments should not be deflected from the goals they set themselves.
It will be important for the presidency to reaffirm commitment to a reformed Stability Pact, to focus on the underlying deficit, to give the Commission the power to issue early warnings to countries in danger.
It will also need to stick to the timetable for the Financial Services Action Plan, which has already shown dangerous slippage, and to secure approval of the takeover bids directive.
If you want someone to help you along this path, why not give the European Parliament more of a role in the follow-up to the decisions of the Spring Councils, in holding the Council accountable for the decisions that are taken?
That is something we would do very well.
Europe is of course though far more than a common market and your presidency recognises this.
The Amsterdam and Nice Treaties have created a Community of values.
I welcome the emphasis in your presidency's statement on the values of a generous, outward-looking and civilised society.
You speak in your document of a planned legal immigration policy.
Exposed as you are on Europe's southern and eastern flanks, you see the importance of understanding a little more and condemning a little less.
The fact is that, as long as we keep out their produce and deprive them of the hope of economic development, we will take the people of the developing countries to the south and the east.
We need many of them to deal with the problems of an ageing population here, or the brain drain problems the Commission President referred to.
Let us work to close the back door to illegal immigration more effectively by offering legal opportunities to those wishing to settle here and integrating them properly in our society.
I had a great deal to say about Iraq and the Middle East peace process as well, but my time is running short.
I would, however, say that the Greeks are well acquainted with what we in the rest of Europe understand by the word 'marathon'.
You take the baton from the last runner, Denmark, and try and cover as much ground as possible as quickly as possible, before handing it over to the next presidency.
We wish you good speed in the marathon that you are running on our behalf.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is to you, Mr President of the Council, that I wish to express my group's emphatic support for your initiative towards resolving the hostilities with Iraq by diplomatic means.
There must be no war with Iraq.
The public do not want one, and this is where the EU - as many Members of this House have said, and this is something I want to endorse - must put all its political weight into the balance, and it must be united in doing so.
Statements, such as that made by the German ambassador to the UN, to the effect that no second resolution by the Security Council would be needed to give legitimacy to an attack on Iraq by the USA, are counter-productive.
Fortunately, the Greek Presidency of the Council is taking the opposite line.
You have our entire support in your efforts to prevent war, in the teeth of the Bush administration's declared intentions.
That employment, economic, and social policies rank high on the Greek agenda is another thing that earns our high regard, but, especially in view of the spring summit, what matters is what we do about them.
The social pillar does indeed need to be strengthened to a perceptible degree, the EU must give its attention to the public's concerns and needs, and, above all else, press on with effective measures to counter mass unemployment and social exclusion within its borders.
Most of all, the Member States must be willing to counteract the looming economic crisis in Europe.
It is willingness to reform the Stability Pact that we regard as the litmus test in this regard.
Be bold enough to do it!
Let public investment at last be removed from the Stability Pact's calculation basis, preventing a socially irresponsible policy of cutting back until there is nothing left from making a difficult economic situation even worse, or even - as President Prodi has just warned us - leaving education utterly unable to compete.
In conclusion, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to endorse your objective of speeding up the Convention's reforming work.
This is another area where the public interest demands that tangible progress be made, especially towards creating social Europe.
My plea to you, and to your foreign minister as a new member of the Convention, is that you should insist on definite results in this issue in particular.
President-in-Office of the Council, allow me to put to the test all the capacity for thought inherited from Greek philosophy, one of the sources of European political philosophy, by asking you to show imagination, insight and lucidity in your role as President of the Council.
Let us begin with the Iraqi crisis.
No, Mr Poettering, you are wrong when you say that we cannot do this or that.
If we want a UN position, we must also say what must be decided at the Security Council; we cannot always hide behind the Security Council without specifying what it should decide.
To date, there is no proof of renewed aggression from the dictator Saddam Hussein.
No proof at all.
If the secret services have proof, they should announce it in all the newspapers.
If they have proof of what Saddam Hussein possesses, he must also know.
If that is the case, therefore, it is not a secret from anyone in Iraq, nor from Saddam Hussein.
If he has weapons, he knows where he is hiding them, and if the CIA or the other secret services know where these weapons are hidden, we can tell the world, since, in any case, the enemy already knows.
I do not, therefore, understand this strategy.
That is why we are asking you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to be Socrates and Plato rolled into one, in other words, to bring together Mr Chirac, Mr Blair, Mr Aznar and Mr SchrÃ¶der, the heads of four governments represented at the United Nations Security Council, around a table to establish a European position that says 'no' to military intervention, which would not only be harmful to everyone, but which furthermore would not solve any problems.
We must have the courage to say what we expect from the Security Council and I believe the European Union has a decisive role to play in this regard.
We said 'yes'. One part of my group was in fact against this, but I have always said 'yes', to the need for military intervention in Afghanistan and Kosovo.
Today, however, all those who said 'yes' to intervention in these two cases must say 'no' to pointless intervention.
We must tell the Security Council this.
France and the United Kingdom have a right of veto which would prevent this intervention.
The European Union must have the strength to impose a 'no', at precisely the moment when North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, when it could make an atomic bomb, and yet we are, quite rightly, going to negotiate with it.
Our current policy is one of encouraging the proliferation of nuclear weapons, by saying to dictators who already have nuclear weapons that we will not do anything to them, and saying to those who do not yet have such weapons that we will attack them.
That amounts to telling dictators in every country to hurry up and get nuclear weapons, so that, that way, we will not do anything more to them and will negotiate with them.
That is the Platonic logic currently being applied by Washington.
I would ask Athens to say 'no' to this completely crazy thinking.
I would now like to address the matter of the Spring Summit and sustainable development.
I agree, but what are the relevant indicators with regard to the environment, the economy and social issues?
These indicators must be equal.
In Salonika, we therefore need to draw up a genuine list of indicators and a strategy to assess and put into perspective sustainable development.
That would truly be an historic initiative, a first.
There are numerous proposals here and there, but nothing more.
You spoke of maritime safety - fine!
Where do the responsibilities lie, however, in environmental terms?
Who will pay for the Erika?
Who will pay for the Prestige?
By way of an example: EUR 11 million were paid out by those responsible for the Erika.
That is scandalous!
It is scandalous because those responsible for maritime disasters should pay for everything.
They must take on the entire risk and until they are forced to shoulder their responsibility, all the responsibility, they will do whatever they like.
You know what I am talking about, since Greece is one of the countries that has the most responsibilities in this sector.
Lastly, you spoke of Cyprus.
Naturally, you want a united Cyprus.
In that case, however, both Turkey and Greece need to approach the problem of Greek and Turkish nationalism.
One of the final barriers concerning the possibility of a united Cyprus is the fruit of these two nationalisms, I would even go so far as to say the joint action of Mr Denktash and Mr Clerides.
The Cypriot people, the populations of the north and the south, do not want the same thing as their representatives.
I therefore believe that together we must all have the strength and courage to provide a future for people who want this future.
In conclusion, you would truly be Socrates and Plato combined if you succeeded in solving the problem of the status of Members of Parliament.
If you achieve this, you may be my guest at the Parisian restaurant of your choice, as you will have become a grand master in politics.
Thank you Mr President.
The Greek Government is assuming the presidency of the European Union at a time of great international uncertainty.
UN inspectors in Iraq are due to report back to the United Nations Security Council at the end of the month with their findings as to whether or not Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction.
No one can judge what will be in this report, but the military build-up of American and British troops in the Middle East is certainly an ominous sign that conflict in Iraq is a very real possibility.
I welcome the recent comments of Prime Minister Simitis, when he stated that the United Nations is the forum that must be used to address the issues raised in the UN inspectors' report on Iraq.
It is very important that the United Nations is the organisation that deals with international security issues.
International global security is best dealt with multilaterally under the auspices of the UN, not unilaterally, and I welcome the objective for Prime Minister Simitis to secure a common European Union position on Iraq when the UN inspectors' report is published.
This is certainly a very ambitious political objective but I fully support it and I am sure the majority of Members of this House do as well.
The European economy is not performing very well at present and the Greek Presidency is correct to accelerate the Lisbon Process.
We need to make European businesses more competitive; more support mechanisms must be put in place to assist small- and medium-sized enterprises.
The Greek Presidency is also making illegal immigration in Europe a priority.
When it comes to protecting the borders of the European Union, a common approach is needed at EU level.
Certainly we are going to have to reform under the EU Convention how we legislate for issues such as immigration, asylum, refugees, displaced persons and European visas.
As has been mentioned, the Convention will now be reporting to European governments during the Greek Presidency of the Union.
Members of the Convention plan to have the draft new European Union Treaty ready for the Greek meeting in June in Thessaloniki and liaising with members of the Convention and preparing this new Treaty are certainly going to be very important for the Greek Presidency.
As a result of the decisions taken at the Copenhagen Summit last December, accession treaties for the new Member States joining the Union are to be signed on 16 April.
These treaties are being prepared and referenda will then be held in the applicant states.
It is very clear that there are wide-ranging and diverse issues that will have to be addressed by the Greek Presidency of the European Union.
The spectre of a conflict in Iraq hangs over us all like the sword of Damocles and that is something that we all need to have in mind.
In conclusion, I wish the Greek Presidency every success and would like to say, on behalf of my political group, that we will be more than willing to cooperate with them fully in the interests of the European Union as a whole.
Mr President, kalispera, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities would also like to welcome the Greek Presidency.
Greece was the cradle of democracy. That means you have a special duty to give the EU a democratic overhaul.
This is our advice.
Open up all meetings in which you debate laws.
Make all the minutes from meetings available.
Give the European Parliament and the national parliaments access to all papers from the Council's working parties.
Prepare complete registers of correspondence in the Council.
Introduce public access to documents according to the principle of best practice among the countries.
Place all agendas and minutes from the Council's working parties on the Presidency's web site.
Give the Ombudsman a new statute, giving him or her access to everything for monitoring purposes.
Give the Court of Auditors the access required for monitoring both the Commission and the organisations that use EU funds.
Retain the rotating Presidency so that each country has six months in which to pull out all the stops.
Keep the EU and the military separate and prepare reforms of agriculture, the structural funds and the budget so that we are ready to receive the new countries.
Also, let Greek hospitality be accompanied by efficient organisation so that we can follow the work on your as yet unfinished web site and are able in six months to say what a jolly good Presidency Greece's was.
The next few years, and certainly the next few decades, will be of great significance to all European people, but primarily to the European Union.
The Greek Presidency must therefore not simply be allowed to be the umpteenth routine presidency.
After all, Greece is, more than any other country in Europe, best placed both from a political and historical point of view to use the presidency to readdress the issue of the absurdity of Turkey's candidature.
I will say it again now: Turkey is not a European country, it does not belong to our European community of peoples, either geographically or historically or as far as its socio-economic situation and culture are concerned.
It goes without saying that we must maintain the very best relations with our Turkish neighbours, and that we can maintain the best possible trading and other relations where applicable.
To give this country a prospect of acceding to the European Union is, however, complete madness.
It will throw the door wide open to a massive tidal wave of immigration, and will in particular fundamentally change the nature of the European Union itself, a union that with the best will in the world will not be able to call itself European any more.
The Greek Presidency is being given an historic opportunity here.
Take the initiative, for example, or suggest holding a referendum on Turkey's candidature in all our European countries.
Why should the electorates of democracies not have their say on something that is so crucial to our very existence?
If you do not, my party in Flanders will turn the European elections in 2004 into a referendum on Turkey's accession.
It is striking that the German Christian-Democrats are also more or less announcing the same thing.
If the Greek Presidency fails to take this opportunity - which will probably be the case - you will be taking on a very great responsibility, and the Turkish question may become a divisive element that could bring the house of Europe crashing down around our ears.
Mr President, I would like to welcome both the President of the Council and the President of the Commission here this afternoon.
I want to talk specifically about jobs, competitiveness and the internal market.
I have a particular interest in that as the Parliament's rapporteur for the internal market strategy: if all goes well my report will be voted on in February and will be presented to you as a basis for action in the Economic Summit.
Both of the Presidents have a crucial responsibility to the global economy over the next six months.
Colleagues around the chamber have been quoted, and indeed Mr Simitis was quoted in the Financial Times yesterday, as saying that 'we are in a global recession'.
I hope he was wrongly quoted, because as far as I know, we are not.
Growth is slowing down, but stimulating and restoring that growth will be crucial to the responsibilities of both Presidents over the next six months with that Economic Summit at the centrepiece.
I am concerned that neither of your statements, Presidents, mentioned the fact that the foundation of economic growth in the European Union has to be the completion of the internal market, in spite of the fact that this is the tenth anniversary.
We have had major reports from the Commission showing the benefits of the internal market and we also know that the principal engine for job creation in markets of the future is going to be jobs in the service economy.
The biggest project that is coming forward to all of you is the completion of the internal market for services, and the barriers to companies setting up across the European Union are amply demonstrated by the work the Commission has done.
I want to ask you, President of the Council, to put on your agenda a determined effort by all Member State governments to clear out the difficulties of establishing businesses across the European Union.
You do not need to wait for the Commission to take that initiative to create jobs and move the European economy forward, we look to you to do it.
Mr President, my thanks go to Greece for an excellent presentation and for highlighting some delicate matters.
Recently, actually since the autumn, it has been mainly the issues of enlargement and the Convention that have been the focus of attention at EU level.
In its presentation Greece mentioned some well-chosen issues it intends to address over the next six months.
Unfortunately, however, we cannot cure all the ills of the world even though we might want to.
We should also be as good as our word with regard to improving European competitiveness, something that was endorsed at Lisbon.
Things have, however, gone the opposite way. The United States of America has rushed off even further into the distance.
There is barely any eye contact anymore.
If there is, the Americans come whistling past one lap of the circuit ahead of us whatever the event, to use a sports image.
In view of this I would ask Greece what it really intends to do during its presidency to put its own house in order also, to fulfil the Lisbon objectives?
Does it intend to make the economic reforms insisted on by the Commission, and which Mr Prodi also mentioned here at the start, and, if so, working to what sort of timetable?
If Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Germany keep to their commitments we can really talk about a Lisbon strategy and improvements in our competitiveness, but if that should not be the case, we might as well wipe our backsides with the Lisbon Declaration and say goodbye to European competitiveness.
Mr President, resolution 1441 firstly calls for effective weapons inspections in Iraq, and secondly for the discussion of the weapons inspector's report in the Security Council at the end of January, and only thereafter for any new steps to be taken.
These steps must be based on a new UN resolution and must concentrate on eliminating any problems encountered.
That is the view in the European countries where the vast majority of our people, as Mr Prodi said, is against a war in Iraq, and rightly so.
Our people correctly fear that there are divisions in the international coalition against terrorism, that peace negotiations will be disrupted, that the sorely needed democratisation of the Middle East will be wrecked, followed by substantial repercussions for our economies, not least in the poorest countries that do not have their own crude oil.
At this historic moment our Group of the Party of European Socialists is asking the Greek Presidency to clearly state that this is also the position of the European Union.
We are now asking for leadership from Europe, so that Europe speaks with one voice.
We must do our utmost to prevent war in Iraq and at the same time engage in serious peace negotiations in the Middle East.
The two-state solution must really be carried through now.
Europe must not hesitate to deploy all its diplomatic and economic resources to achieve this.
We pride ourselves on our capacity for conflict prevention and humanitarian aid, and rightly so.
We operate with a broad security concept, and rightly so, and realise that prevention is much better.
Time after time, Europe has emphasised the importance of the multilateral approach via the Security Council.
Confronted with incessant statements about a war that is all but unavoidable, it is of great importance that the Council and the Commission side with Parliament.
Maximum pressure should, of course, be brought to bear on Saddam via the Security Council, but we must also make every effort to prevent war.
We call on President Bush to take the desire of our peoples for peace seriously and not to sow dissent in the international coalition against terrorism, and therefore to fight together for a peaceful and a more stable world.
Mr President, the ambitious but nonetheless realistic programme of the Greek Presidency, which aims to breathe new life into basic policy areas of the European Union is, unfortunately, already overshadowed by the threat of war with Iraq, a war which has galvanised international public opinion which, as the President of the Commission pointed out, is not divided.
Nor, would I say, is it divided in the United States where, as we know, two-thirds of the people oppose this war.
We are talking about a war which is both pointless and destructive, as members from all sides of this House have pointed out.
However, the main brunt of any military attack will be borne by the Iraqi people themselves, who have been suffering under the economic embargo for years now.
A military conflict will completely wipe out any hope of combating poverty, hunger, child malnutrition and the lack of medical care; these are the problems which the millions of people who are victims of an autocratic regime and a harsh western policy have to live with.
The twelve-year embargo has itself operated as a weapon of mass destruction; it has cost the lives of one million people, half of whom were children.
Anyone in any doubt need only visit the hospitals in Iraq, where children are dying of malnutrition and a lack of rudimentary medical care.
I have seen them with my own eyes.


Ladies and gentlemen, we have a saying in Greece; you see who the good captains are in a storm and the European Union is fortunate to have at its helm a very able captain and an equally efficient crew, who have clearly demonstrated their courage, combined with caution, efficient management of national and European affairs and an inspired foreign policy which has made Greece a pole of stability in the problematic Balkan area, a pole that promotes dialogue and the resolution of differences by peaceful means.
I am positive that the Greek Presidency will meet the challenges and play its historic part.
Mr President, I should like to welcome the Greek prime minister and wish him every success.
We all know that Greece is a relatively small country.
No one expects any miracles. But they do expect the right approach.
This is not the first Greek Presidency; there have been two previous presidencies, both of which left themselves open to a great deal of criticism.
However, the previous presidencies held by the same party, PASOK, when Andreas Papandreou was prime minister, did leave us one useful legacy: a fighting stance, which often went against the grain, on the question of peace.
I trust that this positive trend, which is demonstrated both by our country as a whole and its ruling party, will continue today, especially on the question of Iraq.
As the chairman of the Greens quite rightly said, you cannot hide behind the Security Council.
With four members in the Security Council, the European Union should be fighting to block a war.
I listened very closely to the prime minister's speech and I should like to comment on three points which worry me.
First, the fact that the prime minister said that this is a joint annual programme of the Greek and Italian presidencies.
In my opinion, Mr Simitis is - and needs to be - one thing, and Mr Berlusconi is another, and I fail to see how they will find any common ground on social issues, on democratic issues, on the issue of relations with the USA or on media issues.
A second point which worries me is that agricultural policy - and I am thinking here of small family-run holdings, especially in the south, being squeezed by reforms and by what is happening in the World Trade Organisation - warranted no more than one line at the end of the prime minister's speech.
I expect him to refer to this at greater length in his next speech.
And the third point has to do with social issues.
Mr Prime Minister, I am waiting for Greece to apply Directive 70/1999 on fixed-term work.
It should have started applying this directive on 10 July 2002 but has yet to do so.
Please do not put Mrs Diamantopoulou in the unenviable position of having to institute proceedings against Greece before the European Court.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to raise two points which, I would say, concern me, in your statements.
The first, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that you have not really developed your project on maritime safety.
I hope that we will not have any unpleasant surprises, since, as you know, European citizens in both Galicia and France are impatiently, not to say desperately, waiting for Europe to come to their aid, to establish strict rules, clear rules, to ensure safe maritime transport and to prevent pollution.
We know, of course, how worried Greece is about this area; we therefore wonder, for example, if it would support the creation of a unit of European coastguards, a 'Green Berets' force to organise the volunteers, which was so sorely lacking in Galicia.
Would it impose the designation of ports of refuge?
I shall stop the list there, Mr President.
The second subject that concerns me is the Spring Summit.
There again, it is with regret that I would like to say - and I am also addressing the President of the Commission - that you are missing the point, because the Spring Summit had a specific aim, to measure progress made or ground lost in the field of sustainable development through the policies of the Union.
The summit you are preparing for is nothing unusual, and yet there is urgency.
I shall only give one example: will the Union continue to provide financial aid to multinational companies with nothing in return, without ensuring sustainable employment for employees?
I am of course thinking of the Daewoo workers in Lorraine, France, who are once again out of a job while the Union and the region of Lorraine had banked on this restructuring, granting considerable financial aid.
This is the opposite of sustainable development.
What I would therefore like your spring reports to do is present genuine policies which take account of the environment in order to avoid destroying it and which also create truly sustainable jobs.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr President of the Council, concluded your remarks with a brief discussion of European defence policy.
You observed that the agreement between NATO and the European Union has now come into being, thus leaving the way open for the next European defence policy measures, which we can expect to be taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
This is an eventuality to which particular attention must be drawn, as the European Union will then, for the first time, be taking on responsibilities in defence in a visible way.
This leads me to put two questions, the first of which has to do with how this defence policy is to develop in future.
Do you share the view that the constitutional treaty currently under negotiation should include an article stipulating a mutual defence commitment, comparable to the corresponding article in the treaty on the Western European Union?
That would be an expression of confidence when we take joint action.
Secondly, you also, very briefly, addressed the area of armaments policy, alluding to the way in which the countries of the European Union spend EUR 150 billion on defence, whereas we are always being told that the excessive duplication resulting from this means that efficiency is minimal.
Do you share the view that a common market in defence needs to be created?
What definite steps will the Greeks take during their presidency of the Council?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said about policy relating to Iraq, to most of which I do not need to add anything, but I would like, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to address two remarks to you.
