It does not grant any export refunds whatsoever.
Imports are totally free. They are not subject to tariffs of any kind.
Furthermore, 80% of the cotton used in the Union is imported.
Â Â  Mr President, I hereby state from the outset that, if the Commission's new proposals are implemented, they will be the for Mediterranean products.
The Greek countryside and three of the country's basic products, which are grown by 75% of farmers, will receive a mortal blow so as to serve the new plans and commitments of the CAP, the WTO and the enlargement of the European Union, in other words the instructions of big business and the multinationals, which are ordering that tobacco farming be wiped out, cotton farming be cut back, olive oil farming be abandoned, products in which the European Union is highly deficient.
They are indifferent to the consequences, which will be painful not just for the farmers, but also for workers in processing, warehouses and so on, as well as for anyone with professional connections with these products and numerous small- and medium-sized businesses active in these sectors.
The Commission is cruelly proposing with no turning back to abolish tobacco farming and subsidies by 2013.
The chronicle of a death announced before Gothenburg.
On the pretext of protecting health, it is wiping out European tobacco farming, tobacco farmers and, for Greece, all the activity surrounding the farming, trading and processing of tobacco which, as you know, is concentrated mainly on small lots in problematic mountain areas.
The highest hypocrisy and cynicism, given that it does not at the same time propose to abolish the European tobacco industries which, of course, will continue to import raw tobacco unimpeded from third countries and to speculate by making and exporting cigarettes.
The European Union of 370Â million citizens is being called on to stop financing 347Â 000 tonnes of tobacco, while the USA of 263Â million citizens continue to increase their production of 586Â 000 tonnes, a large proportion of which is imported into the European Union.
What is clear is that tobacco farmers will receive less money, referred to in future as decoupling subsidies but in practice they will be scant unemployment benefits and pseudo-compensation for abolishing tobacco farming from the European Union.
As far as cotton is concerned, so that the cotton farmers do not delude themselves, the Commission clearly states in its introductory report that the new reform of the COM is being carried out because the objective of reducing the price and reducing the cultivated areas and production, for which provision was made in the 2001 reform, has not yet been achieved.
In two years, cotton farming in Greece has been reduced by 70Â 000 hectares, with a significant reduction in the price of cotton and in producers' incomes, due to the increase in coresponsibility levies and all the absurd measures for prohibiting and limiting the number of hectares cultivated and the return per hectare.
250Â 000 tonnes of two years' Greek production did not receive any subsidies and only obtained the international price which, as we know, is fixed by the multinationals.
The same prices are obtained by the developing countries, which the European Union is supposedly doing its utmost for.
However, the Commission is demanding even greater reductions under a new disastrous reform.
With a 'because I say so', it has set a low ceiling of 34Â 000 hectares for Greece and similar cutbacks for Spain and Portugal in a bid to lower the ceiling even further with the measures it is taking.
The Commission proposals for cotton even overturn Protocol ÎV, as Mr JovÃ© Peres mentioned, of the 1981 Act of Accession of Greece to the EEC on the basis of which the guarantee of a minimum price for producers is laid down.
Nor does a proven healthy product, such as olive oil, escape the European Union's eternal anti-farming policy.
Hypocritical and groundless arguments are being used to wipe out olive oil farming.
A spirit of hypocrisy and mockery at the expense of olive farmers prevails in the proposals in the Commission's report on oil.
Having stated that there is a serious risk of cutting care for olive trees on a broad scale, while those who wrote and inspired the proposals are obviously conscious of what will happen with them, measures are being proposed which will achieve what, theoretically, they do not wish to happen, in other words 60% decoupling.
These three Mediterranean products are victims of the mid-term reform of the CAP which is strangling farming.
The catastrophic CAP is turning into an even more efficient mechanism for wiping out farmers, especially small- and medium-sized farmers.
The constant reference to environmental protection is being used as an alibi to reduce farm production.
The hypocrisy becomes crystal clear from the anti-tobacco rather than the anti-smoking campaign, at a time when the cultivation of modified crops is being promoted.
These proposals are not open to amendment or improvement.
That is why, if they are not withdrawn as they stand, they will come up against the combative, fighting opposition of the agricultural world in order to avert their implementation.
When you expressed your position, Mr Lamy, you said that you had also come to an agreement with the producers.
The only thing you did not do was to come to an agreement with the producers, the real producers.
You came to an agreement with those who have nothing to do with production, nothing to do with the products and, mainly, you came to an agreement with the multinationals.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, all those present here today seem to agree that the products under discussion are of significant social importance. That much is obvious to Parliament, the Commission and to those affected.
When all is said and done, the fundamental objective of agricultural aid is to provide people in rural areas with a reasonable income.
They will then be deterred from leaving their land and flocking to the cities or to richer parts of Europe. It should be borne in mind that we are striving to attain two of the Unionâs fundamental ambitions.
These are to achieve territorial balance within Europe and to prevent the depopulation and desertification of rural areas. Sadly, there is considerable experience of the latter in Aragon, the region I represent.
Commissioner, this is what the common agricultural policy should be aiming at, especially in the case of crops with such social importance.
It is essential to encourage people in rural areas to remain on the land in their regions in order to prevent the desertification of parts of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, I have long been endeavouring to extract from the Commission figures relating to the number of jobs to be lost in the leaf tobacco production sector, the related manufacturing industry and in associated sectors. So far, my efforts have been in vain.
I put a specific question to the Commission yesterday and received a reply today.
This reiterated that the reform will not have a negative impact on the income of the holdings.
The Commission has also reiterated here and now that the reform will not have a negative impact on producersâ incomes either.
To date, however, the Commission has failed to respond to the question concerning the effect of the reform on employment.
You are yourself on record as stating that no specific assessment exists, Commissioner.
I have received similar information in written answers, despite indications that 14Â Directorates-General have been exercised on the subject.
CommissionerÂ Lamy, I feel it is irresponsible to undertake such a far-reaching reform without any information on the implications for jobs.
Some 100Â 000 directly related jobs are at risk in the sector, together with 500Â 000 indirectly related ones.
I believe the Commission does actually know this.
I suggest it is withholding the figures because it is fully aware of their alarming proportions.
I suggest too that the Commission is fully aware of the devastating consequences of the reform for employment and the regions affected.
I can certainly forecast them myself, and so can all those who understand the sector and work in it.
We are all also aware that the accompanying measures will prove inadequate.
Incidentally, these measures are not additional, Commissioner. They come from the producers themselves.
In any case, they will be insufficient.
Commissioner, producers are up in arms in Extremadura, the region I represent.
They rightly believe the reform to be brutal, radical and unjustified.
They feel they are about to be sacrificed in the interests of a cause ridden with misinterpretations.
They find themselves in an unbearable situation.
They are angry because they have been at the receiving end of hypocritical and misleading statements.
Allow me to remind you, Commissioner, that in June the Commission gave assurances that reform would be undertaken taking account of the social situation in the least-favoured regions.
Allow me to recall also that in June Parliament and the Council were instrumental in obtaining a political compromise.
This entailed MrÂ Fischler abandoning the maximalist approach of total decoupling.
Despite all of this, there is now a proposal for total decoupling of the most labour-intensive CMO.
Commissioner, I join with previous speakers in urging the Commission to reflect. Before adopting these regulations, I beg you to spare a thought for the anguish of those families and the future of the regions concerned.
They must not be sacrificed on the altar of hypocrisy.
I am put in mind of that excellent account of hypocrisy provided by the famous French dramatist MoliÃšre in his play .
Â Â  CommissionerÂ Lamy, you have heard here the concerns of my fellow Members and now I would simply like to make an observation.
The age-old imbalance between Mediterranean crop production and crop production in the rest of Europe needed a different approach, whereas we are faced with the reform of Mediterranean crop production after the failure of Cancun and with a view to enlargement.
Our concern is growing, with the fear that these two processes may exert further, unendurable pressure on our Mediterranean crops.
Our concerns are, indeed, extremely serious regarding tobacco, even though everyone has to take on board the European Unionâs principle of protecting health: these measures will cause extreme economic and social upheaval and result in foreign tobacco imports being increased to 100 %, so I certainly feel that greater caution would be in order.
I would like to focus my remarks on one of the three crops that we are discussing because I feel that it is a case of enforced coupling.
Each of these products is, indeed, special and deserved to be treated separately rather than them all being placed under the same umbrella.
I am referring, in particular, to olive oil.
Of course, there is a desire to reduce the requirement for support based on the amount produced.
I would take the liberty of emphasising, however, that this condiment enhances food consumption across the world and, since it is a product which is good for health, there is increasing demand for it.
I therefore feel that we have two major problems: guaranteeing a safety net for income and boosting quality policies.
We will discuss these proposals after the legislative proposal.
You quite rightly refer us to the decisions of the individual states, but we must also consider a number of general criteria such as employment.
I put it to you: how can you reconcile the provision of incentives for the quality of this crop with the ongoing possibility of mixing olive oil with other fats?
It is this possibility of mixing that causes a vertical drop in prices and is a blow to farmers.
Â Â  . Mr President, allow me to say a few words to respond to the comments that have been made.
I note that the choice of speakers means that only Members with reservations concerning these reforms have spoken.
I will begin with tobacco.
It has already been discussed, and I have some memories of my own from just over 10 years ago in this very House.
Given the tensions that could be noted here and there between the agricultural policy and the health policy, one wondered whether we should review our options.
So this debate has not come about all of a sudden: it has not just landed in our laps, we have been considering it for years, and you, in Parliament, have been discussing it for years.
I believe that the Commission would indeed have been Tartuffe had it not drawn conclusions from these debates that have been held over the years and I believe that we are drawing the conclusions in a very clear manner.
In this case, we are proposing a redeployment, a restructuring of this crop towards alternative crops.
A clear option is being taken.
We know that this will require considerable efforts on the part of a number of tobacco producers today, at both ends of the scale, but we are putting proposals, including financial proposals, on the table that allow this restructuring to take place due to the necessity that we have again discussed over the past years.
The same does not apply, however, to olive oil and to cotton, where the aim is not to restructure nor to convert or guide production or producers to other products.
We want to maintain a number of cotton crops and many olive groves in the European Union by avoiding the depopulation or desertification of the zones in question, but also by correcting the effects of the current aid systems from the point of view of production, the environment and the finances of the European Union.
That is why the Commission has presented an option, somewhere in the middle, that does not take decoupling as far as the measures adopted in Luxembourg this year for other products.
It is, in fact, in order to take account of the particular sensitivity of a number of these regions that we have not gone as far as we could have gone in theory, and I can guarantee this, to have participated in the Commissionâs discussions on the proposals by our friend Mr Fischler on this subject.
My third point relates to the difference in the treatment of sugar.
Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos, be assured that the reform of the CMO in sugar has begun as we have put forward three options. This is an initial discussion phase that must take place because, it must be said, it is the first time that the substance is being discussed, which is not the case for tobacco, cotton or olive oil.
The Commissionâs formal proposals will be presented next year, once the debate on the three options has been held with the main parties concerned.
Finally, to Mr JovÃ© Peres, who was worried about the impact regarding aid to olive trees depending on the year of planting, I will say that as far as I can tell, this is not a real problem since the maximum guaranteed quantities have already been exceeded, which means that this does not have any impact on the amount of the aid in question.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
Â Â  The next item is the debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 50).
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution (B5-0434/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on human rights violations and failure to show respect for the rule of law in Burundi.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, we are about to debate a resolution on Burundi.
I think it is useful to recall the background to the current situation in that country.
It is now ten years since the murder of MrÂ Ndadaye, its first democratically elected President.
Since then, Burundi has been ravaged by civil war. The war amounted to a confrontation between ethnic groups.
Sadly, it resulted in almost 300Â 000 deaths.
A peace process is currently under way. Initially, this was led by the PresidentÂ ofÂ Tanzania, JuliusÂ Nyerere, and later by MrÂ Mandela.
The terms of the process provide for a cessation of armed conflict.
This was to be followed by the various stages of an electoral process and transition to democracy.
An equitable power sharing system was to be established, together with a rotating Presidency passing from Hutus to Tutsis every 18 months.
All these arrangements are contained in the AugustÂ 2000 ArushaÂ PeaceÂ Agreement which resulted in the present transitional government.
A delegation from the Committee on Development and Cooperation visited Burundi between 22 and 27Â June of last year.
On 9Â JulyÂ 2003 the PresidentÂ ofÂ Burundi appeared before the CommitteeÂ onÂ Development and Cooperation.
On 8Â October an agreement on effective implementation of the cease-fire was reached between the Government and the main faction of the so-called Forces for the DefenceÂ ofÂ Democracy led by PierreÂ Nkurunziza.
Unfortunately, armed confrontations between groups such as the FDD and the FNL have continued.
The AfricanÂ Union has dispatched the AfricanÂ MissionÂ InÂ Burundi peace-keeping force known as the AMIB.
It consists of 3Â 000 soldiers from Ethiopia, SouthÂ Africa and Mozambique. The force is tasked with assisting in the disarmament and demobilisation of rebel soldiers and with their reintegration back into society.
In addition, if peace is maintained, it should be easier to for humanitarian aid supplies to reach displaced persons and the population in war-torn areas.
The last of the AMIB soldiers arrived in Burundi last Sunday.
The force is financed by the UnitedÂ States, France, the UnitedÂ Kingdom and Mozambique.
Nonetheless, there appear to be financial difficulties over keeping it in the field.
At the same time, the problems in the south of Kivu are ongoing. Confrontations are still taking place and they represent a threat to peace in the region.
The EuropeanÂ Union suspended aid to Burundi in JanuaryÂ 1997. Aid was reinstated, however, following the response to the peace negotiations.
EURÂ 48Â million was granted for a rehabilitation programme aimed mainly at supporting the return of displaced persons and demobilisation.
The programme also aimed to facilitate justice and reconciliation.
In addition, institutional support amounting to EURÂ 2Â million was awarded to the MinistryÂ ofÂ Economy.
A further EURÂ 150Â million was allocated at the ParisÂ Conference in 2001. This included an ECHO programme for the return of Burundian refugees from Tanzania supported by UNHCR.
EuropeanÂ Union funds amounting to EURÂ 285Â million are currently available to Burundi.
Additional funds will be allocated under the ninth EDF.
We would like this resolution to serve as a reminder to the authorities in Burundi that they need to involve women in the peace process.
We believe women have an important part to play in the latter.
We also encourage neighbouring countries to support the peace process in Burundi.
Finally, we hope to be able to rejoice that peace has come about in this small country in central Africa.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, although our group supports this resolution â a very balanced one despite the many amendments, which we all accept â we do believe that what is needed, above all, to resolve this problem properly, is a realistic long-term process.
For a long time, in this region, the land of the great lakes, we have seen very violent conflicts, even going as far as genocide and mass expulsions, which, if we merely apply short-term remedies, will only keep on recurring.
That is why it matters that we should start by clarifying terminology, for the words that we use here are often not the same ones that are used in the region itself.
We talk in terms of armies, parties, or refugees, but these are, as a rule, ethnic groups appearing in the guise of an army, a party or as refugees.
What matters in the first place is that some sort of stable balance be established between the ethnic groups, with it being ensured that all of them participate in political life and are represented in the armed forces, in the administration and, as the amendment so rightly puts it, in the justice system above all.
This is where it is very important that we should proceed with tact and sensitivity, rather than adopt a schoolmasterly and accusatory role, for ethnic misunderstandings and prejudices led us Europeans, too, to spend centuries smashing each othersâ skulls in, and such things are still going on in Europe today.
We really do, then, have to approach this task with the proper sensitivity and humility; we cannot expect people who were doing terrible things to each other only a few years or months ago to be able, within only a few months, to behave as if nothing had happened.
That is why we need this process; although we must waste no time in getting on with it, we need sensitivity, we need time, and we need to be present.
That is why we need civil servants, lawyers and also officers from the armed services to act as advisors to both sides.
Â Â  Mr President, the unfortunate people of Burundi are continuing to pay through periodic killings, through arbitrary arrests and through torture. The ethnic opposition is constantly intensified by the leaders of armed gangs, official or unofficial, that were created and supported, it must be remembered, for decades by the former Belgian colonising power and by the French tutelary power.
The resolution provides a great deal of moralistic and paternalistic advice for the Burundi leadership, the leaders of the factions and its neighbours.
Yet more than advice is needed, as the European powers have an overwhelming responsibility for what has happened and what is happening in Burundi, just as they have a more general responsibility for all of Africa, of which Rwanda and Burundi are to some extent the sad symbols.
They have an overwhelming responsibility for having ruined Africa through the trafficking of slaves, through colonialist pillaging and then through another form of pillaging, which continues today.
While Parliament provides moralising advice, the major British, French and Belgian capitalist groups and many others continue to take their stipend, even from the poorest countries, and the little information that filters through from many parts of Africa where ethnic conflicts and mining riches go side by side show that it is very rare to find a situation where behind the local warlords there are no capitalist groups trying to get their hands on the riches the land has to offer.
Rather than improving the fate of the local population, these riches are the cause of its misfortune.
I am well aware that material aid, even a great deal of it, would not be enough to overcome all of the problems that are an extension of the past.
However, if Europe wanted to, it could provide sufficient aid to allow the refugees to return, provide the Burundi people with acceptable housing and living conditions, and enable them to build infrastructures, hospitals and schools, thus creating jobs.
The resolution does allude to aid, in particular for the economic reconstruction of the country, but it gives much more attention to the financing of African forces working to restore and maintain peace and the despatch of a mission of European senior military officials to meet their counterparts in the Burundi regular army.
Yet in neighbouring Rwanda some years ago, the presence of French senior military officials not only did not prevent the genocide but actually encouraged it and perhaps even armed the butchers.
Thus, even if this resolution had some effect, it would certainly not wipe away the traces of blood that the presence of major European capital has left in Burundi and more generally in the African continent.
Â Â  Mr President, when we consider the historic, colonial interference of many European countries in various places around the world, for example Burundi, it is very important that we have this discussion here today on Burundi where government forces have been responsible for extra-judicial killings, disappearances, torture and other serious violations.
Meantime armed groups unlawfully kill, maim, abduct and torture civilians in pursuit of their political aims.
Moreover, armed belligerents in Burundi continue to recruit, at times forcibly, child combatants.
As was agreed last December, and has already been mentioned here, it is imperative that Burundi enacts a stable and real cease-fire between government and rebels as a precursor to a meaningful and lasting peace.
We in the Green EFA group have also called for judicial and army reform, as provided for in the Arusha accords of 2000, and an end to impunity for those who continue to perpetrate human rights abuses.
We also invite the government to set up a truth and reconciliation commission, as has been called for by so many in civil society.
We call on the government to ratify the International Criminal Court.
We also recognise that Burundi is in need of help from the international community, especially financial aid for the economic reconstruction of the country, for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of a legitimate functioning government.
This is a challenge that the EU must rise to.
But we must also be aware of the fact that little is being done to stop the well documented flow of arms that fuel conflicts and cause massive human rights abuses â not just in Burundi, but in so many other parts of the world.
This is something that must be a priority for the EU, we cannot allow arms to be sent to countries where they are causing such massive human rights abuses.
We should not be involved with arms in the first place, to be honest.
Â Â  Mr President, the Pretoria Protocol brings new hope for the peace process in Burundi, and the EU along with the international community needs to support strongly the transitional government in its efforts to restore stability and law.
To rebuild national unity and reconciliation after those long years of civil war, it is vital to ensure that people, individuals and communities who suffered gross human rights abuses are acknowledged and provided with reparation.
This is why I support the creation of a truth and reconciliation commission, of the kind set up in South Africa or Sierra Leone for instance.
It will allow cases of extreme violations of human rights committed by all parties to be identified and investigated.
It also provides victims with support to ensure that their dignity is restored and that healing and rehabilitation can occur.
Bringing the accused to trial under the legal, judicial process strengthens the rule of law and is vital in breaking the cycle of vengeance created by widespread rapes and killings committed with impunity.
A truth and reconciliation commission would also raise awareness of human rights and provide the basis for peace-building and sustainable reconciliation of the communities of Burundi.
Â Â  . Mr President, like Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, it is with a certain degree of optimism that we welcomed news of the conclusion of the Pretoria Protocol between the transitional government and the armed Hutu group, the FDD.
This Protocol is in our eyes an important step towards consolidating the peace process in Burundi.
It shows that many of the local actors are prepared to respect the Arusha Agreement as a framework for the peace process.
Like the author of the resolution we are discussing this afternoon, we are also concerned about the exclusion from the process of the last rebel group, the FNL, and we feel that it is important to continue to encourage all initiatives to launch the negotiations between the FNL and the transitional government in Burundi.
What have we done so far?
For the most part, we have supported the peace process as far as possible, deploying a number of instruments to ease the conflict and promote reconciliation, including food aid, financial contributions and the despatch of observers from the African Union. Pending the establishment of the facility to support peace, we are preparing, in collaboration with the African Union, an emergency project to maintain peace in Burundi, which totals around EURÂ 25Â million.
Naturally, we hope that the entire donor community will stand alongside us.
We are working towards the economic reconstruction of Burundi with a rehabilitation programme, totalling just under EURÂ 50Â million, which is designed to ensure the physical rehabilitation of the economic and social infrastructures that have unfortunately been destroyed by the civil war, as in other parts of Africa.
In August, we signed an indicative national programme with Burundi, as part of the ninth EDF, which amounts to around EURÂ 70Â million, part of which is naturally allocated to the restoration of the political institutions in the transitional phase.
Therefore, in our view, support for the peace process and a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the country are the two objectives that the Union must continue to strive towards in order to support the little progress being made as regards the peace process in that country, which sadly continues to be troubled.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on Turkmenistan, including Central Asia:
â B5-436/2003 tabled by Max van den Berg and Richard Corbett on behalf of the PSE Group;
â B5-0440/03 tabled by Ole Andreasen, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
â B5-0445/03 tabled by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group;
â B5-0446/03 tabled by Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group;
â B5-0449/03 tabled by Pernille Frahm and Luigi Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
â B5-0450/03 tabled by John Bowis and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
â B5-0452/03 tabled by Bart Staes and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is not without reason that the resolution at hand calls PresidentÂ Niyazovâs Turkmenistan âone of the worst totalitarian systems in the worldâ.
As a Member of this House, I then rub my eyes in astonishment when I see PresidentÂ Chirac of France referring to the figure known as Turkmenbashi as âFather of all Turkmenâ and âmy best and great friendâ.
He did this onÂ 13Â October on the occasion of the presentation of the new French Ambassadorâs letters of credence in Ashkabad.
In his letter to PresidentÂ Niyazov, PresidentÂ Chirac also expressed the desire to consolidate and deepen the warm relations between France and Turkmenistan.
Apparently, in Paris, oil and natural gas interests take priority over everything.
Just compare that with our resolution.
What was that we were saying about a single European voice?
Whilst the Member States of the European Union are discussing the undeniable fact of the Christian tradition of the Occident, sincere Christians in Turkmenistan are having to fear for their lives daily.
It is their certain knowledge and solace that God is watching over His church everywhere.
That does not alter the fact, however, that we have a political responsibility towards their oppressors.
Council and Commission, please, understand your calling.
Â Â  Mr President, today in Europe and every part of the civilised world it is Thursday, but in Turkmenistan ironically it is 'the day of justice'.
Well, there is nothing just about life in Turkmenistan, but justice for the Turkmen people is what this debate is all about.
President Niyazov renamed himself.
He renamed the days of the week.
He named the months of the year after his national heroes, starting with himself and his mother.
He has built lavish palaces; he has erected statues of himself while his people remain impoverished.
From 1985 he has ruled as a tyrant.
Since 1999 he has been president for life.
In November last year the worst repression of all followed an attack on him.
Turkmenistan has become a land of torture and imprisonment, of death in custody, of intolerance towards political and religious views.
The press is muzzled, human rights organisations are barred and opposition is driven abroad.
Our resolution lists names, and we demand the release of those names, the end of ill-treatment in those cases where they are actually still alive, and access to them for the Red Cross.
But they are the tip of an iceberg that needs to be exposed.
I trust that the Commission will do just that.
Our delegation on Central Asia covers all the countries of Central Asia and Mongolia.
Last May we were in Uzbekistan, the beautiful and historic country of Tamburlaine.
We were made welcome and we saw some improvements in human rights and a willingness to open doors.
But two days after we left Mr Ruslan Sharipov was arrested.
Ruslan Sharipov is a journalist who wrote about police and government corruption.
He was arrested on charges of homosexual conduct, criminalised in that country under Article 120 of the criminal code, in contradiction with the provisions of the ICCPR ratified by Uzbekistan.
On 28 August masked men kidnapped and severely beat his public defender, Surat Ikramov.
In September Mr Sharipov got out by letter allegations of his ill-treatment and of how he was threatened in prison by police and prison officers.
In September the charge was reduced, but only reduced.
He should never have been charged.
He should be released now, and I ask the Commission to intervene in this case.
While we were in Uzbekistan, we also met the British Ambassador, Craig Murray.
He is a fearless diplomat who told us the truth as he saw it.
Perhaps he was unwise to do so, but he was right to do so.
At a meeting in Tashkent on 17 October he said: 'I believe that people are born with an instinct for liberty and that freedom and democracy come naturally to people everywhere once they are given the chance'.
Well, the British Government did not endorse or commend him.
It summoned him home for treatment.
I ask the Commission to issue a diplomatic 'habeus corpus' challenge to the British Foreign Secretary: restore a good man to his post and the gainers will be the Uzbek people and their leaders, but also the good name of British diplomacy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the clarity of the resolution on which we are now voting leaves nothing to be desired.
As has already been quoted by other fellow Members, Turkmenistan is âone of the worst totalitarian systems in the worldâ.
The situation in other Central Asian countries is perhaps a little better, but there, too, the human rights situation is abominable.
Does that mean that Europe should ignore Central Asia?
My answer is ânoâ, and for two reasons.
The first is the strategic goals.
Ignoring that region will not do.
It is not in Europeâs interests to let those countries, which export corruption and instability as well as oil and gas, remain ârogue statesâ.
There is a second reason, too, which is the necessity â already mentioned by some fellow Members â of doing business regarding the large quantities of oil and gas in that region.
To some politicians, however, and sadly also some fellow MEPs, that means that we have to do business first and foremost, and that we should just mention human rights, but on no account focus attention on them too much.
Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past, when, on account of our need for oil from the Middle East, we kept quiet about the human rights violations in Saudi Arabia.
It is true that Europe needs oil and gas, including from that region, but that also means that those countries need us, and this provides us with the opportunity of giving priority to the human rights situation â to improving it, in particular â in our dealings with those countries, and only then speaking about oil.
Referring to EU policy in Kosovo I would say: âstandards before oilâ.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, what I have to say supplements what my colleague MrÂ Bowis said.
We are both members of the delegation on Central Asia, and it is partly thanks to him and his great commitment that we are able to put this kind of issue back on the agenda.
I should like to begin with Turkmenistan.
I am still rapporteur for a new cooperation agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan.
Parliament, along with the Commission, has stated that it does not actually want to conclude that agreement, nor does it want to discuss it.
There is every reason for this.
As MrÂ Bowis and other fellow Members have already stated, it is perfectly clear, looking at the current situation, that that regime is unacceptable.
At the same time, however, we have to think about what we can do for the people of Turkmenistan.
We believe that Parliament must make an urgent appeal for the Red Cross to be able to visit the prisoners again in any event, for us to be able to resume good contact with the NGOs, and for those NGOs to have some freedom once again in those countries.
We must stand up for the people â including politicians and human rights activists â who are currently incarcerated.
We must stand up for freedom of belief.
It is too absurd for words that only a certain form of Islam, and only the Orthodox Church, still have some degree of freedom, or in any event still enjoy a measure of protection, while all the other groups, both Christian and non-Christian, lack that protection.
This is unacceptable, because people and religion belong together.
With regard to a number of the other countries mentioned, I should like to point out that, in spring of this year, we also discussed a resolution on Kazakhstan.
That led to intensive talks between our delegation and parliamentary delegations from Kazakhstan, and improvements were introduced on a number of items.
We are still finding ourselves disappointed on many counts, however: legal procedures, freedom of the press, and also freedom of organisation.
I hope that these first steps that Kazakhstan has made in the right direction are not the last, but instead that further pressure, including on the part of the European Union, will lead to improvements in the situation in that country.
I wish to make a passionate plea for a new cooperation agreement with Tajikistan.
Fortunately, the Commission is currently preparing an agreement for that country, too, which is an extremely good thing, because we must keep close to these countries.
MrÂ Bowis has already described the situation in Uzbekistan, and I have nothing to add.
That leaves Kyrgyzstan.
The present resolution rightly levels a number of criticisms, but, at the same time, we have here a country that deserves our warm support, because it is trying, with ups and downs, to build a democracy, despite having no resources and no oil.
There should be criticism where criticism is due, but, even more importantly, support where support is due.
I also wish to express to the Commission my hope that, in coming years, when it comes to Central Asia, the European Union will perhaps give a little extra support to a country such as this, in particular, which has no oil and no resources.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission shares the concerns that have just been expressed by the Members as regards Turkmenistanâs lack of respect for its human rights and democratic obligations, be it the obviously unfair trials of political prisoners, the ill-treatment of these prisoners, which is common knowledge, or the serious attacks on religious freedom, for example, regarding which we have the same information as you.
Our analysis is therefore the same: the situation is serious in relation to respect for human rights.
In spite of this situation, however, it is important to maintain dialogue with Turkmenistan in order to avoid totally isolating the country, which in our opinion and in the current circumstances would probably be even worse from the point of view of respect for human rights, which we promote.
As regards the other countries of Central Asia âÂ Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and UzbekistanÂ â which you have just mentioned, at both EU level and Member State level, we continue to stress that the international commitments concerning human rights must be respected, and we do this within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreements.
With regard to the bilateral relations between the Union and these countries, we do the same, and we have done so publicly for all of these democracy problems in Central Asia by cooperating with other international bodies working with us on this issue, be it the United Nations, the OSCE or the Commission on Human Rights.
Therefore, we fully and completely share the concerns that have just been expressed and are set out in the motion for a resolution.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at the end of the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on Nepal:
â B5-0435/03 tabled by Gerard Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group;
â B5-0437/03 tabled by Hannes Swoboda and Maria Carrilho, on behalf of the PSE Group;
â B5-0439/03 tabled by Astrid Thors, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
â B5-0448/03 by Pedro Marset Campos, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;
â B5-0451/2003 by Thomas Mann, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
- B5-0453/2003 by Reinhold Messner and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.
Â Â  Mr President, the recent breakdown of the ceasefire in Nepal and the ensuing violence have led to a huge loss of life and injury.
To achieve lasting peace in Nepal, an open and democratic society, and progress and prosperity for all, all sides must honour the armistice of 19 January as well as the code of conduct which was signed by both the Maoist insurgents and the government on 13 March 2003.
The announcement yesterday that the Maoist rebels will no longer carry out political killings, or destroy public utilities or infrastructure is just a crumb of comfort.
Sadly, since the breakdown of the ceasefire, 211 people have lost their lives.
We must ensure that we support and promote democracy and the rule of law in countries such as Nepal.
The recent opening of an EC delegation office in Katmandu is a welcome boost to EU-Nepal relations and cooperation.
We must ensure that we do all we can on the ground to help those suffering directly and indirectly from the unrest.
We should increase our financial assistance in Nepal and we must ensure that the main goal is the eradication of poverty and provision of universal health and education services.
These underlying causes of conflict must remain the target of all EU cooperation assistance to the country.
The Commission must work in Nepal through all stages of the conflict, from supplying humanitarian aid for those suffering, to ensuring that conflict resolution and prevention programmes are launched to prevent further violence.
I welcome the call in the resolution for the appointment of an EU special representative for Nepal.
Such a representative could work to ensure that assistance is provided to the Bhutanese refugee camps.
The UNHCR decision to phase out assistance for these camps is worrying and comes at a time when Nepal needs continuing rather than diminishing support.
Although Nepal has sheltered many Tibetan and Bhutanese refugees over the years, the deportation of 18 Tibetans to Tibet a few months ago is a worrying development.
The well being of all refugees needs to be guaranteed.
Peace will only be achieved in Nepal through the democratic process.
The EU should help this process and help the Nepalese to build a better future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the ceasefire agreed on 29 January of this year in Nepal between the government and the Maoists lasted only seven months.
As long ago as March, both sides were given a code of conduct, whereupon rebel leaders were released from prison.
Three rounds of negotiations resulted in the Maoists abandoning their demand for the abolition of the monarchy.
The government produced a framework for reform of the state; I have its road map and objectives in my hand as I speak.
It provides for round table conferences involving all parties, as well as prompt elections to the national parliament, new structures featuring regional self-government, the introduction of the market economy and education and employment rights for ethnic groups and people with disabilities, all of which adds up to a substantial package.
In August 2003, though, the Maoists ended the ceasefire, since which time three hundred people have been killed, twenty-five of them last weekend alone, and acts of intimidation, extortion, serious fighting and murders have become daily occurrences in Nepal.
For the first time, foreigners have been abducted and shots fired at tourists.
In this country, so heavily dependent on tourism, the situation is becoming more tragic.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party calls on the Maoists to renew the ceasefire once and for all and to return to the negotiating table.
Should the two sides need a mediator from outside, the EU is eminently capable of performing that role, we Europeans enjoying a high degree of acceptance throughout South-East Asia.
We therefore call on the Council to appoint a special ambassador to Nepal, with which, Commissioner Lamy, the Commission must build up the EUâs relations.
One first and important step would be for the staff complement in the new office in Katmandu to be increased.
Although putting an end to the civil war is the first priority, at no time must respect for human rights be neglected.
Democracy must be extended, reforms acceptable to people at the grass roots must be implemented, and minorities must be treated with respect, particularly the Bhutanese refugees in the camps that Parliamentâs delegation to SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) visited, the funding of which by the UNHCR is evidently no longer certain.
The minorities also include refugees from Tibet, who have been obliged to leave their homeland in fear of their lives, and who pass through Nepal on their way to India.
According to the information I have received, the handing over to the Chinese of eighteen Tibetans was an exceptional occurrence â let us hope that it remains one.
The Nepalese government must guarantee that deportations will be prevented, and all refugees from Bhutan and Tibet must be guaranteed protection under international human rights agreements.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the population of Nepal has known poverty and a ruthless caste system for centuries, and a government that has not been able to offer any solutions.
This formed a fertile breeding ground for a Maoist insurgency, which claimed 7Â 000 lives.
In January of this year, a ceasefire was agreed, which came to an end in August, but the negotiations then ended immediately.
Since then, again according to the sources available to me, there have been more than 800 deaths, mainly Maoists and poor farmers and villagers.
The deaths, on 13Â October, of four students caught in the crossfire between Maoists and the army are the latest outrage.
The government of Nepal receives supplies of arms from the United States on a massive scale, aid from India, military aid from the United Kingdom and other countries, and supplies of arms from Belgium, which even amended its Arms Act in order to be able to supply those arms.
More than half of the revenues on which the country survives are now derived from foreign aid.
The government lacks any democratic legitimacy; power rests with the King and the army.
Thanks to those supplies of arms, the government has evidently chosen to halt the dialogue and to opt for what is known as the military solution: stamping out the rebels and so-called rebels â poor villagers â by force of arms.
Human rights are trampled on with impunity in the process, as the British representative, SirÂ Jeffrey James, found on the scene.
Every possible means must be employed in an attempt to get the parties back around the negotiating table.
Supplies of arms must cease, and those who think that arms can effect a solution here will see nothing but the total destruction of the country.
Even more children will be tricked into leaving their homes and recruited as child soldiers; even more farmers will be shot dead in their fields; there will be even more killing in general.
In the meanwhile, this people has become so weary.
We now have a delegation there.
Will we now take genuine action there, and also harness our efforts to bring about a return to peace?
Or will we continue to give aid with one hand and supply weapons with the other, whilst closing our eyes to the fact that the government is, of course, using that money to pay for those weapons?
I wonder what kind of hypocritical game we are playing.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission welcomes and appreciates Parliamentâs initiative to publish a resolution almost two months after the sudden breakdown of the peace talks in Nepal, which, as Mrs Maes has just said, had begun following the truce in January of this year.
Unfortunately, as we know, no consensus has been reached on a lasting solution and we believe that the role of the political parties and civil society must be better integrated into the peace process; otherwise, there can be no serious chance of restoring confidence.
This would appear to be a necessary precondition for any popular foundation for peace negotiations and we are willing to support the request for a round table bringing together a broad spectrum of representatives of the parties and civil society that would make it possible to move forward in the search for a solution to this crisis.
However, at this stage we do not believe that any additional measures, such as direct mediation in the peace process, are appropriate while they are not based on a broad consensus between the various parties concerned.
In your comments, you mentioned the situation of the refugees: we estimate that there are around 100Â 000 refugees and we regret that the progress made in verifying them has been slow. In order to assist their repatriation and settlement, we are going to continue to supply provisions for the camps and to support the role of the High Commissioner for Refugees.
Several of you highlighted the need to provide our office in Kathmandu with additional resources and we are willing to do this within the limits, of course, of our budget resources, which to a large extent are determined by this House, as you will be aware.
Finally, as regards the question of arms sales, it is clear to us that there is no hope of an armed or military solution to this conflict.
We will continue to be particularly vigilant with regard to the issue of respect for the Code of Conduct for Arms Exports, which, as you know, implies specific obligations, which also extend to our Member States.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I was glad to hear Mrs Stihler speak, and also that a number of Socialist Members have rejoined us, as we covered two important human rights issues without the second strongest group in this House saying anything about them.
I was already worried that the group had ceased to exist or had abandoned human rights policy.
I would just like to ask, in the event of their no longer needing their speaking time, whether the Rules of Procedure would allow it to be transferred to us in future.
We would be very grateful for that.
Â Â  There is no danger of us not noticing your presence, Mr Posselt.
The joint debate is closed.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the vote.(1)
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  We do not agree with the report for the following reasons:
First, because the proposed measures aim to protect and strengthen the common fisheries policy of the ÎU, with which we disagree due to the restrictions which it places on production, directed mainly at small- and medium-sized fisheries, especially in countries such as Greece.
In addition, we are being called on to support an absurd control system in which the controller and the controlled are one and the same.
Secondly, because the short-term action plan and, more importantly, the creation of a Joint Inspection and Control Structure are measures for the further integration of the ÎU in the fisheries sector, meaning greater restrictions on national fisheries policies and national measures which take account of national peculiarities and requirements.
At the same time, the proposed Joint Inspection Structure also raises numerous questions, in that issues of national sovereignty in the territorial waters of the Member States also arise.
Â Â  . We abstained on this report, as on the other two fisheries reports.
Of course we are in favour of the recovery of fish stocks, and particularly cod stocks, which are threatened, as highlighted by another report debated at this sitting.
However, we do not trust either the European institutions or the states themselves to do this.
Sometimes this translates into weak-willed measures, and one report confirms that these have been scuppered by various Member States of the European Union, resulting in the continual dramatic decline of the stocks of some fish species. Other times, it results in measures presented as being essential to save nature, while the main, if not the only, effect they have is to persecute the people, in this case those for whom fishing is their livelihood.
We should remember that this takes place without any of the big guns having anything to fear.
The contrary is shown to be true by the assessment of the multi-annual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets, presented at this sitting.
What sense would it make to have a preserved environment if the price was the misfortune of men, or at least the majority of them, those who live off their job?
Â Â  . If the Commission wishes to group together all national inspection and surveillance resources into one Community Fisheries Control Agency so as to submit them to a single monitoring procedure, in the interests of establishing a Joint Inspection Structure, it should also define clearly which powers pertain to the Community and which pertain to the Member States, as the rapporteur emphasises.
Such definitions are all the more important given that, until now, the accepted principle has been that the Member States are responsible for monitoring fisheries activity.
Bearing in mind the far-reaching legal implications of the Commissionâs proposals â remember that surveillance and monitoring of aspects of the common fisheries policy are in some cases ensured by military means as well â and their very high costs, the rapporteurâs suggestion that a feasibility study be carried out in relation to this proposal, in coordination with the Member States, is equally sensible.
As various Member States, experts and organisations maintain, this study should examine alternative models for Community cooperation in this field.
The rapporteurâs concern that representatives of the sector should participate in the various phases of the decision-making process must also be given priority.
Finally, I reiterate the absolute need for a legally independent common fisheries policy (CFP) to be established once and for all, since, for no apparent reason, the CFP has up to now only been mentioned in the Treaties in connection with âagricultural productsâ, and in the context of the common agricultural policy.
Â Â  Even if we accept that the objectives of reducing the fishing fleet have not in fact been achieved, which does not apply in Greece, for example, where we have had both a reduction in the fleet and a reduction in fisheries for the benefit of imports and aquaculture, we have no reason to regret the failure of the multi-annual guidance programmes.
That is because these programmes started the restrictions on small- and medium-sized fisheries production, as in Greece, resulting in a reduction in fisheries, the deterioration in the fisheries balance of trade and unfortunate repercussions for the populations of the shore areas.
We do not disagree with controls on the fishing capacity of the fleet; however, we do not agree that they should be carried out by the common fisheries policy as expressed under the multi-annual guidance programmes.
On the contrary, we feel that the necessary arrangements should be made on the responsibility of each Member State, taking compliance measures in accordance with the actual scientific data of other agencies, such as the FAO, in relation to the state of fish stocks and so on. Under no circumstances do we agree to the cession of this responsibility to supranational bodies such as the ÎU, because its policy tends to further strengthen big business in the fisheries sector also, striking small- and medium-sized fishing enterprises with withdrawals and the scrapping of vessels, measures in favour of aquaculture and so on.
Â Â  . Overfishing in European waters has led to scientists now proposing a total ban on cod fishing and strict limits for other species of fish such as plaice.
Up to now, scientistsâ warnings have fallen on deaf ears at the December annual meetings of the 15Â Fisheries Ministers.
As a result, we are threatened with the same situation as happened ten years ago off the coast of Canada (Newfoundland).
Those waters were fished down to the very last cod, and, even ten years later, there are still no cod to be found.
The fishing communities in eastern Canada did not survive that.
The EU has been trying for years to reduce the fleet capacity of European fishermen.
That reduction has taken place in practice, however.
Europeâs overfishing problems are being shifted on to the rest of the world in that increasing numbers of European fishermen are depleting fish stocks in the waters of other continents.
It all began in Ireland a couple of years ago, when a supertrawler, the , had to be decommissioned.
Instead, this supertrawler is now sailing under the Panamanian flag for exactly the same Irish firm in the waters of the Developing World.
There are now as many as three supertrawlers that have not been decommissioned by the Netherlands; these vessels are now depleting fish stocks in the waters off the West African coast, under the Dutch flag.
Thousands of small-scale African fishermen are missing out, and shortly yields off the West African coast will also decrease.
The response of the Dutch Government will then probably be to send these supertrawlers even further away.
Scientistsâ warnings of worldwide overfishing are not being taken seriously: not by the Dutch Government and not by the European Commission.
A year ago, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg (SeptemberÂ 2002), the Dutch and European authorities hypocritically signed declarations that there must be an end to worldwide overfishing byÂ 2010, but in reality the Dutch and European authorities are shifting the problems caused by overfishing in European waters onÂ to the countries of the Developing World.
Fishing the worldâs oceans dry with our heads in the sand: I can think of no other way of summing it up.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I do not want to prolong the proceedings, but you will have become aware that the cry of âCheck 16â has become a running gag in the House.
Because of an event that you will probably be able to follow up â although you are again the wrong person for me to be telling about this â I asked, during the last part-session, for the House secretariat to pay attention to the circumstances under which a vote is re-examined when one or more Members ask for this to be done.
Neither then nor now have I received any notification from the secretariat.
We often talk about the dignity of Parliament, but that also involves us being given an answer to this question by the secretariat.
Â Â  Clearly, Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure already covers this matter.
However, I will ask the Conference of Presidents to give you a response.(2)
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 23 October 2003.
Â Â  I should like to take this opportunity to welcome to the official gallery a number of distinguished visitors here with us today.
Mr Mejdahl, speaker of the Danish Folketing, is very welcome here this afternoon.
We are also joined by colleagues from the Committee on European Affairs of the Swedish Riksdag, and I should like to welcome them to our Chamber.
As you know, this afternoon we shall have our exchange of views with Commissioner Verheugen on the Commission monitoring reports on the Accession States.
I know that a number of distinguished guests, including ambassadors, have joined us for that today.
They are very welcome.
I note in particular that the Romanian chief negotiator and acting minister for European integration is in the gallery, as is Mr Theodor Stolojan, the leader of the Romanian opposition: they too are very welcome.(1)
Â Â  A corrigendum to the agenda of the sittings of 5 and 6 November has been distributed.
The following changes have been proposed:
I have received two competing requests, pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure, to refer back to committee the report by Mr Wuermeling on consumer credit (A5-0310/2003): from the PSE Group, asking for referral back before the debate, and from the ELDR Group, asking for referral back at the beginning of the vote.
Unless there is a consensus in terms of a joint request from the groups I am not in a position to make a proposal to the House other than that we would vote on these requests at the appropriate time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I think it is a good principle to try to avoid unnecessary work and unnecessary confusion.
I believe that those present in the House are representative.
I therefore propose that we immediately vote on referral back to committee.
Â Â  Mr President, that was an astute proposal by Mrs Thors.
If she now joins us straight away in voting for immediate referral back to committee, that will sort the whole thing out brilliantly.
Â Â  I gather, from the round of applause, that this is what the House would like, in which case the House needs to change the Rules, because they do not permit me to do this.
The vote must take place at the time I indicated earlier.
So please be here at the beginning of the debate to ensure your view is taken into account.(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to refer to some very unpleasant, untruthful and personal remarks made by Mr Balfe following the budget vote in Strasbourg last month.
Mr Balfe had demanded an extension of the medical insurance to former Members, which was refused by the Committee on Budgets.
As one of the budget rapporteurs for 2004 I see myself as a servant of this Parliament whose main responsibility is to defend the decisions taken by this House and, in this case, also those of the Budgets Committee.
My primary objective has been to ensure that there is value for money for the European taxpayer and a desire to maintain the reputation and the dignity of this House in the eyes of the European public.
First, the accusation by Mr Balfe against me that I have entirely frustrated the decision taken by the Bureau is an accusation against the entire Budgets Committee, because all of his demands were put to the vote.
Second, Mr Balfe made a reference to, and I quote 'the comparatively inexpensive scheme'.
This is an astonishing statement given than the initial estimates are far over EUR 1 000 000 and it is costing us EUR 60 000 just for a study to establish the actual figures: hardly peanuts.
Third, with respect to the use by existing Members of current schemes, I have to say that I am completely baffled.
Is Mr Balfe suggesting transparency for all Members in the Budgets Committee, or does he want to establish a register for everybody?
Is he proposing to amend the current scheme?
Surely he is not concerned about the cost!
I suggest he puts forward proposals for next year's budget so that we can make whatever amendments are needed.
Finally, in the name of all of my colleagues on the Budgets Committee who I believe take their responsibilities extremely seriously, I would like to say that these allegations are not worthy of someone holding a senior position in this House such as a Quaestor and I believe he brings this House and that office into disrepute.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to make it clear that the Bureau asked the Committee on Budgets to take a certain action, which Mrs Gill, as Budget rapporteur, could have done.
She declined to do so.
The Bureau requested that Members who were over 60 when they retired, had served at least two terms in the European Parliament and were prepared to pay on the same basis as all the staff one third of the costs of the scheme, would as is the case for every member of staff of this institution be admitted to a sickness scheme if they did not have adequate national insurance.
The Bureau, which was unanimous in its view, put forward a very humane request.
I do not think that MrsÂ Gill, as budget rapporteur, reacted in a friendly, humane or reasonable way to that request.
A study will now be produced, and I hope that when it is finished the Budgets Committee, which spends millions of pounds on very dubious projects ...
... will realise that it also owes a duty to senior and often ill Members of this House who have given a lot of service, and that those Members are prepared to pay to be in an insurance scheme which is more than any of us, as present Members, are prepared to do.
I hope that this matter will be looked at again by the Budgets Committee but I restate that all Mrs Gill had to do was take the recommendation of the Bureau not of this Quaestor and place it before this House for a vote.
If she thinks the Budgets Committee is superior to the House I suggest she go back to constitutional school.
Â Â  Happily, the Members present today are healthy, rather than ill.
Let us thus proceed with a healthy respect for our agenda.
Â Â  Mr President, I too, want to be brief.
Tomorrowâs agenda includes a vote on a resolution on the liberal professions.
The fact that Parliament was not sitting last week meant that it has not been possible to put together a compromise in good time, so I ask that the vote be postponed to the next Strasbourg part-session.
Mr Medina Ortega and MrÂ Rothley have also agreed to this.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with Mr Lehneâs proposal since we have not in fact reached an agreement on the text of the joint motion for a resolution amongst the different political groups.
Â Â  If there is a consensus on that then let us proceed on that basis.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to return to the question of the agenda and of Mr Wuermelingâs report.
We have given some thought to how we might resolve this problem at once without changing the agenda and have come to a conclusion that I think even Mrs Thors would agree to.
I hereby move that the Wuermeling report be moved up to the first item on the agenda; I would ask you to announce it now, and notify you here and now that I will then move that it be referred back to the committee straight away.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say that I definitely support the proposal that we should vote right now on the motion for referral.
Members cannot be expected to come to this Chamber half an hour before midnight tonight just to decide whether or not a debate is to take place.
Any majority would be quite fortuitous.
Such a thing is not commensurate with the importance of this proposal.
At the same time, though, I would ask you to give me the floor, so that I may oppose this referral without debate.
Â Â  This reflects precisely the dilemma in which the groups have placed me.
If I follow the logic of Mr Schulz and he is defeated, and the Wuermeling report thus becomes the first item on the agenda, that would completely upset the rhythm of the work planned for today.
I shall not follow that suggestion.
However, if, as we proceed with our agenda, colleagues can come to a consensus and can come to me at the end of the first item with an agreed proposal, I shall then put that to the House, and we can act on it accordingly.
If no consensus can be reached we shall proceed as indicated earlier.
Â Â  Mr President, yesterday you were in Berlin as was I. You were on an official visit to the German Parliament.
You were accompanied by representatives of the PPE-DE and the PSE Groups.
Have you forgotten, Mr President, that there are other Groups in this Parliament who could also have accompanied you?
Why did you take only the two largest groups?
I do not understand this and I would like you to give me an answer.
Â Â  Yesterday and on Monday I made an official visit to Berlin and to the Bundestag on behalf of this Parliament.
Yesterday afternoon I addressed every political group in the German Parliament, including the Greens and the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the CDU-CSU.
I invited no group from here to accompany me, but the protocol office of the Bundestag kindly informed colleagues here of my visit.
Those German colleagues who wished to attend any part of the visit were free to do so.
Of course, Mr Cohn-Bendit, like you, they were not obliged to do so.
It was a matter of choice for you and for others, not for me.
I made a visit as President, but it was open to those who wished to associate themselves with it.
Those colleagues who attended parts of the visit or the various political group meetings were very welcome.
They were not under obligation to be there, and they were not accompanying the President on the visit.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to call upon the Commission to explain the Eurobarometer survey that has just been published and that places Israel at the top of the list of states that are threats to world peace, above Iran, North Korea and the United States, all three in equal place.
First of all, how is it possible to put together a questionnaire presenting a list of threats to peace which includes Israel and the United States and ignores international terrorism,Â Palestinian or otherwise?
Above all, however, how is it possible to mix rogue and democratic states on a list of states that allegedly threaten the peace?
What frightens me is that the mental confusion of the pollster is equalled only by that of those polled who did not differentiate and who seem to condemn the use of force in all situations, whether it be a case of aggression by a rogue state, international terrorism, or legitimate defence by a democratic state.
This moral disarmament is the worst possible news for the future of the Europe that emerges from this opinion poll.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I, too, uphold the concerns, expressed by many Members in this House and elsewhere regarding the survey itself and how it was organised.
I hope that the political groups and the Commission are able to give us further explanations because, if Europe is to have any influence, if Europe is to be a leader in international affairs, then, without a doubt, it needs to act with greater caution.
When questions are asked, it is good to know how they are asked and why they are asked and, above all, once there are results, it would be right and proper to not let the pressÂ âÂ and certain papersÂ âÂ know about them first but to inform Parliament and the public as a whole about them.
In addition to that, MrÂ President, I would briefly like to condemn what happened yesterday in my country, where there was a serious attack on a barracks The trail is one of insurrection and anarchy and is also linked to the event in Spain, where some Italian terrorists or pseudo terrorists were arrested.
I believe that all we Europeans should take action because we must not underestimate this threat of terrorism, although the results of police action, such as the measures of the Italian police that arrested some dangerous murderersÂ âÂ or, at least, those accused of murdering Marco Biagi and Massimo DâAntonaÂ âÂ can be seen as positive signals.
The action which I am calling upon Parliament to take part in should be a united endeavour to combat this disturbing phenomenon across Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will take the liberty of returning for a moment to the issue of the Eurobarometer survey.
I think that it is right that Parliament should listen to what the Commission has to say and it should not hear of it from the press-room or from journalists; it is right that, as is our prerogative, the CommissionÂ âÂ in the person of MrÂ Prodi or another CommissionerÂ âÂ should come and explain to us the reasons behind this survey, which wasÂ âÂ quite rightlyÂ âÂ reported in all the papers and which certainly portrayed a negative, if not pessimistic, image of our European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I do not wish to go into the content of this particular opinion poll, although it certainly would have been wise for the poll to have asked what people thought of the Palestinian State and of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.
It is not a bad thing, however, that people know what Europe thinks.
I would, in general, encourage the Commission to publish information of this or any other nature on the views of Europeans, to show the importance of opinion on our continent.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to speak to the same topic.
My group has of course discussed the effects that these publications and figures have had.
Speaking on its behalf, though, I want generally to welcome your desire to put the issue of the handling of such an opinion poll, and the manner in which the questions were arrived at, on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents.
I think that is where it belongs in the first place, as it is very difficult to have a wide-ranging discussion in plenary on an opinion poll, the overall basis and background of which I have at present only fragmentary knowledge, derived from references in the press.
Before I venture to pass judgment, I would say that it is right and proper that we should consider it in its entirety.
I would also warn against our approving of opinion polls only when we find their results agreeable.
As a long-suffering German social democrat, I, in particular, can say that this is always a problematic venture for any politician.
Opinion polls, whatever questions are put, can sometimes tend to make you feel queasy.
We cannot discuss, here in this plenary, whether or not the questions have this sort of suggestive effect or whether or not the answers that have been given are to our liking.
After all, who knows what would have come out if other questions had been put?
I would therefore counsel against us taking premature decisions or carrying out premature assessments; instead, let us just put this on the agenda for the Conference of Presidents and have discussions with the Commission on Eurobarometerâs operations as a whole.
Â Â  MrÂ President, to echo the speeches of some of my colleagues, MrÂ Berthu and MrÂ DellÂ Alba in particular, I would say that it could perhaps be useful to put an end to surveys and not to ask people for their opinion because, if they are asked for it, there is a risk that they will give it and, clearly, if this runs counter to the overriding attitude and if it is politically incorrect, then it is very unpleasant for the European political establishment.
In a democracy, moreover, there is also a formality to be gone through in this area, that is to say elections, and I would point out to you that these are extremely dangerous.
In any case, they could, for example, lead, as from June, to greater interest in the political sympathies I represent.
I wonder if elections too should not also be abolished and then perhaps the people of Europe also changed as soon as they begin to have negative thoughts or as soon as they apparently hinder the progress of European democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, I have recently returned from Sri Lanka, where I was continuing my engagement with the peace process at the invitation of those involved.
As colleagues may know, the peace talks have been suspended since April.
I found it particularly encouraging, during my visit, that the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers, as they are more popularly known published their proposals for an interim self-governing administration.
This is, indeed, a very significant move on their part.
It is the first time that they have submitted comprehensive proposals.
What made it all the more noteworthy is that the LTTE's chief spokesman, Mr Tamilchelvan, stated that this interim administration was not a precursor to a separate state.
This opened the way for negotiations with the government to start once again, even though there is a wide gulf between the two sides.
Unfortunately, over the last 48 hours, President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who belongs to the opposition party, has sacked four key ministers, suspended the Parliament and declared a state of emergency.
I believe that this threatens the peace process.
Bearing in mind that we in this House support the peace process, and that together with our international partners we have committed four and half billion dollars to underpin it, and also remembering the importance of bi-partisanship in the Irish peace process, I would ask you, Mr President, to urge the two main parties in Sri Lanka, together with the Tamil Tigers, to support the re-opening of negotiations to ensure that permanent peace is brought to that troubled country.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to refer to the recent crisis in Sri Lanka.
Mr Cushnahan cogently pointed out that, at a time where it is now possible, after 23 years of civil war, to bring peace to the country, the President declared a state of emergency once the proposals for peace had been put forward by the rebel Tamil Tiger groups.
You, Mr President, Mr Poettering and other Members of this House have met the Prime Minister, who as we speak is with Mr Bush in Washington.
Parliament ought to be recalled back in Colombo.
There is no justification for the prorogation of Parliament, nor for the declaration of a state of emergency, nor for sending troops out onto the streets.
The European Parliament might well ask that democracy, the rule of law, parliament and government be reinstituted in Sri Lanka.
Â Â  Mr President, I was surprised and horrified yesterday to read the charges by Amnesty International against Sudan, where a special court has sentenced a sixteen-year-old boy accused of armed robbery to so-called âcross amputationâ; in other words his right hand and his left foot are to be cut off.
Amnesty International is denouncing the Sudanese judicial system and penal legislation, which contains this sort of punishment, such as amputation and death by stoning, and has called on the international community in a bid to prevent the punishment of the sixteen-year-old youth from being executed.
I think, Mr President, that both our Parliament and you personally need to take an initiative and remind Sudan that it has signed the Cotonou Agreement on respect for human rights.
Our direct intervention is needed.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on the same point which has just been made.
I sincerely hope that you would write to the Sudanese Government and suggest that these barbaric punishments be stopped immediately: not just for this crime, but for all crimes.
They cannot continue to use Sharia law and these dreadful, horrendous punishments.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a serious humanitarian issue on which you need to and, I believe, will intervene.
On 27 July 2003 a tanker, the , with a local pilot at the helm, ran aground at the entrance to the port of Karachi.
There was a serious ecological disaster.
A great deal of oil leaked into the port.
Since then, the authorities in Pakistan have prevented the seven members of the crew from leaving Pakistan.
In the case of the , the Spanish authorities sought out those responsible on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle, in other words the master of the ship, but not the rest of the crew.
The cook is not to blame, nor is the cleaner.
Nonetheless, in the case of the , seven seamen are being held, most of whom are Greek.
What is more, on 17 August, once the whole disaster had occurred, a team from a salvage company arrived in Pakistan, the head of which, Mr Nikos Papas, is also being held by the authorities in Pakistan, even though he is not a member of the crew.
They merely went to salvage the ship and limit the disaster.
I should like you to intervene.
We have a hostage here.
The minister from Pakistan is in Brussels today, he is to dine with Mr Solana and Mr Patten.
We need to intervene in this matter.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to draw your attention to the Rosia Montana Gold Corporation project.
This project, which relates to the development of a gold mine in the centre of Romania, raises three types of problem.
There is a social and humanitarian problem because this project, which is under way, means that a population of 2Â 000 people has to be resettled and 900 houses demolished; and there is an environmental problem because this project will, in particular, involve the installation of a 400-hectare settling tank containing cyanide residue, necessary for the intensive treatment of ore.
An Australian company has already been using this technique in Baia Mare for almost two years, causing an ecological disaster in the Danube.
This is a problem that also affects the historical heritage: after about 15 years of exploitation, the valley, which also contains archaeological remains dating from the Roman occupation, will have disappeared and, with it, many churches, cemeteries and historic monuments.
Implementation of the project is subject to the environmental agreement to be given by the Romanian Government.
In the knowledge that Romania is bound by its commitments as a candidate for accession to the European Union, is it acceptable that recourse to methods of extraction that endanger people and the environment, methods that are now only used in the developing world, should be tolerated in a country that is about to be integrated into the European Union?
I would appreciate it if those of my fellow Members who are going to the area at the beginning of December would assess the precise extent of the irreparable damage that would be caused by implementing such a project.
Â Â  Parliament will indeed attend to the matter through a delegation.
That visit has been approved by the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, since 12 August, the date of his abduction, there has been no news from Dr Arjan Erkel and we do not know what has happened to him.
He was kidnapped in Mukala in Dagestan and nothing has been done to free him.
I feel that the European Parliament and the European Union should take action with a view not only to getting information and calling for his release but also to protecting the institutions that provide voluntary services in territories where the health situation is absolutely disgraceful.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to point out that, on 2Â JulyÂ 2003, the Italian Presidency made a commitment before Parliament to present the moratorium on the death penalty to the United Nations General Assembly.
This undertaking was supported on 23Â October by a resolution adopted unanimously by Parliament.
Today, we learn from the press that the Italian Government has decided not to present the resolution to the UN.
I urge you, MrÂ President, to convey our disappointment to the Presidency and to keep point 3 of our resolution, which provided for the results and assessment to be discussed in any case.
Although these are, I feel, very important, a debate is still called for.
Â Â  Indeed, the Italian Presidency is here, listened to your comments and hopes that it can take note of the resolution.
That concludes the item.
Â Â  . Mr President, as regards my report, the arrangement is meant to be that we all agree the report being referred back to the committee without further debate and without a vote.
I am, though, able to take this opportunity to give a brief explanation of what the report contains and what it aims to do.
This is one of the few proposals that will directly affect every citizen in the European Union in his or her daily life, and will do so in a very sensitive area, that being money.
The directive will affect you if you pay by credit card, if you hire a car, if you buy a television set on credit or if your bank account is overdrawn.
At this moment, in the European Union, the consumer credit agreements currently in force account for something like a billion euros.
That is why it is of the utmost importance that Parliament should handle this issue with all possible care and with a great sense of responsibility.
In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we get the impression that the Commissionâs proposal does not do justice to the importance of this issue.
There has been no scrutiny of to what extent the proposal will, in effect, prevent the socially disadvantaged from getting any access whatever to loans, as substantially tighter conditions apply to checks on creditworthiness, which could result in those who particularly need credit no longer being given any.
It has not been considered, either, to what extent this proposal might result in an increase in consumer credit interest rates.
The Chemicals Directive, for example, is contentious enough, but at least we know what it is going to cost, which we do not with this one.
Nor has there been any examination of what effects the intended restriction of consumer credit will have on consumption in the European Union, considering that consumer credit funds 13% of it.
That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has decided on an admittedly extraordinary course of action and recommended to the Commission that it withdraw the proposal, revise it in the light of all these points â there are another thirty of them in my report â and rethink the whole thing before it again comes up for debate.
I can understand why some Members are saying, after the Commission has stated its unwillingness to withdraw the proposal â Mr Prodi has done so in a letter, MrÂ Byrne has said it time out of number â that there is little point in having another plenary vote on the whole thing.
The question in fact arises as to whether there is any sense, under these circumstances, in again entrusting the Commission with the drafting of a proposal.
Speaking personally, I have little confidence in its responsible departments coming up with something that we would find more manageable.
I hope you do not mind me speaking in such personal terms.
In view of the Commissionâs refusal, in any case, to revise the proposal, I agree that we should get down to the task of rewriting the whole of the directive.
I do not actually regard this as one of this Houseâs functions â we are meant to take policy decisions rather than to formulate individual articles â but if the Commission is proving to be so obtuse on this point, it is for us a constitutional duty, a duty that we will discharge, and, having done so, we will see to it that European consumer credit law is modern, flexible and promotes competitiveness.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  The proposal is thus to refer this report back to committee without debate.
I should like to thank you, Mr Wuermeling, and all colleagues, for helping to resolve that matter.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission communication on a comprehensive monitoring report and strategy paper of the Commission on the progress towards accession by the candidate countries.
As I remarked earlier, there are many distinguished guests in the gallery today to follow this item.
They are very welcome.
I am pleased that we are joined today by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and by Commissioner Verheugen.
I know from my extensive contacts in preparing this debate that Commissioner Verheugen is determined to have these reports adopted by the college of Commissioners after he has presented them to this House.
I regret that as a result of a failure by those other than Commissioner Verheugen to observe the correct procedures, you will, over recent days, have already read in the newspapers much of what you are to hear today.
Indeed, it was reported extensively in some French newspapers yesterday.
This is not a criticism of Commissioner Verheugen, because I know he was determined to follow the procedures as agreed between this House and the Commission.
I regret that this afternoon we will not be hearing for the first time what should be a major communication between our institutions from one year to the next.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the acceding countries, the top priority of my Commission, the absolute top priority is about to become a reality.
Less than six months from now we will see the biggest enlargement in the Unionâs history.
The presence in this House of the representatives of the countries that are going to join the Union next year is a tangible sign of how important that event is.
First, let me say how much I admire the governments and peoples you represent.
Over the past few years, you have moved heaven and earth to bring your legal and administrative systems into line with the These reforms demonstrate your strong desire for freedom and democracy.
Indeed, you have carried out a quiet revolution that is taking you into the European Union with your heads held high, proud of your achievements.
Before the membership negotiations closed last year, I announced that the Commission would be presenting a report on the preparedness of the acceding Member States about six months before they actually joined.
Today, I am here, together with Commissioner Verheugen whom I would like to thank for his remarkable work to present that report to you.
The Comprehensive Monitoring Report adopted by the College this morning is the fruit of lengthy, painstaking efforts by the Commission, which has been monitoring and supporting the acceding countries' preparations for years.
It is based on the 10 reports prepared by the Commission, one on each country, which are also available to you.
These reports draw on all the Commission's expertise in the various areas of the .
They will also be the last such reports the Commission will prepare on the acceding countries, although we will continue to follow up the issues still outstanding over the coming months.
This means we are no longer in the pre-accession phase.
As from today, the Commission is starting to exercise its customary institutional role as guardian of the Treaties with regard to the new Member States too.
I will shortly ask Commissioner Verheugen to outline in detail the Commissionâs findings in the Comprehensive Monitoring Report, but let me first make some general remarks.
The official accession date for the ten new Member States is 1 May 2004, but the prospect of enlargement has already had positive effects.
The European Union is increasingly becoming a reference in many countries for the development of civil society and political life.
No other and I repeat, no other player on the world stage can boast the same drawing power.
The reason is clear.
The Union has succeeded in putting the highest ideals into practice: peace, on which we have founded our Union; democracy, which we defend through all our policies; greater opportunities for economic prosperity and solidarity towards the least-favoured regions and groups.
Why our model is so successful today is also clear.
On its own, each country would be at the mercy of greater and more powerful political and economic entities, but, united, we can direct the process with due regard for democracy and the human dimension.
I am convinced that the accession of the new Member States next year will bring no great problems in terms of implementing the where either the single market or the other Community policies are concerned.
Of course, there are still issues to resolve clearly outlined, moreover, in the report including some very important ones, but I am confident that all these countries will overcome these last remaining obstacles.
The 10 governments are perfectly aware that any shortcoming in any area would deprive them of the benefits of accession in that sector, in terms of both financial transfers and market access.
If problems still remain after accession, the Commission will do its duty, as it always has, and will take the necessary steps.
In any caseÂ âÂ I must stressÂ âÂ I do not envisage any major obstacles to the conclusion of this process.
Indeed, all the issues we have identified are manageable and we have the instruments for the purpose.
Moreover, it is in everyone's interest for the Union to absorb this enlargement as quickly and smoothly as possible because there are many other issues facing the Union and many other goals we must achieve, including the Intergovernmental Conference and the smooth functioning of our institutions in an enlarged Union, the Lisbon strategy, the new Financial Perspective, the completion of the enlargement process and the ring of friends policy the Wider Europe policy.
These will be the real challenges for the enlarged Union of 25 Member States.
One of our tasks will thus be the continuation of the enlargement process. As I have often said, this is a continuous, inclusive, irreversible process.
Our common target is to carry through the accession process for Bulgaria and Romania in 2007.
Considerable progress has been recorded in these two countries as well this year, and Commissioner Verheugen is going to say a few words on this too.
The accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania have moved forward significantly and it is time to think about a framework for finalising them.
These negotiations must be based on the same criteria as those observed by all the other countries, and, of course, in particular, what is known as the principle of own merit.
At the beginning of next year, the Commission will point the way to finalising the negotiations by presenting a proposal for a financial offer for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
Everyone agrees that these negotiations must not depend on the outcome of the debate on the new Financial Perspective or the debate on future reformsÂ âÂ we have always kept these issues separateÂ âÂ and, to prevent this happening, we need to take as a benchmark the financial framework worked out for the ten acceding countries.
On this I am counting on Parliament's support, and I intend to involve Parliament fully in this next phase in the process.
Next year will be decisive for Turkey.
Indeed, this will be one of the last big decisions that it will fall to my Commission to take in this term of office.
It will involve assessing Turkey's progress in meeting the Copenhagen political criteria and issuing a recommendation as regards the opening of accession negotiations.
Let me make one point very clear in this respect: it is this Commission that will present the Regular Report on Turkey and the recommendation in autumn 2004.
That was the undertaking I gave at Copenhagen last year and we will keep our promise.
We have followed developments in Turkey very carefully over the past year.
There has been considerable progress that shows the determination of the Turkish Government to leave no stone unturned in their efforts to meet the political criteria for membership.
We will be watching further developments closely in the areas where progress is still needed, as regards both legislation and the actual implementation of the new rights and freedoms to which the Turkish people are entitled thanks to the reforms undertaken.
Lastly, let me reiterate the Unionâs desire to see Cyprus accede as a unified country.
We continue to hope this will happen. Clearly, it is in Turkeyâs interest, too, to reach a settlement quickly, because this would prevent the Cyprus issue from becoming an obstacle to its own aspirations.
The issue can still be settled before 1 May next year on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's proposal.
All parties concerned must contribute to this process and the Commission stands ready to assist in every possible way.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before closing, I would like to mention the Balkan region.
Croatia has already presented its membership application and the Commission is now looking at Zagreb's replies a huge number of replies to the questionnaire sent to it at the beginning of the summer.
Other countries in the region intend to follow Croatia's example shortly.
Our response to these countries needs to be discerning and far-sighted and we must make it clear that the prospects of membership are genuine and that we commit ourselves to accompanying them along this common road, even though the stringent criteria we have always adopted still stand.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, history has vindicated the vision of Europe's founding fathers: the original Six that had just emerged from the war are now 25 free, strong countries and they will, no doubt, number more than 30 in the future.
In a few months, our family will have 10 new members.
With their enthusiasm, we will be able to enhance our Union and give it new horizons.
We must extend it too and, together, all working together, we can uphold and assert more firmly the values on which it is founded.
Mr President, with your permission, I will now give the floor to Commissioner Verheugen, whom I would like to thank once again for his extraordinarily astute work and his remarkable commitment to this project.
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, when we concluded negotiations with the ten candidate countries a year ago, we did so on the basis of a prognosis that these ten countries would be fully prepared by the date set for accession, that is to say that they would have discharged all the obligations into which they had entered in the course of negotiations.
That is the reason behind monitoring; it is there to determine whether or not this prognosis was accurate.
The concluding monitoring report that the Commission adopted today is the last one.
There have already been two previous reports, which have had very positive effects, and I can tell you that we of course have to expect the media, following the debate in this House, to focus on those points where we say there is something not yet right.
It therefore seems to me to be necessary to start by putting this into perspective.
In the first place, we did not have to re-examine most of the , as it had already become apparent during the negotiation process that all the requirements had been met.
We did not even give it a second look.
We only revisited the areas in which issues had remained open during the course of negotiations and in which commitments had been entered into.
We divided up this part of the into 140 sectors of widely varying importance, some of them comprising several hundred legal acts, others only one â and that is just an illustration of the volume involved.
The fact that we had, all in all, 1Â 400 such sectors to monitor made that an immense task; it is a communal effort by the Commission as a whole, one that, in recent months, had required many hundreds of staff, but I will also claim that this work is very substantial and that the sort of overview we have was never possible at the time of any previous enlargements.
I have to tell you that such a thing has never been done in the history of the EU, and it is important that we should know that if we are to properly evaluate what the outcome has been.
It turned out that, in the 1Â 400 sectors that we monitored, preparations are running perfectly according to the timetable in 70% of all cases and that no comments are called for.
In a further 27% of cases, we have noted that some individual points remain to be dealt with, but there are, generally speaking, no grounds for concern.
This process is in motion, and, according to our prognosis, everything will be in place on 1Â May 2004.
That leaves 3% â precisely 39 instances out of 1Â 400 â in which we have observed serious omissions and delays that can be compensated for only with difficulty.
In these instances, we are telling the future Member States that decisive action has to be taken as a matter of absolute urgency in order to fulfil the conditions in time for 1Â May 2004, so that everything in this area, too, can be in good order.
The thirty-nine problem areas are spread out over ten countries.
I would advise against attempting to rank them in order; the fact that Poland has ten such areas does not mean that Poland is worse than others.
The simple explanation is that a large part of the problems are present only in Poland, as the size of the other countries means that certain of the problems are not found in them.
I regard the overall outcome as very balanced.
It relates to only a few chapters of the and we estimate that the problems will be able to be resolved everywhere even before 1Â May 2004.
If they are not â and it is this point that is crucial â then the Commission will, in good time before 1Â May, take the necessary actions, and we have a whole range of options to choose from.
We can apply the safety measures that are in any case already contained in the Treaty.
We can apply the specific safety measures provided for in the Treaty of Accession; we can institute normal infringement proceedings; we can make use of administrative interventions.
We have, then, a wide range of options, and agreement has today been reached within the Commission that each Commissioner, within his or her own area of responsibility, shall oversee the ongoing handling of these still unresolved issues and shall, if necessary, propose the necessary measures in good time before 1Â May.
Speaking for myself, I do not expect this to be necessary, as, in most instances, the adverse consequences resulting from these problems being left unresolved would not affect the Community as such, but only the new Member States themselves.
For example, the question was raised of whether the structures were in place to enable agricultural support grants to be paid in full.
If administrative structures are inadequate for this purpose, the result will be that the money will not flow, which means that the government that makes itself guilty of such negligence will end up under considerable domestic pressure, because their farmers are not getting their direct support payments.
I therefore predict that all these cases will be resolved as a matter of course before 1Â May 2004.
Knowing that this House pays particular attention to the area of food safety, I can tell you that there are still a number of problems in this area too, and our position remains unchanged, namely that no food not conforming to our standards â by which I mean our hygiene rules â must be allowed onto the internal market.
For that reason, the necessary measures relating to food safety will be taken by February at the latest in order to ensure that no products not complying with the standards get onto the internal market.
There are, however, relatively few of them, and people must not get the idea that a country has performed badly in a particular area just because a few firms in a few countries fail to reach the standards.
To sum up, then, we come to the conclusion that institutions and policies will continue to function after 1Â May 2004, that no appreciable disruptions are to be expected and that, while the possibility of problems cannot of course be excluded, they will be manageable in every respect.
All this, then, adds up to a good outcome.
I unreservedly endorse, and associate myself with, the Commissionâs expressions of appreciation for that and President Prodiâs recent underlining of the especial achievements of these countriesâ governments, parliaments and peoples.
With which, let me turn to Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
I can keep this relatively brief.
Both Bulgaria and Romania have made remarkable progress.
I would in particular like to stress that Bulgaria has now at last managed to promote reform of the judicial system, which had been a major problem in assessing it.
I would like to highlight the more positive valuation given to Romania in terms of the market economy criterion.
The Commission is now stating that Romania can be regarded as a market economy, provided that the reform process continues without change, which we assume it will.
This amounts to an appreciation of the significant economic reforms that Romania has already achieved and of the remarkable macroeconomic stability that it manifests.
Turning to how we take matters further in relation to Romania and Bulgaria, the Commission counsels against decoupling these processes from each other.
We are sticking to the target of bringing both countries, together, into the European Union in 2007, although the principle still holds that no country should have to wait for another.
If, then, it turns out in the course of the ongoing process that they are progressing at different speeds, we will also be able to conclude the negotiations on different dates.
Although we can regard it as a sort of compliment that both countries are very keen to complete negotiations before the present Commission leaves office, we are very cautious when it comes to making a statement about this.
I would also appreciate it if Parliament could follow us in not, at the present moment, specifying any dates, but could limit itself to confirming 2007 as the accession date.
For that to be the case, work on the accession treaty needs to be completed before the end of 2005.
That means that the time window for completing the negotiations is between now and somewhere around the summer of 2005, when, if the country in question really has done everything, it will be possible to conclude them.
As a whole, I regard this picture as a favourable one.
I want, though, to again strongly encourage these countries to make determined efforts towards improving political and economic governance; I am referring particularly to corruption and to the fight against economic crime.
This is also important in terms of the investment climate in both countries and of making them attractive to investors.
We have tried hard not to prejudge anything where Turkey is concerned, and it can be speculated whether or not the report that the Commission has presented today makes a statement about the decision that is to be taken next year.
We have tried hard not to do that, but, instead, to give Turkey fair and objective treatment, and that means that we have to attest and acknowledge the remarkable fact that reforms have been better implemented, and at increasing speed, in both the political and economic spheres.
It also means, though, that we have to tell the truth and say that a very great deal still does not meet our standards or conform to our requirements, and that these things have to be addressed.
It makes no sense to keep any of this quiet.
I noticed that Turkey reacted with a degree of surprise, for one of the consequences of the leak â which is regrettable and, from my point of view, absolutely so â is that I know the candidate countriesâ reactions even before the reports are adopted, and the Turkish reaction tends towards astonishment.
No doubt they had reckoned on a rather more favourable assessment.
So I want to reiterate very clearly that, although we entirely acknowledge what has been achieved in Turkey, we have to point out to the Turks that there are still problems with a number of issues to do with fundamental rights, that Turkeyâs willingness to be bound by the rulings of the Court of Human Rights is still problematic, and that there are, in particular, major problems when it comes to implementing the reforms that have already been decided on.
There is a considerable implementation deficit here, and the government recognises this and wants to do something about it.
President Prodi has just made reference to the problem of Cyprus.
I must, again, do likewise, because I want to inform you that the Commission has today taken a new step, one that is new and may well lead to controversy.
In our strategy paper, we have linked Turkeyâs desire for accession to the Cyprus issue.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding, and also with Turkish reactions in mind, let me explain â as I must â that this is not a condition.
We have to adhere strictly to the Helsinki conclusions, which state that this is not a condition.
It is a statement of fact.
We are simply stating the fact that failure to resolve the Cyprus issue would represent a major obstacle to Turkeyâs European ambitions.
To say that is no more than to state a fact, but I do not, of course, deny that such a statement of such a fact acquires political significance when contained in a strategy document of this sort, and I can also tell you that this political message, this political significance is deliberate.
The Commission wanted to make it clear that it can see such a political connection and wanted, in so doing, to encourage Turkey to be even more pro-active in order to resolve the Cyprus question on the basis of the UNâs plan.
I am firmly convinced that the elections in the Turkish part of Cyprus will open a window of opportunity, and that, in their immediate aftermath, greater pressure must be exerted on all parties in order to introduce some impetus into a situation that has been bogged down for some time.
I do indeed think that a message of this sort from Europe helps the present Turkish Government, in that it gives it a strong argument against those elements in Turkey that have been standing in the way of further progress, particularly on the Cyprus issue.
That is something I wanted to explain to you, as the coming days will certainly see wide-ranging international discussion of this question.
We have always said that the accession process is intended to be a catalyst for resolving the Cyprus issue, and we must, I think, use every available opportunity to deal with the anachronistic situation of a future Member State of the European Union with a barbed wire fence and UN troops deployed there in order to protect the two ethnic groups from each other.
For us as Europeans, that is simply not acceptable, it is unworthy of us âŠ
âŠ and that is why the Commission has decided to take this step.
As this is the last occasion on which the Commission will be able to put such comprehensive reports before Parliament, let me conclude by again thanking you very, very warmly for your cooperation, which has always been constructive, fruitful and trusting.
Â Â  I thank the Commission for those reports.
I should like to remind colleagues that we are not having a debate in substance now.
These reports will go to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, rapporteurs will prepare their own reports, and the debate comes later.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all rejoice that we have got as far as we have, and for that I want to extend warm thanks to the Commission, to its President Mr Prodi, and to Commissioner Verheugen.
Having said that, I intend to keep it brief.
You mentioned the material that has been published.
I find it intolerable that certain things should get into the press without Parliament having the documents in question.
Commissioner Verheugen, to what do you attribute this state of affairs?
Now for my second question.
Whilst I would encourage you to work towards the candidate countries actually implementing what has been agreed, I would also ask you whether it is not the case that we have to set them a good example, for example in matters of stability policy?
Do we not also, for our part, have to do everything possible to adhere to the Treaties, in order to give a good example to our future partners in the European Union?
My third point has to do with Turkey.
We are all very glad that Turkey has chosen this particular way forward.
The Turks are our friends and partners, but do we not also have to distinguish between that which is theoretical and what is put into practice?
Where Turkeyâs membership is concerned, I ask you to consider the possibility of another form of relationship, for example by way of a privileged partnership.
The majority in our group favours good, strong and neighbourly relations founded upon a privileged partnership.
Â Â  . Mr Poettering, you cannot be more irate than I am myself about these leaks of information.
Let me just say in all seriousness that it is perhaps a weakness in the Communityâs procedures that the Commission has to be sent too many sensitive documents before it can take a decision.
Leaks are a regular occurrence as soon as papers leave my office.
I knew that this would happen.
When, at 6 p.m. last Friday evening, in accordance with Commission rules, we had to dispatch the papers, I was in no doubt whatever that my weekend was, so to speak, done for â and so it was!
I told the Commission this morning that I had no wish to tell them how much political interference I had endured in the last few days, on the part of Heads of Government and foreign ministers from every quarter, because I do not wish to give the impression that the Commission gives in to such pressure.
The real problem with these leaks is that they limit the Commissionâs capacity to act.
We have been unable to make any amendments today, because all and sundry would have been able to draw comparisons between what happened today and what we originally wanted.
That is profoundly sad, Mr Poettering, and I cannot give you an explanation.
We are dealing here with derelictions of duty by individuals.
Past attempts to discover who was responsible have failed time and time again, and I no longer have any confidence that such attempts will prove successful.
What I can do is ask Parliament to forgive this manifest untoward conduct by members of staff whom I do not know by name, but which I hope you will excuse.
I also agree with you as regards the second question.
If we were to set the number of problems that have been identified with the new Member States against the number of infringement proceedings brought against long-standing Member States in any given year, you would discover a startling discrepancy.
The fact is that the number of infringements of the Treaties about which we have to complain to the present Member States every year is many times higher than the number of problem areas that we have now identified.
I entirely share your view that, if we were to be able to measure the present Member States against the same benchmarks that we apply to the candidates for membership, we would, in one area or another, get some perhaps surprising results, whether in the area to which you referred â that of macro-economic discipline â or, perhaps in others as well.
What you said on the subject of Turkey is nothing new to me; it is a point of view that I respect.
You will be aware that this is an area in which the Commission has a clear mandate from the Council, and that it must act accordingly.
I would like to use this opportunity to make just one comment.
A discussion of the principles behind Turkey acceding or not acceding is necessary and has to be conducted.
Where, then, if not in this House?
Where if not among the people of Europe?
I am in full agreement with that.
I simply ask that, in this discussion, we should never lose sight of the fact that we in Europe have a direct interest in Turkey being a fully-developed democracy, a fully developed state under the rule of law, with respect for human rights and protection for minorities.
If we constantly keep that in mind, then I do not actually have any fear that this necessary and unavoidable discussion might do any damage.
Â Â  Mr President, I should just like to observe that the leaks do not help the Commission's cause to be involved in foreign and security policy decisions.
I welcome what the Commission has said today.
It is remarkable progress and I also welcome Commissioner Verheugen's assurance that the Commission will take action if progress is not forthcoming in those 39 areas.
First, the Commissioner sent out warning letters earlier this year to the candidate countries.
What was their response and does their response indicate that they will also respond to these proposals he has put before us?
Second, in relation to Romania, where there was a slight hesitancy in his language, to what extent does Romania's previous track record, where it promised a lot and delivered little, count against it despite the progress that has been made in the last two or three years?
Finally, I should like to ask the Commissioner about the hidden negotiations that nobody talks about anymore, the parallel negotiations to extend the European Economic Area to the accession countries.
How exactly are the EEA negotiations progressing?
Â Â  . Mr Titley, the two monitoring reports that we delivered in the first half of this year have indeed resulted in positive outcomes.
At the same time, we also identified problem areas and then sent out what we called âearly warning lettersâ, the sort of thing that in my schooldays in Germany was called a âblue letterâ â I believe that, in English, they are called âred lettersâ â which always contained the threat that if you did not buckle down to work at once, then you risked having to repeat a year.
The results were very interesting.
Almost half the cases that we identified have, in the interim, already been sorted out, so that they do not appear in the concluding monitoring report.
We will now also be writing to the governments, and I know that, in every case, the Commissionâs insights will be accepted â nobody disputes that â and that all the governments will be cooperative, so I believe that we will be able to sort the problems out.
Some of the governments, for example, have told me that the relevant legislation is already on track.
Monitoring has undoubtedly proven its worth as a method that helps us to make progress.
The only thing I can say in response to your comment on Romania is that the encouraging political and economic stability that we have seen in Romania over the past two years is continuing, and that, in view of this stability, Romania is actually in a very good position to achieve the objective it seeks.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate the Commissioner on having brought the accession countries to a stage where fewer than 40 serious concerns were raised out of the 140 elements of the . Most of those concerns are in the area of health and food legislation, or of public administration.
Without making light of the concerns, is the Commissioner confident that the obstacles can be overcome by next May?
Moreover, on Bulgaria and Romania, a clear difference is emerging.
I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he will give the clear signal that Sofia has asked for on the Union's final requirements, and whether he will be tough with the Romanians on the very substantial progress that Romania still has to make.
I welcomed the Commissioner's remarks on Turkey.
The reforms of Prime Minister Erdogan's government are real and must be welcomed.
They must be fully implemented; Commissioner, you are right to demand more, particularly regarding political rights and Cyprus.
But let us acknowledge Turkey's very strident steps forward and I hope that the Commission will commit itself to finding all of the resources possible for working with Turkey to help it towards membership.
Â Â  Mr Watson, I am â shall we say â moderately optimistic that everything will be sorted out.
I am entirely optimistic that far and away the greater part of it will be.
Although we cannot exclude the possibility of mishaps in one instance or another, I will reiterate that all the problems that might crop up are capable of being isolated and will not result in any overall danger to the internal market, the Agricultural Policy, or the food market as a whole.
If I may turn to Romania and Bulgaria, it is certainly the case that Romania still has a long way to go, but there is no doubt that it has, over the last two years, caught up to a significant degree.
Bulgaria and Romania were given their financial signal when we undertook to present the financial package in the first half of next year, that is, during the Irish Presidency, and, moreover, very early on in the year.
I have already discussed in depth with the Irish finance minister how this can be handled.
I regard the political and technical difficulties involved in the financial package for Bulgaria and Romania as being manageable, for the reason that we intend to use the same methods, the same principles and the same rules as we did for the Ten.
We are not putting together a new package for Romania and Bulgaria; instead, we are, so to speak, extrapolating what we have already done for the Ten.
That is also the only option available to us if our orders are that the financial package for Romania and Bulgaria is not to prejudice the next Financial Perspective, which, in its turn, should not prejudice the conclusion of negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria.
That is why we can do no other than choose the same methodology that we have already chosen for the Ten.
So I do not think that is so terribly difficult and do not want to exclude the possibility of our being able to make perceptible progress in this area in the first six months of 2004.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner did not answer my third question about the accession of these 10 countries to the European Economic Area.
It may be that he has chosen not to answer, but maybe he forgot.
I would like an answer.
Â Â  The Commissioner will answer that in his next reply.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should first of all like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Verheugen.
In Germany, there is a âChancellor of Unityâ and now also a âCommissioner for the Unification of Europeâ.
My sincere congratulations on this.
I am particularly glad that, in your report, you have quite clearly given priority to the political criteria in respect of Turkey.
This is an important point.
It is evident that the progress made is significant to the Turkish public.
I think we should note this with a sense of gratitude.
Secondly, I have to conclude from your report that you are fairly disappointed with what has actually happened.
So am I, to say the least.
I thought that more would have been done than has actually been the case, especially with regards to the position of the army; this at any rate, is evident from your report.
These are matters with major implications.
Your optimism concerning the ten countries that will be joining the EU on 1 May relates to minor aspects that can still be ironed out.
I think that the big step towards the democratic constitutional state â which still has to be taken in practice â is of such a scale that we can hardly expect this to be completed in a year from now.
Correct me if I am wrong, Commissioner, but is the date of December 2004 either the date on which we will no longer take our political community of values as such seriously, or as the date on which the guillotine comes down on Turkey's membership?
In that sense, I think that this date is causing us increasing anxiety.
Would it therefore not be preferable, in respect of Turkey, if we were to focus on programme-based progress, or guidance, on the road to a democratic constitutional state?
Â Â  MrÂ President, on the subject of the European Economic Area, MrÂ Titley, I appeal to Liechtenstein, in the interests of the functioning of the European Economic Area, to not associate signing the Treaty with problems stemming from Europeâs past, but rather to seek dialogue with the Czech Republic concerning these difficulties.
At present we are working extremely hard to show the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic a possible way out of this problem.
I cannot yet predict how successful we will be, but we are trying, and we are doing our best, but obviously, you never know.
I agree with you, MrÂ Oostlander, that it is precisely in the area of the military that we had hoped for more progress in Turkey.
There are two issues that give me particular cause for concern.
The first is that Turkish military personnel are still in supervisory authorities controlling important areas of civilian life, such as the National Council of Education or the National Council of Radio and Television.
The military have lost nothing there.
It is also the case that large portions of the Turkish defence budget are not subject to the control of parliament, and when a budget is outside parliamentâs control, then that clearly indicates a lack of democracy.
There is no question about that.
I do not think that we need new benchmarks for Turkey or a new deadline or anything else.
Turkey itself will decide whether or not the end assessment will be favourable.
It is up to them to press ahead with reforms and, as MrÂ Poettering quite rightly said, to put these into practice, so that we can make an assessment.
The political conditions governing accession have been met.
The roadmap is clear: a decision at the end of next year.
The Commission will accomplish this task seriously, fairly and objectively and will not shy away from this responsibility.
Â Â  â Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our group, it is with pleasure that I echo the congratulations to the Commissioner and everyone who has been of assistance to him, but one issue is still causing us concern.
In various accession countries, there are a number of sectors, and it is often these very areas of policy which require increased efforts.
I am, for example, referring to discrimination in the area of social policy and employment, the right to asylum, and justice.
Specific problems spring to mind; they are particularly shocking to our EU citizens, and I assume also to the citizens of those countries.
I am talking here about such things as the discrimination against the Roma, child prostitution and human trafficking.
If these points do not receive priority attention in the sense that they need to be sorted out prior to accession, what means do we have of exerting influence after it?
In this connection, I would quote to you your own words: these countries will then have joined and, as you stated in your introduction, you will have very little influence on these new Member States.
Â Â  MrsÂ Maes, you have raised some very sore points, and I will give you a very clear reply.
Firstly, as regards the political, economic and social integration of minorities, Europe has problems not only with Roma.
I could name groups in a number of Member States for whom discrimination is similarly prevalent, just to put the record straight.
It is not, therefore, just the south eastern Europeans that have problems with the integration of the Roma minority, but also well-established old Member States that have problems integrating national minorities.
As regards the Roma, they were and are, as you know, the main focus of our pre-accession efforts, and we will not declare any country ready for accession that has not devised and implemented a viable strategy for their integration.
I have, however, said many times in this House that it would be a complete illusion to believe that the problem of discrimination and the Roma could be solved before accession in the sense of there being no more discrimination; that is a challenge for at least a whole generation.
What we can reasonably achieve is, precisely, to see a policy drawn up and implemented that reduces discrimination, and I think that we have achieved just that.
As regards the other issues such as prostitution and trafficking in women and girls, we repeatedly and emphatically point out these are, of course, prohibited in all of these countries.
We cannot say that there is a shortfall in the legislation but we can say that there is a shortfall in its enforcement.
Allow me to say something else, though, since, recently in particular, the issues of which I am all too aware have become apparent at Czech/German and Czech/Austrian border patrols.
When we talk about prostitution and even child prostitution, then there are always two sides.
There are those who offer their services or are forced to offer their services, but there are also those who ask.
I have always been in favour and have always said that the issue needs to be tackled from both sides.
I do not believe that we can solve it if we only tackle it from the angle of these unfortunate women, girls and children, who are abused for the purpose of sexual adventures, or whatever else.
It must also be tackled from the angle of those who feature as customers, who create the demand and also an offer.
Â Â  â MrÂ Verheugen, I understand your anger with the media.
I have three questions.
Firstly, it was announced in the media in Poland that fifty-one complaints have been lodged, and in Parliament it is said that an iron fist is needed.
Perhaps you should also use the iron fist in your area, but when the iron fist is directed against people, then it will be difficult and not just the officials will be affected.
I have the impression that the social burdens in Poland will increase; the wind is blowing in the governmentâs face.
The second question is what do you think about the regional processes in the candidate countries?
In Prague there is 3% unemployment, in the industrialised area of Northern Moravia there is approximately 30%.
My third point is that we want good partnerships.
We have just spoken about the Roma and if we want to have a good partnership with Russia then the issue of Russian minorities in the Baltic States must be tackled with greater consistency and seriousness, without political reservation and discrimination, but rather in a way that really leads to a solution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Modrow, I am sorry that I did not understand your first question or your first accusation.
I do not know what you mean by fifty-one cases and an iron hand.
I am familiar with neither the number nor the choice of words.
As regards Poland, I believe that it has proved itself capable of fulfilling the conditions governing accession and of implementing the , and the Polish Government is working hard at dealing with the problems that have been identified, but there are nine of them rather than fifty-one.
As regards regional differences in development, this is an issue that the Commission takes very seriously and on which we report regularly, and we are including these regional differences in development into the strategy for the structural funds that will be introduced in all of these countries from next year and which should significantly help to reduce these regional discrepancies.
In the case of the Russian minority in the Baltic States, MrÂ Modrow, I do not agree with you that the issue is being dealt with in an inconsistent manner.
On the contrary, I think that the Commission is handling the issue extremely well, but that there are nationalistic forces in the Russian Duma that are irresponsible in their approach to it.
I can go into further detail if you so wish.
As far as the situation of the Russian minority is concerned, we have been rigorous in ensuring that Estonia and Latvia meet the corresponding standard, and they are doing so.
That does not mean there is no room for improvement.
I also mentioned, in talks last week in Moscow with President Putin and the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, and other leading representatives, that we are able and willing to bring about improvement, but that overall the standards that exist in Europe regarding minorities have been met in both countries.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner Verheugen, first of all I would like to express my appreciation for the great work that has been carried out.
Having said that, I have a specific question relating to Cyprus and Turkey.
I greatly welcome the clarification in the progress report of the fact that the non-resolution of the Cyprus issue is an obstacle.
I think that it is also extremely difficult to imagine beginning negotiations with a country that is, at the same timeÂ âÂ as will be the situation under international law from May next yearÂ âÂ occupying part of the EU territory.
This leads me to ask a specific question: at present Turkish citizens in their masses are being given passports for the illegal North Cypriot state, which is intended, on the one hand, to change the demographic situation and, on the other, to prevent an opposition victory.
That is the current situation.
Even if we do not recognise this election, we know that the result will greatly influence what happens next.
I think that it will also be extremely important for Turkey.
My specific question to you is, therefore: do you think that it is possible to influence Turkey in this area and to make it clear that we want to put an end to this?
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrsÂ Rothe, this is, in actual fact, about elections to a parliament in a country that we do not recognise.
Nevertheless, these elections are politically important, especially this year.
I have noted with satisfaction the assurances given to me by my Turkish partners in dialogue that Turkey would not allow a shadow to fall over these elections.
What we, and many sides, are describing means, however, that one already has.
That is clearly an attempt to manipulate electoral lists so that the desired election result is achieved.
The possibilities of influencing it are extremely limited.
I am aware that these elections are being monitored by both independent media and independent non-governmental organisations, which will regularly report on them so that a European public opinion can emerge and exert pressure.
This, MrÂ President, is one of the cases where Parliament can do more than the Commission and I should be grateful if it would avail itself of this opportunity.
I know that you yourself have already done this.
Â Â  Mr President, as the Commissioner said, because Poland is the largest accession country, it obviously has the most problems and the most serious concerns.
Would it be fair to say, as many people in Poland say, that in some cases at least part of the problem concerning the integrated administration and control system lies with Brussels delaying the spending on the final requirements for the system?
Would it be fair to say that?
Â Â  MrÂ President,you are asking too much of me since I cannot of course give any information as to how the technical support worked in individual cases, the more so because this is a very specific procedure.
What I know about this system is that we have been aware of the issue for about a year and a half and that initially the Polish agricultural administration responded very hesitantly and then decided on a change of strategy, which led to a considerable time delay.
If you have evidence that Commission staff gave wrong advice or false information, then I ask you to let me know, as I would like to look into the issue.
I am not aware of this having happened.
One thing, though, I am willing to concede: what we have experienced here is further proof that our administrative structures are so unbelievably complicated in some areas that an accession country cannot, even if it wants to, fulfil these demands in a relatively short space of time.
This is especially true for the area of agriculture.
It has also been our experience that the Sapard programme has proven to be the most difficult of all pre-accession programmes, because it makes the greatest demands of the new Members and because, of all the systems, it is the most complicated and carries the most obligations.
I will readily concede that we are dealing with an extremely complicated system but that, if you want to discuss who is responsible for the fact that we have or must have such complicated structures in this area, then that is quite a different matter.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am going to use this speech to refer specifically to Hungary, a country I have observed in my capacity as rapporteur for this House.
I would like to provide a few complementary clarifications on the conclusions I have already had a chance to read, whilst first highlighting the high degree of alignment of Hungarian legislation and national institutions with the , a fact which, of course, I note with pleasure.
The first question I would like to ask concerns the so-called âstatus lawâ, the law applying to Hungarians residing in neighbouring countries: what do you make of the current situation, Commissioner?
Do you really think that the commitment to consult neighbouring countries before amending that law has been respected?
The second question relates to the fight against corruption and organised crime, which you have already had occasion to mention elsewhere, Commissioner: what do you make of the behaviour of the Hungarian authorities during their investigations into and prosecution of high-profile financial scandals, of which you are aware, Commissioner, and which have been uncovered recently in that country?
Specifically, what comments do you have on the Hungarian Governmentâs criticism of the Financial Supervisory Authority, which is, of course, independent of the government of that country?
Â Â  MrÂ QueirÃ³, I do not think that it would be sensible for the Commission to reopen the issues associated with Hungarian Status Law.
For a long time, I have endeavoured, with the utmost discretion, to help all countries concerned avoid any conflicts that might result from it.
In the meantime we have reached the point where there is agreement between Romania and Hungary and the discussion process between the Slovak Republic and Hungary has not yet been concluded.
I urgently advise against us interfering there, as this is more of an opportunity for the two states to talk and act in a neighbourly fashion.
If our help is required, then it is available.
At the moment, however, the two countries are talking to each other and I think that they will reach an outcome sooner or later.
Even if they do not, European Community law will apply in this matter from 1Â MayÂ 2004, and this will, in any case, rule out any differences in treatment on the grounds of nationality.
The other question is a very complicated issue in the light of the domestic disputes in Hungary.
I do not think that we are dealing with a systematic problem here, that is, with a problem that could be said to show that Hungary has not met the conditions for accession.
Rather, we are dealing with massive, extremely weighty and very emotional domestic disputes.
I do not think that it is for me to get involved in such a conflict and give my opinion on it.
Just as little as I would get involved in domestic disputes in current Member States, we should now understand that our new Member States have left behind the phase where, as it were, they were under some kind of surveillance.
I do not feel in any way responsible any more for domestic events in these countries.
To observe and judge them is now a matter for Parliament, a matter for the Council, but it is certainly not a matter for the executive power to judge what a freely elected government and a freely elected parliament do.
I urge you to understand that I do not want the Commission to start getting involved in a future Member Stateâs internal politics.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner Verheugen, I think that the reports are very well balanced and very accurate.
As regards Romania, I would like to add that even recently we have seen visible measures against corruption, and this should be seen as a good thing.
There is one issue that I ask you to consider closely, Commissioner, namely the spread of some aspects of petty crime to neighbouring countries.
This causes great problems and I ask you, Commissioner, to really urge Romania to do something to counter this; it would be in their own interests.
As regards Turkey, I find your report very well balanced,Â and the issue of Cyprus was also handled well.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you would join with me and perhaps also urge all parties in this House not to make Turkey a campaign issue for the next European elections, since I fear that there are some forces that see âFor or against Turkeyâ as the election campaign issue for 2004.
I hope that you agree with me that this should not be the case.
Thank you.
Â Â  Commissioner, do you want to talk about the next European Parliament elections?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am in danger of being tripped up here.
You know, MrÂ Swoboda, that all parties in this Parliament must be completely at liberty to pick out any European problem as a central issue.
I have said so many times: I cannot and will not prevent any one from also raising in elections an issue of such fundamental importance to the future of Europe as the possible accession of Turkey.
Indeed, where else are they to do so if not with the electorate in the run-up to an election?
As I understand the basics of democracy, citizens have the right to have such issues discussed with them.
That is completely clear to me and I will not, therefore, criticise anyone.
I can only repeat what I have already said, namely that the discussion should be conducted in such a way that no harm is done and that in doing so the common European interest is always taken into consideration and that the public are told that we want something from Turkey.
What we want from Turkey is that in its political, strategic and geographical situation they take on security functions from us, both politically and economically, which no one else in the world is in a position to take on.
We need Turkey on our side.
The public also needs to be told this.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, on the question of the availability of its reports, perhaps the Commission could show courtesy to this House by providing advance copy to the rapporteurs of this House rather than to the media.
I speak as rapporteur for Bulgaria, a country on course for joining the European Union in 2007.
I hope that all possible steps are going to be taken to complete negotiations in 2004, ideally by May 2004. This would send a very powerful message to the people of Bulgaria.
While the Commission correctly states that the accession process for Bulgaria is based on the âown meritsâ principle, nevertheless it has also said that it is committed to a common accession treaty for Bulgaria and Romania together, by the end of 2005.
Bulgaria should have no difficulty with that and I hope that Romania will meet that target as well, but I would not like to think that Bulgariaâs aspirations would in any way be held back by slower progress on the part of her northern neighbour.
Finally, with regard to Cyprus, I agree there are strong possibilities for the two communities to reach a comprehensive settlement, but this requires goodwill and flexibility on sides and indeed pressure from the Commission on both sides.
Â Â  MrÂ vanÂ Orden, I would just like to repeat what I have already said.
I must apologise for the irregularities and derelictions of duty that have been blamed on staff unknown to me, but I cannot allow the fact that duties were neglected anywhere to lead me to also violate my own and to disregard the Commission rules.
I ask for your understanding.
We sent the document to all rapporteursÂ âÂ and to youÂ âÂ a few minutes after it was adopted by the Commission.
I would, however, urge you to evaluate the progress in regular personal dialogue with me as we often did last year.
As regards Bulgaria and Romania, I agree with you.
The one country should not wait for the other, and we have also guaranteed this, but at present there is no need and no reason to contemplate decoupling the one country from the other in this accession process.
Â Â  I should like to thank the Commissioner for those reports, and all colleagues who contributed today.
That concludes the item.
Â Â  The Commission report on the progress towards accession by the candidate countries assembles an impressive list of âwarningsâ, which will no doubt give these countries a foretaste of Europe at its most disciplinary.
This outcome was, however, inevitable once we did not opt for the most sensible accession method, that which we were advocating as early as 1992 and which consisted in creating a large political confederation and in then having the Eastern European countries subscribe to each Community policy as their interests or capacities progressively dictated.
The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, preferred a one-phase accession formula to a unified system, leading implicitly to a super state, and we are now going to suffer the consequences, because it is neither technically nor politically viable.
It is also striking that the candidate country that comes in for the most criticism, often for trivial reasons, is Poland, in fact the freest and most pugnacious country at the Intergovernmental Conference.
As regards Cyprus, the Commission is beginning to ask itself questions about the Turkish occupation.
It is not too early.
We need to demand that Turkey withdraw its troops immediately.
Â Â  â I lament the fact that the press were given precise details the day before yesterday of the contents of the report that you are presenting this afternoon to the Members: this order of things does not seem to me to correspond exactly to what should be the democratic functioning of the institutions.
You have told us that this wayward trend is difficult to control, and that worries me.
Then I note that the report on accession preparations treats Turkey in the same way as the other candidates, the ten plus two, in that way seeming, contrary to what you said, to anticipate the decision to be taken by the Council at the end of 2004 on this issue.
Finally, I notice that, before the ten countries have even entered the European Union, they are already being threatened by safeguard clauses and being severely rebuked by the Commission, which is, furthermore, adopting a schizophrenic stance, systematically alarming the candidate countries and, at the same time, getting them to believe in themselves.
Should the candidate countries really be put on trial in such a way?
Or, does this awkwardness on the part of the Commission not reveal a fundamental methodological error which has not allowed the specific characteristics of each country to be properly taken into consideration in the enlargement process and which is in danger of having long-term consequences?
Â Â  The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission: Progress report on the Intergovernmental Conference.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to present this House with a progress report on the process of constitutional reform of the European Union.
The Italian Presidency firmly believes that only with the support of the European Parliament can the numerous problems facing us be resolved, and political agreement be achieved by December.
For this reason, in keeping with Italyâs traditional position, we have striven to maximise the participation of the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Convention on the future of Europe was an innovation that set the current process of treaty reform in motion. The draft Treaty drawn up by the Convention is the result of more than just intergovernmental negotiation.
Indeed, it takes its shape from a series of constructive contributions and a structured, global, public, transparent debate on the future of Europe. For the first time in the history of European integration, the process has actively engaged national parliaments and representatives of civil society too.
The political value of the success achieved must not, therefore, be dispersed or watered down by the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.
For its part, the IGC is responsible for enhancing and supplementing those sections of the Treaty where full agreement has yet to be reached.
Any other solution would be seen as an attempt to downgrade the democratic and transparent method that was launched with the European Conventionâs work.
If this were to happen, it would be a backward step that our citizens would find difficult to understand or justify.
This is the belief underpinning the Italian Presidencyâs chief aim, which is to reach global political agreement on the Constitutionâs text by December.
This will open the way to the signing of the future Constitutional TreatyÂ -Â a Constitution for Europe as President Giscard d'Estaing has called itÂ -Â in the period between 1 May 2004, which is the date set for the accession of the 10 new Member States, and the European Parliament elections.
The extension of the constitutional debate beyond these dates would cause two serious problems of legitimacy and transparency. On the one hand, the constituent legacy of the Convention would be lost; on the other, the European citizens would find themselves voting in European elections without any idea of the future constitutional shape of the Union.
The Italian Presidency will certainly not allow itself to be steered into negotiating a watered-down compromise that would represent a retreat from the Conventionâs proposals just to achieve consensus on controversial issues.
Our aim is to achieve a high-quality result in keeping with the expectations of the European public and capable of guaranteeing effective, democratic functioning of the Union well into the future.
