In parallel with this, Commissioner Fischer Boel is already working on a fundamental programme for the simplification of the agricultural , the first package of which will be able to be presented this year.
I am much obliged to Mr Swoboda for his support, and can tell him that I can give him the documents he needs right now, as I already have them to hand for him and for the other groups too.
These documents will show you what stage the various projects had reached and the reasons why the Commission thinks they should be withdrawn.
Perhaps I might make another brief observation concerning the media.
Right now, I have no desire to bore the House or to torment it, but I could well, here and now, read out a list of the occasions on which I have appeared before it to inform it about this project.
The first was as long ago as September 2004 â even before I was appointed.
I have spoken to your House about this matter on a total of 11 occasions.
Initial information was given to your House before the public heard even a word about it â although I do assume that the plenary of the European Parliament can be regarded as representing the European public.
I do indeed insist that I have acted with absolute correctness as regards informing the European Parliament.
Until this afternoon, and indeed until I stood up to speak here, neither I nor any of my staff gave the media any information about what is in the list.
I have a certain reputation to maintain where my respect for your House is concerned, and so I hope I have made that perfectly clear.
You will, of course, be given all this in black and white.
Even though the Commission is entitled to decide independently of anyone else what to do with this list, I think it highly advisable to wait and see what advice we get from Parliament and to act on it when implementing what is decided.
The Commission has agreed to this.
Turning to the final question, for which I am extremely grateful, my concern about the economic future of small and medium-sized businesses in Europe was one of the reasons why I proposed this project in the first place.
I am perfectly well aware that big business and major firms can handle regulation with relative ease; they can afford to have their own departments to deal with it.
The smaller a company is, though, the more burdensome it finds the costs involved in dealing with red tape and the more difficult it is for it to plan and make investments and actually achieve some growth.
I can, then, assure you that the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises will be considered in all that we do.
The external expertise on which we will draw will of course include that of the representatives of the small business sector.
Our future policy on small and medium-sized enterprises is due to be announced in a communication in only a few weeksâ time, and there will be a great deal in that, too, about the issue of better regulation.
I am just as grateful for what you have had to say about transposition at national level.
There are indeed some quite fascinating examples of how Member States have managed to take a short, clear and straightforward European directive and turn it into a bureaucratic monster with many times the number of words needed.
There is a splendid English expression for this: âgold platingâ.
Part of this project, to my mind, has to do with us explaining to the European public that this sort of thing has to stop, and that European legislation cannot be used as a sort of protective screen behind which nation states run their pet projects and do things that they would not dare to do otherwise.
That, I think, should answer all your questions.
I am grateful for the political support offered to me by three of your speakers, and offer you close and trusting cooperation in this project, which will have a particular impact on all three institutions.
Â Â  Madam President, I too welcome the Commission statement, particularly as far as the optical radiation directive is concerned.
I am delighted that the Commission is joining with us in Parliament to call for natural radiation to be taken out, and for the temporary workers directive to be looked at.
I have always felt that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work.
I hope that the Commission might look again at another physical agents directive, the electromagnetic fields directive, and how it will affect MRI scanners, in terms of bringing in static magnetic fields.
We need health and safety legislation, yes; but only when it is necessary at EU level and when it cannot be done at Member State level.
For instance I would like to see a specific directive on needlestick injuries.
I would like, under Article 13, to see a specific directive on age and on disability.
Nevertheless I welcome what the Commission is saying.
There is unnecessary regulation and, speaking as a pro-European, I think it does us more harm than good.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue for us is one of substance and not form.
It is all very well to withdraw a few directives; indeed there are some that we would really love to see withdrawn, such as the Bolkestein directive, but unfortunately it is still there.
What concerns us, however, is the emphasis given to this exercise, which is absolutely uncalled-for, because trying to win the people over by undoing what has been done seems to us to be rather questionable, to say the least.
Commissioner, after you have seen and listened to industry, I would really urge you to go and meet the consumersâ association as well, as they uphold peopleâs rights and environmental rights.
I am sure that you will meet people who will tell you that competitiveness is much more than what you have been trying to propose to us, alas, for about a year.
I also think that in connection with the impact assessment question and other topics that you have raised here, such as screening, there are outstanding problems that may seem innocent enough but unfortunately are not: just look at the demolition job that you â you yourself and the Commissioner and President Barroso â are performing on REACH and have already performed on the pollution strategy.
I therefore sincerely expect a clear answer from you on these two topics.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, we agree with better law-making.
Clearly, we would like there to be less pernickety bureaucracy and we would like to give business a bit of air.
However, what is your vision for cooperation with the European Parliament, which is a co-legislator?
Even though it is not provided for in the Treaty, in view of the interinstitutional agreement, how do you see the participation of our parliamentary committees?
With regard to the impact assessment, which we called for, it must not turn into automatic justification for the Commissionâs proposal or into justification for doing nothing.
What will happen, also, to the impact assessment on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament?
Finally, with regard to simplification, which is very important, we must take care that it does not lead to deregulation.
Meddling with the Community acquis in the field of social affairs, the environment or consumer protection could lead to social dumping.
We will therefore be very vigilant.
Better law-making does not have to mean fewer laws.
What place is given to standardisation?
The European Parliament draws its legitimacy from codecision.
We must not reduce its legislative power.
Â Â  . Madam President, my answer to the first question is that we will, of course, be happy to take up any suggestions, including those being made in this sitting.
I am able to inform you that I have invited the Member States, the business associations, the consumersâ groups, the trade unions and all members of the European public to submit their own proposals to us, and these have been coming in in their hundreds, many of them very detailed and very precise.
What this tells me is that this project really does enjoy widespread support.
In response to Mrs Frassoniâs question, I would like to say that this is something I have tried to explain.
It strikes me as being an issue of political trust.
As I have said, and as I will emphasise once again, the object of the exercise is not to alter the quality of the in any particular section.
The initiative is not intended to deregulate in the sense in which the radical ideologues of the free market use the term, but to simplify the existing system of legislation, making it more transparent and more user-friendly.
In saying this, I am saying, as I have already said in your hearing on numerous occasions, that the European model actually consists in balancing growth and employment, social cohesion and sustainable development, and that is something of which we are not, of course, going to let go.
Mrs Frassoni can take my word for it: nothing like what she fears will actually happen, and none of the standards we have already achieved will be made less rigorous.
To Mrs GrossetÃªte, I can say that Parliamentâs rights of participation will of course be retained.
I think that one of the consequences of the simplification project will even be that Parliament will be able to avail itself of rights in ways that it could not have done originally, as we will be resubmitting acts that were adopted at a time when there was as yet no codecision in the areas to which they apply.
I believe that what we do will enhance Parliamentâs rights of codecision, and the Commission is of course willing to report to all the committees on what happens.
The whole question of the impact assessment is a difficult one, and one that I did have something to say about.
For its own part, the Commission has decided that it will no longer be making proposals before a comprehensive assessment of the costs resulting from them has been carried out.
Although that is an internal procedure within the Commission, we will present you with the results from it at the same time as we forward proposals to you.
Speaking personally, I take the very definite view that a further impact assessment will of course be needed if the legislator does what it is there to do and makes substantial changes to the Commission proposal.
That, though, is a decision for you yourselves to take, for it is you, and not the Commission, that are the legislative body; if you say that you can adopt an act even without an impact assessment, then that is your decision and your responsibility.
I would, however, advise that we should, together, look for a way in which we can come up with a generally acceptable method of assessing the impact of legislation.
I think we can actually be very proud of the fact that the impact assessment developed by the Commission has an extremely good reputation internationally, and, while I do not believe that you will find anything better anywhere in the public sphere, there is still room for improvement, and that is something we can work on together.
I do indeed agree with Mrs GrossetÃªte that we do not necessarily need less lawmaking, but that lawmaking does need to be better in future.
Let me reiterate that we are talking here about two different things.
One is the great project of simplification, which will indeed result in a marked reduction in the volume â mark well, the quantity, rather than the quality â of the .
The actual result of the other project, the new method whereby we draft legislation, will be a significant increase in its quality, and you, the Members of the European Parliament, being the people who make the laws, will be enabled to arrive at a very precise account of the costs and benefits of every individual decision.
Â Â  Madam President, the Commissioner made his statement in a rather solemn fashion, as if we were witnessing an historic moment, and I think it is one.
Todayâs decision by the Commission is, of course, historic.
It is about the image that the European Union creates and that image will not change unless reality changes, which I believe also to be the case.
He claims that âit is an appetiserâ, but we would be wrong to think that this is merely cosmetic.
I think that the Commissionâs proposals do have teeth.
It is quite extraordinary â with all due respect to the Commissioner â for bureaucracy to come up with proposals for less bureaucracy.
So turkeys may be able to vote for Christmas after all.
The Commissioner is right to give Parliament and the Council some of the responsibility, since it is from this House and the Council that much of the small print in legislation originates.
I think that Mrs GrossetÃªte was also right when she made reference to this: âHow can we prevent this process from continuing?â
We have our own responsibility that we should take quite seriously.
Finally, since you have a website where citizens are invited to add their comments, could you give us an idea, in a nutshell and on a regular basis, of the feedback you get from this?
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement.
We too are in favour of the scrapping of needless or redundant laws, but we do have some concerns, partly fed by the way President Barroso came out shooting from the hip in the on the subject of deregulation.
The main concern for me is the persistent rumour, just repeated by Mrs Lynne, that either now or in the near future the Commission will include the withdrawal of the directive on temporary agency work.
Will you agree with me, Commissioner, that if that happened it would be a major blow to attempts to balance flexibility and security and would damage the balanced pursuit of Lisbon?
Can you assure us that the Commission is not considering the withdrawal of the directive on temporary agency workers?
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen can take it from me that bureaucracy is, of course a slogan guaranteed to get you applause, but a look at his list reveals that it conceals the real object of the exercise, which is the demolition of the welfare state.
If it is indeed the case that the Temporary Workers Directive is to be withdrawn, then that is a slap in the face for social Europe, then we will see âthe working poorâ in Europe, for that means that this aspect will be covered by the Bolkestein Directive, and that Europeâs minimum standards are being eroded.
What I want to know is this: how do you propose to build a social Europe by dismantling minimum social standards in Europe?
Â Â  Madam President, I will answer the first question by saying that we have initiated a public consultation, and you will of course be able to have access to what emerges from it.
I really must say that Mrs Schroedter is wrong in making what is in fact an insinuation.
The withdrawal of proposals that have not even yet been adopted cannot be said to dismantle anything.
It cannot do anything to change what is actually law.
I am talking here about proposals that the European Parliament has not even yet adopted, and the Commission will, in every single instance, be giving a precise explanation of why it is withdrawing them.
I made a point of adding that this does not mean that we will not be bringing these matters back to your House.
As regards temporary workers, we suggest that Parliament should not wind up its deliberations before the Commission has presented more comprehensive economic analyses and an extensive impact assessment.
The proposal has not been withdrawn, and I have no idea whence you have that information.
You must not believe everything you read in the newspapers; I would appreciate it if our deliberations were to relate only to what the Commission has officially communicated to you in its proposal.
What matters is not what the newspapers print, but what the Commission has decided this afternoon.
To Mr Maaten, I want to say I had no intention of making a ceremony of my statement; I mentioned the hour of the day only because I wanted to demonstrate to you that, as soon as the Commission had agreed on its resolution, the European Parliament â and nobody else â was informed about it.
Â Â  That concludes the debate on this item.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0331/2005).
We will be taking a number of questions to the Commission.
Â Â  As CommissionerÂ Kyprianou has been held up by a meeting on precisely this problem, he has asked me to stand in for him, and I am pleased to do so.
I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to restate the commitment we made to inform the European Parliament systematically and transparently on the issue of the spread of infectious animal diseases in Europe.
CommissionerÂ Kyprianou, who is responsible for health and consumer protection, has kept your Parliament informed of the latest developments and of the measures taken by the Commission.
Yesterday evening, he presented the situation regarding animal health to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as he had also done to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 14 September.
The Commissioner has also already provided the honourable Member with information in writing on the action taken by the Commission to control these threats.
The discovery of outbreaks of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease in Asia of course gave rise to fears that these diseases would arrive in the European Union.
All the legal measures needed to prevent the possibility of these diseases being introduced via animals and products of animal origin have already been taken.
These include, in particular, the requirement to inform passengers in international ports and airports of their obligations in this regard.
The Commission uses its regulatory powers to ensure that the existing provisions are continually updated.
It is in this connection that the Member States were recommended to strengthen the application of existing measures and controls at the EUâs borders in order to ensure that only animals and products that meet Community requirements are imported.
As regards vaccination, emergency vaccination is already possible if outbreaks of avian influenza are discovered.
The Commission has proposed a new directive regarding avian influenza.
This proposal will enable us to adopt an approach to vaccination that takes into account the latest scientific developments in knowledge of the disease and the most recent epidemics.
Clearly, we must not forget that vaccination on its own cannot guarantee proper prevention and control of the disease.
With regard to foot-and-mouth disease, similar provisions have already been put in place.
Those are the answers I wished to give on behalf of MrÂ Kyprianou, Madam President.
Â Â  Madam President, I thank the Commissioner and his colleague, Mr Kyprianou, for the response.
There are two points on which I would appreciate a straightforward answer from the Commission.
The Commissioner states that vaccination cannot be prevention, but that means that we should let it happen first before we use the vaccine, while the vaccine is already available.
Poultry already receives 10 different types of vaccines, so why not add one against avian flu?
It exists, we can use it, and it is being produced in the European Union.
So why are poultry farmers and countries not given the opportunity to use it to prevent an outbreak of the disease?
The same applies to legislation.
We have just been talking about the simplification of legislation.
The use of a preventive vaccine would lead to far fewer rules in the EU, and that must surely appeal to the Commission.
Â Â  I did not say that vaccination was not useful.
I am simply saying, and I even stated specifically, that emergency vaccination was already possible if outbreaks of avian influenza were discovered.
We know, of course, that vaccination is a preventative measure but that it is not enough and that we must, at the same time, draw up a whole series of provisions that the draft directive aims to lay down.
That is why I think, MrÂ Maat, that the Commission is not at all reticent with regard to vaccination.
We also hope to develop this vaccination in view of all the scientific data that enable us to increase our knowledge of the disease, but the Commission would like to have a broader provision than simple vaccination to prevent the introduction of this disease into Europe.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to inform MrsÂ Stihler that charter flights are also covered by the scope of Regulation 261/2004.
As such, airlines operating this type of flight are of course obliged to comply with the provisions of that regulation.
From what you said, this was a case of a long delay caused by a crew shortage, and therefore not denied boarding.
In this case, no financial compensation is laid down as it is for denied boarding and cancellations.
Nevertheless, airlines are of course obliged to provide appropriate assistanceÂ âÂ drinks, food, means of communication and hotel rooms, as appropriateÂ â in order to minimise the inconvenience suffered by passengers.
This assistance is compulsory in the case of denied boarding, long delays and cancellations, even if they are due to .
With regard to financial compensation, airlines are only exempted from providing it for cancellations and denied boarding caused by exceptional circumstances.
So, can a crew shortage be considered to be an exceptional circumstance?
This matter must be assessed on an individual basis, in view of all the factual aspects, in particular the organisation of replacements and the availability of reserve crews on site.
MrsÂ Stihler, you will appreciate that, without all those details, the Commission cannot issue a definitive judgment.
However, on the basis of ArticleÂ 16(2) of the regulation, passengers may now complain, if necessary, to national monitoring bodies specially authorised to deal with their complaints and their differences with airlines.
I think that is all I can say, given that the best of regulations cannot cover all specific situations and that such situations need to be assessed case by case, on the basis of all the elements.
In this specific case, it would be necessary to check whether replacement staff were available at the local airport for a return flight or whether organisational provisions were in place.
As I said, though, the passengers in question now have the option of turning to the body set up at national level to deal with their complaints.
Â Â  It is an interesting case.
I find it fascinating that when air stewardesses have colds and cannot travel on an airline there must be immediate backup to cover staff shortages in those circumstances.
So I wonder whether in this case the systems were just not in place.
Only today another Scottish constituent, a Mr Duncan Thorpe, raised the question as to whether a delay of five hours or more entitles him to compensation.
According to the Europa website, where there is a delay of five hours or more the airline must offer to refund the ticket.
Yet the company that replied to my constituent stated, and I quote: 'Regulation (EC) NoÂ 261/2004 does not impose any obligation on carriers to offer or pay compensation when passengers are delayed'.
Can the Commission outline how it is monitoring the successful implementation of this directive?
Thank you for your consideration, Madam President: it is an important matter.
Â Â  . It is clear that this regulation includes an obligation for each Member State to set up an authority capable of investigating requests.
However, this regulation is too recent for me to be able to give you an assessment of its implementation today.
It goes without saying, MrsÂ Stihler, that we will ensure that these new provisions on passenger rights can indeed be implemented in practice; I can assure you that we will see to it that, as of 2006, we will be able to make an assessment that will enable us, where appropriate, MadamÂ President, MrsÂ Stihler, to further strengthen, if need be, the measures taken.
I would stress, however, that we are in the early stages of a policy that aims to provide passengers with a guarantee of new rights.
You must, of course, give us some time to assess the implementation measures and, perhaps, to strengthen or correct them.
Â Â  Commissioner, like the questioner I too have received queries from my constituents.
This is an area that is extremely badly understood by the public.
It is one of the great benefits of Europe which we have recently brought to the public and we should publicise it much better.
I am not suggesting a new directive, but could the 25 Commission information offices in the 25 national capitals not put the details on their websites and print a one-page leaflet providing the public with real information on their rights, which may be obscured by the airlines?
Â Â  . Thank you for your suggestion.
The charter is, of course, already displayed in airports, and it refers to a national body responsible for investigating complaints.
That said, you are right that we need to go further in informing consumers and in this field we need to develop much more specific communications that are much more accessible to all.
I would ask you to be forgiving, because these provisions are new, but I assure you that I personally am seeing to it that the provisions that I proposed and that Parliament and the Council have agreed to adopt will really be applied.
For this to happen, we must indeed inform people.
Thank you for your suggestion and thank you, too, to the author of the question, MrsÂ Stihler, for having given some specific examples.
It is on the basis of these examples that we will gradually create a body of case-law and also achieve better application of the texts.
Â Â  Commissioner, a few weeks ago I underwent the experience of being denied boarding by one of the main European national airlines, and the rights that were read to me then were not in line with the rules approved by this European Parliament.
Does the Commission know which, and how many, Member States have transposed the European legislation and incorporated it into their own legislation, and which, and how many, have not?
Â Â  . Madam President, we are talking about a regulation; consequently, no transposition is required.
To put it simply, you can notify me by letter of the Member State to which you are referring, and I will make every effort to check whether, in this instance, the Member State has indeed set up the body responsible for monitoring the application of the provisions in question.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, first of all, I can well understand the emotion that followed all of those accidents in August.
Obviously the Commission cannot comment on the causes of those accidents: that is a job for the experts.
I would like to say to MrÂ Pafilis that we cannot draw a connection between liberalisation, the opening up of air travel to competition, and any safety issue that could be attributed to this opening up to competition.
It could also be borne in mind that, at the same time as liberalising the internal market in air travel, the Commission strengthened the safety rules.
The Community in the field of aviation safety has grown considerably and changes in safety-related data show that the numbers of accidents and deaths have continued to fall since the launch of the liberalisation process.
This process, at the same time, has made it possible to give many European citizens the option of cheaper air travel.
Having said that, safety is, now more than ever, a top priority for the aviation industry, and monitoring of Community aircraft, which is, of course, the responsibility of the national authorities, which have the freedom to refuse to grant a licence, is a point that we must monitor very carefully.
With regard to pre-flight checks, the provisions in force require Community airlines to comply with very strict safety standards.
The applicable operational regulations have been drawn up by the Joint Aviation Authorities.
These rules specify that an operator shall ensure that all personnel assigned to, or directly involved in, ground and flight operations are properly instructed, have demonstrated their abilities in their particular duties and are aware of their responsibilities and the relationship of such duties to the operation as a whole.
I have quoted rules that could, MadamÂ President, have been expressed in simpler terms, for which I apologise.
I would really like European texts to be simpler, but this is a text by the Joint Aviation Authorities.
What I would like to say, in response to MrÂ Pafilis, is that, since the beginning of February, I have taken the initiative of asking the Council of Transport Ministers about the possibility of drawing up a European list of companies that have been subject to bans or flight restrictions. It has to be said that, due to the cautiousness of the Member States, we have progressed less quickly than I would have liked.
Then, this summer, came the air disasters of which you are aware and to which MrÂ Pafilis referred, and it was at that point that Parliament, presented with this amended proposal for a regulation, adopted, at the proposal of MrsÂ De Veyrac as rapporteur, some extremely positive amendments harmonising the criteria under which a company can be banned or have its flight options restricted. I think that this proposal can now be adopted fairly rapidly, in November.
I will therefore be able to draw up this European blacklist, which, obviously, will enable citizens to be better informed regarding the quality of the air operator they are using.
Then there is the problem of third countries.
The Commission has also worked to institute stricter controls with the famous SAFA Directive.
That is indeed a directive, and it must be transposed in all Member States.
It must be transposed before AprilÂ 2006.
By relying firstly on the draft regulation on the identity of the operator, which includes assessment criteria for companies that will enable us to get started on the blacklist, and also on the SAFA directive, transposed in all the Member States, with regard to the aircraft of third countries, this will give us an instrument that, I hope, will mark a very important step in aviation safety.
Those are the various points I wanted to make to MrÂ Pafilis who, quite rightly, questioned me on the safety of air transport.
Â Â  â Commissioner, if this situation continues until 2020, we shall have one accident a week. In other words, sacrifice of human life for the sake of profit.
This is not our appraisal; it is the appraisal of the International Air Transport Agency.
It is precisely on this point that we consider that the policy of liberalisation, of so-called 'free competition', has created a situation of unaccountability which, among other things, makes victims both of its passengers and the workers themselves.
Both the governments and everyone involved, from either the public sector or the private sector, are fully aware of the state of aircraft, just as they are fully aware of the huge problems which crews face with the pressure exerted on them from changes in labour relations.
You are not doing anything about this; you are doing the opposite.
As I do not have much time, I ask you this: why do you not withdraw the directive which allows checks to be carried out by unlicensed mechanics on the aircraft in question, rather than allowing this practice, which has proven to be a disaster?
Â Â  . MrÂ Pafilis, I do not know which directive you mean.
I would simply repeat that you cannot claim that the European Union has not strengthened safety legislation.
We now have a European Aviation Safety Agency, which is recognised as having the desired authority, including by the US FAA.
My predecessor â and I myself will continue along this path â really did strengthen the whole body of safety legislation.
You are right: we cannot open the aviation industry up to competition without at the same time ensuring that we have a solid regulatory framework regarding safety.
We are, however, making progress, and I would like to pay tribute, MadamÂ President, to the European Parliament, which has helped us a great deal in this matter.
I am very happy to see that we are going to have absolutely identical criteria in all the Member States where, as you know, the civil aviation authorities are responsible for safety.
We will therefore have common criteria that will enable us, with regard both to European companies and companies from third countries, to ascertain that a company cannot transport passengers because it does not provide the necessary security guarantees.
I think that we certainly still have a lot of work to do in this field, but we have already taken a big step forward and I will tell you quite plainly that I am not one of those who will allow competition to become established outside a precise and effective regulatory framework regarding safety.
Â Â  â Commissioner, the report on the Helios aircraft which crashed in Grammatiko is now out: both pilots had heart conditions.
One had heart arteries which were 90% blocked.
In other words, he was almost dead before he died.
That is what happens when small airlines fly without checks being carried out.
We in Greece have Olympic Airways, a company which has not had the slightest accident in 30 years.
You, of course, are sounding its death knell at the moment.
I make a plea on behalf of the Greek people to give Olympic Airways a chance so that we have the security of flying with this airline.
Forget competition.
There may, nonetheless, be a way of securing the survival of this national airline, which is a guarantee for Greece and Europe.
Are you thinking about giving Olympic Airways a chance, Commissioner?
It is, if you like, useful for Greece ...
Â Â  . MrÂ Karatzaferis, I am shortly going to propose extending the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency, which will enable it, in particular, to monitor flight procedures and everything related to the human factor, because you are right that pilots must be properly trained and must be able to pilot aircraft.
This proposal will be tabled shortly and, believe me, we are quite determined to keep a close eye on those companies that do not provide the necessary guarantees.
That will also be the purpose of the blacklist, the updating of which will be greatly facilitated by the work of the European Aviation Safety Agency.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, we have no need for sentimentality and bombast on such a serious issue and we believe that you really do need to get a grip on this problem.
The problem of the safety of air carriers is not going to be resolved with black, yellow, green or red lists.
We really do need to get to the nub of the matter and identify the causes.
This is where you really need to check with your colleagues, especially as you have received a letter to this effect from the parties directly involved and interested, the mechanics responsible for pre-flight checks on aircraft, that the directive of the European Union â the number of which escapes me at the moment â allows for checks to be carried out by employees ...
Â Â  . I would like to remind you that the blacklist concerned, which, I hope, will come into being early in 2006, will result in companies being banned from operating throughout the territory of the European Union.
It is, after all, a very rigorous measure, which means that it will probably have a very dissuasive effect, as companies that do not meet the security standards will know that they risk being put on the blacklist, in other words of being banned from flying over the whole of the European Union.
Recent events have shown that, up until now, there were bans issued by national civil aviation authorities that did not apply over the whole territory of the European Union.
That was obviously not very reassuring for the people of Europe.
However, this step that, I hope, we will take at the beginning of 2006, will give us a guarantee that unreliable companies will feature on the blacklist and will experience all the disadvantages of being banned from flying over the European Union.
Â Â  .
Indeed there is a question about the project data and IT infrastructure for a modern land registry that is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund.
The purpose of this project is to establish a digital database of registered active property rights, which are presently recorded on paper in mortgage offices, together with a spatial reference.
This electronic registry of active titles will certainly offer a valuable service to citizens and business.
We are confident that this project can be completed quickly and quite cheaply.
Also, the project will establish coastal and forest zones according to Greek legislation, where there is a presumption of state ownership of the land except in urban areas.
It will be for the Greek state to pursue its claim to ownership, in the manner it considers appropriate.
The legal validation of active property rights is not included in the project co-financed by the European Union through the ERDF; that action will be financed exclusively from national funds.
In our view that is sufficient explanation for the apparently low level of Community funding for the project to which the honourable Member referred.
The Greek authorities requested an ERDF co-financing rate of 50%, a level that the Commission has approved.
I believe that answers Mr Papadimoulis' basic question.
Â Â  â I thank you, Commissioner, for your reply, but I want to ask you a specific question: on 5 October 2001, the Commissioner responsible at the time, Mr Barnier, announced the conditional continuation of cofinancing for the entire national land register in Greece.
Today, according to your announcements, on the basis of valid calculations, there is only funding of 2.5% of the overall cost of the project, which totals EUR 1.65Â billion.
I ask you therefore: to what do we owe this huge reduction in the Community contribution?
Why is the Commission refusing further funding, as Mr Barnier promised?
Â Â  .
The financing provided by the Commission is EURÂ 40Â million â 50% of this element of the project â which comes under the ERDF co-financing system.
The reason is that the remaining part â the legal validation of the property rights â cannot be included in the co-funded project because the Commission considers this a legal matter and one that is therefore outside the scope of the co-funded project.
As you probably know, the legal framework in this context in Greece is quite unstable: it changes fairly often.
It is therefore the responsibility of the Greeks to finalise the land registries, for which we provide technical instruments through our financing of this project.
It must be said that the legal validation work would consist largely of the work of the lawyers, so that expenditure â which would take the form of lawyers' fees and similar costs â would, in any case, not be eligible for finance from the ERDF.
That is the reason for this low level of financing and why the Commission cannot provide financial assistance for the remaining part of the project.
Â Â  â Madam President, I too join my voice â the voice of opposition against the previous Greek Government â with that of Mr Papadimoulis: his opposition stance is understandable, since he has referred to the year 2001.
The Commissioner is being called on to answer, to clarify why there is no provision for further funding for the land registry project, to clarify the negative aspects of this entire dossier from 2001 onwards.
Of course, I will not omit to say that I consider it important to fund precursor products supporting the land register, supporting the land registrations which will follow.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I should say one more thing to help explain why the level of funding is so low.
We should bear in mind that this project will generate revenues; Greek citizens will have to pay a fee when requesting the certificates.
That was one of the factors that prevented us from offering higher cofinancing.
You referred to something that took place in 2001 and I am not sure that I remember it correctly.
There was a previous land registry project in Greece which was a failure â if I may put it that strongly â and that is why the Commission decided to recover the full amount of the contribution.
We then started to reach agreement on the second project when we identified the part of the project which we could finance without any doubts or problems.
I understand that there are many concerns, which you have expressed here.
I can offer to look into it more deeply and, with my colleagues in the DG, to see whether this limited participation is justified on the evidence available.
At this stage, that is all I can offer.
I will ask to be informed once more about all the details that prompted this funding level of EURÂ 40 million.
That is all I can say at the moment.
Â Â  â Commissioner, you are considered to be a responsible and serious politician in our country.
We have the following problem with the land registry: it cost 26 times more than planned. Less land, more money, including European Union money.
The question is straightforward.
The issue is debated frequently in parliament and raised in the Greek press: do you intend to ask the Greek Government to prosecute those who took this money?
Do you intend to ask that those who stole the money from the Greek people and the European Union go to court and submit their defence?
Â Â  .
I am planning to go to Greece on or around 20 October, when the Commission will certainly look into any potential irregularities, with the authorities.
I have not been informed of any irregularities with regard to this project, but the matter will certainly be investigated, just to be on the safe side.
Â Â  .
You ask whether we have received a letter from the Greek authorities containing the information to which you allude.
I can tell you that the Commission has not received such a letter, but we have discussed the forecasts for payment with Greece, as we do with all the Member States several times a year.
In the context of our discussions with Greece on the forecast for payments in 2005 we noticed the potential risk of an absorption shortage by the end of the year.
Both the Greek Government and the Commission are aware of that potential risk.
That is why, back in July, the Director General of DG Regio, Mr Graham Meadows, wrote to the Greek Government concerning the N+2 payments and cohesion fund commitment targets for the year.
After that letter was sent a meeting was held â around a week ago â between the Greek authorities and the Commission.
As I mentioned, I am planning my own visit and will discuss this issue when I meet representatives of the Greek Government in October.
It is my understanding, from the meetings the services have had, that there is a clear commitment not only on our part but also on that of Greece to do everything possible to avoid any decommitment this year, although such a risk does exist.
Â Â  â Madam President, we are talking about the loss of one-third of the third support package.
This was also said by the Commissioner who was responsible several years ago and who is now in the Greek Parliament.
There is a letter from the Minister of Economic Affairs to the prime minister of Greece in which there is talk of such an extensive loss.
Have you investigated why Greece is behind?
Why can it not take up money, especially at a time when it has a 6% deficit and needs every last euro?
Why does Greece find it so easy to reject several billion euros?
What is the reason?
Have you any information on the matter?
Â Â  .
We know that the Greeks need funds, as indeed do other Member States which use our funds, and as soon as I was informed there were problems with absorption capacity we worked very closely with the authorities to help as much as we could on the Commission side to solve the problem.
Nevertheless, one should also take into account the fact that this year still has some months to run, so if there is full involvement â which I believe there is on the Greek side â we can try to avoid losing the funds within this year's allocation for Greece.
It is too premature to talk about concrete figures because my experience of the last one-and-a-half months of last year, when I took over at the end of November, was that the last months of the year usually see a huge mobilisation of funds in most of the Member States when they are able to catch up.
That means there are still three months left to ensure an adequate absorption of funds in Greece.
All I can do is make the commitment that we will work hard with the authorities on this issue and on the basis of the figure I was presented with by the DG, my feeling is that the figure is well below the one mentioned in the question by the honourable Member.
Nevertheless, at this stage I am reluctant to mention those figures because I believe that the Greek authorities and the Greeks who need the money will do their best to spend the money properly in the months to come.
As you know, for the structural funds the amount which might be at risk is the amount allocated in 2003 because now the N+2 comes automatically at the end of this year, and within the 2003 allocation we have not only ERDF, but also Social Fund and EAGGF funding.
It is not for me to impose rapid action on the Greek authorities, but insofar as we can impose and mobilise we are doing so.
We are holding meetings at all levels and our missions are very often to Greece.
Colleagues are working at a current operational level, but they are also very active in helping overcome any difficulties which have accumulated over years.
Things like this do not happen overnight, but are usually the outcome of longer-term processes.
We are trying to address the problems we have uncovered this year and help the Greeks.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, is it not the case that the previous Greek Government amassed a huge debt potential, and that is why Greece now has problems fulfilling the Stability and Growth Pact?
Â Â  .
I cannot say so with 100% certainty, but my feeling is that it is not so much co-financing problems as the national contribution to the funds which makes it difficult for the Greek projects to be finalised properly.
There have probably been a series of flaws, but I am not prepared today to give more information on the real reasons for the problems.
As I said, these are usually whole processes, but we have certainly not identified any one single factor responsible for the lack of financial means to co-finance the projects.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply and the spirit of your reply.
Nonetheless, I should like to ask you: can you tell me, on the basis of requests for payment so far, what the total take-up rate is for the Greek Community Support Framework?
Similarly, you replied to me a few days ago in writing, saying that you were expecting Greek proposals on an interim review of the overall programme by the end of September.
Have you received them?
Thirdly, following your trip to Greece, when do you estimate that the cooperation of the Commission with the Greek authorities on the review of the Community Support Framework will be completed?
Â Â  .
I am not sure whether I heard all the questions, but normally if we receive the project proposals by the end of October we should safely be able to allocate the funds towards the end of the year.
Therefore, there is still some time to go, which is why I am saying that it is too early to judge today which â if any â funds would probably not be taken up, especially since it is always possible that there may be an excellent project that will consume the rest of the 2003 allocations before the end of this year.
Let me tell you that there is certainly no lack of willingness to cooperate with the Commission.
As you may remember, in the first half of the year we managed to resolve an enormously difficult problem.
We managed to find a solution, we managed to finalise negotiations that were extremely difficult and painful for both sides.
However, the commitment on both sides was strong enough to resolve the problem, which was of a historical nature.
Today we are working more on a current basis, but all the necessary efforts are being made on both sides and that makes me feel optimistic that we will resolve this problem.
I cannot make any commitments on behalf of the Greek Government, however; I can only offer the help that we are offering.
Â Â  Â There has been mention of the budget for 2007-13.
As the honourable Member will be aware, this is the subject of an interinstitutional agreement and also the subject of negotiations between the three institutions on the basis of a proposal tabled by the Commission.
The Commission is involved in negotiations but nonetheless it defends its own proposal, if I may use that verb.
The Commission has no power when it comes to deciding how a potential reduction of the total budget amount is to be distributed, and it cannot take decisions on how budget cuts are to be spread across the individual headings within the framework of cohesion policy.
Each global cut of this nature leads to adjustments of components of the whole budget too.
I can, however, state that in June the Luxembourg Presidency proposed a budget for cohesion policy that was 10% less than the Commissionâs proposal.
The proposal envisaged a disproportionate impact on the individual objectives of cohesion policy.
ObjectiveÂ I, involving the poorest regions, suffered a 6% cut.
ObjectiveÂ II, intended to help create more competitive regions and provide new jobs, suffered a budget cut of about 18%.
The most drastic cuts concerned Objective III, which relates to European territorial cooperation, that is, to cohesion.
For ObjectiveÂ III the cuts amounted to 50%.
I am referring to a reduction in relation to the Commissionâs proposal.
In principle this would have a disproportionate impact on the so-called old and new Member States, as 80% of the cuts would affect the 15 older Member States and the remaining 20% would affect the countries that have recently acceded to the Union.
This is all I can say about the Commissionâs involvement in decisions concerning budget cuts.
Â Â  Â I am taking the floor to prove that Greek Members are not the only ones to attempt to debate with the Commissioner.
Thank you for your response, CommissionerÂ HÃŒbner.
It was competent, detailed and to the point.
In my question I tried to convey the concerns felt by many Members as to how regional policy will fare in the framework of the new budget.
I shall leave it at that, President, to prove to you that there are some male Members of this House who are capable of finishing on time so you do not need to resort to the ghastly device you have before you.
Â Â  .
There was no further question there for me to respond to.
Â Â  Commissioner, will you look at the speech made yesterday by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in which he lauded various achievements over recent years in developing parts of the United Kingdom?
The one thing common to all the examples he gave was that they had all been part-financed by the European Regional Development Fund.
In that context, will you use that information in your negotiations with the Council to try to push up the amount of money available in the 2007-2013 financial perspective?
Â Â  .
Thank you for that information.
In this context I should like to say two things.
Firstly, the UK is a source of best practices in Europe when it comes to regional policy and the way funds are used.
I have visited many science and business parks.
You have wonderful partnerships at local level and achieve unbelievably good results, very often from a tiny catalytic contribution coming from the Structural Funds.
Wherever you go â not only in Scotland, Wales or Cornwall, but also in other regions of the UK â you can find excellent examples of this type of best practice.
We are also using the UK experience to help us to become more innovative in terms of financial engineering, and the British experience will also be widely used for the events which we will have with the British next month on financial engineering.
Secondly, we all need a decision on the budget, but it should be appreciated that in the meantime we can work together with the British on all other avenues â regulations, programming and also on those innovative proposals for initiatives for the future of the funds.
However, it would be good to have the decision on the budget under the British Presidency.
Â Â  Commissioner, your colleague Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ stated publicly that if the EU fails to reach an agreement on the financial perspective this year during the British Presidency, then the new Member States of the EU would be unable to receive the full level of assistance from the structural and cohesion funds as planned.
Do you agree with that prediction?
Â Â  .
It is no secret that this policy needs time to be launched.
We estimate that from the moment the decision on the budget is made we will need about 18 months to launch the new generation of cohesion programmes and projects.
Looking at it from this point of view, now is really the last moment for the decision to be made on the budget, as we are already short of time.
That is absolutely clear.
The problem is that once the decision is made and we complete all the other necessary procedures, then we have to negotiate the programmes â the national framework and the operational programmes â and then the Member States have to prepare themselves for the launch of the programmes and projects.
If we start the projects in January 2007 â which is now quite unlikely â then there is less time to absorb the money, so the amount of money will just depend on the decision, whenever it is made.
The decision will give the money, but how much time we will have to absorb the money is the worrying factor.
If the perspective is shortened because of the delayed decision on the Financial Perspective, then the Member States and regions â old and new â will have less time and there is a risk that some money will be lost.
It is in the case of this policy that the risk is highest.
Â Â  Questions NosÂ 45 and 46 will be answered in writing(1).
Â Â  .
I am satisfied that there is no conflict of interest in relation to the study that the Commission has commissioned.
I am satisfied with the independence and integrity of the work of the contractor, the Swiss Institute, and the sub-contractor, the Centre for the Study of Gambling at Salford University.
The relationship with contributing companies to which the honourable Member refers is one that is common to university departments throughout the world.
I am assured that donations from contributing companies, whether they be bookmakers or national lotteries, are unconditional donations.
I am satisfied with the declaration of the absence of conflict of interest given to the Commission.
I can assure the honourable Member that my services will give the fullest attention to how this study is carried out and will ensure that the contractor fully meets the award criteria set out in the tender specifications.
The honourable Member refers to, and I quote, 'the indisputable impact that the study will have on the rules governing the gambling sector in the future'.
Firstly I would like to remind the honourable Member that the study, which is looking at a wide variety of gambling services, will report factually on the various laws applicable in the Member States and on economic aspects.
This is a fact-finding exercise and the contractor will not advise the Commission on its future policy options.
Finally, I can assure the honourable Member that I will not be taking any policy decisions purely on the basis of this study.
The study will assist us all in gaining a better understanding of the issues involved, but it is my intention to consult fully before taking any decision.
The report of the contractor will be given to all interested parties and will be published on the Commission's website.
In addition, the contractor's findings will be the subject of a public hearing, which is scheduled to take place in early November, at which the views of the interested parties, including the honourable Member, will be most welcome.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your very precise answer.
I would simply like to stress that you have not denied the facts contained in my question and that it is precisely those facts that are particularly concerning.
Even if the Swiss Institute for Comparative Lawâs study is just a preliminary study on all systems, it is quite clear that contracting all the economic aspects to a university centre with companies such as Stanley Leisure, Gala Group, London Clubs International or the Camelot Group on its administrative board is nevertheless, in my opinion, far from being as objective as it should be.
Â Â  .
I do not agree with the honourable Member.
It is quite common for universities and centres of excellence to have funding from particular bodies.
There is no conflict of interest when that particular university carries out a study.
I do not accept that it is any different in this case.
The contractor has given various assurances.
I would point out to the honourable Member that the Camelot Group, which runs the UK National Lottery, is also listed as a sponsor.
So Salford is sponsored by both a private sector operator and an operator with a state monopoly.
Therefore I do not accept that they are in any way conflicting.
This is going to be a factual study; it will help the Commission in its deliberations; it will be put on the website; there will be a hearing in November to which all interested parties will be invited, including the honourable Member.
We will then reach our final decisions thereafter.
This is a fact-finding exercise.
Â Â  Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the robustness of your response.
I wonder if you would agree with me that the Centre for the Study of Gambling in Manchester is a reputable academic institution that takes no moral position on gambling, either for or against.
It simply looks at the psychological roots of gambling and its economic and social impact, and does so in an independent and academic fashion.
Â Â  .
On the basis of the information available to me I can agree with the honourable Member and, until it is proved otherwise, this particular institute has the highest reputation.
Â Â  .
In my previous reply to the honourable Member, I stated that the Commission is prepared to examine the legislation in question on the basis of more specific information.
While the Commission has not received specific complaints regarding the Austrian legislation, I would remind the honourable Member of the study which has been commissioned to report on all the national rules applicable to the various forms of gambling services.
This study is due to be completed by the end of this year and I expect it to include a legal and economic review to help us all better understand the complex issues involved and to inform us of the laws applicable in the Member States, including Austria.
I repeat my invitation to the honourable Member to provide us with more details or practical examples of the problems Slovenian gaming operators have experienced in advertising their activities.
Such information would assist the Commission in establishing whether infringement proceedings should be opened.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your comprehensive answer.
We will be only too happy to provide you with concrete examples of discrimination whereby certain Austrian companies are refusing to run advertising for gaming establishments in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia, since they are forbidden from doing so by their national legislation.
Material evidence of this exists, and we will notify you of all such evidence as soon as possible.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Â Â  .
I thank the honourable Member for what he is going to do.
I invite him to contact the Commission so that a meeting can be set up with him.
Perhaps the matter could be further pursued then.
That would be one way of proceeding.
Â Â  .
The Commission has the greatest sympathy for the many thousands of policy-holders and pensioners who have suffered severe financial loss as a result of the serious problems encountered by the Equitable Life insurance company.
The Commission has no direct role in the supervision of individual insurance undertakings.
That is the responsibility of each Member State and is, in practice, carried out by the supervisory authorities appointed for that purpose.
The United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, recognising certain weaknesses in the former regime and responding to criticisms in the Penrose report, has launched a major reform of the regulation of life insurance undertakings.
In part this reflects the lessons learned from the Equitable Life affair.
As regards the payment of compensation where national supervision has failed, redress can only be sought before the national courts of the Member State in question.
With respect to the Community regime for the insurance and pension sector, the Commission is currently working on the Solvency II project, the aim of which is to achieve over time a more harmonised risk-based system for the supervision and prudential regulation of all insurance undertakings across the European Union.
The Commission is also continuing its exploratory work with the Member States on insurance guarantee schemes that could deal with situations where an insurance undertaking fails and is unable to meet its commitments to policy-holders and beneficiaries.
It should be noted, however, that Equitable Life did not enter into liquidation and continues to operate as an authorised insurance undertaking, albeit one that is closed to new business.
As far as the banking sector is concerned, the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive already obliges Member States to set up schemes which offer a minimum guarantee level of EURÂ 20Â 000 to depositors, although the threshold is higher in a number of Member States.
The Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive is in the process of being reviewed in order to ensure that it is still in line with market developments.
Concerning the proposal for a directive on services in the internal market, the Commission would like to recall that financial services are excluded from the scope of application of the services proposal.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the services proposal includes provisions strengthening consumer protection.
In particular, Article 27 requires Member States to ensure that providers whose services present a direct and particular risk to the health and safety of the recipient or a third person, or to the financial security of the recipient, would be obliged to take out professional indemnity insurance.
Â Â  .
More than one million Europeans, including over 15Â 000 non-UK residents and many vulnerable pensioners suffered real losses totalling EURÂ 5 billion to their prudently built-up retirement savings in 2001, allegedly due to what has been termed 'serial UK regulatory failure' and not due to falls in the stock market.
The Commission has claimed that it is unnecessary for it to investigate the UK's national implementation since it finds that the UK is compliant today.
This does nothing to redress the issue.
Will the Commissioner investigate the case thoroughly with a view to instigating Court of Justice proceedings against the UK in this case?
Â Â  .
There is long-established European Court of Justice jurisprudence in this area.
The situation is as I outlined previously in response to a question regarding another insurance undertaking in the United Kingdom.
The Commission is not in a position to pursue the matter in the way that the honourable Member and other Members of the House would like it to, because it is not the way the Commission can do things.
The European Court of Justice only finds in relation to the way a directive has been transposed and the situation as it is at the present time.
It is for policy-holders who have been affected by any change to pursue those issues through their own national courts.
I have given this reply in response to previous questions in this generally related area and that remains the position.
Â Â  I thank you for your reply, Commissioner, but can you tell me how one is meant to have confidence in the single market if Equitable Life can get away with treating ordinary people in this way?
This was not due to a fall in the stock market but to serial failure in regulation. That is the allegation that has been made.
How can people across Europe be asked to take a single market seriously if the Commission washes its hands in this way?
Â Â  .
Irrespective of where my sympathies might lie in this area, the role of the Commission is to ensure that the United Kingdom is currently in conformity with the relevant EU legislation.
The Commission cannot make any pronouncement on the content and application of the former regulation regime which has been replaced.
The Commission has consistently acted in full conformity with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice on the role and purpose of infringement proceedings.
The objective of such proceedings under EU law is to establish or restore the compatibility of existing national law with EU law, and not to rule on the possible past incompatibility of a national law, which has since been amended or replaced.
That is the established jurisprudence on those issues and remains the situation.
Â Â  Since we are behind schedule, I shall have to stop the discussion of this topic here, and so Questions NosÂ 50 to 53 will be answered in writing(2).
Â Â  . The Commission can confirm to the honourable Member that it has received an application from the Czech Republic to register 'Karlovarske oplatky' as a protected destination of origin according to Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2081/92.
This application is under examination by the Commission under the terms of the regulation.
At this stage the Commission cannot take into account any information or material from third parties that is not contained in the application itself.
If the Commission concludes that the application meets the requirements for registration, the name and a summary of the specification will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This allows any party with a legitimate interest to lodge an objection to the registration with their Member State.
Any Member State may object to the registration within six months of publication, following which the Commission will invite the authorities of the Member States concerned to discuss the issue and seek agreement on the dossier.
However, if the Commission concludes in its initial examination that the application does not meet the terms of the regulation, it will take a formal decision not to publish the application.
Therefore, the strict answer to the honourable Member's question is that at the initial stage the Commission will only take into account matters contained in the application.
However, if the Commission decides to publish the application there will be an opportunity for the producers referred to by the honourable Member to object to the registration.
Â Â  Commissioner, I do think that the Commission should also consider information from Parliament.
Karlsbad Wafers were produced and sold in Karlsbad and Marienbad.
They were invented at the Tepl monastery.
They were being produced and sold worldwide back in the 19th and 20th centuries, and nowadays the best Karlsbad Wafers in the world are produced in Dillingen an der Donau by a company called Wetzel.
Take a look at me; you can tell that I know a thing or two about food, and I can confirm that they are the best Karlsbad Wafers.
I would therefore implore you to examine whether it is really possible to narrow down geographically a designation that is so international and European in nature.
Our European culture would be poorer as a result.
Â Â  .
In the circumstances I had expected to be able to sample these extremely delicious waffles, but that might be for another occasion.
I can only repeat that if the Commission decides to publish the application, there is a possibility for the different Member States to go into the matter within a fixed period.
If that should be the outcome, then you have that possibility.
I am quite sure that this will be followed up later on.
Â Â  I can provide confirmation from across the group divide that those wafers are indeed very good.
Perhaps MrÂ Posselt should bring one along for the Commissioner.
Â Â  .
The Commission can confirm to the honourable Member that it has received an application from the Czech Republic to register 'pravÃ© olomoucke tvarÅ¯ÅŸky' as a protected geographical indication.
As for what to do, whether the Commission takes a decision to follow up these ideas, or whether to just leave it as it is, the explanation is exactly the same, and to save time at this late stage I would simply suggest that there is a possibility to come back to this.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, the Commissioner herself has said that the application by the Czech Republic concerns âgenuine OlmÃŒtzer Quargelâ.
In my opinion, this is accurate.
This would also make it clear â particularly as âOlmÃŒtzer Quargelâ is produced in other Member States, too, of course â that this is simply a generic designation.
This would not pose any problems from the point of view of Austria or Germany, the countries in which these producers from the former Czechoslovakia have settled, as the relevant distinction would be rendered by the term âgenuineâ OlmÃŒtzer Quargel.
Â Â  .
I am quite aware of the reasons why this is produced outside the original triangle, but I can only recommend that you try to use the possibilities available in the legislation if this should not turn out as you wish it to in the end.
Â Â  .
The Commission is aware that the Polish soft fruit sector has had major problems in the last two years, owing to the low prices of several of the products in question.
Following the Presidency's conclusions concerning the simplification of the common organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables in November 2004, the Commission started several months ago to carry out an analysis of the Community market for soft fruit intended for processing, with a view to making appropriate proposals to address the specific problems.
As part of those investigations, missions were organised to several Member States. In Poland, these took place in April and July.
The work will be completed by the end of the year and will be published by the Commission at the beginning of 2006.
Obviously, it will be necessary to await the conclusions of this work before starting discussions on any possible measures.
In addition, at Poland's request, the Commission has initiated a safeguard investigation concerning the import of frozen strawberries.
The investigation is ongoing and no conclusion has been drawn at this stage.
Â Â  Â Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking the Commission and you personally for taking such an interest in this problem, which is a very serious one for Poland.
My main concern is the length of the decision-making process.
We first drew attention to this problem back in 2004.
Unfortunately, another year has gone by and things got worse rather than better in 2005.
I have a question for you, Commissioner.
Will it be possible to resolve this problem before the start of the 2006 harvest?
Â Â  .
Work on the report started back in April 2005 and since then investigations have been carried out in the major countries concerned: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland and the United Kingdom.
Two missions to Poland were undertaken during the harvest period.
The report is being prepared on the basis of the information collected during these missions, together with statistical data.
It will cover in detail the four major European sub-sectors: strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and cherries for processing.
Possible measures will be included in the Commission communication on the proposal for reform of the fruit and vegetable sector, scheduled to be discussed in the second part of 2006.
Â Â  .
Thank you, because it is very nice to know where the question is coming from.
The Commission forwarded to the European Parliament indicative information on the breakdown of CAP direct payments by Member State, the size of payments, and types of farms in 2000 and 2001.
It can be seen from those data that there are great disparities in the size of payments for farmers in many of our Member States.
Since aid applications are made by the farmer, defined as a person whose holding is situated within Community territory and who exercises an agricultural activity, the Commission does not receive data concerning land ownership or the aristocratic status of the beneficiary.
In any case, since it is bound to ensure the confidentiality of these individual data, the Commission is not in a position to make available or to publish the names of beneficiaries of aid from the EAGGF Guarantee Section.
The reason for the variation in distribution of the direct payments is connected with historical production.
Since the 1992 CAP reform, the original price support policy has been replaced by a policy aiming at greater competitiveness.
The shifts in policy have been achieved by the gradual reduction of the EU support prices and compensation for farmers for the consequent revenue loss in the form of direct payments.
Owing to the fact that those direct payments were first introduced by coupling them mainly to production factors through per hectare payments and reference yields in the arable sector, and to headage in the livestock sector, those farmers with larger farms or greater livestock numbers received more compensation in the form of direct payments.
During the debates held on all the different changes to the CAP in the 1992 reform and Agenda 2000, and again in the discussions on CAP reform in 2003, the Commission actually proposed a so-called capping of the direct payments to farmers and, as far as I remember, the latest discussions on this issue back in 2003 proposed a cap of EURÂ 300Â 000 for each beneficiary.
At the end of the day, however, the Council and the Member States rejected this proposal and it is therefore not part of the current CAP reform.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Commissioner for her response.
I understand very well that the Commission cannot make data available concerning beneficiaries, but I think it is still important, in the interest of all of us, that we should insist on that information being publicised. It will make policy so much more transparent and make the common agricultural policy so much easier to defend.
Secondly, I would like to say to the Commissioner that, following in the UKâs footsteps, the Netherlands has now also publicised the data.
These data confirm that most of the European agricultural subsidies end up where they should not, namely in the hands of large industrial companies such as NestlÃ© and Heineken.
How much longer can the Commission tolerate this?
Â Â  .
When the figures are published, both the direct payment to the farmer and the export refunds to big companies are of course part of these figures.
You are quite right that it is not in my hands to publish these figures, because they are not the Commission's figures.
That is the reason.
Of course I have noticed that certain Member States have decided to publish these figures, among others the countries you named and the country I know best.
We are preparing our website, the DG Agriculture website, to provide a link to the different Member States.
That is the only way that we can put 'soft' pressure on the Member States to publish these figures.
Â Â  Commissioner, I have to say that I find your answer utterly unsatisfactory.
For the period between 2005 and 2009, the Commission made transparency into one of its strategic objectives.
Commissioner Kallas stated very clearly in two speeches, one in Nottingham and one in Berlin, that money that is allocated via agriculture, among others, is the taxpayersâ money and that citizens ought to know where it ends up.
Mr Kallas states quite explicitly that Member States must make information concerning beneficiaries of European funds available to the public, so I see a contradiction between your statement here and what was said by your fellow-Commissioner Mr Kallas.
I would like to know, Commissioner, whether you will help ensure that Member States are required to make information of this kind available to the public, in accordance with Mr Kallasâ intention.
Â Â  .
I have always been in favour of transparency.
That is why we have been looking into ways of how to make Member States publish these figures.
At present I am not in a position to do that, but I am working in close cooperation with my colleague, Commissioner Kallas, to see what can be done.
Naturally, we cannot break the rules or breach legislation. That would cause huge problems.
But we are looking into this matter and we are trying, via the link to our website, to show everyone that we want to see the Member States publish these figures.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, does it not more closely reflect reality to say that there are both large and small farms, which developed by tradition?
Is it not the case that these large farms are the same rural businesses that employ a very large workforce?
I should just like to point out that agriculture in my home Member State is structured on a small scale, yet, back inÂ 1999, Austria was in favour of this modulation, this phasing-in schedule.
Unfortunately, it did not win through, however, as first Germany and then the United Kingdom opposed it.
Â Â  .
When we last had discussions on trying to find a compromise political agreement on the CAP reform in 2003, there were various discussions on how to target the payments to different types.
Two ideas were put forward.
One of them was accepted by the Council and that was the idea of taking all the smaller farms out of the system â those receiving less than EUR 5Â 000 with this franchise.
They do not contribute to the modulation.
When we have to reduce a direct payment to the farmers afterwards because we hit the ceiling of the Brussels Agreement, these smaller enterprises will not be hit.
We have taken into consideration the possibility of not targeting the smaller farms when we talk about reducing the direct payment.
Â Â  QuestionsÂ Nos 58 to 96 will be answered in writing(5).
Â Â  Madam President, on a point of order, did you expend the full 20 minutes on oral questions to Commissioner Fischer Boel?
Â Â  Yes, we did.
We have already overrun by several minutes, and I should like to give our interpreters, too, the chance to have a break.
That is why I announced a short while ago that we were unable to continue dealing with a question.
I had hoped that you had heard me.
That concludes Question Time.


Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, other colleagues from my group will be taking the floor in this debate, in particular my colleague Erik Meijer.


For my part, I will confine my contribution to explaining the thinking behind our amendment rejecting the proposal for a directive inappropriately entitled, âthe development of the Communityâs railwaysâ.
We wholeheartedly believe that it is high time to overhaul the organisation of the transport sector on our continent.
This should be done in accordance with the criteria that our fellow citizens value: safety, the environment, social and territorial cohesion, the public service, and their corollary, high standards of harmonised social regulation for the workers concerned.
The sectorâs unions have some very carefully worked out proposals on all of these aspects.
They should be our natural partners when planning and implementing this kind of project.
In this context, the aspiration to achieve a more balanced use of rail â and, moreover, inland waterways â is in every respect legitimate and Europe is of course a relevant arena in which to address these issues.
The question is as follows: what is there to say that achieving such objectives should at all costs require all-out liberalisation of the rail transport sector?
This would at the very least merit a serious evaluation of the various different experiences with this model so far and the initial impact of opening up to competition before any new measures are taken.
That is moreover what Parliament explicitly demanded when the first railway package was adopted.
This express request has never been met. Why not?
For example, not a word has been said about the disastrous consequences of rail privatisation in the United Kingdom.
You pass very swiftly, MrÂ Barrot, over the fact that the first private train in France, owned by Connex, is not carrying any additional traffic, but is happy to occupy a place held until now by the public company SNCF.
Neither is any mention made of the decline in the diversity of services offered in the freight transport sector, or of the fact that passenger routes that are deemed to be unprofitable have been abandoned with a view to the opening up to competition.
What is more, there is barely a murmur about projects which have a real chance of improving European transport, such as the Lyon-Turin link, being blocked.
No! We liberalise and that is all there is to it.
It is this dogmatism of âmarkets everywhereâ that our group is protesting against.
We do so in a bid to reiterate the demand for a public and pluralist assessment of the experiences so far and to express our preferred choice of cooperation and not competition in the rail transport sector in Europe. Our group calls on all of our Members to vote in favour of Amendment 14, which rejects the proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of rail transport.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, my main remarks are on the reports by MrÂ Savary and MrÂ ZÄ«le, for which I was my groupâs shadow rapporteur, and I wish to thank both rapporteurs, who have each been working under very different conditions, for their efforts. Mr Savaryâs report concerns a proposal that almost everyone supports, while MrÂ ZÄ«le had the job of getting backing for a proposal by the Commission that only very few people are interested in.
My group is satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the committee, where the proposal for compensation in connection with freight transport was rejected. That is not the same as saying that we see no problems with the quality of freight transport by train.
Unfortunately, there is a lot to suggest that the quality is not improving and that, in certain areas, it is perhaps even on the decline. Lack of punctuality and flexibility mean that, directly contrary to all political intentions, freight transport by train is falling behind.
The question, then, is: how are we to solve this problem?
The Commissionâs proposal was too clumsy and out of step with the conditions in a free market. However, MrÂ ZÄ«le deserves recognition for his attempt to find a solution other than a flat rejection, even if â as I assume it will be when we vote tomorrow â the result is just such a rejection.
I am in no doubt that, as liberalisation and free competition progressively take root, train services will become more efficient and we shall see better value for money and a greater focus on passengers.
We shall see better quality than that delivered by the national monopolies, and I find it thought-provoking that the number of passenger miles travelled by train in Great Britain, which has of course done a lot of liberalising over the last ten years, has increased by as much as 40%.
I also find it thought-provoking that those countries that invest single-mindedly in modern railway services using high-speed trains also see those services making progress at a time when trains are otherwise losing ground in many countries.
Liberalisation is therefore important as well as investment if, regarding not only freight transport but also passenger transport, we are to guarantee railway services an increased market share.
It is also important that we speed up the process.
The common framework for the training of train crews is, of course, a logical consequence of the liberalisation that has already been agreed. MrÂ Savaryâs report is therefore the least controversial of those relating to the third railway package.
The big debate has of course been about who is to be covered by the Directive on the certification of train crews.
Shall it be train drivers only, or other staff too?
Shall it be exclusively those involved in international rail services or also those involved in purely national services?
My group is generally satisfied with the result we now have.
A suitable balance has been found whereby train drivers and other staff directly involved in safety are included. It was a wise decision to have the rules initially cover international train services.
Once we have used a cost-benefit analysis in order carefully to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, we can then, in time, look at whether staff involved in purely national services should be included. Where drivers are concerned, this is, of course, expensive training we are faced with, so it is important that we do not impose unnecessary costs on the train companies.
Last but not least, I want, for my own part, to say how very pleased I am that Parliamentâs proposed third railway package welcomes the liberalisation of passenger transport and introduces common rules for passengersâ rights which apply to all passengers and which, in addition, are much simpler and much less bureaucratic than the Commissionâs proposal.
MrÂ Savary also asks what is to be done about the small countries.
I myself come from a small country in which free competition for railway services has progressively been introduced and in which the national railway company, DSB, is in competition at home and, at the same time, now operates in Sweden and has been given permission to offer routes in Great Britain. DSB has equipped itself for free competition through modernisation and through the reorganisation of its activities so that the old monopolistic and statist culture has been replaced by a modern business culture that places more focus on the passenger.
That is the way forward.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for being given the floor and would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski and the other Members who contributed to the work on the whole railway package.

In particular, I should like to refer to the drafting of the report on the proposal for a directive on the development of the Communityâs railways.
In the course of our work in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, many negative opinions were expressed concerning the dates and programme proposed by the rapporteur for opening up passenger services for competition.
I made my views known on those occasions, as I am familiar with the condition of the railways in the new Member States and am aware that they are inadequately prepared to compete with large and powerful Western European countries in the open market.
I am not opposed to liberalisation of the transport market, but I would argue for fair competition. Allow me to reiterate that I am not against the liberalisation of services so long as it is fairly done.
Provisions must be put in place to protect small undertakings and also to ensure monopolies do not arise in the future and that the major players in this field are exposed to healthy and fair competition.
For all these reasons I believe that Parliament should not support MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs proposal to bring liberalisation of the market forward to 2008.
I have in mind the opening up of international transport, including cabotage.
We should not back this proposal if we genuinely wish to implement the Unionâs policy of equal rights and fair competition, which would allow the new Member States time to come up to the standards of experienced undertakings in Germany, England and France.
As Vice-Chairman of the European Parliamentâs Committee on Transport and Tourism, I appeal to the House to support the original European Commission proposal regarding dates and programmes for liberalisation namely opening up international transport without cabotage from 2010. I also call on the House to reject MrÂ Jarzembowskiâs report, because the proposal voted through in the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerning opening up this market did not take account of the situation in the new Member States.
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the debates on the Constitutional Treaty over the last few months suggest that the European Union ought to take its citizensâ interests into account when adopting legal provisions. It would also be appropriate to review existing legal instruments and assess the consequences of their implementation, including the financial consequences.
The European Commission proposed liberalising international passenger transport services from 2010.
In his document, MrÂ Jarzembowski suggests bringing the date forward by two years, so that liberalisation would begin in 2008.
This would result in undertakings currently active in Poland or in other new Member States losing a significant part of the market.
These countries are suffering from under-investment in railway infrastructure and they lack modern rail equipment.
Regional rail transport has been under-financed too.
A further reduction of the transitional period for international transport will aggravate the negative effect of the new provisions on transport companies in the new Member States. This is because current arrangements for European funding to purchase modern rolling stock for passenger transport are inadequate, and the countries that joined the Union on 1Â MayÂ 2004 are not in a position to disburse the large sums required themselves.
Union citizens will benefit from the liberalisation of services in the long term.
At present, however, it is important to get the technical quality right and the appropriate infrastructure in place.
This requires the new Member States to undertake some unusually expensive action involving restructuring and investment.
It is therefore necessary to retain the five-year period proposed by the Commission, so as to allow the conditions for competition on the European transport market to even out.
We should grant the railway sector sufficient time to revitalise itself.



MrÂ President, Commissioner, liberalisation of the market in rail transport services should go hand in hand with a great European venture linking west of Europe to the east, and north to the south by means of a high speed train similar to the TGV.

That would be the ideal project through which to demonstrate the unity of our continent and the relevance of European institutions, including the European Commission and the European Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, being more environmentally-friendly, safer and more cost-effective, rail transport ought to be used more by both European business and private users.
Nevertheless, according to various documents, especially the White Paper, rail transportâs market share appears to be in serious, worrying decline.
Our aim should therefore be to reverse the trend, by working towards building a competitive and open rail market.
This is what we are once again trying to do carefully, resolutely and, of course, in line with the rules. We are seeking to grant Member States the right to restrict the opening up of the network in certain cases, whilst respecting the rights of the workers, thus ensuring the safety and quality of the service provided.
The truth is that blocking the passenger rail transport market to various operators from the Member States cannot be justified by simple protectionism, often on the part of state monopolies. This does not benefit users in any way, shape or form.
Yet in this rail package there are other issues that merit more detailed analysis.
Firstly, we feel that cabotage services should fall under future legislation.
We welcome the fact that the process of opening up the networks is to be staggered in order to make it easier for those involved to adjust, and this could be extended for the reasons explained by a number of speakers. Secondly, without prejudice to the Member Statesâ responsibilities, powers to issue certification for international train drivers and other on-board staff should also be defined in order to promote the safety and the free movement of workers.
Lastly, I turn to the issue of the differences between the rights and obligations of national and international passengers.
In our view, the directive should apply to both in order to make the system simpler and more coherent.
To conclude, we are, broadly speaking, in favour of this legislative package. For this reason, I should also like to thank the rapporteurs and to express my hope that the package will be adopted in Parliament and in the Council.
As has been said before, this is an opportunity that must not go to waste.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin with stating that I fully agree with the tabling of the rail package and with the principle of liberalisation, since I believe that it leads to more efficient railways that will attract customers.
This is also significant for passenger services, to encourage passengers to leave the roads and travel by rail. Naturally, the expansion of economies of scale is also necessary.
That is all well. What I see as a problem, and I would like to commend it to the attention of Mr Jarzembowski, is the specific macroeconomic challenge the new Member States are faced with.
Namely, there is huge pressure on these states to introduce the euro, and a constant pressure from cofinancing sources to start our first three-year programme.
We have to participate in agricultural financing, as our own budgetary contribution is a prerequisite to receiving direct support.
This enormous pressure to enter the euro zone as soon as possible forces these governments to tackle the issue of budgetary consolidation.
That in turn makes them ignore the large national companies outside the national budget, such as the national railway companies.
Accordingly, I think that at this time it is impossible for us to accept the liberalisation schedule he proposes for new Member States, and especially cabotage.
I suggest that we establish a transition period that allows us time to prepare, to give a chance to our national railway company, especially considering the fact that the new Member States are very large âtransit chunksâ and huge transit markets.
We must grant them equal opportunities!
This is the reason the accession contract contains transition periods up to 2007 for goods traffic. The public services sector is also underdeveloped.
I fear that we would be left with secondary railway lines operating at a loss, with all the main lines taken over by the large railway corporations. This is another reason why I ask that we consider the introduction of some kind of a transition period.
Â Â  Mr President, it is my conviction that the third rail package is an important finishing stage in the creation of a common European railway transport services system.
I agree with the principles set forth in the directives of the third package.
I support that the overall principles required to open up the European market of passenger services be implemented in national law by 2006.
Hungary, a new Member State, has already done that.
I support that Member States should be able to decide, even on a reciprocal basis, to give earlier access to their railway infrastructure.
This is definitely a case for a multi-speed Europe.
However, if some Member States wish to decide to open their markets a few years later, they must be allowed this option. This is currently missing from the regulation, while at the same time the proposal is going deeper, opening up the market for national passenger services.
That, however, will raise challenges for a number of Member States, including certain new Member States, that will take time to tackle: public services contracts, solutions for under-serviced areas, logistical tasks and the restructuring of railway companies with all the personnel consequences involved.
These tasks are not merely a question of a simple national parliamentary decision â they require time.
We have to realise that, while new Member States show a faster rate of economic development than most traditional Member States, there are some areas where we progress at a slower pace.
Rail services hold values in new Member States, values that may fall victim to an overly swift transformation. These values are not only national in nature but, with the implementation of the third rail package, which I support, will also become common European values.
I am asking Parliament to consider this during the voting procedure tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the very important issue of Turkey, which includes the Council and Commission statements on the opening of negotiations with that country and the Recommendation by Mr Brok on the Additional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey following the enlargement of the European Union [9617/2005 COM(2005)0191 C6-0194/2005 2005/0091(AVC)] (A6-0241/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, honourable Members, I warmly welcome this debate, which is held at a critical time as the European Union prepares to open accession negotiations with Turkey.
I have enjoyed my previous exchanges with honourable Members of this House on this topic, and the close and detailed interest that this Parliament maintains in both Turkey's accession process and enlargement issues more generally has further been demonstrated by the questions tabled for Question Time later this evening.
The December 2004 European Council decision to open accession negotiations brought Turkey's 40-year goal of European Union membership a significant step closer and in the process helped further to bind the country so critical to our future security, stability and prosperity to the Union.
The strategic case for opening accession negotiations is convincing. It includes the powerful incentive for reform and the contribution the process makes to stability and prosperity, the example that it sets to the world that there is no contradiction between Islam and democracy, human rights and the protection of fundamental freedoms, and its contribution to reducing tension in the Aegean and over Cyprus.
The June European Council confirmed the December decision and recognised the importance for the European Union's credibility of observing our existing commitments.
As Presidency, our task has been to deliver on these commitments and we are working hard to finalise the Council's position in the framework for negotiations in advance of 3Â October.
The enlargement process has had unparalleled success in spreading European values and promoting greater security across the European continent, but it is as much for its own continued success that we must ensure we are scrupulous in ensuring that all the requirements are met.
As Commission Rehn, who is with us today, has said, the negotiations with Turkey will be the most rigorous yet, reflecting lessons learnt from the previous wave of enlargement.
They are also expected to take many years to conclude.
The powerful incentive for reform that enlargement offers to candidates has been strikingly evident in Turkey in recent years.
The European Commission's 2004 Regular Report on Turkey's progress towards accession noted 'substantial institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards', the reform process having 'clearly addressed major issues and highlighted a growing consensus in favour of liberal democracy'.
There is much for Turkey still to do in order to reach European Union standards, including on freedom of religion and the implementation of existing legislation, and the Commission will continue to monitor Turkey's progress.
But it was the impressive track record of European harmonisation reforms to date that prompted the December Council to conclude that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria.
Indeed, in the same month, this Parliament adopted a resolution supporting the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey 'without undue delay'.
That December Council set Turkey two further conditions to be met before accession negotiations could be launched: to bring into force six outstanding pieces of legislation which reinforce the rule of law and human rights; and to sign a Protocol extending the 1963 Ankara Agreement to the new Member States.
The new legislation entered into force on 1 June, and Turkey signed the Ankara Agreement Protocol on 29 July.
Both represent significant developments.
The new legislation overhauls the Turkish penal system, aligning it much more closely with European Union models and adds significantly to the reforms that have taken place in Turkey in recent years.
Signature of the Protocol extends the European Union-Turkey Association Agreement â or Ankara Agreement â to all 25 Member States.
It is, of course, with 25 Member States that Turkey will conduct its accession negotiations.
You are all well aware that, when signing the Protocol, Turkey issued a unilateral declaration restating its longstanding position of non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus.
Last week the European Community and its Member States issued a declaration setting out its position on the issues raised.
That declaration makes clear that the 'declaration by Turkey is unilateral, does not form part of the Protocol and has no legal effect on Turkey's obligations under the Protocol'.
Furthermore, it states that 'Turkey must apply the Protocol fully to all European Union Member States' and that the 'European Union will monitor this closely and evaluate full implementation in 2006'.
The declaration also restates that the European Community and its Member States 'recognise only the Republic of Cyprus as a subject of international law' and clarifies that 'recognition of all Member States is a necessary component of Turkey's accession process'.
The Council's declaration also reiterates the agreement of the European Community and its Member States 'on the importance of supporting the UN Secretary-General's efforts to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem in line with relevant UNSCRs and the principles on which the European Union is founded'.
Resolution of the Cyprus problem lies in the hands of the United Nations and the communities on the island.
The European Union's role is to support the UN Secretary-General's 'good offices', and to provide a context within which the two parties can re-engage with one another in confidence and accommodate the ultimate agreement.
Let me make one final point in my introductory remarks to this debate.
Turkey will not accede to the Union imminently; 35 chapters must be opened and closed; further reforms will be required; and some Member States have already committed to referenda on Turkey's eventual accession.
The Turkey that will eventually join the European Union will, frankly, be a different Turkey from the one we see today â and it may also be a rather different European Union that it joins.
But the progress made by Turkey so far has been quite extraordinary and Prime Minister Erdogan's Government remains committed to further reform.
The conditions laid down by the December European Council have been satisfied, and this paves the way for opening accession negotiations next Monday.
I am delighted that the Foreign Secretary will appear before this Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs on the following day; he will of course update the members of that committee then on the progress made.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the additional protocol, like so many other issues around the beginning of negotiations with Turkey, raises what is very much a point of principle, that being the question of whether a candidate for accession is willing to accept all the parts of that entity of which it desires to become a member, or, to put it another way, whether it recognises all the Member States.
In December last year, the Commission put to the Council the proposition that recognition in international law was not necessary at the present time, but that the signature of the additional protocol on customs union between the EU of 25 and Cyprus would be sufficient.
Turkey did comply with this requirement, albeit with a unilateral declaration that made it at least questionable whether the protocol would be implemented.
The Council responded to this with a statement to the effect that this was quite simply not valid in either political or legal terms.
Our Committee, though, asked the Commissioner, orally on 13 September and in writing on 15 September, to make his good offices available to us, and he agreed to do so.
To date, we have had no response to the question as to whether the Turkish Government intends to include this unilateral declaration in the process of ratification by that countryâs parliament.
The fact is that, as and when this is made something that the Turkish parliament needs to ratify, thereby making Turkeyâs non-implementation of it a matter of law, that presents us with a problem.
I therefore invite you, before we proceed to the vote, to provide the Committee on Foreign Affairs with the statement it has requested, and which is mentioned in the joint resolution.
We should make it clear that it is Turkey that is asking to join the European Union and not â contrary to the impression I sometimes get â we who are inviting it to join us.
We must not lose sight of the fact that the joint statement, as submitted by the groups, attaches a great deal of importance to the additional protocol actually being put into effect.
If we are to address this problem, we would be well advised to negotiate the chapter on customs union by 2006 at the latest and conclude negotiations on it by the end of that year, in order that this issue â which also has a bearing on the recognition of Cyprus â can be speedily resolved and that we do not end up negotiating with Turkey without the prospect of this fundamental issue being resolved.
For that reason, we agree with the Commissioner and the President-in-Office that we will need, in future, to again avail ourselves of the good offices of the United Nations in order to resolve the Cyprus conflict as a whole.
Perhaps I might be permitted a few personal observations.
Yesterday, somebody asked me why it is that torture in Turkey â of which there are thousands of instances â is not a fit subject for debate, while an unresolved issue about a general can stand in the way of negotiations with Croatia.
I have to admit that I was unable to come up with an answer to that.
We should be honest in the way we do politics, taking care not to use arguments as pretexts for our own subjective political ends; instead, we need to be very clear and honest in stating where we stand on this issue.
One reason why the resolution submitted by the groups in this House is so important is that we also need to make it clear that one criterion that must be met is the European Unionâs capacity for absorbing new Member States â both as an end in itself, and because it raises questions about what is financially possible, what is actually practicable, and what the institutions are capable of handling.
I would like to see the Council and the Commission, in these weeks and months, apply to the period of reflection on the Constitution the same consistent effort that they are devoting to Turkeyâs accession.
Then we might make some headway on this issue of absorbency.
We must not lose sight of the fact â which the groupsâ resolution makes clear â that it is for us in this European Parliament to state that the conditions are formally met â in contrast to their form of words, which refers to âsufficiently fulfilledâ â and that issues of minority rights, issues relating to the processes of reform within Turkey, and the freedom of religion issue have a major part to play in this.
This summer, the Commissioner exchanged letters with the Turkish foreign minister on the subject of the Law on Foundations, in the course of which the foreign minister rejected the improvements that the Commissioner had suggested, and stated that such things were a matter for the parliament, and then only after 3Â October.
Issues of pluralism, tolerance and freedom of religion, not to mention the right of the Orthodox Church to train its own priests, which it has been unable to do since 1971, are, after all, issues of substance touching on the European Unionâs understanding of its own values and should be given prominence in the early months of the negotiating process.
As I see it â and this is true of Turkey and of many other countries â the prospect of membership of the European Union has an important part to play in these areas.
It exerts crucial leverage in getting internal reform processes going in such countries as those in the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Turkey, and it is for that reason that we should never shut the door on them.
We also, however, need to be realistic and open-minded, not only about the results we expect from negotiations, but also about the ends we have in view.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, scarcely any political issue has such far-reaching implications for the existence of the European Union as the possibility of Turkey becoming a member of it.
Being a major issue, opinions differ as to what is to be done about it.
Speaking on behalf of my group, and having been one of the signatories to the joint motion for a resolution, let me say that, on so fundamental an issue as this, we do of course allow every one of our members to vote in whichever way they choose, because this is an issue on which every single member of our group has their own opinions, not only because we allow them to, but because it is our profound conviction that they should.
That is why different members of our group can be found taking up different positions on this subject.
We do, however, agree on one thing, and it is for that reason that we have been able to give the motion for a resolution our unanimous backing, that being that both parties to the negotiations on Turkey must see them as open-ended as regards their outcome.
We want to stress that we all have an interest in democracy, the rule of law, and human rights in Turkey developing in such a way that they are brought closer to our values.
Even if Turkish accession is not the ultimate objective, or even if, at the end of this process, Turkey does not become a Member State, we can, today, tell our Turkish friends and partners that it is still very much in our interests to seek a close alternative partnership that will put partnership, cooperation and friendship with Turkey on a sound footing.
Having listened to all that has been said by the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, let us not mince our words: we are dancing around as if on eggshells, with statements being issued by this party and that, by Turkey on the one hand and the Council on the other.
As Mr Brok has reminded us, Commissioner, you gave the Committee on Foreign Affairs an undertaking that you would attempt to get the Turkish Government to make a statement to the effect that its non-recognition of Cyprus and its refusal to let Cypriot ships or aircraft dock or land on Turkish soil was not an issue in the process of ratification by Turkey.
That declaration has not been forthcoming.
If we do not get from you such a declaration, in which Turkey assures you that these matters will not feature in the ratification process by noon today, then our group will move that approval of the protocol be deferred, for it is logical â both politically and inherently â that there should be no vote on this until such time as such a declaration from the Turkish Government is in our hands.
Let me ask a very serious question: how do things stand as regards human rights?
I suggest you go and ask the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew.
Where the freedom of Christians to practise their religion in Turkey is concerned, nothing has changed.
We, in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are all in favour of partnership, friendship and dialogue with the Islamic world, but that cannot be a one-way street.
Islam, too â meaning, in this instance, the Turkish Government â must be willing to acknowledge the legitimate rights of Christians in Turkey and to give that practical expression.
That is something that worries me.
I am addressing the President-in-Office of the Council â who will, I hope, pay attention â when I say that I call on the British Government to apply the same standards across the board.
We know what the human rights situation in Turkey is like, but what about Croatia?
We are refusing to begin negotiations with Croatia on the grounds that this general is not being handed over, even though it is patently obvious that the government is not in a position to do that.
For Turkey, though, almost all of us close our eyes and apply different yardsticks.
I urge you, for the sake of your own credibility, to apply uniform standards and treat Croatia, too, fairly and objectively.
This is very important, and we urge the Commission to do it.
Although it can always rely on our support, we will also take a highly critical line if there is no improvement in the human rights situation within a specified period of time after negotiations with Turkey begin.
We know that torture is still going on.
If a stop is not put to it, we must also be ready to defer negotiations.
We must not pass over these violations of human rights in silence.
That brings me to the last point I want to make: it is a very important one, and I shall quote from our joint resolution, which I signed along with Mr Eurlings and Mr Brok, whom I want to thank warmly for jointly leading the negotiations on behalf of our group.
Paragraph 16 of it states that the Treaty of Nice is not an acceptable basis for further decisions on the accession of any further new Member States and that Parliament therefore insists that the necessary reforms be brought into force within the framework of the constitutional process.
What that means is that it is not just Turkey that must meet the conditions for accession.
That is a hard and tricky road to go down, and we hope that Turkey will go down the road that leads to democracy, to the rule of law and to human rights.
We too, the European Union, must be certain that we can cope with an accession.
If that is not the case, then it is irresponsible to keep on enlarging this European Union of ours, for we will end up with something that is no longer the European Union.
Here, at the heart of the European Union, let us do what has to be done to make this European Union strong and effective.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening attentively to Mr Poettering, there is only one conclusion to which one can come, and that is that it would be better if he were to say that he and his group do not want Turkey as a full member of the European Union.
That is the message contained in his speech, so let him say so, rather than pussyfooting around the issue.
If he does not want Turkey to be a full member of the European Union, then let him say so.
His groupâs website includes pages full of some of its members saying that very thing.
That is the point at issue and that is what he is fighting shy of.
Let me tell you what our group wants.
It has been decided by the Heads of State or Government, 18 of whom are Mr Poetteringâs political allies, that 3 October is to be the day on which the accession negotiations are to be kicked off; they will take between ten and fifteen years and are not a free ride, for their conditions have been proposed by the Commission and defined by the Council, and it is these that we are discussing today.
Let me name a couple of conditions that are indispensable.
If Turkey wants to join the European Union, there are fundamental conditions with which it must comply.
One thing on which we do agree is that a country cannot seek membership of the European Union while not recognising one of its Member States; that is impossible.
We therefore argue that the commencement of negotiations cannot be conditional upon recognition, but recognition must be forthcoming at some point during their course.
We also want to make it clear that we cannot wait until the end of a fifteen-year process for it; it must happen at once, at some point in the first or second year, and if the protocol to which Mr Brok referred is not put into effect, which means that Cyprus is not recognised, then the accession negotiations will have to be suspended.
Delighted though I am that Mr Poettering agrees with us about this, I ask the House to hold the applause a moment or two longer, for there is more to come.
If you want to enlarge the European Union, you have to make it fit for enlargement.
That is something else on which we agree, and this joint resolution says so.
If Mr Poettering wants to be better understood, he will have to be very precise in the language he uses.
If the European Union does not have the capacity to cope with Turkeyâs accession, then it cannot cope with Croatiaâs either.
I can tell Mr Poettering what his group, by its policy, is saying: it is saying that it does not want Turkey because Turkey is distant and Muslim, but that Croatia is acceptable on the grounds of being Catholic, conservative and close at hand.
That is what his groupâs policy adds up to: hypocrisy and nothing more!
It is not acceptable to string a candidate country along for 40 years with promises of EU membership; it is not acceptable to demand of such a country that it put itself through processes of transformation that it has already undergone.
Under no conservative government â whether that of Mrs Ãiller or that of Mr Poetteringâs great mate Mr Yilmaz â has Turkey made such progress towards democracy as it has done under Mr ErdoÄan.
So let me spell out the fact that the increase in security that could result from Turkeyâs full membership is not to be underestimated.
We cannot, however â and I include my own group in this â be naive and say that it can join tomorrow.
Its accession is dependent on conditions, and those conditions apply to both parties.
Turkey must comply with them, and so must the European Union.
This debate could do with a bit more honesty.
If you find Turkey unacceptable, then you should say so openly.
We want to give it the chance, but we do not know whether its accession will, at the end of the day, be possible, for there are reforms to be implemented by both countries, by both parties.
You in particular should be more reticent, Mr Langen.
I have a clear recollection of December 1995, when this Houseâs most eloquent advocate of accession was none other than your good self, and that makes you one of our leading hypocrites.
Let me tell you, I have a good memory, and shouting the odds does nothing to make your arguments less false.
I ask Members to give some thought to the fact that the European Parliament ...
Â Â  Wait a moment please, Mr Schulz.
MrÂ Langen, you do not officially have the floor and I would therefore ask you not to speak.
Please calm down and be quiet.
Â Â  Mr President, perhaps you would be so kind as to have Mr Langenâs comment of âWhat a liar!â recorded in the Minutes.
I would be grateful if that at least could be done.
It is apparent from the uproar among the Christian Democrat Members how hard it is to bear when one is publicly caught out.
Let me tell the House what our group regards as important.
We have, of course, had the same debate that Mr Poettering describes as having gone on in his own outfit.
In my outfit too, by which I mean our group, there is more than one opinion, but I do want to return to paragraph 16 of our joint resolution, because it was evident from Mr Poetteringâs speech that we will soon have to debate Croatia.
The same fundamental preconditions apply to Croatia too: cooperation with the International Court is a .
It is clear from paragraph 16, though, that another fundamental precondition for any enlargement is that the European Union should have a constitution.
If that constitution is not the one that is proving unacceptable in its present form, then let me make it quite clear that enlargement needs more than just Nice and a few adjustments to it.
If the European Union is to be made fit for enlargement, we must keep on demanding a constitution for it, we must maintain that as our goal.
That applies in the case of Turkey, but let there be no misunderstanding: it also applies in the case of any other candidate for accession.
I should also like to know whether Mr Poettering would insist just as enthusiastically on these two conditions being coupled together if this debate were about Croatia.
I look forward to seeing whether he will, in that event, be just as passionate in demanding compliance with fundamental preconditions as he has been demanding it of Turkey.
That is a day to which I look forward.
I will sum up by saying that we, as a group, will be voting in favour of the resolution.
As regards the adjournment that Mr Brok envisages in the event of the answer not reaching us by midday today, let me say that, if Turkey really does put that on the agenda for the ratification debate in its parliament, then the result will be precisely what we have specified in the joint resolution.
The negotiations will then have to be suspended, perhaps even deferred, so an adjournment will not be necessary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, whenever we talk about Turkey the debate, of course, becomes political straight away, regardless of the more or less legal reason for the debate, as is happening now.
All the groups have signed an important compromise document together, putting forward a united position, but we have also sacrificed a number of points of correctness for the sake of this unity.
In my view, the document is extremely harsh in the demands it makes on Turkey, and such an approach does not even encourage the Greek Cypriots to be more flexible or for them too to seek a solution to this situation, for which they are largely responsible.
We must not forget who rejected the referendum; we must not forget the reasons why we are in this situation.
I am saying this just to show how things stand.
A country that was about to join prevented a European Union Commissioner from speaking on state television, and that Commissioner has said that the Greek Cypriot authorities betrayed his trust and went back on their word.
I am saying this because we are not doing even our Cypriot friends a favour if we do not demand that they too show a sense of responsibility regarding this situation.
Lastly, for those who, like us, have belief and hope in a political Europe as a political, economic and moral force, it is clearly a surprise that we ourselves are not delighted at the success that our gentle European influence is having in Turkey.
Perhaps we ourselves do not realise that a number of taboos have recently been broken.
Armenia is being discussed in Turkey and it is being discussed with the support of the government: in spite of everything, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have supported opening this debate.
The Kurdish taboo has also been broken: one need only recall the Prime Ministerâs recent speech on the mistakes made in that area and the fact that they have accepted responsibility for the Diyarbakir intervention.
These are successes achieved by political Europe, by our capacity for encouraging open, more respectful, democratic structures and systems.
It is true that we are entitled to be critical, but we are not entitled to be cynical; the early death of the European Constitution on the electoral scaffolds of France and the Netherlands has left the continent without an ideal border for its maturity, leading to a build-up of resentments and cynicism, which do not constitute a policy.
That is not the way to do politics; that is not the way to create a federalist, liberal policy for the Europe that we want: one that encourages freedom, the rule of law and democracy.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whenever sensible people get so worked up, there has to be something behind it, or else they would not do it.
There are a couple of things of which we can perhaps remind ourselves.
Up to now, we have not enlarged the European Union; we have united it.
The Turkey debate is the first real debate on enlargement, for nobody â irrespective of how they are voting â is describing the accession of Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary as an enlargement of the European idea; they were a matter of obligation, for it was right and proper to welcome these countries after the collapse of Communism.
What we are now dealing with really is a new dimension.
This is about enlargement.
No matter which way we decide, this is a new dimension.
Just shut up, will you?
We do indeed have a new dimension to deal with, and the question with which it presents us is this: is it, post-9/11, important in terms of Europeâs interests to give Turkey the chance of accession?
That question can be answered in different ways, but it must be answered by reference to the interests of the European Union, the interests of the people of Europe, rather than on the basis of emotional, cultural, or racist resentments.
That is not acceptable and we do not want it!
If you are not, if you do not think I mean you, then I do not.
In that case, I mean Mr de Villiers.
Stop thinking that everything refers to you!
You are not the centre of the universe!
At present, the arguments used in Europe against Turkey rely on feelings, on racist resentments directed against Islam.
Not all those who are against Turkey use these arguments, but they ride the wave of these sentiments.
It follows that all those in the ânoâ camp must ask themselves what their arguments unleash, and it is for that reason that I think it right to argue that Europe needs to change first, that Europe has to do its homework, and that Europe needs a constitution; these are things with which nobody disagrees.
Europe cannot enlarge itself the way it is now.
As to whether Europe can, subject to the conditions in the Treaty of Nice, make itself more united by including Croatia, I too have my doubts.
That is a legitimate debate.
The other debate, though â the debate about whether Europe can absorb a country whose population is predominantly Muslim â is nonsensical.
Today, in Europe, there are more Muslims than there are Belgians.
They are already included among us.
The question of how European Islam is will arise with Turkey or without it, so let us stop discussing it.
Islam is the third-largest religion in Europe; whether I, as an atheist, find that to my liking is another matter.
It is for that reason that the only question to be asked at the end of this debate is what Turkey will be like in ten yearsâ time.
Will it be a democratic state, a secular state?
Is Islam European?
Will this same Turkey be prepared to join with us Europeans in contending for the values that we enshrine in a constitution?
If the answer to those questions is in the affirmative, then I will bid it welcome; if not, then we will have to think up something else.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would be most obliged to you if you were to use whatever influence you have on Mr Cohn-Bendit to induce him to take some time out to think and thereafter to withdraw the sweeping accusations of racism that he has aimed at those who are opposed to Turkish membership.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say, for Mr Brokâs benefit, that not all the arguments against Turkey are racist, but that those who can ride the wave of racism in their campaign against Turkey must, for that reason, give some thought to what arguments they use.
I stand by that.
If that touches a sore point for you, then that is your problem, and if it does not, then good for you.
Â Â  Mr Brok and Mr Cohn-Bendit, we must work in accordance with our Rules of Procedure.
I imagine that Mr Brok has spoken pursuant to Rule 145.
He has not said as much, but my interpretation is that he has requested the floor on the basis of that Rule, which stipulates that personal statements take place at the end of the debate in question.
You may speak, therefore, MrÂ Brok, if you wish, when we finish this debate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to raise a point of order.
I should like to call on MrÂ Cohn-Bendit to withdraw his remark, which seems extremely serious to me and which is not âŠ
Â Â  Mr de Villiers, since you have not told me which Rule of the Rules of Procedure you are invoking, I have had to cut you off.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, on the eve of the opening of these debates, which are scheduled to take place over a long period of time, the matter is one of reiterating very clearly their non-negotiable points, on which Europeâs negotiators therefore cannot compromise, whatever pressures they might be subjected to.
While people may be familiar with these points, it is not a useless exercise, in my opinion, to reiterate them today.
Our group has done so in its motion for a resolution.
In the first instance, it is a question of actually enforcing standards of democracy, as well as actually complying with internationally recognised civil rights and human rights.
That obviously includes the civil, political and cultural rights of the minorities and, above all, of the Kurds.
This is an aspect that the draft compromise which has been submitted to us, and which is, moreover, satisfactory overall has surprisingly and regrettably overlooked.
Well, in our opinion it is vital that Turkey abandon once and for all any notion it might have of solving the Kurdish issue through the use of military force, that it acknowledge the political dimension of the conflict and that it promote reconciliation, particularly with the Kurds who have relinquished the use of their weapons.
In the same spirit, it is a question of getting Turkey to agree, contrary to any form of nationalism, to look its past in the face by recognising the Armenian genocide.
It is significant, moreover, that the unacceptable court action brought against OrhanÂ Pamuk should focus at the same time on the Kurdish issue and on the Armenian issue.
Finally, it is a question of ensuring, within a short timescale that it would be useful to clarify from the first phase of the negotiation, that Turkey recognise the Republic of Cyprus, withdraw its occupying troops from the north of the island and, for the time being, fully implement the commitments contained in the protocol extending the EU-Turkey customs union to the new Member States, in particular the Republic of Cyprus.
This of course means that Turkey must respect in full the unrestricted access of Cypriot boats and aircraft to its ports and airports.
Within that list, there are no excessive or unwarranted conditions.
On the whole, these measures live up to the expectations of Turkeyâs democratic forces themselves.
Like us, they want to create the conditions for their country to join the Union in the future.
For them â for the Turkish and Kurdish democratic forces â these negotiations constitute an exceptional lever for accelerating the changes that they consider to be necessary.
Therefore, our vigilance is to their advantage!
Â Â  . Mr President, for those of us who are opposed to the whole idea of political union, the matter is quite straightforward.
We are opposed to political union with Turkey just as we are opposed to political union with Germany, France or Italy.
However, what is one to make suddenly of all these euro-fanatics â especially down there â and the CDU in Germany, and even the great President Chirac himself, whose ardour for the European Union's endless development suddenly cools when they reach the Bosphorus?
Some this morning will detect the whiff of hypocrisy; but it is not actually hypocrisy, it is the smell of fear: fear that public support for the whole EU project will finally collapse if Turkish entry is pursued.
After all, the latest Eurobarometer, as Mr Poettering will surely know, showed 70% opposition to Turkish membership in France and 74% in Germany.
But, as usual, Brussels will plough on.
Good!
Although we are against Turkish accession, we shall be quite happy to watch the EU destroy itself while trying to achieve it.
They say turkeys do not vote for Christmas, but if the EU institutions vote for Turkey, it could be a serendipitous exception to the rule.
Â Â  . Â MrÂ President, each successive enlargement of the European Union triggered a range of emotions, but to date no enlargement has caused as many misgivings amongst Europeans as the one involving Turkey.
This could mean that Europeans will never consent to it.
If Europeans oppose this enlargement both now and in the future, creating the mirage of full Turkish membership of the European Union will amount to creating a tremendous disappointment and upset for the government in Ankara.
When the Turkish issue was first debated in the House in DecemberÂ 2004, I pointed out that it is abundantly obvious that all the advantages of closer economic, political and military ties with Turkey can be gained without full membership.
Much has been written on this subject.
I should today like to highlight a further problem linked to this enlargement, namely the loss of political and geographical balance it involves.
Postponing Croatiaâs membership and avoiding a statement on Ukraineâs rightful place in Europe whilst pressing forward with this process for Turkey is painful and unacceptable.
It is exceedingly costly and damaging to the European Union in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in the other countries I mentioned.
MrÂ Schulz and MrÂ Poettering maintain that our capacity for absorption is limited.
If so, I would prefer to use this capacity differently.
The document before us is actually an attempt at blackmail, as it conditions the enlargement process to the so-called constitutional process.
The Law and Justice Members will therefore abstain in the vote on the aforementioned document.
Â Â  Mr President, there is every indication that Turkey will accede whatever the cost, but as the EU/Turkey Civic Commission demonstrated recently, Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria, yet the Commission and Council claim otherwise.
They know very well what goes on.
Commissioner Rehn referred a moment ago to the persecution of the author Orhan Pamuk, and they express their concern every time something happens, but when it comes down to it, they do nothing about it.
When should Turkey recognise all Member States?
What is the timetable for opening the Turkish airports and seaports?
People suggest during the negotiation process, so in ten years time or so, possibly, for we will of course have made so much progress that we will be unable to back-pedal, even if Turkey does not meet the conditions.
That is the salami solution: decisions are taken in small chunks and before we know it, we are facing a .
The only argument we keep hearing prior to Turkeyâs accession is the promise that is being made to the Turks.
What about the promise that Turkey must meet conditions?
In fact, when will we ask the public what they think about the accession of a non-European country that has no place in the European Union?
Â Â  Mr President, just before the planned start to the negotiations, the relationship between Europe and Turkey is going through a very rocky patch, first of all as a result of a counter-declaration from Turkey that the Commission tried to prevent at all costs, but secondly because Turkeyâs perception of what would be needed in order to join the European Union is incompatible with the rules of the club.
They perceive things differently.
That is why at the moment, what we need, above all else, is clarity â clarity about what the rules are and what should happen, and that is why I welcome our joint resolution, for it is bringing us exactly that.
It stipulates that the recognition of Cyprus is not negotiable.
That country must be recognised as soon as possible; if not, serious consequences may follow.
That is what we in this House believe and that is what we should stick to.
Mr Schulz mentioned a timeframe of one or two years; so it would be unacceptable even for the Socialists if Cyprus were not recognised in two yearsâ time, and that is something of which we have taken note.
Secondly, clear language is also spoken with regard to the implementation of the Protocol.
That should be set down right at the beginning of the negotiations in 2006; if not, this may have serious consequences.
With this in mind, I would add that there is another side to this. Europe must take responsibility for encouraging the UN to reconcile the two parties in Cyprus.
Last weekend, I spoke with the two leaders of both factions, but they had not seen each other in years.
We should at the very least press the UN to send someone out there to talk to both parties.
Anything else really would be an admission of weakness.
Thirdly, as regards the legal position of the declaration, the Commissioner is right in saying that it has no legal meaning for us, but Mr Brok and Mr Poettering are also right to say that we have a problem if the Turkish Parliament uses it as part of the ratification.
Mr Schulz argues that, if Turkey uses it for the ratification, we must cease negotiations forthwith.
How can he claim such a thing if he wants the process with Turkey to go well?
I hope that the Commissioner will soon be able to confirm that Turkey is not making ratification dependent on it.
Should Turkey do so anyway, it would be preferable for Parliament to keep in check, and suspend the whole process, so that we can exert maximum pressure to ensure that Turkey does not go down that undesirable route and avoids problems rather than, as Mr Schulz says, us maybe having to call the whole thing off in two monthsâ time.
The resolution is also very clear about how we should deal with the negotiations in time.
Whilst Turkey has, apparently, formally met the starting conditions, I would add that the new acts are problematic, because Articles 301 and 305 of the penal code ensure that Orhan Pamuk can be persecuted, a judge can call off an Armenian conference, and I am delighted that Prime Minister Erdogan has spoken out so clearly during the conference, also with regard to the Kurdish issue.
That is courageous.
In order to really solve problems, though, those laws need amending, including the law on religious minorities, which is not worthy of a country that wants to be part of Europe.
It can never be right that priests cannot be trained there after years of promises, and that churches are still being taken from the people.
That is why I welcome the use of the word âdeadlineâ in this resolution.
If we take the priority as regards political criteria seriously, we must be so bold as to set clear deadlines and warn them that they have one or two years to put matters right; otherwise, we cannot move forward.
Last, but not least, the resolution makes explicit reference to absorption capacity.
Europeâs capacity to absorb a large country such as Turkey will need to go hand in hand with a constitution and financial arrangements, but above all, the man and woman in the street will need to be persuaded.
That is for Turkey to do by means of good campaigns and real reforms, but there is also something for this House to do â not only speaking clear language in this resolution, but also by delivering on that language in the years to come.
Â Â  Mr President, listening to Mr Eurlings, we can in any case establish that we are agreed on many things in the resolution, but not, I think, everything.
Where Turkey is concerned, there is a difference in attitude between some of the groups to the left, or to the left of centre, and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats).
That is the first point I wanted to make.
I am pleased, though, that we have a clear draft resolution and I hope that it will make it through the voting round unscathed.
Needless to say, we mainly took this Houseâs position last year as our starting point for drafting the resolution.
We have also deliberately repeated a number of points from it in order to explain the negotiation framework that this House would like to use in the coming years.
We have asked for the first phase of the negotiations with Turkey to centre on the political criteria, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the position of minorities.
In that way, the European Union will be able to bring pressure to bear on the Turkish Government not only to set down these rights and freedoms in law, but also to implement them effectively.
We have insisted on this many times and will continue to do so; Turkey should therefore put this reform into practice and give it practical expression, so that we can evaluate progress in a good light.
It is at least as important to confirm once again that the ultimate goal of the negotiations is full EU membership.
At the same time â and that is also expressed in the resolution â the outcome will of course depend on the process itself.
Success is our goal, but there are no guarantees.
As the Commissioner said himself, the process is in itself very important and will also have enormous consequences for the future of Turkey itself.
It has to be said, unfortunately, that the debate on the opening of the accession negotiations with Turkey and the text of the resolution are being overshadowed by two issues, firstly the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, and, secondly, the extension and implementation of the customs protocol, also again in relation to Cyprus.
These two problems, I am sad to say, have been brought on by Turkey itself.
It is beyond us why a global decision such as opening ports or airports should be an immense problem of principle.
We cannot understand why Turkey finds it so difficult to recognise all members of a club to which it would like to belong.
That is why we insist on Turkey relinquishing its objections surrounding the extension of the customs agreement and on it implementing the Ankara Agreement in full and without discrimination.
That is why we insist on Turkey formally recognising Cyprus as soon as possible after the negotiations have started.
That is why we press home our position that signing an agreement with 25 countries also implies the recognition of 25 countries.
We are afraid, and that is also reflected in the resolution, that these issues could lead to hitches in the negotiation process, or even to its suspension.
That is not in our interest or in that of the Turkish Government or of the Turkish people.
We would therefore expressly call on the Turkish Government to set down to work on this straight away so that these problems can be eliminated.
Finally, although this is not a debate about Cyprus, or the Cyprus issue, this issue has been tabled and I would like to raise two questions in its connection.
First of all, like Mr Eurlings, I would like to ask all parties to return to the negotiating table in order to break the surrounding the future of Northern Cyprus.
Secondly, I would like to ask the same parties, as well as the Council and Commission, not to hesitate any longer and take the necessary steps in order to give the economy, and with it the people of Northern Cyprus, a chance.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry to see, judging from what previous speakers have said, that talks between the SPD and the CDU on forming the Grand Coalition are not progressing so smoothly.
I find it extraordinary that those who have profited so much from European integration in terms of prosperity, security and liberal democracy should now refuse to extend those prizes towards Turkey.
However, I agree with Mr Poettering that it is important for us to accentuate the Union's capacity to absorb that country.
I wonder whether the President-in-Office could indicate whether he agrees with us that we need European settlement of the Constitution before Turkey and Croatia are able to accede.
Would he also agree that the Cyprus problem will remain intractable and the Balkans fractious and unstable should the Union refuse membership to Turkey?
Would he say what steps the Presidency will take to promote efforts to open up financial and trade relations with Northern Cyprus once accession negotiations have been started successfully?
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the run-up to important decisions in the European Union about Turkey, it is becoming increasingly evident that a battle â a tough one at that â is going on between reformers and conservatives about Turkeyâs future, between a democratic Turkey anchored in Europe and an undemocratic Turkey in splendid isolation.
Let me again make it abundantly clear that I would like the reformers to win.
That means that the EU, in its relations with Turkey, must not mince its words, but must also be fair.
Where Cyprus is concerned, the signing of the protocol by the Turkish Government means, to my mind, 100% implementation.
Let there be no doubt about this.
That also means, though, that the EU must deliver on its promise to bring the northern part of Cyprus out of its isolation, and that also means, while we are on the subject of Cyprus â and this I say for the benefit of the Socialist Members of this House â that things must be done in their proper order: we first need to ask Kofi Annan to examine whether a solution is possible, and then follow it up with recognition, because the other way round will not work.
Being frank and fair also means that we need to praise Turkey for the new penal code, while pointing out to the reformers that this new penal code still contains far too many clauses and articles that can be misconstrued by the conservatives to frustrate the reformers, as we have seen in the case of the author Orhan Pamuk; that is why further changes are needed.
As far as I am concerned, the negotiations can begin.
