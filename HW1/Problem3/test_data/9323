(EL) Mr President, finally after many years of procedures and negotiations we are very close to adopting a regulation on chemicals.
Of course, the regulation may not be perfect, but it is very good.
In the future it can be improved, as has been done with several community directives and regulations.
I would like to congratulate Mr Sacconi, because in essence this regulation provides for the protection of human health and the environment and this protection will increase over time; moreover, I imagine that, in future, all the substances that cause the concern of most of my colleagues today will be replaced over time.
It is very good that the regulation provides for control of dangerous substances, where possible.
It provides for substitution, which must take place, and in cases where there are no substitutes it provides for research plans, which is also very important.
I would like to remind you that the science of chemistry has offered a lot to the improvement of human life on earth.
And this was achieved thanks to innovation.
In essence, this regulation calls for the same thing over time; innovation so that new, better and less dangerous or completely harmless substances can be created to serve man.
Once again I would like to congratulate Mr Sacconi, because he managed to create a regulation for chemicals, which should not be judged with impatience.
Do not expect to see perfection as of tomorrow!
Over time we will see an essential improvement of public health and the environment.
(PL) Mr President, one of the main provisions of the draft REACH regulation is the principle of substitution, which remains within the competence of industry.
This principle could unlock the significant potential for innovation of both the vital chemical industry and the end users of its products.
Nonetheless, there is considerable scope for the interpretation of certain provisions such as those appearing under 'suitable safer alternatives'.
The provision concerning enterprises' research and development plans may also prove problematic, as those enterprises that do not have their own research establishment may be exempted from it.
There is therefore a danger that some small and medium-sized enterprises that do currently have their own research establishments may close them down, and will therefore not be required to submit the aforementioned plans.
The question arises as to who is responsible for seeking substitutes, the chemical industry or the end user, or whether the responsibility is shared.
This in turn raises concerns about the nature of intellectual property law in relation to current patent law, which unfortunately is not as good as it could be.
The carefully formulated principle of substitution is the most logical response to the use of hazardous substances.
The procedures contained in the regulation aimed at stimulating innovation in the search for new and safe substances are certainly needed.
(DE) Mr President, the French philosopher Voltaire once said that all fanaticism is dangerous.
I believe that this debate is a good example of the truth of this statement.
The words of my fellow Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, of those from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group or even of the extreme left give me the impression that only losers could endorse a package such as this.
Yet let us compare the advantages of REACH with the disadvantages.
It must be made clear in this regard that REACH represents a step in the right direction for us all: greater environmental and consumer protection, but also greater competitiveness.
Rejecting REACH would undoubtedly be detrimental to all sides, therefore.
For this reason, it will now be up to us to communicate this properly.
Indeed, to look at the media, one would think that there were no winners.
Our skill will now be judged on how effectively we can change this impression.
After all, in the final analysis, human beings, animals and even the environment are the big winners from this legislation.
We should continue to work on it, therefore.
In this regard, I must also remind the media of their duty, which is to communicate a true image of this new legislation, particularly at the present stage.
The second stage will consist of getting the implementation of this image right - which will also be very difficult, as we know the scenario: the EU is always to blame.
From the point of view of legal form, however, this legislation is a directive and therefore needs to be implemented by the Member States, who will have to implement and also apply it correctly.
All parties really face great challenges in this regard.
The appeal goes out to us, too: let us create a strong Agency for all this, so that we have uniform rules rather than another patchwork of 25 or 27 different regimes.
We have considerable work to do, therefore, and hopes for a REACH-free year in 2007 are unlikely to be fulfilled.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us see how far we have come with the project before us today.
REACH will change our relationship to chemical pollution considerably, by reversing the burden of proof, first of all; then by systematically providing information all down the line.
A previous speaker mentioned the asbestos scandal. We are well aware that a scandal of that kind would be impossible with the text we are voting on today.
The public needs to know that.
There are all these gains, it is true, but there are of course also things with which we are not satisfied, or not satisfied enough, starting with natural substances: I would have liked us to be a little clearer, as it may cause problems.
I do not think a natural substance is really a chemical substance.
As regards imports, I would also have liked us to have more guarantees that we can impose similar standards on importers.
Then, obviously, there is this major issue of substitution.
Like many of you, I, too, would have liked substitution to be automatic, systematic and immediate.
At first reading, I voted in favour of all the amendments to that end, but I noticed that we do not have the qualified majority.
If Mr Sacconi had not managed to reach this compromise, we would be taking a great risk, at the vote on the second reading, of not having this principle implemented.
After all, it must be said that the compromise does include the principle.
What is in question is not the principle but its gradual, progressive implementation, - inadequate in my opinion - but the principle exists for all dangerous substances.
Let us not therefore overlook the effort our fellow Member has made and the victory we have achieved on that front.
Now, having established the principle, we are going to have to see that it is adequately implemented.
That will depend on the Agency's resources - financial resources, human resources - on pressure from the public and on the amount of money that will be devoted to research. Furthermore, on this point, we want the Commission to be particularly proactive in ensuring that this compromise leads to all the progress we are hoping for.
(HU) After three years of debates, we have reached the point where we can give a final judgment on the draft law known as REACH.
Several options are on offer for the vote on Wednesday.
One: we could support the Council's common position.
Two: we can reject the entire proposal.
Three: we can accept the compromise package, and thus bring REACH into existence.
The first and most important question is whether we need new legislation at all, or whether the laws currently in force are adequate for resolving our concerns for environmental protection and human and animal health, and ensuring that the desired amount of information is made available.
In other words, do we need new legislation in order to find out more about the 30 000 chemicals which surround us every day?
The answer is a resounding yes.
We need new, comprehensive regulations, within the framework of which the large-scale, often postponed review of chemicals can be carried out.
The other important question is whether the compromise that has been reached is good enough.
Are the solutions that have been reached better than those of the first reading, or has the legislation simply been diluted and further weakened in the course of the six 'trialogues'?
Let us address these questions one by one: what were our most important goals after the first reading?
We wanted a stronger and stricter substitution, and we have got it.
We wanted to make stricter rules governing manufacturers' responsibility, and we have made them.
We wanted to restrict animal testing, and we have done so.
We wanted a stricter, but practicable registration, and we have achieved it.
We wanted the OSOR principle to prevail and to support SMEs, and this too, we have achieved.
All in all, we can say that the compromise package is much better than the one put forward at first reading; we have fought successfully for a stronger and even stricter REACH.
Ladies and gentlemen, for these reasons, the conclusion cannot be other than to support the compromise.
(DA) Mr President, there are approximately 100 000 chemicals on the market.
We have no knowledge of by far the majority of these chemicals at present.
We do not know what effects they have on the environment and on health.
That, clearly, is completely unacceptable, but it is a state of affairs that we are now tackling by means of REACH, for REACH introduces two basic principles.
Firstly, we are reversing the burden of proof so that, in the future, it will be up to the industry to show that a substance is safe before it can be given permission to market it, whereas, at present, it is up to the authorities to show that a substance is dangerous before they are entitled to ban it.
The second basic principle, and the absolutely most important one, is that the most dangerous substances of all - those that give people cancer and allergies and that affect people's reproductive ability etc - are to be substituted.
If there is an alternative substance that is safer, it must be used instead of the dangerous substance.
That is a very important basic principle.
It is also gratifying that, in future, less use will be made of experiments on animals.
Implementing REACH would lead to far fewer such experiments.
In the short term, there would be quite a few experiments, because we should need to use some data that we do not have at present, but, in the long term, REACH would result in far fewer experiments because of the introduction of compulsory data sharing, which is definitely also an aspect worth including.
All of us have been influenced in this business by many different interest groups.
That much is obvious.
There are major interests at stake, and things could not be otherwise.
There have been the green organisations, on the one hand, and the chemicals organisations and their industry, on the other.
The question is, what is the nature of the compromise we have obtained?
Has the game ended in a draw, as I saw one newspaper article assert?
No, it has not.
We have ended up not with a draw but with a compromise, in which it is clearly the green interests that have won.
It is clearly environmental and health considerations that have won.
In the past we had an open stable door, with the result that a variety of chemicals could, without further ado, be placed on the market and used as one saw fit.
That door has almost been closed.
The door is not completely secure inasmuch as there is still a small chink in it.
In an ideal world we should, of course, have sealed this, but we do not live in an ideal world.
We have achieved a compromise, which is good for the environment and people's health.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the midst of a long debate on the greatest legislative initiative this Parliament has ever had to come to grips with.
My compliments to Mr Sacconi on his work.
As the previous speakers have demonstrated, the text may be voluminous, but it remains open to a very broad interpretation.
This proposal bears the clear imprint of Parliament.
There has been a marked change in the world of chemicals and the faith in their safety since Seveso and Bhopal.
The fact that all the previous speakers welcome the compromise only with reservations is proof that it is relatively balanced.
Now, however, the Council and the Commission are called upon to start up a functional, powerful Agency as quickly as possible.
This will cost money and generate red tape.
The Agency is the key to the functioning of REACH.
The recruitment of sufficient numbers of the relevant experts represents a challenge.
The Agency must work quickly, accurately and without making mistakes so as to improve the reputation of REACH as a model for other states and associations of states.
In my opinion, the issue of intellectual property has been sufficiently regulated.
We shall have to monitor carefully whether we can live with the present form of substitution in the long run, and we shall have to monitor just as carefully the strain the legislative procedure puts on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Only when all aspects are equally successful will REACH have met the requirements arising from the Lisbon process.
REACH must not degenerate into a typecase that is still not full even after two or three decades; Europe will have to be judged on its implementability.
With regard to the overlapping fields, I would make a plea for the deletion of medical devices, as these rules are congruous and adequate in themselves, and leaving medical devices in would mean incalculable delays in the authorisation of medicinal products.
We shall consider in due course whether the present function of REACH is adequate, and whether the rules are too strict or too lax.
We must not use comitology to withdraw from involvement in further developments, but rather must monitor application regularly and with a critical eye.
(ET) I would like to greet our rapporteur Mr Sacconi and congratulate him on his good work and his cogency during the numerous negotiations.
The path that led to this result has been far from easy, but in the end everything we desired has successfully been achieved, by which I mean not only instruments for authorisation and substitution, but also, to a certain extent, compulsory registration.
The legislative framework of REACH is one of the most substantial ever created by the European Union; it may even be one of the most voluminous of any debated in any parliament anywhere in the world.
REACH serves a greater objective in Europe, and in the future will set a good example for the rest of the world.
When one considers the Commission's recommendation and the Council's initial position, Parliament's report has come a long way.
What is, perhaps, most important is that the substitution process will come to include all dangerous substances that are prohibited or have a limited validity permit, with the obligation to plan substitution or, if that is not possible, to develop alternatives.
The law's achievements are the result of active work in Parliament over the last three and a half years.
My own country, Estonia, was not one of the negotiators in the initial phase of the process, but I followed the process that led to the compromises with great interest, and so I would like to emphatically congratulate Parliament for the compromise that has been achieved, and say that I really do hope that the national parliaments will follow our example.
I hope that the compromise package will be accepted at Wednesday's vote in the same form which was agreed upon during the preliminary work.
This would improve the quality of life of the citizens of Europe and serve as a stimulus for small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs with new and high standards for environmental sustainability, which would make our industrial sector more innovative and competitive.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Borrell, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and all those involved in the lengthy and difficult drafting of this text.
Certainly it contains more positive than negative points but I deplore the fact that no chemical safety report will be required for the 17 000 substances produced in amounts of one to ten tonnes.
There is no doubt that the compromise we reached on the authorisation chapter represented a last-ditch effort at reaching an agreement.
In relation to CMRs, however, substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, the process of proper control, which has been retained, is acceptable, apart from the fact that the agreement, which stipulates that the presentation of a research and development plan will be obligatory without at the same time extending the obligation to implementing any such plan, weakens the text.
Consequently, a revision will be needed in six years.
In the general context of the increase in certain types of cancer and reduction in fertility, surely we have a collective ethical responsibility to follow the precautionary principle, especially in relation to hormone disruptors?
In spite of the improvements made to the Commission's text, let us remember that REACH will allow the European chemical industry to keep its place as leader on the world market, that REACH will make a quite new contribution to restoring the confidence of consumers and that the changes to REACH will make it possible to improve the weaknesses in the system.
Mr President, the ball is now in the court of the Commission and the Member States, who will have to see to it that the Agency is operational as soon as possible.
Mr President, in the course of this debate, some speakers from the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups used some intemperate language in relation to Mr Sacconi, members of the PSE Group and others.
It obliges me to put some political realities to them.
Firstly, the Sacconi package is better than the current regulatory system that we have in place.
It is better than the Council's common position.
If they succeed in defeating it by amending it and the possibility that we end up back at square one, then effectively that puts the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups in the pockets of some of the dirtiest and most backward chemical industries in Europe.
We want to make progress in this Parliament, not go backwards.
The strength of Europe and of this Parliament is in identifying the threads of consensus on an issue.
I think that Mr Sacconi, his staff and all the other Members of this Parliament who have participated in this process have successfully identified the thread of consensus and built on it and we have made progress in regulating the chemical industry in Europe.
We do not all have everything we would like; but as long as there are divergent views on how we can achieve a clean, healthy environment in Europe, on how we can control these things, we will have the democratic process to help us to find a solution.
I heartily recommend the Sacconi package and congratulate him and all associated with it.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally after a lengthy and extremely difficult procedure, we are facing a solution regarding the regulation on registering, evaluating and licensing of chemical substances.
The said regulation is a unique opportunity for all of us to achieve a high level of public health and environmental protection, both for us but also for future generations.
I would like to express my support for the solution that Mr Sacconi achieved, to whom we owe congratulations.
Maybe we did want more strict rules or a regulation with broader applications.
What we must note though, is that the primary goal is to activate as soon as possible the control system for dangerous substances, even if there are still issues that need redefinition in the future.
By adopting REACH, the existing legal framework on control of dangerous chemical substances will be strengthened in order to protect the health of European citizens, while at the same time it will boost competitiveness of European industry through innovation and research for the development of safer chemical substances.
REACH is a new, realistic proposal, which we all ought to support by continuing to work on improving it.
We should not send REACH back into the hallways, where it was for so many years, in order for it to become more environmentally friendly and more socialist in nature.
(CS) The negotiated compromise is neither a disaster for European industry, nor a wasted opportunity to improve healthcare for half a billion Europeans.
It is indicative of the desire among MEPs and the EU-25 to find balanced solutions that represent ways forward, rather than barriers, and for this they deserve plaudits, not criticism.
The regulation, in this administratively streamlined version, will undoubtedly bring fresh bureaucracy, for which the Union will be criticised.
This is a clear levy that Europeans will have to pay for getting what they want, namely more detailed information on chemicals in products.
We shall see how this influences consumer behaviour.
I am certain that such information, which costs a great deal of money, will provide fresh impetus for European research into developing useful substitutes and, where the regulation does not provide for substitutes, will safeguard the gradual, natural elimination of various harmful substances from products.
Doctors will continue to carry out strict checks on dangerous substances and rightly so.
Nothing comes for free, however, and industry is therefore right to defend itself against higher costs.
We still cannot overlook the influence on competitiveness and unemployment in the Union for which politicians such as ourselves - and not doctors or industry - are responsible.
One serious shortcoming that I should once again like to highlight is the fact that the new system is solely European, and not global.
Accordingly, despite its undoubted benefits, REACH will place the tightly regulated European economy at a disadvantage in the context of liberalised world trade.
Indeed for this very reason, it offers consumers no protection from the dangers concealed in products from third countries, especially given that the unemployed will buy cheap products, legally or otherwise.
I therefore call on the Commission and the 27 Member States to ensure that European regulations match our ambitions on the world stage, because this is our political responsibility.
It is our duty to try and raise environmental, safety and social standards in manufacturing, both in the Union and in third countries.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Sacconi for accomplishing such a long, hard and difficult task so well.
I would also like to thank the Finnish Presidency.
I am delighted it was under this Presidency that we finally managed to complete the intense work on the development of this regulation.
It has taken a very long time, eight years to be precise, and the fact that nobody is entirely happy with the outcome actually means that the REACH regulation can be adopted.
The chemical industry feels that REACH is overly favourable to the environment.
Environmentalists allege that the regulation was written to suit industry.
This suggests that a compromise was reached which is feasible in view of current social and political conditions.
I wish to make only two further points.
Firstly, if we cast a critical eye over the REACH regulation, we are bound to recognise that this is a single document replacing the 40 different regulations currently in place, and that it will enable us to effectively protect human life and health.
Secondly, this regulation is a distinct improvement on what has existed to date.
If we resolve to continue improving and amending it in the future, I believe we should adopt it.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the EU is often referred to as an incompetent, useless institution that, following enlargement, has become incapable of taking the important, effective joint decisions that are vital for Europe.
I firmly believe that today's debate and the vote on Wednesday on the REACH Directive will be evidence that the exact opposite is true.
The drafting and adoption of the REACH legislation represents a step of both Europe-wide and worldwide significance.
With this legislation, Europe will be creating clear, transparent and fair rules for registering, assessing, authorising and, where necessary, restricting the use of chemicals.
In their final form, these rules will result in the greater protection of public health and the environment, and will enable the European chemicals industry not only to survive, but also, in my view, to strengthen its position in the world.
This is because, through the REACH legislation, it is Europe that will in future determine the rules, standards and trends for the chemicals industry throughout the world.
As with all legislation, REACH represents a compromise, in this case between representatives of the chemicals industry, consumers, environmentalists and animal welfare groups.
It also represents a compromise between the representatives of large chemical firms and SMEs.
Speaking as an MEP from the Czech Republic, a medium-sized country in which SMEs dominate chemical production, I am sure that, once the initial costs have been absorbed, the REACH legislation will enable the consolidation and further development of these SMEs, including the creation of more and more jobs.
I shall therefore be voting in favour of the REACH Directive in Wednesday's vote.
(HU) Fellow Members, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur and all those who have helped and perfected his work with their questions and their support over the past years.
I would like to underline that for us, representatives from the Eastern European states, this is a legislative project that in two important instances expresses our own proposals made in committee debates and successfully incorporated into Parliament as well.
One is the Maltese-Slovenian proposal, the other the Hungarian-British, so-called OSOR initiative.
This in itself makes possible savings of 10 billion Ft for Hungarian small and medium-sized enterprises.
This is further proof that we have managed to harmonise the health and environmental protection considerations with the small entrepreneur's cost-bearing capability.
Therefore, I would like to welcome this compromise.
As a member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am especially pleased that the requirement of providing consumer information was finally built into the compromise proposal.
I believe this will be very important to all participants, since this will allow us to assess the results of REACH.
I sincerely hope that all the work we have accomplished in the course of lawmaking will not be undone during implementation.
My congratulations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regarding all the positions that have been voiced, even the most critical ones, and those who are preparing to vote for the common position, without supporting a package that improves it, I should just like to say that there is freedom in this Parliament and that we shall remain on good terms as before.
There is, however, an argument that I have to demolish.
Somebody spoke of hundreds of dangerous substances that would be freely released on the market, and someone even said that 90% of dangerous substances would be authorised: in other words, the compromise puts in place a kind of licence to kill.
All this distortion is supposed to have happened during the last night of negotiations.
That is not true.
I can only give you an estimate, because only REACH will tell us the actual numbers, but the most reliable estimates say that roughly 2 500 substances will be subject to the authorisation procedure.
With the compromise, there should be less than 200 substances that can be authorised on the basis of adequate control - which is not a licence to kill, but involves a risk assessment.
In any case, because of the way in which we have restructured the compromise, even for these substances a substitution plan must necessarily be submitted where an alternative exists, or a research and development plan where there is no alternative.
Nobody, therefore, can deny the fact that all substances that are authorised will be included in a process that sooner or later will lead to their substitution.
If anyone was thinking that substitution would be made compulsory by decree, they would be voting on something that I have never put forward, either at first reading or in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
What I really cannot accept is what has been said about the negotiating process having been non-transparent and undemocratic.
I met the shadow rapporteurs before and after all the negotiating rounds; I kept them informed; and, right up to the last round, there was very broad agreement on the negotiating mandate that I took to the negotiating table.
Lastly, I should like to thank my friend Carl Schlyter for having returned the apple from a year ago.
I shall eat it tomorrow.
He, however, kept it, and he showed me something in a glass jar that is a real ecological disaster in the making.
Still in the fruit and vegetable department, I should like to tell you something that I was taught by my old trade union negotiating master.
He was an old worker who had been through a lot and had made plenty of sacrifices.
He told me, 'You must not be like a walnut, which is hard on the outside and soft inside; you have to be like a peach, soft on the outside and hard inside.'
That is the negotiating line that I follow.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for a very interesting and very open debate.
There has been some pretty frank talk here.
The discussion showed that there is still a range of views on REACH in Parliament, and why should there not be?
In my opinion, it is very understandable and natural that that should be the case.
On the other hand, the debate showed that very many Members of Parliament are prepared to seek the best outcome possible in this situation through compromise.
It appears that the wish that I expressed in my first speech will come true in the vote the day after tomorrow on Wednesday.
It would seem that there is now a sufficient number who desire a compromise.
I am certain and convinced that the result of these compromises is that we in the European Union will have the most progressive legislation on chemicals in the world.
After the voting has taken place, the serious work will then begin: the Regulation's implementation.
The practical work will start on the control of the 30 000 chemicals now on the European markets.
I believe that this work will mean that we will be doing our children, our grandchildren, nature, the environment and everywhere we live a great service.
With these words, then, once and for all I want to thank the Members of Parliament, and the rapporteur especially, as well as the Chairman of the Committee and our partners more generally in Parliament and the Commission.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make just two brief comments.
Some of the participants in this debate, who I can no longer see here at the moment, have expressed the criticism that the REACH project would reduce the level of protection for employees in the chemicals industry.
I can state conclusively that that is pure nonsense.
REACH cannot reduce the level of protection in the chemicals industry.
The relevant provisions on worker protection remain in full force.
REACH does not permit anything that was previously prohibited.
Quite on the contrary, employees will no longer be expected to deal with a whole string of substances for which they were previously responsible.
At all events, therefore, REACH brings about a clear improvement in the safety of employees in the workplace.
Therefore, I must reject unambiguously this argument on the part of Members of Parliament who are acting as though they are representatives of workers' interests.
My second point is that many speakers have rightly pointed out that the important thing now is to implement REACH fully as well as transparently, resolutely and with the avoidance of unnecessary red tape.
This requires an endless number of initiatives, projects and measures - I could list them all to the House, but there is not enough time.
I have already spoken to the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and offered to visit the committee in February and present a detailed report on the measures the Commission has either already taken or plans to take with regard to the implementation of REACH.
At the same time, I should like to attach particular importance to answering all the questions that have been asked here about support for European SMEs and a relaxation of the requirements imposed on them, and about the many hundreds of thousands of employees affected.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I have listened carefully to the speeches of the distinguished Members of the European Parliament and I appreciate the positive and constructive contributions and the well-intentioned criticisms.
The Commission supports the compromise amendments, which, on the one hand, aim to make significant improvements in the protection of human health and the environment and, on the other, to enhance innovation and maintain economic growth.
I believe that one of the most important elements of the agreement we have on the table, as Mrs Corbey underlined, is the substitution of the most dangerous substances with safer alternatives when these are available.
I can say that in certain aspects this compromise is an improvement compared with the original Commission proposal, for example the authorisation in general is stricter.
I can fully support making it obligatory for companies' applications for authorisation to include substitution plans for substances of very high concern - manufactured or imported - if the companies have identified the availability of suitable alternatives.
I can also fully agree that these substitution plans should be key factors in the decision to grant authorisations and in any further revision of such authorisations.
The vote last October in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety may have raised hopes for an even more ambitious result, as Mr Bowis said.
Like many of the speakers this evening, I would also like to stay at the top of the mountain and would have preferred certain issues to have been dealt with differently in the final deal.
For example, as Mr Davies and Mrs Hassi have underlined, the rules on substances which disturb the hormone system - the so-called endocrine disruptors - could be stricter.
Mrs Lucas and others do not accept that the possibility to keep the scientific names of new dangerous substances confidential for six years would be beneficial to the overall deal.
This denies consumers the right to know which substances they are dealing with and it also makes it more difficult for users to identify the substances in various databases.
Last but not least, as Mrs Ek, Mrs Ferreira, and others have suggested, the obligation to provide a chemical safety report for the most dangerous substances in the lower production volumes would have been useful to further enhance worker protection.
Nevertheless, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt underlined, a compromise is a compromise and this compromise package is a marked improvement for the protection of health and the environment if we compare it to the current situation.
The Commission can fully support the compromise package and I sincerely hope that Parliament will support this package during the vote on Wednesday.
Throughout this process the Commission has done its best to facilitate agreement between the Council and Parliament and to find balanced compromises.
We very much welcome the convergence developed between Parliament and the Council and fully support this agreement so that REACH can be enforced by June 2007.
Once again, I am grateful to Mr Sacconi and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts to achieve this compromise.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Community Customs Code - Customs 2013 programme (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the reports:
by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) C6-0419/2005, and
by Mrs Fourtou, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2013) C6-0158/2006.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as well as the other committees involved, and in particular Mrs Fourtou as rapporteur for the reports to be discussed tonight.
The modernisation of the European customs environment is an essential contribution to attaining the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. It is a must if we want the European Union to remain an attractive place to do business and maintain the external competitiveness of EU companies.
In this context, it is crucial to deepen the single market by making the EU a fully-integrated customs territory.
This reform is also critical if we want to live up to the challenges of globalisation and reinforce the role of customs in protecting our citizens and companies from security and safety hazards such as counterfeiting, dangerous goods or the devices of international terrorism.
The modernised Community Customs Code will provide the legal framework for the development of a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade based on the best use of information and communication technology.
The present Community Customs Code was adapted in 1992.
Since then, it has undergone only limited changes. This means that the Code has not kept pace with the radical changes to the environment in which customs and traders operate, particularly in respect of the rapid and irreversible adoption of electronic data exchange.
The Customs Code has to be adapted to fit the electronic environment.
In addition, it is commonly held by customs authorities and traders alike that current customs procedure and processes are unnecessarily complicated.
They also do not reflect the changing focus of customs work, moving from the collection of declining customs duties towards the application of non-tariff measures.
This includes, in particular, security and safety measures, the fight against counterfeiting, money laundering and drugs and the application of sanitary, health and consumer protection measures.
With your support, the proposal for a modernised Customs Code on the table tonight, together with the proposals on the Council table and e-customs, will make customs work better, faster and more cheaply.
Let me once again and now more specifically turn to Mrs Fourtou and the Committee on the Internal Market for their detailed and most valuable assessment of the Commission's proposal for a modernised Customs Code.
I know there is unanimous support in the Committee on the Internal Market for the rapporteur's recommendations.
Progress in the Council is complementing your work.
I am pleased to report that on 4 December the Competitiveness Council showed a keen interest in the key elements of the reform.
Ministers gave strong support to the Commission's proposals on the single window, on centralised clearance and on customs agents, while inviting the Commission to pursue the work to implement these in an acceptable manner for all Member States.
I would like to thank Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate on these three issues, but I must also inform you that in at least one of them the Commission's position remains unchanged.
Thus it is the Commission's firm opinion that the accreditation of professional customs agents is not a matter for the Customs Code.
There is a future for the profession in an open competitive market, through self-regulation and the recognition provided by the status of authorised economic operator.
Though there is no debate on the e-customs proposal tonight, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur Mr Heaton-Harris and the Committee on the Internal Market for its full support for an extremely ambitious Commission proposal.
It is indeed challenging to propose that all Member States and the Commission commit themselves to developing common electronic systems for customs proposals by an agreed date.
Let me stress that the firm support from Parliament is more than welcome in order to convince Member States that, despite budgetary constraints, they need to develop their customs IT system in a Community framework.
I am confident that the Council will acknowledge this step and the proposal can soon be adopted.
I very much appreciate the efforts of the European Parliament and particularly those of Mrs Fourtou to come to an agreement in a single reading on the Customs 2013 proposal. This will definitely ensure the continuity of the programme activities as of 1 January 2008.
The speedy adoption of Customs 2013 shows that there is a broad agreement across all the institutions on the obvious need to guarantee the effective functioning of the internal market in the customs field.
Indeed, the customs environment is undergoing major changes.
The Customs 2013 programme will be an essential instrument to ensure efficient cooperation and coordination between all customs administrations.
It will facilitate the introduction of new trans-European computerised systems, reinforce networks between customs officials and promote and establish common training modules.
Once the two customs proposals under debate and the e-customs proposal are finally adopted by both Parliament and the Council, they will enable the customs services of the EU to meet the major challenges.
They will facilitate international trade, foster simpler control and will more effectively protect the internal market and the health, safety and security of our citizens through more efficient control.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'modernised Customs Code', 'paperless Customs', 'Customs 2013 programme', these three reports that we are discussing in this session demonstrate the growing importance of customs and their role in the European Union's desire for competitiveness and efficiency.
These three reports are closely linked but, in the interests of greater clarity, I shall first present the modernised Customs Code and then move on to the Customs 2013 programme.
The Customs Code - as you said, Mr Kovacs - dates from 1992.
It was legitimate to modernise it in order to adapt it to the evolving range of tasks undertaken by Customs and the radical changes that have taken place in international trade.
It is a matter of rationalising customs procedures by laying the foundations of customs clearance systems that are accessible and interoperable within the European Union.
That is why this proposal is accompanied by a proposal for a decision on electronic customs, for which Mr Heaton-Harris is the rapporteur.
The new Code includes 200 articles and we have concentrated on the principal points, or at least the most controversial points, that is, the customs representative, the authorised economic operator, centralised customs clearance and comitology.
Article 11 is concerned with the customs representative.
Until now, national legislation has made it possible to reserve the right of representation to a professional category.
In the context of the Single Market and the electronic environment, however, there is no longer any grounds for this monopoly.
Furthermore, some businesses are able to have an integrated service that takes care of customs formalities.
The right to customs representation, therefore, must be open to all.
Nonetheless, in many Member States, using a customs agent is traditional and remains very useful for small businesses.
That is why, without wishing to retain a monopoly, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted an amendment that, among the criteria for the status of customs representative, provides for recognition of the existence of practical standards of competence or professional qualifications in order to satisfy those Member States for whom the abolition of this monopoly is difficult to accept.
We have not yet found the ideal solution and this question will certainly be raised again at second reading because certain delegations within the Council are still expressing reservations and going so far as to demand regulated access to the profession.
The authorised economic operator was introduced into the Customs Code by means of Regulation 648 of 13 April 2005, known as the 'security regulation'.
This statute is not yet properly in existence because the provisions for its implementation have just been adopted by the Commission.
The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has introduced a clarification, making a clear distinction between the 'customs simplification' Authorised Economic Operator, and the 'security and safety' Authorised Economic Operator.
Centralised customs clearance is a facilitation that, in principle, has been well received but the Member States are wondering about the collection of customs duties.
The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has adopted a fairly radical position in demanding that electronic customs clearance operations should be free of charge and that customs-offices should be open 24 hours a day.
Indeed, in the interests of fair competition between national customs authorities, the rule must apply to all.
It is necessary, however, to ensure that there is harmonisation of the checking processes.
Finally, the provisions in the proposal make constant reference to comitology.
This procedure is necessary because reference needs to be made to experts to establish the provisions for implementation of the Code.
In accordance with the new interinstitutional agreement of July 2006, certain provisions of the Code are subject to the new procedure for comitology with scrutiny.
Therefore, having sought the opinion of the European Parliament's legal service, we have adopted, in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, amendments that are aimed at adapting the comitology procedure corresponding to the different articles.
The Committee on International Trade adopted amendments for the codecision procedure for certain provisions that would normally fall within their competence by virtue of the strengthened cooperation procedure.
We considered, however, that its position was contrary to that of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and we had to reject those amendments.
Those then, very briefly, are the main points of the report and, as I said just now, it is very closely linked with the report concerning the Customs 2013 programme.
Reading the mid-term evaluation of the Customs 2007 programme has demonstrated that this programme is well adapted to the needs of administrations and that it plays a crucial role in helping participating countries to share their experiences.
This evaluation recommended strengthening the activities carried out in the field of training and information exchange.
The programme has a budget of EUR 322.8 million over a period of six years and its aim is to help the customs administrations of the participating countries to encourage legitimate exchanges, to simplify and speed up customs procedures and to ensure the safety and security of citizens and the financial interests of the Community.
The amendments adopted in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection are in line with the work of the Council and I wish to thank the Finnish Presidency in particular because, in order to satisfy the European Parliament's legitimate budgetary demands, it has on many occasions negotiated with Member States and defended our position.
Therefore, we shall be able, I hope, to conclude this matter at first reading.
The reports concerning customs are eminently technical and complicated.
That is why I wish to thank most warmly the various people I have spoken to within the Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union who have always responded to my every request and allowed me to tackle these subjects more easily.
I thank also my fellow Members and the Chairman of our Committee for their help and support.
At a time when trade is speeding up, when organised crime and counterfeiting threaten our security and our market, customs and economic operators need our full support.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, Commissioner, I wish to congratulate you on the important work that you and your services have accomplished in the interests of modernisation of customs legislation, which is a necessary condition for the good functioning of our internal market.
I should like also to warmly congratulate Mrs Fourtou who made some very useful proposals for improvement.
With regard to international trade, I shall make three comments concerning questions of competence between committees, comitology and, lastly, the parliamentary dimension in international trade.
I think, Mr President, that there must be an end to rivalry over competence between the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on International Trade or, at the very least, these rivalries must not delay the adoption of European legislation that our internal market so desperately needs.
It is not sensible to deny the link between international trade and the issue of Community customs.
At a time when Europe is being closely watched, I regret that Rule 47 of our Rules of Procedure has been violated in respect of strengthened cooperation between committees, because the amendments voted for unanimously by the Committee on International Trade have been brushed aside in an irregular manner and will not, alas, be put to the vote in plenary.
I am delighted, however, that our amendments have brought to light an abusive use of comitology procedures by the European Commission.
I hope that, in the end, it will be forced to use the new comitology procedure with scrutiny, which came out of the interinstitutional agreement of July 2006.
On that subject, it will be important to clarify the use of Article 194(c), and the European Commission will have to assure us that it does not intend to modify the Community Customs Code according to an international trade agreement concluded by it under Article 133 of the Treaty on European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the failure of the Doha agenda harms the rules of international trade, we must protect our producers and our consumers from security and safety problems thanks to border controls.
In this context, never has the parliamentary dimension of international trade been so important, particularly in relation to the functioning of Community customs.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members who have cooperated on this difficult dossier; above all Mrs Fourtou, who has fought her way through this complex set of rules with great success.
The rapporteur for our group, Mr Heaton-Harris, unfortunately cannot be here today, and so, as the coordinator with competence for this dossier, I shall be speaking on his behalf and that of the group today, if I may.
The Community Customs Code is an extremely important project, which will remove persisting hurdles in the European internal market and, particularly with regard to piracy and intellectual property, has global significance.
For example, it enables centralised clearance at an enterprise's headquarters, which is important to the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, in particular.
I think that this report on the Modernised Customs Code helps to simplify existing customs procedures and will also help to improve the competitiveness of European enterprises.
I should like to focus on just a few points.
From the outset, one critical point was Article 14 on authorised economic operators, about which Mrs Fourtou has spoken.
I think that the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has reached a good compromise on this, one which gives these persons greater freedom in the performance of their activities.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will therefore withdraw its Amendment 57 and support the compromise reached in the Committee on Internal Market.
This compromise makes clear that we want our enterprises to enjoy greater freedom, and we should also communicate to the outside world that the regulations of the Modernised Customs Code have been drawn up for our enterprises and in their favour.
The Community Customs Code will not be an obstacle to greater competitiveness.
Finally, I should like to highlight and champion the amendment to Article 125 that was tabled by Mr Heaton-Harris on behalf of our group.
This article enables Member States to introduce simplifications beyond the scope of the Customs Code, within the framework of bilateral or multinational agreements.
The old Customs Code already included the possibility of closer cooperation, and so this possibility is already being used in practice.
It would be detrimental to our enterprises if we were to now abolish this framework, and I believe that that also accords well with the thoughts of Mr Audy.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I have the feeling that, with regard to this issue, disputes amongst MEPs, as such, have been kept to a minimum, particularly with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats having withdrawn its Amendment 57.
I believe that Mrs Fourtou and the Commission's services in the TAXUD Directorate-General have done a wonderful job and have explained an issue that appeared to be complex in a very clear fashion, but we still have a few amendments that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is insisting on presenting.
I believe that the first group of amendments raises no difficulties, since it involves adapting the comitology proposals to the new comitology agreement between Parliament and the other institutions.
With regard to the other amendments, there are still certain issues outstanding, such as the issue of representatives at customs.
A significant proportion of Members of this House, at least, believe that customs activities require a degree of professional dedication and cannot be replaced with an abstract freedom to carry out customs activities.
There are too many considerations of a personnel nature, including security considerations, which make this a legitimate profession that must be maintained and must not be eliminated on the basis of a liberalisation theory that has nothing to do with reality.
The amendments presented by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the economic operators authorised and also, particularly for consumers and citizens, on free electronic customs processing and the twenty-four hour provision of these services, also seem to me to be positive.
I believe that it would be a good thing to simplify customs procedures, which are usually very complex and which hinder the internal market.
I - like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in general - am therefore in favour of the amendments presented by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
I believe that Mr Audy is absolutely right to raise the issue of comitology, but I believe that, in accordance with the reports that we have received from the legal services, the only possible solution is the one adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and that the problem is not one of confrontation amongst committees but, rather, one of our all having to adjust to this situation, in view of the current reality.
I do not therefore believe that there is any kind of problem between the two committees.
In short, Mr President, we are in agreement with Mrs Fourtou's report; I believe that we could reach an agreement very quickly amongst the three institutions in order to approve the two reports, and we hope that this Parliament will approve the amendments from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs without any great difficulty.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, I should firstly like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, for the splendid job she has done.
In general, there is no rule without its exceptions, and that is a good thing.
Our European Union does not consist only of Member States that should be covered in full by the Community's customs regulations.
The EU also consists of territories that, for historical and other reasons, have in different ways been forced to place themselves outside the Community's harmonisation of indirect taxation.
Such territories include the Ãland Islands, which belong to Finland, the Channel Islands, the Canaries, Agios Oros in Greece and the overseas French departments.
It is important for both the European Union and its territories that trade between them be able to take place as smoothly as possible.
Because these territories are very different even from each other in terms of their trade with the European Union, it is important that it be made possible to introduce special exemptions for them.
This would benefit the European Union and our efforts to achieve the objectives in terms of the Lisbon Agenda.
Special arrangements for these areas would not disrupt trade within the Community, and we should, of course, all benefit from the smooth flow of trade and from the fact that unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles had not been erected.
I am therefore pleased that, in its report, the committee has taken note of this need and adopted a pragmatic approach.
My hope now is that the Council and the Commission too will meet Parliament half way on these points.
Bilateral arrangements too must be possible in certain cases.
It is important for the EU to respond to the population's special needs and not to get hung up on standard solutions that are appropriate for many but not for everyone.
I am pleased that the reform of the Customs Code can also help strengthen people's confidence in the EU, which has, of course, seriously wavered recently.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Parliament and Council Regulation laying down the Community Customs Code is a document amounting to a thorough modernisation of the Customs Code in force since 1992.
This modernisation is required in view of the radical changes that have taken place in the area of international trade.
Accordingly, the regulation aims to simplify customs legislation and procedure.
It is designed to benefit commercial entities and customs administrations, to reduce the cost of customs formalities and to respond to commercial challenges involving safety and protection, detecting counterfeiting and money laundering and also protecting health and the environment.
The new Community Customs Code goes beyond simplifying certain procedures.
Fundamental changes in Customs legislation have been undertaken in a number of areas.
This document is inextricably linked to the report on computerisation of Customs procedures.
The decision taken by Parliament and the Council concerning an electronic environment for customs authorities and traders provides for the creation and application of safe, interoperable and accessible electronic customs systems which should simplify and improve flow along the supply chain and also customs procedures.
The third proposal establishing an action programme for duties in the Community 'Customs-2013' intensifies cooperation between customs administrations and their officials.
Trans-European information networks are provided for, to facilitate the completion of customs formalities in the internal market and allowing products to be taxed according to national and Community tax legislation within the market.
This programme plays a key role in the harmonious operation of the internal market and the management of the Union's external borders.
It also contributes to attaining the Commission's objectives for the years 2005-2009 and the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
(FR) Mr President, a codification is a moment of intelligence: one moves away from law to which one is subjected to law that has been thought out.
I am therefore very pleased about the reports on customs codification by our fellow Members and friends, Mrs Fourtou and Mr Audy, particularly because, since 1919 in the case of Germany, 1934-35 for France, 1938 for Mexico, and so on, we had lost our codifying ambition.
Here, of course - let us not be naÃ¯ve - we are codifying the customs rules simply because of pressure from the United States after 11 September, who want customs that are no longer to do with budgets but with security: hence the addition of control by authorised economic operator, by customs representatives, and so on.
Beyond this little codification, however, we shall have to think of a customs codification that is legally equal to the challenges of globalisation.
Since maritime law was codified at Montego Bay in the 1970s, and since International Trade Law was codified at Marrakesh in the 1990s, the 21st century will have to devise a customs codification at the only level appropriate to international trade, that is, at global level.
The place for working towards this model of a global code exists: it is the World Customs Organisation in Brussels, in partnership with the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.
The sources of inspiration for this model code exist too: it is the Tokyo Convention and the Brussels Convention on customs value and rules of origin.
There remains the purpose of this model for a customs code, that is, a revolution in customs technology, so that we can move out of the current archaic system and have customs duties that can be adjusted, reimbursed, subsidised and negotiated.
Adjusted according to the production cost differential between one country and another; reimbursed, in the form of a customs credit offered by the importing country to the exporting country; subsidised, in favour of exporting countries of the South, who would receive a customs credit supplement; negotiated, finally, in the stock exchange like the protectionist pollution quotas.
In this way we shall at last achieve a reconciliation between international free trade, which is necessary and national social protection, which is equally necessary.
This is the marriage of David Ricardo, the free trader, and Friedrich List, the protectionist.
(SK) To begin with, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Fourtou and Mr Heaton-Harris, for their work in drafting these technically demanding reports.
From the very beginning, the Customs Union has been considered a cornerstone of the European Community.
The Customs Code is a practical instrument that ensures smooth trans-border trade, and it should therefore take into consideration the new challenges of a globalising economy.
The creation and subsequent implementation of a modernised Customs Code is a logical and essential prerequisite for the effective development of the European market.
The proposal reflects efforts to create a customs and trade environment based on improved effectiveness of customs clearance procedures through information exchange, elimination of the administrative burden, and facilitation of trade at European and international levels.
In this age of technology, an electronic system offers new opportunities for the quicker and more effective implementation of commonly recognised standards.
The proposal offers a unique opportunity to overcome existing discrepancies between the customs systems of Member States, as it will ensure enhanced interoperability of national systems, which we have so far failed to encourage adequately.
At present, security-related issues are becoming a priority, and the proposal therefore also focuses on this area.
It includes specific measures to secure external borders, as well as data protection.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that these proposals will be accepted during the vote.
If they are not, we would paradoxically be blocking the free trade that we are actually striving to facilitate.
(PT) Mr President, to whom I extend my warmest greetings, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally welcome this initiative and commend the rapporteurs on the quality of their work.
This initiative is of the highest importance, given that the code currently in force dates back to 1992.
It must be modernised to reflect the changes that have since taken place and must address those changes.
There are two aspects that strike me as crucial. Firstly, this new code will help boost international trade because simplifying the processes may lead to an increase in the competitiveness of European businesses, and thus to stronger economic growth.
To this end, opening up to new technologies - as well as placing greater value on those technologies and even enforcing their use - represents a highly significant step that should help strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy.
That being said, there is a second point that must be highlighted, which relates to the nature of the current functions of customs.
Security needs to be increased at various levels to protect public health, to ensure food safety and to combat crimes such as money laundering, counterfeiting and fraud more effectively.
In other words, consumers must be better protected.
I should like to conclude by saying that this proposal is a positive step towards safeguarding more effectively the interests of Europeans both as manufacturers and as consumers.
As such, we naturally endorse the proposal.
Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her work on this issue.
I wish, however, to talk about one specific issue regarding customs policies.
The single biggest problem currently facing the EU in relation to its customs policies is the unwillingness of the Turkish Government to implement the Ankara Protocol.
Turkey promised the European Union 18 months ago that it would do so and that, accordingly, Turkish ports and airports would be open to Cypriot ships and air traffic.
Turkey has failed to honour this political commitment, which is a central element of the Turkish accession negotiations to join the European Union.
Last week, Turkey offered to open one port to Cypriot traffic.
This offer was not even given in writing to the Finnish Presidency, and, even so, it falls well short of the commitment given by the Turkish Government that it would implement the Protocol.
It is now very likely that up to eight chapters of Turkey's accession negotiations with the European Union will be suspended some time this week, which is the recommendation of the European Commission.
On a broader level, Turkey faces the real possibility that EU accession talks may be fully suspended in time if it does not implement the Ankara Protocol and open up Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot traffic.
(EL) Mr President, I consider the speech of the previous speaker quite useful and definitely well timed and I would like to endorse everything he said.
However, I will not just stop at what he said; I would like to refer to the main subject of today's discussion by saying that technology, the Lisbon Strategy and the logic behind the common market force us to modernise the Customs Code.
The delicate position of the customs representatives and their particular professional nature necessitates the specification of certain criteria for the proper performance of their activities, without these criteria having a negative effect on the internal market or the free transportation of services.
This is the equation we have to solve.
Therefore, we have amended Article 11 of the new Customs Code, so that there is no numerical limitation in this particular profession, the recognition of customs representatives throughout the European Union Member States is established and, of course, there is free competition in the sector, in general.
On the other hand, several of my colleagues, including me, have insisted that the criterion of practical standards or professional qualifications for individuals who wish to become customs representatives must be precisely specified.
This is because the usefulness of the profession will be acknowledged as well as the considerable services they offer to companies as well as to the customs authorities, and primarily it will ensure the safety and protection of the public's interests.
Therefore, I believe that with the proposal submitted today by the European Parliament we achieve a proper balance; in that context I would like to thank Mrs Fourtou for her efforts to arrive at this useful compromise within the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that if we wish to create a common market according to the provisions of the Lisbon Strategy and become a considerable competitive power on a global scale, we have no other choice but to effectively meet these trade challenges and adapt to the rapid technological developments.
To this purpose, not only do we have to eliminate bureaucratic customs procedures but also amend the laws that govern them, in depth.
Even though our goal is to simplify commercial transactions between Member States while at the same time safeguarding security and protection of European citizens, such a goal would not be feasible without the presence of customs representatives, namely specialised professionals with certified knowledge.
Therefore, I consider it necessary to issue accreditation to the right individuals using the most commonly accepted criteria.
I consider that customs brokers provide the necessary guarantee of knowledge and experience for the execution of customs operations and therefore they must be considered accredited customs representatives.
Let us not forget that they exist as a profession in the vast majority of Member States and they serve an important role to the benefit of all financial agents and especially for small- to medium-sized enterprises whose activities are of vital importance to European growth.
To conclude, I should like to stress that modernising the Customs Code cannot in any way be identified as deregulation of the labour market of serious professionals who historically have proven their effectiveness.
(PL) Mr President, the European Union's customs system should serve two main purposes.
Firstly, it should protect the Community's economic and financial interests and secondly, it should facilitate legal trade exchanges and the acceleration and simplification of customs formalities.
Unfortunately, despite the existence of the Customs 2007 Programme and the allocation of almost EUR 150 million, these aims have not been fully achieved.
One only has to consider the negative impact on the Community market of large-scale smuggling of alcohol and tobacco products, and recently also of liquid fuels.
Not only does the scale of this organised smuggling destabilise the internal market, but the Union's budget also suffers as it is deprived of the hundreds of millions of euro it should obtain from customs duties.
This state of affairs also has an impact on the trade in foodstuffs.
Products often appear for sale on this market at prices significantly lower than the cost of production, which indicates that the customs system has been evaded.
This happened recently on the poultry market in Poland, and over the last two years there have also been problems with frozen strawberries from China.
The second purpose of the customs system, namely facilitating trade exchanges, is not being fulfilled.
This is particularly obvious along the European Union's eastern border with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.
Tiresome procedures, corruption and queues of vehicles stretching back for miles all contribute to making it unattractive to export goods from the European Union.
I very much hope that the EUR 323 million allocated for the implementation of the Customs 2013 programme will allow significant improvements to be made.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the honourable Members for their valuable contributions to the debate and for the positive attitude towards the Commission's proposals.
The Commission has given appropriate consideration to Parliament's 58 amendments to the Modernised Customs Code and has found the majority - as many as 32 - acceptable, 9 acceptable in principle or in part and only 17 unacceptable.
I would point out that those amendments which the Commission finds unacceptable are related to the key issues that I highlighted earlier and that are commonly debated by both Parliament and the Council.
I must reiterate that as regards customs representation - Amendments 14, 19 and 57 - the Commission maintains that the accreditation of professional customs agents falls outside the scope of the Customs Code.
The Commission fully recognises the role played by customs agents in the world of trade.
These agents, like any other economic operator, should have the right to exercise their profession in another Member State, and professional competence in one Member State should be recognised in another.
This is a basic feature of the single market and essential in an electronic environment.
The Commission is actively working with the professional associations, like CLECAT and CONFIAD, listening to their concerns and trying to find a satisfactory solution.
The proposed change offers substantial benefits to business in general, such as increased competition between customs service providers, and opens new and wider business opportunities for customs representatives beyond national borders.
On comitology, I believe that our legal services have come to conclusions that are not too dissimilar.
There are indeed a few articles where the Commission considers that the regulatory procedure, its scrutiny, should not apply, but in most cases our institutions' respective analyses are converging.
I should like to clarify why the Commission cannot support certain amendments.
The first I should mention is Amendment 21, which suggests that in Article 22(1), the words 'administrative and criminal' be deleted.
All Member States impose criminal penalties in customs matters and apply, even if they are not always described as administrative penalties, measures of an administrative nature intended to penalise non-compliance with the customs rules.
There is, for example, the withdrawal or suspension of authorisations in case of serious misuse.
Such administrative measures play an essential role in the uniform and proportionate application of customs legislation.
It is therefore necessary that Article 22(1), continues to refer explicitly to both administrative and criminal treatment of infringements.
The Commission cannot agree with Amendments 23 and 25 relating to customs fees.
The Commission's intentions are simply to limit, as far as possible, the charging of customs fees; in particular, such fees should not be charged for the drawing-up of electronic declarations.
On the other hand, we find it inappropriate to prevent the collection of fees where attendance of customs staff is requested beyond the normal office hours.
We hold the view that customs fees are only legitimate where customs render a service that goes beyond their normal mission.
I should also mention Amendments 30, 40 and 41, which aim at granting benefits to railway companies.
The Commission cannot accept them, because they are going against our efforts to build up a level playing field for all transport operators, be they road, inland waterways or air transporters.
In fact, the original proposals are likely to have been misunderstood and I am confident that once further explained their rationale and fairness will become obvious.
In conclusion, I can assure you that these issues can and will be urgently and seriously addressed.
The Commission is confident that, given the spirit of openness and cooperation that has marked the consultations to date both in Parliament and in the Council, practical and appropriate solutions will be found so that the Modernised Customs Code can enter into force as planned in 2009.
With regard to the customs 2013 programme proposal, I confirm that the Commission fully supports all the amendments proposed by Parliament.
I hope that the report by Mrs Fourtou will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority.
Let me finish by repeating that the strong support by the European Parliament for the e-customs proposal will certainly be acknowledged by the Council and speed up the adoption of the proposal.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Prevention of injury and promotion of safety (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Sinnott, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the prevention of injury and the promotion of safety C6-0238/2006.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, may I first express my thanks for all the hard work done by the members of the committees concerned with the Commission's proposal for a Council recommendation on the prevention of injury and the promotion of safety.
Let me acknowledge in particular the effort made by Mrs Sinnott in respect of this important initiative.
I should also like to express my thanks to the Austrian Presidency for hosting a conference during its term, which also contributed to this issue.
The Commission started to support actions in the area of injury prevention under the former EU programme on injury prevention and has continued its support under the current public health programme.
Injuries represent, as you know, after cardiovascular disease, cancer and respiratory diseases, the fourth most common cause of death in the Member States.
Every year, some 235 000 EU citizens die as a result of an accident or violence.
Over 50 million citizens seek medical treatment for injuries and 6.8 million of those are admitted to hospital.
Injuries, unintentional and intentional, are estimated to be the main cause of chronic disability in young people, leading to an enormous loss of life-years in good health.
Among people over 65, accidents and injuries are also a major cause of death and disability and are often the trigger for a fatal deterioration in health.
Areas that have attracted less attention in the past include home, leisure and sports accidents, as well as accidents in vulnerable population groups, such as children, adolescents and elderly people.
Research shows that more than 50 % of serious accidents are preventable and that reduction by one quarter should be a realistic target over the next 10 years.
But, of course, it is of the utmost importance to have reliable information on injuries in Europe in order to plan actions.
Injury information is also essential for evaluating the outcome of all our efforts and actions.
The Commission has set out a Community action plan on injury prevention and safety promotion in its communication 'Action for a Safer Europe'.
Member States are encouraged to create similar national plans for injury prevention.
Such plans should serve as a framework for actions that engage relevant partners and stakeholders. They should define institutional responsibilities and should be based on good practice and safety promotion.
The Council recommendation on the prevention of injury and the promotion of safety is a first step towards combining the efforts of the Commission with those of the Member States for actions for a safer Europe, in order to reduce the individual and societal burden of injuries.
Through such a joint approach, through learning from each other's experiences, we can have faster and more effective results.
We hope and expect that the situation within the Member States in relation to accidents and injuries will improve significantly in years to come.
Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee.
I am looking forward to a very interesting debate.
rapporteur. - Mr President, injuries can take or change a life in a split second.
They can be accidental, inflicted or self-inflicted.
Injuries cause the death of a quarter of a million people and result in 65 hospital admissions every year.
The challenge, when dealing with something as widespread, serious and preventable as injury, is to save lives and preserve health.
For that reason I felt both challenged and privileged to work on this report.
In this report, which particularly focuses on injury data collection, I have recommended that to promote safety and prevent injury we need better-quality data.
It is not helpful in terms of prevention to know the overall number of road fatalities.
We need to know what it was that made the fatal difference.
Was it the condition or type of vehicle; was the victim the driver, a passenger or someone walking along the road; were drink, speed or bad weather conditions involved; what was the road like?
That is the type of breakdown we need in every area of injury if we are going to save lives.
We cannot hope to closely examine every injury but we should and must create a system of data collection that more closely examines the injury determinants of all fatal and seriously disabling injuries, to prevent them more effectively in the future.
That is my approach in the report, which the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety strongly supported.
Gathering such information may seem difficult, but in reality a great deal of information is already in place: insurance companies have detailed data on accidents; police have data on violent and self-inflicted harm.
We must identify the experts in injury reporting and work with them to get the information that can be studied to truly prevent injuries and promote safety.
The Commission document allowed the injury and safety surveillance system a place within all future health programmes. That would surely allow the system funding, regardless of whether it proved effective or beneficial.
We feel strongly that a real initiative to prevent injury and promote safety is so important that it needs to be put on its own stream within the health programmes.
We need to think about that again in more detail when we consider the health programmes themselves.
That means that this particular recommendation should not yet be linked to the health programmes but should be considered alongside them.
That is why the Committee on the Environment took out all mention of health programmes from the document.
The Commission laid out seven priorities to which we have added injury and safety in the workplace, and we have also stressed domestic violence among women and children.
One change I ask that we make is to take out Amendment 4, which we will vote on separately tomorrow.
That suggests: 'Domestic violence against women is the main cause of death and invalidity among women between the ages of 16 and 44.'
Domestic violence against women and children is clearly a crime and I strongly support amendments that have highlighted that.
However, a recommendation to produce higher-quality data cannot itself include inaccurate data.
The statistic this amendment presents on the main cause of death is inaccurate.
As recently as October a Eurostat publication said that transport accidents and suicide were the main causes of death of women in that age group.
Because we want to make injury surveillance more comprehensive we include mention of risk-taking behaviour, drugs and alcohol, gender considerations, social and environmental condition.
Self-harm is also emphasised because of its increasing incidence.
We have also made additions to the list of high-risk groups to include the young, the elderly, disabled people and women.
The list is not exhaustive.
I support the amendments on needle-stick injuries and injuries to healthcare workers.
We know the solution to them.
They are easily preventable and therefore completely inexcusable.
It is clear that injury places a heavy burden on the economy.
For me, however, it is a question of injured people and their families.
In my opinion, the real key to preventing injury and promoting safety is the value we place on the human person.
If you have a Renaissance masterpiece you handle it with far more care than a magazine poster.
We need to return again to people and their value as the central issue.
Some injuries will happen - we cannot prevent them all - but with better understanding of how they happen, resulting in safer products and practices, we can reduce their occurrence.
However, we will not have a serious effect on the level of injury until people realise that every person matters and that the loss or disablement of even one person is a great loss to us all.
When we understand that, we will treat each other and ourselves like the masterpiece that we are and we will realise our shared responsibility for each other's safety.
That is what is behind Amendment 21 and why I emphasise to the Commission that the tragedy of injury is so much more than the economic burden.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, eight years ago I had the honour of being the rapporteur of a programme for the prevention of injuries during recreational hours; at that time I had been impressed by the large number of such injuries, which indicated that we have a serious problem.
I would like to state that the report submitted by Mrs Sinnott is very good; I also helped in that direction with my own amendments, so that if in the future a community mechanism is created, that is 'injury registration operation' it assists in the development of national prevention policies, because the systematic collection of data will reveal the causes of these injuries, namely what we call determinants of injury.
I consider that the primary causes mentioned by the rapporteur, must be linked, to the effectiveness of injury prevention exclusively; in particular I suggest that we look into the issue of the elderly, who make up for the majority of the victims and the injuries that originate from violence against women, which I believe is quite a large number, and of course road accidents, car accidents and also sports accidents as well as accidents that are caused by products and services.
In order to increase efficiency and reduce cost, I consider it necessary to integrate the existing programmes and infrastructures (data banks and so on), because the Commission already has programmes covering this subject; therefore there is data that must be taken into consideration when it prepares its proposal to Parliament.
This mechanism will gather details provided from Member States based on their national injury supervision systems, allowing easy access to information and correct practices.
Ladies and gentlemen, I conclude by saying that the thousands of deaths along with the financial damage created by injuries is an open wound for the European communities.
It will not heal easily, but we can still create in the future a community mechanism for gathering data that will assist us in the effective prevention of such injuries.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the figures are indicative of the need to warn the citizens of the consequences of risky behaviour.
How many accidents of different kinds are caused by alcoholism or drug use?
How many serious injuries among children are the result of a lack of care by adults, for example, children swallowing detergents or medicines?
Currently, some 235 000 European citizens die as a result of an accident or violence-related injuries.
This amounts to 600 fatalities per day in the EU alone.
These are shocking figures, which lead, on the one hand, to personal suffering and tragedy, and, on the other, to social and budgetary costs.
It is a fact.
Accident and injury comes at a very heavy human price - premature death, years living with incapacity - and entails high costs in terms of healthcare and loss to society owing to lack of productivity.
Injuries can be avoided, however.
It is therefore essential to adopt healthier lifestyles and to make living conditions safer.
Prevention is better than cure.
The risk of injury is not spread equally across all Member States or all social groups.
Risk factors are also determined by the home and work environment.
Age and gender should also be taken into account.
This is why I tabled an amendment aimed at gender mainstreaming across all areas including health policy.
To this end, quantitative gender-based studies must be carried out and resources applying the principle of gender budgeting must be allocated because, as previous speakers have said, domestic violence, violence against women, is also a significant cause of injuries that are terrible, first and foremost, for women, but also for society.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to congratulate Mrs Sinnott on her excellent report, which deserves our full support.
The subject matter of this draft legislative resolution is undoubtedly extremely important, as it concerns the premature deaths of more than 200 000 EU citizens annually and the injury of several million individuals in the 25 Member States.
Some of these injuries are horrific, and many result in the permanent disfigurement or severe lifelong disability of thousands of people.
Two main aspects of the prevention of accidental injury are: the identification and assessment of risks factors, and the proper communication and implementation of safety measures.
Mrs Sinnott correctly notes that, in addition to the gathering of information on injuries by way of establishing a surveillance system, the Council's report needs to be enriched by placing more emphasis on the promotion of safety and raising risk-awareness among the general public.
Of the numerous serious risk factors affecting human life, allow me to concentrate on just one: alcohol and road safety.
In this area, there is much to be done in terms of prevention.
The use of alcohol by drivers is extremely dangerous, mainly because alcohol suppresses our higher-level brain function, resulting in impairment of sense perception, slowness of reflexes, disturbance of locomotor muscle coordination and poor understanding of danger.
In this respect, alcohol has, through the years, been responsible for the deaths of millions of road users worldwide.
Yet, either because of ignorance, or more likely as a result of very strong lobbying by the alcohol industry, we fail to comprehend fully that much more drastic action on drink-driving is necessary.
Instead, we are led to believe that alcohol intake is safe below certain limits, i.e. 50 mg per 100 ml of blood in most EU countries.
This is totally wrong in my view.
There is no safe limit for alcohol and driving.
Any alcohol intake, however small, will affect brain activity to some extent.
Whereas a driver with a blood alcohol level of 20, 30 or 40 mg/100 ml might be legally entitled to drive, he or she is at a much higher risk of being involved in an accident than someone without any alcohol in their blood at all.
Our state education systems, as well as our legal systems, give our drivers a false sense of security in allowing them to think that, as long as they do not drink excessively, they are safe on the roads.
This is criminally wrong and we must correct this situation by helping to bring about a zero-alcohol-level approach for drivers.
Only then can we hope to reduce significantly the number of alcohol-related road deaths.
But - and unfortunately there is always a 'but' in politics - how many of us are willing and able to take on the task of fighting for no-alcohol intake legislation for drivers, and how many of us will survive politically if we come into direct conflict with the alcohol-related industries by supporting a zero-alcohol level for drivers?
In conclusion, if there is an important injury-prevention message for our people this Christmas, it is that alcohol is a killer on the roads, in large as well as small quantities, and that the only safe driving alcohol level is a zero level.
(SK) I would like to join those who support the Council's recommendations.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for drafting the European Parliament's report on this issue.
The basic reason for drafting this report has been mentioned several times tonight.
Every day, 600 people die as a result of accidents and injuries, which equates to a quarter of a million people per year.
On the one hand, these numbers express the grief and bereavement of families, and on the other hand, we must not forget that accidents and violence in the area of social and economic life also constitute a major economic burden on the state.
In many Member States, hospitals are required to consider meticulously the effectiveness of treatment, for instance in cancer patients.
While the treatment of victims of accidents and violence requires substantial spending, these conditions are preventable.
Each year seven million people in the European Union are admitted to hospitals and as many as 65 million require medical care.
These statistics express and reflect the enormous suffering sustained by all those affected.
Therefore, I believe that the proposal for common procedures by EU Member States to decrease levels of accidents and violence is highly effective.
Accurate statistics reflecting differences between Member States will help us to identify prevention methods more precisely.
If it is known that persons aged over 65 account for 16% of the EU population and 40% of fatal accidents, we should launch a series of awareness campaigns or introduce protective schemes that target people in this particular age group.
Young people are another important group that we should be focusing on for the prevention of accidents and violence.
Sports injuries occur quite often under the supervision of coaches and during free-time activities.
We must respect our health and the health of others.
Together, we should oppose the daily violence to which we are exposed to on TV and in films and children's games, which often constitute an encouragement to these undesirable forms of behaviour in society.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's endeavours to reduce the large number of accidents and casualties and significantly improve the situation in Member States are certainly welcome, and indeed the rapporteur has had a few things to say about that.
Do we really think, however, that these measures will result in fewer accidents in these countries?
I believe that the exact opposite will be the case.
These measures will mean the commitment of funds in these countries that can be used for precisely these measures.
I should like to comment on the costs, which are always set out.
Naturally, I am concerned about the number of casualties.
I read today, with regard to REACH, the amount by which we could reduce healthcare expenditure if we managed to improve this situation.
The figures are correct, of course, but we shall never achieve them.
The only thing we shall achieve with this document is red tape, even though we all insist that the EU rejects this and wants to reduce it.
Yet the EU Member States are well-placed to deal with this problem.
They collect their own statistics, they take the necessary measures, they know the local situation much better than we in Brussels or Strasbourg do.
We are deceiving ourselves if we suppose that our statistics are able to tell the Member States anything they do not already know; we are on the wrong track.
Taking driving as an example, we cannot hope to influence driving practices in Sicily or Finland from Brussels.
This can only be done by taking action locally, and therefore such action should be regulated purely by means of subsidiarity.
I should like to offer a rather exaggerated analogy. Say someone were to tell me today that many people are injured falling off ladders whilst hanging curtains.
There are some countries that traditionally do not use curtains and thus do not experience such accidents.
Who would try to make a comparison?
That is the way of things in many other cases, too.
In my opinion, therefore, we are on the wrong track here.
We should re-think these measures and focus on bilateral measures that will really lead to a reduction in accidents, as this proposal will not achieve that.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank Members for a very interesting debate.
I share with most of you the frustration we are facing that in the European Union we still have so many preventable causes of injury, death and ill-health, and that there is so much more we could do about it.
I think these contributions are a step in the right direction and contribute to this effort.
I know that the European Parliament has been consistently proactive on the subject of injury prevention, and today's debate shows the interest in this issue.
For us, and me personally, the main target, the centre of my policies is the human being - people - and this is reality.
But, in this day and age we also have to admit that unfortunately not all decision-makers have that as their sole consideration.
So when we are able to accompany those arguments with financial and economic arguments, we can achieve this purpose even better.
Without saying that these would be the priority or the main consideration, it does help.
In addition to the human suffering, in addition to the pain, in addition to the social impact that injuries have, they also cause a serious problem for the economies of Member States and therefore investment from that point of view is also required.
Regarding the Commission's position on the different amendments, the Commission can fully accept a large number of amendments, for example, 5, 18, 21, and partially accept amendments 7, 11, 15, 16 and 17.
The full list of the Commission's positions on each amendment is being made available to Parliament and I trust that it will be included in the record of this sitting.
We cannot accept the amendment that concerns the deletion of the financial mechanisms under the public health programme because we do not have any alternative, and on legal grounds we cannot accept an amendment that obtains support through the cohesion and structural funds.
So, in the circumstances we will have to insist on maintaining the funding through the public health programme.
The main target of this proposal is of course the issue of information, because without the right information we will not be able to set the policies, we will not be able to set the targets, we will not know whether we are achieving our targets.
Most Member States need help, and this can be shown from the results, from the information we have, and based both on the Treaty and the policies of complementing and supporting Member States in their efforts and also in coordinating the policy of Member States irrespective of policies, which is the reason for this proposal.
It is true that there is information here and there, but we need to pull it all together so that we can learn from each other's experiences and prove that this is a European Union of solidarity, a European Union of cooperation, where we can learn from each other's experiences and help each other so that every single Member State does not have to go through this learning process at the cost of lives, at a cost to the health of European citizens.
That is the challenge before us, and I think we can make great use of this possibility of an exchange of best practices and information and close cooperation.
That is the target of this proposal, and I would like once again to thank Mrs Sinnott and Parliament for their support for our proposal.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.

Expenditure in the veterinary field (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field C6-0199/2006.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, firstly I would like to say that I am grateful for the work done by the Members of the committees concerned with this Commission proposal to amend Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field.
This year, the Commission allocated approximately EUR 210 million to assist Member States in running eradication and monitoring programmes to counter animal diseases.
This programme is a key element in our food safety strategy.
As we all know, animal diseases are unpredictable - the unexpected can and does happen.
In 2005-2006 even though we saw outbreaks of avian flu, blue tongue and classical swine fever in some Member States, none of them was a major outbreak and we managed to keep them under control and not allow them to cause extensive damage.
The Commission has embarked on a wide-ranging review of Community animal health policy.
An extensive evaluation has recently been completed and the results were presented at a conference held in Brussels last month.
I was pleased to note that several honourable Members attended, and indeed chaired, sessions.
One of the primary areas of interest for discussion today and one which generated considerable interest was the possible introduction of an insurance or cost-sharing element to help fund disease eradication costs.
However, these are longer-term measures which still need considerable discussion with the various stakeholders before we can determine how best to proceed.
There are, however, a number of key changes which we can make now, in order to improve efficiency in how the Commission and the Member States manage funding in this area.
The proposal before us today aims to make such changes, while allowing the necessary time for other longer-term issues to be dealt with in the ongoing policy review.
The proposal contains three main elements.
First, we propose to introduce the possibility of multiannual programming for the disease eradication programmes, but with a simplified procedure which will make it easier both for the Member States and also for the Commission.
Second, we propose to strengthen the legal basis for the TRACES programme, but also for communication.
It is interesting to note that we currently have a legal base for communication activities in animal welfare but not for animal health, and this is going to be corrected in the proposal.
Third, we propose to limit the list of disease eradication programmes eligible for funding to those that correspond to clear priorities, but with a procedure under which this list could be amended when necessary in response to developments.
The proposed changes would make important advances in strengthening and prioritising our food safety strategy.
The proposal makes a number of improvements which will also increase efficiency and reduce bureaucracy, both for the Commission and the Member States.
I am grateful for Parliament's support.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report that I submit to the Chamber on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development welcomes the proposal by the Commission regarding the possibility of approving multi-annual programmes and updating some of the instruments that accompany Community policy on animal health.
It also considers, however, that some specific measures contained in the proposals aimed at amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC fall short of what is required.
We therefore wish to highlight 12 amendments aimed at achieving five key objectives, which are as follows: in view of the lack of knowledge of what has occurred with programmes for the eradication, control and monitoring of certain animal diseases in the various Member States, the first of the objectives is to call on the Commission to submit a report every four years to Parliament and the Council on the animal health situation and on the cost-effectiveness of implementing the programmes in the Member States, including an explanation of the criteria adopted.
The second is to support the dissemination of good practices and to encourage the submission of joint programmes by two or more Member States in border regions wherever this is shown to be important for the prevention, control, monitoring and eradication of contagious animal diseases, including zoonoses, in view of the different attitudes and behaviour in different Member States, even neighbouring ones, as regards the same diseases, which can affect the measures adopted.
The third is to make it compulsory for funding proposals to be submitted in the event of emergency situations, which require the sudden and unforeseeable disbursement of very large financial resources.
The funding proposals should not be subject to the deadlines referred to in this decision, which should, in any event, extend the deadlines laid down by the Commission.
An example of this is the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2000.
For diseases of this kind, the sooner measures are imposed and the more radical they are, the more effective they will be.
For this to be possible, a minimum financial reserve needs to be set up to respond to disasters which arise suddenly, insidiously and unforeseeably.
Fourthly, we are proposing to extend the list, attached to this decision, of contagious animal diseases to which Community financial support can be granted.
The Commission had proposed to cut this list.
The proposal contained in this report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development thus adds eight diseases to the current list, and proposes more aimed at also ensuring funding for their control and eradication.
I wish to highlight the vital importance of this proposal, given that in a number of countries there are eradication programmes already under way, which should not be interrupted.
In Portugal, where I am most familiar with the situation, bovine leucosis is a disease for which eradication programmes have been running for around 20 years, and it is now in the final stage of definitive eradication.
Very few cases of leucosis were detected last year and it is estimated that the disease can be definitively eradicated in one year's time.
Making the disease ineligible for funding could compromise all the efforts made and lead to its uncontrolled resurgence.
Another example is Newcastle disease, which is endemic in wild birds and could be transmitted to unvaccinated poultry at any time.
The economic consequences of this disease could be devastating for birds.
Aujeszky's disease in pigs, which the Commission proposed to exclude, is also the subject of a planned programme for Portugal, where failure to eradicate the disease means that it is impossible to export pigs to some markets.
Swine brucellosis is another disease not included in the current list, which may pose the same type of problems for trade, and is endemic in Portugal and the Mediterranean basin.
In order to simplify the legislation in force, the Commission is also proposing the repeal of Council Decision 90/638/EEC laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases, replacing those criteria with fresh technical criteria set out in the annexes to the new decision currently under review, which the Commission intends subsequently to transform into criteria and standard requirements.
In this report we are proposing that Parliament issue a new opinion in the event of a change in the criteria in force.
Lastly, Mr President, I wish to pass on my thanks to all those who helped draw up this report.
The Commission will hopefully take on board the proposals put forward in the report, which are aimed at helping improve animal health.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report and the Commission for its contribution this evening.
I will deal with the future, because that is important in terms of the review.
However, as regards the issues in this report, as we have said, by and large we agree with much of the proposal.
Everyone recognises the need to control and monitor animal diseases, not only because of the human health implications, but also because of the economic consequences where there are outbreaks.
Take Ireland in 2001, where we had a foot-and-mouth outbreak and the country came to a standstill.
Thankfully, we got it under control, but it showed what can happen when there are problems.
Information is the key to controlling, monitoring and being effective when diseases occur, and I am glad to see that we will be looking at better information systems within Member States and between Member States.
The funding proposal for information policy is very positive, and the multiannual programme is a very practical proposal: it makes it easier for Member States and that is to be welcomed, as are the joint programmes by two Member States or border regions.
We need the extension of the time limit for proposals from Member States in relation to their disease programmes.
We extended the list of diseases; we are conscious that Article 6 allows for emergency situations, and that is to be welcomed.
I have a particular point to make as we look to the future: Europe needs to look beyond its borders and to ensure that our trade policy does not conflict with public health and food safety issues.
We allow food imports into the EU and, at the very least, we need to ensure that the standards of our imports meet those of our home-produced food.
We need to exclude imports where we have any doubt whatsoever.
It is all too easy to import a problem, but it is very difficult to tackle a problem once it is within our borders.
I am concerned that the WTO may be pushing for trade without due concern to animal health and human health implications.
I am not convinced that our current rules meet my concerns and I do not believe that computerised systems alone will protect us.
Let me finish by saying that we have taken the lead in the EU on these issues, but it would be regrettable if, in pursuit of a trade deal, we were to sacrifice our standards and the health of our animals and of our citizens.
Mr President, the present Commission proposal does not make any change to the existing rules on the eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses, but rather aims to update some of the instruments that accompany Community policy on animal health.
We welcome this, but we welcome in particular the Commission's announcement that it will shortly be submitting a full report on European animal health policy.
That would be a good time and opportunity to discuss further-reaching changes to the present rules and, if necessary, to set up a new legal framework.
We agree with the objectives of the proposal as set out in the Commission's explanatory statement, and also with the rapporteur.
We support the proposed amendments to Council Decision 90/424/EEC, and we also support the critical comments and notes by the rapporteur on the financing of the system for monitoring the movement of animals, and also on the system for financing unforeseeable diseases and outbreaks of epidemics, or animal diseases causing lasting harm.
Measures for combating animal diseases always require large amounts of funding, and providing this at short notice is often the problem.
The rapporteur's suggestion that certain funds be set aside in a reserve should of course be considered.
Our secret hope is that the proposed amendments improve the implementation of the cofinanced programmes on the eradication of animal diseases.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking our rapporteur for her very well-balanced report.
As previous speakers, particularly Dr Kindermann, have already said, this is a technical report that introduces urgently needed amendments.
Flexibility is essential in crisis situations.
Assistance provided swiftly is worth double in such circumstances.
The reaction and measures taken must be prudent, however, and preventive action is better than reaction.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has been calling for monitoring of imports of live animals from non-EU countries to be as intensive as EU monitoring for many years.
As we all know, animal health has a direct impact on products of animal origin and thus, ultimately, on public health.
For this reason, special attention should be paid to ensuring that negative effects of the kind seen in the past no longer arise, where public confidence in products of animal origin is seriously dented, with damaging consequences for the economy.
(PL) Mr President, as a Member of the European Parliament and also as a veterinary surgeon, I would like to express my support for Mrs Figueiredo's report, in particular its call for infectious animal diseases such as bovine leucosis and Aujeszky's disease to be kept on the list of diseases eligible for cofinancing from Community funds.
I would like to remind the House that eradicating these diseases in certain Member States is particularly important, amongst other reasons because of trade within the Union.
One of the conditions for placing pigs on the market is that they should originate from a region or country free from Aujeszky's disease.
A similar situation exists for cattle, which must originate from herds certified free from enzootic bovine leucosis.
Many new Member States have limited budgets and consequently do not have the financial resources necessary to completely eradicate these diseases.
The European Commission's proposed adjustment of the list of diseases involving the removal of bovine leucosis and Aujeszky's disease, may lead to significant cuts in the preventive programmes in place, or even to them being completely halted.
It is essential that any future updating of the list of diseases should only take place after the consent of the European Parliament and the Council has been obtained.
Mr President, I welcome the interest shown by the Members in the proposal to modify what we call the veterinary fund.
I appreciate that the overall principles of the proposal have been accepted by Parliament.
The suggestions made are good ones but many of those are already being applied.
The idea, for example, to allow emergency expenditure in a crisis is indeed essential, but the provision already exists in the decision under Article 3.
The Commission funds actions to deal with those diseases on an emergency basis, normally at 50% co-financing of eligible measures and 60% for foot-and-mouth disease.
The idea of ensuring coordination between Member States submitting programmes is also welcome but this is also the case in reality.
We will continue that approach but we feel that Article 16 is not the proper location.
We will introduce the idea somewhere else - the idea of task forces and sharing best practice.
The eradication plans are publicly available on the Commission's website, but we would be very happy to provide information on progress to Parliament and the Council and we recommend these to the Member States.
The decision sets out the criteria that Member States must fulfil when submitting eradication programmes to the Commission for consideration.
Those are technical criteria.
Therefore the regulatory committee procedure is appropriate to define the information required.
Member States need to be very precise in the information they supply and it is therefore helpful for the Commission to specify the format required.
On the suggestion to delay the final date for submitting an application for funding, we encourage Member States to submit applications as early in the year as possible.
Nevertheless, we can accept a final date of 30 April.
With regard to the list of diseases eligible to receive funding, which was raised by many speakers, we have proposed shortening the list to focus efforts on the key priorities: those diseases that have indirect implications for human health and diseases that may lead to serious trade problems.
The addition of diseases or wider possibilities to allow Member States to submit any programme at all would risk dilution of those priorities.
Nevertheless many of the diseases and issues raised will be or are being covered differently, for example, through the emergency expenditure (Article 3 of the decision).
It covers those diseases that have the potential to cause very serious losses, such as classical swine fever, avian influenza or FMD, for example.
There are, however, two diseases on the list today, for which Member States currently receive funding: Aujeszky's disease and bovine leucosis.
For those two cases I am prepared to examine ways in which funding can continue for a number of years.
A full list of the Commission's position on each of the amendments will be provided to Parliament.
I trust that they will be included in the record of the sitting.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12.30 p.m.
Annex - Position of the Commission
Figueiredo report
The Commission can accept Amendments 7, 8 and 10.
Amendments 1, 2, 4 and 12 can be accepted in part.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11.
Banana sector (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Fruteau on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation amending regulations (EEC) No 404/93, (EC) No 1782/2003 and (EC) No 247/2006 as regards the banana sector C6-0339/2006.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Members for their efforts to speed up the discussion on this banana proposal, and express special thanks to Mr Fruteau, who delivered an excellent report within a very tight time frame.
I am convinced that we all have an interest in approving the banana proposal before the end of the year, to give the producers a clear framework within which to operate in the future and also, of course, to achieve budget stability; but also to reassure the banana producing regions that they can count on the tangible solidarity of the European Union.
Bananas are very important for the social and economic viability of our outermost regions.
They provide revenue to more than 15 000 holdings and jobs to some 24 000 farmers.
Those regions face very specific handicaps and the Treaty itself grants them a specific status, in Article 299.
They are, in all respects, part of the European Union and have every right to enjoy the benefits of European Union policy.
The banana reform is the practical expression of our commitment to confirm solidarity within the Union.
I am very happy that the European Parliament agrees with the Commission on the need to reform the current banana aid scheme and to try to bring it into line with our common agricultural policy.
A crucial consideration is the budgetary unpredictability of the current expenditures within the banana sector.
I am delighted that the European Parliament agrees on the very substance of the proposal, namely, the choice of the POSEI solution, which represents quite a number of different advantages.
First of all, it is consistent with the CAP reform; it is a very flexible tool for Member States and for the regions in question; it permits Member States to give additional financing; and, last but not least, it gives predictability from a financial point of view.
Another important point on which you agree with the Commission's proposal regards the budget, which is based on the average support granted over the period 2000-2002, and a marginal assurance has been added to take into account the variability of the banana market.
The recent change in the import arrangements and a possible agreement with banana-producing third countries have also been taken into account.
You have requested that the Commission should submit a specific report on POSEI in 2009, if the livelihoods of banana producers, in particular, were to deteriorate following a change in the external regime.
As a matter of fact, our proposal already focuses on, or foresees, the submission of a report on the whole POSEI regime in 2009, and that will include the banana sector.
Let us not forget that the banana sector represents more than 50% of the agricultural revenue in some producing regions.
It goes without saying that this report will be submitted sooner in the event of a deterioration of livelihood in the outermost regions.
As concerns Crete, Cyprus and the Algarve, we should keep in mind that banana production involves less than 400 hectares and some 300 holdings overall.
That hardly justifies a derogation from the general principle that allows farmers the freedom to choose their crops according to the market and the best advantage they can derive from their production.
I am looking forward to the discussion with you tonight.
Again, thank you for being so quick in your action on this issue.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is, today, about to reform the internal strand of the common market organisation (CMO) in the banana sector, in order to adapt the aid scheme for European producers to the new global trade situation and to the principles of the new common agricultural policy.
This change, which is the subject of the report brought before the House today after being approved by a very large majority by Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, undoubtedly goes in the right direction.
For banana producers in the outermost regions, who account for more than 98% of the EU's production, it is proposed to transfer a package of almost EUR 280 million a year to the POSEI programmes, which will make for greater flexibility and better use of Community funds.
In this regard, I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for the reassessment of the amounts allotted for this reform, which should make it possible to better assure the sector's viability, particularly in the outermost regions where banana production plays a vital economic and social role for which no other agricultural product could compensate.
I must, however, remind you that the amounts proposed were calculated on the basis of the current customs tariff.
Consequently, the uncertainty concerning world trade negotiations suggests that there may be a further reduction in this tariff level.
Given that, at EUR 176 a tonne, the banana sector is already in an extremely delicate situation that threatens the socio-economic balance of many of the producing regions, a further reduction in the customs tariff would signal the end of banana production in the Community if no adjustment is made to the plan proposed by the Commission.
If the opening up of markets is to make a contribution to revitalising the production structures, it can do so only insofar as the fundamental principles of regulation and equity are combined, that is, the various producers need to respect the common rules that put them on an equal commercial footing.
It is, however, quite evident that this equality is totally lacking in global trade given the gulf that exists between the social and environmental standards of European countries and those of the countries of Central or Latin America.
Faced with this problem, the resolution of which has to remain one of the European Union's priorities, the aid granted to Community banana producers is necessary in order to compensate for the failures in the global trade system.
To be effective, these internal regulatory measures must be in line with the external regulatory tools.
It is in this light that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is insisting on strengthening the evaluation measures indicated in the reform proposals, in order that the Commission could take positive steps if the external tariff situation were to deteriorate, for example by increasing the amount of the financial packages granted to producers.
The survival of banana production in the European Union also depends on its capacity to optimise its production costs while respecting the social rules and living standards of the producers.
Since the CMO was established, producers' organisations have in this way enabled a better concentration of Community supply of bananas in the market and contributed to a noticeable reduction in the costs relating to the cultivation of bananas in the European Union.
It would now be contradictory in economic terms to disrupt this process.
That is why we believe it is essential to maintain a regulatory framework in this regard at Community level in relation to producers' organisations, in order to further the efforts already made towards strengthening our production structures.
As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has asked, this willingness should, furthermore, be demonstrated by an obligation to affiliate to a producers' organisation in order to benefit from aid provided within the context of the POSEI package, except when circumstances do not allow it.
Finally, and this will be my last comment, there is the question of the administration of aid.
The support system for production within the present CMO in bananas does provide for schemes for bi-monthly advances that are essential to the sector's activity in the outermost regions as in the rest of the Union's producing countries.
The transfer of packages to the POSEI programmes, however, is not coupled with any plan to continue this system of advances. This jeopardises the survival of producers who would therefore have to resort to private sector borrowing, at a time when the characteristic fluctuations of the commercial climate in this sector does not encourage banks to grant long-term loans.
In this context of economic instability it is up to the European public powers to provide adequate safeguards so that these trade policy choices at global level do not run counter to the interests of those producers who are the most fragile in the Union.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (ES) Mr President, the Committee on Budgets has unanimously approved its opinion for this report on the reform of the Council Regulation and, furthermore, it entirely agrees with the fundamental aspects of that proposed reform.
Our only complaints - and the Commissioner herself has already explained them - relate to the lack of time available to us to analyse the proposal, since we have had to opt for the urgency procedure.
In any event, in the view of the Committee on Budgets, the only important thing is to accept the general funding mechanism proposed and, at the same time, to ensure that the proposal is entirely in line with the Court of Auditors' report on the financial management of the common organisation of the markets in the banana sector.
Our committee simply proposes an amendment of a generic nature, which we are proposing for all programmes not subject to codecision, calling for the general financial framework that we have approved for 2007-2013 to be respected.
At the same time, in order to stress Parliament's involvement even further and given that the consultation procedure is being chosen, we would like the aid to banana producers to be subject to this Parliament's control by means of the annual budgetary procedure.
As a whole, however, this proposal is a good one and fundamentally helps all of those outlying European regions that face great difficulties competing with third-country products.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PT) Mr President, the Commission's proposal to reform the Common Organisation of the Market (COM) in the bananas sector forms part of the process of liberalising the farming sector at EU level and in the context of the World Trade Organisation.
The Commission is proposing to decouple aid from production, to implement the single payment system, and to abolish the compensatory aid scheme that contributed to price stability and safeguarded, albeit only partially, producers' income.
The 'POSEI' option involves incorporating existing aid into the POSEI programmes for banana producers in the outermost regions, namely Madeira, the Azores, Martinique, Guadeloupe and the Canary Islands.
The Commission's proposal is also aimed at saving money by stabilising budget expenditure on the COM.
Consequently, if the objective is to guarantee an income and a decent standard of living for banana producers, it is hard to see how the Commission's proposals will improve upon the current COM.
Far from it, in fact.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to emphasise the socio-economic importance of the banana sector in the outermost regions and its contribution to achieving economic and social cohesion, on account of the income and employment which it generates, the economic activities to which it gives rise, both upstream and downstream, and its effect of maintaining an environmental and landscape balance which encourages the development of tourism.
The amendments tabled by this committee, some of which are referred to in this report, are essentially aimed at offsetting some of the negative points in the Commission's proposal.
They seek to protect producers, to ensure the development of the sector, to guarantee the implementation of a system of advances, and to continue to support producers' organisations in order to promote marketing.
Furthermore, we are proposing mandatory interim assessments of the new measures in order to ensure the levels of income and employment and to prevent any deterioration in the sector's economic situation.
Lastly, we are proposing only the partial decoupling of aid.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to congratulate Mr Fruteau on the excellent work he has done in drawing up this report and for his willingness to reach a consensus.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her proposed reform, which has been accepted in general terms both by the sector and by this Parliament.
I hope that, from now on, these new rules will put an end once and for all to the arguments within the World Trade Organisation, and I would therefore ask that, despite the new pressure from certain Latin American countries, the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne, which entered into force on 1 January following the agreement reached in Hong Kong, be defended and maintained as a minimum with a view to providing the European banana sector with a little stability.
Commissioner, the outermost regions, which are the European Union's main producers of bananas, are highly dependent on this product and therefore any modification to the arrangements governing the sector, in particular to the external arrangements, must be taken into account.
I am therefore amazed by the debate that is taking place within the Council of Ministers on the period of reference proposed, which has led to a budget of EUR 280 million per year.
I must insist that that period of reference must be the same as the one applied to the other COM reforms, and it would therefore be incomprehensible for there to be an exception to the rule set so far, or a budgetary haggle, when 98% of that sum is quite rightly intended for the outermost regions.
Since it is important, I would also like to mention another of the requests included in the report: that relating to the continuity of the system for producers' organisations, with a view to maintaining the concentration of the Community produce, which has been one of the main successes of the COM in bananas.
Its disappearance, Commissioner, would only exacerbate the disadvantages faced by Community producers in the face of third-country imports.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Commission has made a great effort to adapt the internal system for bananas to changing circumstances.
I believe that we must congratulate the Commission on that effort, which will essentially make it possible for Community banana producers to survive in very difficult circumstances.
As Mr Fruteau, the rapporteur for this report, pointed out, there is still concern about a possible future change to the common organisation of the markets in bananas externally.
The Commissioner has mentioned certain guarantees with regard to the Commission's monitoring of this issue, but as a Member of this Parliament I feel obliged to point out our concern, which is enshrined in certain amendments that have been presented in the Fruteau report and that I hope will be approved by Parliament tomorrow.
In short, Mr President, I believe that Parliament will be able to approve this report tomorrow and probably some of the fundamental amendments, but the most important thing - I repeat - is that we can count on the Commission to carry on protecting the banana sector in the future.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, reform of the banana market affects a couple of the so-called outermost regions of the European Union.
Its implementation is more or less a foregone conclusion, which is not at all the case for reform of the fruit and vegetable market.
The latter involves several dozen types of fruit and vegetables and is of far greater importance for the whole Union, but is forever being delayed.
The future of some 300 000 jobs is at stake in the banana producing regions, whereas in Poland alone some two million jobs depend on fruit and vegetable production.
The cost of dealing with the main problems affecting the fruit and vegetable market is barely EUR 80 million a year.
At the same time, the Union's budget would not suffer, as up to EUR 300 million is not taken up in that market every year.
The annual cost of reform of the banana market amounts to EUR 280 million. This is a far higher sum, but will deal with fewer problems.
I would remind the House that, on 1 May 2004, Poland and nine other countries became Members of the European Union and are entitled to be treated on an equal footing with other Member States.
The fact that they are not located on picturesque islands is no excuse for failing to do so.
In view of the situation I have described, references to a common agricultural policy can only be cause for embarrassment and shame, but it is not I who should be ashamed.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse the report by Mr Fruteau, whom I congratulate on his outstanding work, amending the Commission's proposal.
I support the objectives outlined in the report, which are as follows: to maintain Community banana production, in view of its vital contribution to employment, to economic and social development and to safeguarding the environment in banana-producing regions, especially in the outermost regions.
The second objective is to safeguard the incomes of banana producers and to prevent the economic situation of the banana sector from deteriorating.
The third objective is to give banana-producing Member States control over the granting of aid, so that this can be done in the most effective way, taking account of the specific priorities of these regions.
The report also provides for a specific report to be submitted by 2009 in the event of changes to the incomes of producers, for example if the tariff changes.
I do not find it acceptable, Commissioner, to make aid contingent on producers joining a producers' organisation.
I feel it would be more appropriate to leave the decision on such a requirement to the Member States.
I therefore propose that this be taken into account and that the Council adopt it accordingly.
(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal to reform the system of production aid for banana producers is a perfect example of Article 299(2), which provides for specific treatment for the outermost regions on account of their particular characteristics, being implemented in the farming sector.
In the outermost regions, banana production has undoubted economic, social and in particular environmental importance.
It is vital therefore that it be maintained, and that is precisely the purpose of this reform.
I wish to congratulate the Commission, which has outlined the right path forward: the management of aid via the POSEI programmes, greater flexibility for the Member States in distributing these resources and an end to the isolation of producers from the market, regarding which the producers' warnings must immediately be heeded.
Lastly, the Commission must pay very close attention to the development of the sector.
It may become necessary to change marketing conditions that adversely affect producers' incomes, and the Commission must respond appropriately to such a situation by taking the necessary measures.
(PL) Mr President, the European Commission's proposed reform of the common organisation of the market in bananas is consistent with the philosophy of the 2003 reform of the common agricultural policy.
It is also consistent with the commitments undertaken by the Union during negotiations at WTO level.
Nonetheless, it is worth assessing the impact of the reforms on the level of banana production in the outermost regions of the Union.
There is a certain similarity between the reform of the market in bananas and the forthcoming reform of the market in soft fruits.
The regional market of the banana sector is just as important as the market for soft fruit.
The degree of threat to the stability of rural areas and to the livelihoods of the growers and their families is also similar.
Both products are very labour intensive.
In addition, it should be noted that the market in soft fruit is under greater threat from unauthorised action by third countries than the market in bananas.
In the case of soft fruit only temporary antidumping measures exist, while in the case of the banana market an effective single tariff system is in place.
Some of the support mechanisms proposed for the market in bananas would resolve the difficulties of the market in soft fruit.
The European Commission should therefore consider applying them to it, particularly the system of area payments for growers of soft fruit intended for processing.
Let us hope that the measures proposed will have a positive impact on the situation of banana producers.
However, we are still waiting for an account of the true costs of this reform.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to make a few comments about the questions raised here tonight.
As I have already explained in my introductory speech, a report on the implementation of the POSEI programmes will be presented not later than 2009 and will permit the assessment of the situation in the banana-producing regions.
If there are substantial changes in the economic conditions affecting livelihoods in the outermost regions the Commission may submit this report earlier.
A question was raised about the situation of the producer organisations.
It is important for me to underline clearly that producer organisations have not been abolished.
Simply, there is no longer a need for a common definition of producer organisations at Community level.
The vast majority of Community producers are already members of producer organisations.
It is therefore more appropriate to let Member States decide whether they wish to adopt rules on producer organisations, which will enable them to target regional needs much more specifically and provide support under the POSEI programme.
This is possible.
Regional authorities will be left to make their own choices.
This flexibility built into the system would be the best way to secure sustainable and coherent policy decisions in the outermost regions.
There were some questions about advance payments.
It is important that we do not forget that the new system offers a number of tangible benefits to the banana-producing farmers.
Firstly, as soon as the POSEI programmes are approved they will have budget clarity for the full period of 2007-2013.
This will improve their position if they need to go to the bank about loans.
They could also obtain 100% clarity concerning the aid already paid on 1 December.
Under the present system, they have clarity concerning only between 20% and 40% of the payments.
It is my clear impression that the Member States appreciate these changes.
In general, I can say with some confidence that our proposal on the budget will be very good for the banana-producing countries.
If we had chosen other reference periods the result would have been worse than choosing the period 2000-2002.
Therefore, I am happy that the European Parliament has decided not to reopen this discussion.
There were a few comments on the fruit and vegetable sector.
I am very happy to be able to say today that on 24 January I will be coming to the Committee on Agriculture to give an explanation on the new fruit and vegetable reforms.
This will clarify some of the questions that have been raised here tonight.
On the various proposals, the Commission supports the incorporation of Amendment 4, regarding the contribution of bananas to the social and economic cohesion, and Amendment 9, which mentions the importance of various quality standards and the link to tourism, although we might need to revise the wording slightly.
Concerning the amendments asking to link the POSEI report to the banana sector and allow for a partial decoupling in non-outermost regions, the Commission's view is that this would clearly go against the whole idea behind the reform and also the linkage to the 2003 CAP reform.
I wish to thank you once again for all your efforts to speed up the discussion of the banana reform.
I am delighted that Parliament seems to agree with the basis of this whole reform and I am looking forward to the vote in plenary tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Written statement (Rule 142)
(FR) The banana plays a key role in the economies of four of the seven outermost regions, due to the importance of European markets and the exceptionally labour-intensive work that it requires.
Our Parliament must ensure that the proposed support is set at a sufficient level and that it takes account of possible price changes during negotiations at the World Trade Organisation.
In order to deal with a possible slump in producers' income, provision should be made for an automatic revision clause, and the current system of financial advances, which is essential to the industry's activity, should be re-established.
Banana producers in the outermost regions are waiting for a clear signal regarding the survival of the sector, in order to restore confidence within the industry.
Fragmented and ineffective for many years, the West Indian banana sector is today a model of organisation, and restructuring efforts in this area must be emphasised.
I would like to point out that the banana sector in the outermost regions meets the non-commercial criteria in force within the Union, unlike its competitors in Latin American countries.
Without the banana, which brings 15 000 jobs, representing the real economic backbone of these regions at human, social and environmental levels, the entire agriculture of Guadeloupe and Martinique would be threatened with extinction, for lack of alternative crops.
Circulation of compound feedingstuffs (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a decision by the European Parliament and the Council correcting Directive 2002/2/EC amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feeding stuffs C6-0209/2006-.
Member of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its actions regarding this dossier, and especially rapporteur Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who, unfortunately, could not be here today.
The Commission's discussions demonstrate the high level of interest created regarding the issue of labelling compound feedingstuffs.
The Commission's proposal is the logical consequence of the decision issued by the European Court, last December.
The proposal aims at aligning our legislation, namely Directive 2002/2/EC, so that it reflects the Court's decision.
I fully understand and acknowledge the need for political debate regarding the potential improvements on the current system of labelling compound feedingstuffs.
I appreciate the broad understanding on behalf of the European Parliament that today's proposal is not a suitable context for this discussion.
The modernisation and simplification of the legislation on feedingstuffs is included in the Commission's rolling simplification programme for 2007.
The Commission is following this objective in the context of the procedure of evaluating the effects, during which interesting new ideas regarding the labelling of compound feedingstuffs will be taken into consideration, as discussed in Parliament in the past few weeks.
As I recently stated to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the evaluation of the effects will set the path for the legislative proposal regarding the modernisation of legislation on the labelling of feedingstuffs, which is expected to be ready in the second semester of next year.
This will give us the opportunity to study in full the best way to modernise all the provisions of the legislation regarding the labelling of feedingstuffs.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur, and not least his staff, for their commitment to this report.
Whilst this is evidently an interesting report, it is also a controversial one, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has in any case made a correction to the Commission's proposal.
This means that Article 1(1)(b) of the 2002 Directive needed to be deleted in accordance with the proposal that was issued further to the European Court of Justice's ruling.
During the exchange of views, it soon became apparent that there are very different opinions about the labelling of mixed feed.
This is not a matter of the exact designation, but of whether we really want to have a debate about the open declaration articles in the relevant legislation.
As I see it, this open declaration should be exposed, since the present regulation in this field is not workable and still not transparent, because there are, after all, still labels around which specify 110% of ingredients.
In addition, too little consideration is being given to the intellectual property of the feed industry which, as a result of present legislation, is forced to make its recipes public.
This is detrimental not only to industry, but also to the farmer, for the consequence of it is that our competitors outside the European Union know exactly what we are doing.
Also, present legislation discourages innovation in the feed industry, and that does not benefit farmers either.
Unfortunately, it transpired that the deletion of Article 1(1)(b) was at stake and that, according to the legal offices of the Commission, the Council and of this House, meant that the other articles in the legislation could not be amended.
I have to say that the coordinators of all parties shared this view.
This is why the European People's Party would like a prompt review of the whole of feed legislation, not least as a means of guaranteeing complete transparency.
When I consider the amendments, I have to say that the European People's Party is shocked that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled an amendment to another article, while their own coordinator declared this amendment to be inadmissible.
What we in the PPE-DE Group want is a prompt review, and we welcome the Council's pledge in this respect, to carry out a complete overhaul in the first half of 2007; I assume that the Commissioner will be acting in accordance with this Commission proposal to the Council.
Mr President, my group supports the rapporteur's call for clarity and transparency with regard to the circulation of compound feedingstuffs.
We also pay tribute to his considerable efforts to find a compromise solution.
The discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have revealed a great variety of opinions, especially on the open declaration for compound feedingstuffs.
Views differed not only on the pros and cons of individual amendments, but particularly on their legal admissibility.
The reason for this was not necessarily the controversial nature of the subject alone, but chiefly the exceptionally complicated legal preliminaries to the procedure.
At this point, I should like to remind the House that we are talking about a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council correcting a 2002 directive amending a 1979 directive on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs that is based on a ruling by the European Court of Justice of 6 December 2005.
The codecision procedure has been applied, although, as a rule, the Committee on Agriculture has only the right to be consulted.
Following much to-ing and fro-ing, advance talks with the Council produced a line that my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, can support.
The Commission has promised to present a revised version of the whole feedingstuffs declaration next year.
I hope this will indeed bring clarity and transparency for farmers, for consumers, for the industry and, most of all, for us politicians.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the rapporteur may well be absent, but I would still like to extend warm thanks to him, because I have the impression that, even though he has been a Member of this House for years, he has not lost any of the initial enthusiasm he displayed in the past.
Looking back, the European Union has been faced with a number of unparalleled cattle feed scandals that have had a profound impact on policy.
It is therefore self-evident that we cannot exercise enough care in the cattle feed sector, and there is every reason to put sound checks in place.
The big question is whether we will resolve this if we indicate exact percentages and quantities on the label, and so this method is probably ineffective, as the content changes by the day, and I know few farmers who study every label before they decide which cattle feed to buy.
What matters to an average farmer, an average cattle farmer, is the energy content of the feed, the protein content and the company's reputation.
What is the role of the government in all of this?
Should the government always need to have a certain insight into what a certain manufacturer does, and how can this be monitored?
I therefore think it important that every cattle feed manufacturer in Europe should have the information available at any time in order to be able to present it to anyone who is interested, which does not mean to say that all company secrets should all of a sudden be out in the open.
Quite the reverse; I doubt whether we can make this demand.
There are certain experiences that are beneficial to certain factories and these can be sustained, but I think that the Commission must be able to say that as a government body or national body, it must always be able to check the cattle feed composition and the possible impact this feed has on public health.
One of the interesting aspects of the Court of Justice's judgment was that the directive's criteria, as we know them, were not at all in proportion with the directive key objective, namely better public health.
My burning question is therefore: the current Commission is very much in favour of less legislation, but how can this be married with the Commission's past requirements - and perhaps even today's if I interpret the proposal correctly - involving precise percentages?
I cannot see how this can be done.
Less regulation and at the same time an indication of exact percentages?
Another big area of concern for me is the fact that in seven of the Member States, the national judicial authorities have already declared the directive to be inadmissible.
I am therefore tempted to think that the entire directive in its current form is a legal ogre; I therefore welcome the Commission proposal to table a fresh proposal at the earliest opportunity.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank our rapporteur, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has made real efforts to reach a consensus with all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I support two substantive amendments, as I believe that text that is excessively detailed and excessively well meaning often confuses rather than enlightens.
I am in full agreement that, in case of calamities, the competent authorities need to obtain precise details of the feed materials contained in the feedingstuff concerned, and that these details must be disclosed.
Naturally, the definition of 'calamities' is open to debate but, in my opinion, common sense will determine this in the end.
Secondly, it is important that, as part of the simplification programme, the proposals to overhaul feed legislation be drawn up by mid-2007.
I believe that we have all learnt from the mistakes of the past.
We hope that the BSE crisis in the late 1990s was a one-off, an extreme situation, that will never happen again.
I would say to the Commissioner that transparency is essential when it comes to the production of foodstuffs, in particular.
The simplification programme for food and feed legislation is along the same lines.
Now, more than ever, transparency and confidence in a product are unbeatable advantages in international competition for consumers; but we do have to permit international competition in Europe, too.
. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend my thanks - which will be passed on, I am sure - to the rapporteur for his work, but I regret that the Commission has not accepted the proposal for a decision of Parliament amending the Directive of 2002 on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs.
In fact, while the requirement to provide the authorities alone with the composition of the mixtures in the event of a crisis admittedly represents a step forward, it is not sufficient, and the issue should therefore be tackled when the legislation is reviewed by the Commission in 2007.
It is essential that farmers using these feedingstuffs should be aware of the origin of the ingredients, whether these be vegetable or mineral.
Different mineral and vegetable proteins have different properties, and it was for lack of information about origins that, for example, feed was found to contain rendered animal fats, leading to the infamous BSE crisis.
Furthermore, the composition of the mixtures cannot be withheld on the pretext of protecting the intellectual property rights to the formulas.
In carrying out their work and making up the feed ration for their livestock using some of their own produce, farmers must be able to balance the feed by supplementing it with a mixture.
In order to maintain this balance, it is therefore crucial for farmers to be aware of the composition of the mixture that they buy.
