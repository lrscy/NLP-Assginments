In short, despite the amendments made to the Commission's proposals by this report, agribusiness and the manufacturers of feedingstuffs are still unduly favoured at the expense of farmers.
(DE) Commissioner, today, on the basis of a ruling by the European Court of Justice, we are discussing the correction of Directive 2002/2/EC regarding the circulation of compound feedingstuffs, or the compound feedingstuffs declaration.
The aim of this Directive is not the protection of health; in this respect, the ruling by the European Court of Justice was acceptable.
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development held a broad debate followed by the presentation of amendments calling for provisions on giving feedingstuff ingredients by weight and detailing these in percentages.
I should like to express my particular thanks to the rapporteur.
I also support the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, particularly my amendment - which has been adopted - calling for no further-reaching amendments to be made to the legal act from now on, to enable swift action.
The Commission has announced its intention to draw up proposals by mid-2007 to overhaul feed legislation, and it should do so.
That would be a good time to discuss the proposals, which should take into account not only consumer issues, but also the interests of farmers in being provided with precise, detailed information on the feed materials contained in feedingstuffs, and the interest of the industry in ensuring that business secrets are adequately protected.
It could also be a suitable time to reconsider the possibility, in future, of using high-quality animal proteins or protein components, which was of course banned following BSE and is still not accepted now.
As we all know, only feedingstuffs containing the best, high-quality ingredients guarantee animal welfare, optimum performance and high-quality foodstuffs.
(NL) Mr President, since the BSE crisis and the dioxin scandals, farmers and consumers have, now more than ever, been in need of reliable information about the origin and content of cattle feed.
Clear rules in this respect are lacking.
Effective prevention of outbreaks of animal diseases requires maximum transparency and this interest must prevail over that of industry that refuses to reveal the content of cattle feed.
Since a compromise is well within reach, I am imploring the Commission to come up with a fresh proposal in 2007.
The designation of all ingredients must be compulsory, but the percentages are only essential for the substances that determine the name of the product.
Exact percentages need not always be displayed.
The rules for cattle feed should really not be any stricter than those for human food, but the information must be displayed on the products themselves for the benefit of the users, the farmers and consumers and not kept quiet until something goes wrong, for by then it is too late.
The Commission proposal should bring clarity to the area of ingredients.
A transparent market is needed; farmers and consumers are entitled to this, as is the cattle feed industry.
Unfortunately, the Conservatives and Liberals in this House have, in their amendments, been led too much by industry.
The EU will need to make tracks in deciding in favour of rules that are in the interest of the consumer and farmer.
No unnecessary delays; every farmer wants to know the exact content of their animal feed.
Prevention of a new crisis requires maximum transparency that must be achieved in 2007.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I would like to thank Members for this interesting debate.
I shall now continue in Greek.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to remind you that today we are called upon to decide or agree on a proposal for a decision that amends the directive, based on the decision of the European Court.
I think that everyone agrees on this point, namely that irrespective of the opinions that each one of us has, this is not a suitable moment to discuss the full review of the legislation.
As I have assured you before, this will take place within the next year; hopefully before the end of next year.
I believe it is of interest, for you too I hope, that until then we will issue a report regarding the implementation of Directive 2002/2/EC, namely how this directive has been implemented by Member States, a fact that will help both our later discussion on the full review of the legislation.
Of course, today's discussion demonstrates the high level of interest regarding the improvement of the legislation, considering that there is always room for improvement, and of course Parliament's commitment to observing established procedures.
I am certain that Parliament will listen to our proposal by correcting, at this stage, the directive on the labelling of feedingstuffs, based on the Court's decision.
With regard to the amendments, we will circulate a full list with the Commission's position on each one of the amendments and I hope that this list will be included in the Minutes of this meeting.
Allow me to mention a couple of issues: The lawful ground of Directive 2002/2 is the protection of public health, something that is significantly linked to the safety of feedingstuffs, of course.
This was confirmed by the Court's decision; this is why the Commission cannot accept Amendment 1 which would seriously undermine this principle.
The new article that is recommended by Amendment 4, regarding the notification of the exact percentages in the event of major crises, includes something that has already been integrated in the directive in a very explicit manner.
In such cases, the exact percentages will be given; this is why we do not consider it necessary to adopt the amendment that overrules this provision, therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendment 4.
Once again I would like to assure you that this proposal is included in the Commission's programme regarding the simplification and improvement of the legislation.
In other words, it has included this legislation regarding the labelling of feedingstuffs in its proposal.
I believe that the discussion prior to this corrective decision will be taken into consideration during the formation of the new proposal, however we will, of course, have the opportunity to discuss again at a reasonable time our future proposal regarding the labelling of feedingstuffs, trying, always something that is not easy, I admit to combine consumer protection, improved consumer services with a reduction in the costs incurred by other bodies involved.
This is our objective and we believe that through this cooperation we will succeed.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12.30 p.m.

Mr President, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has already presented to plenary the reports by Mrs Kudrycka, Mrs SegelstrÃ¶m and Mr La Russa on the legislative proposals for which the Commission requests use of the urgency procedure.
We believe that, from a political point of view, the compromise that we have been able to achieve with the other institutions is acceptable, and we are therefore in favour of plenary adopting these reports during this part-session.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to say - speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - that we are in full agreement with that, and I think that the Members belonging to the other groups in this House will be able to give their consent too.
(Parliament adopted the urgent procedure)
Financing instrument for development cooperation - A financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the
Recommendation for a second reading, by Mr Mitchell, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (11944/2/2006 C6-0357/2006
and
the report by Mr Martin on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on the draft Council regulation establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (11877/2006 - C6-0265/2006 -
rapporteur. - Mr President, this regulation has been in gestation for almost two years.
At times, the pressure on Parliament to cave in, to divide, to give up our legislative role, was barely tolerable.
I have been taken aback by the willingness of fellow MEPs, at times, to give other institutions carte blanche in this important area, so long as some little interest of theirs or influence was not lost.
However, I wish to pay tribute to my colleagues in the Committee on Development - Members who did not allow pressure to divide us, across all groups, and who, in the end, carried the day.
I should also like to pay tribute to the secretariat of the Development Committee and to the secretariats of those groups that worked constructively with us in these negotiations.
Having threatened to reject the original Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument (DCECI), as it was called, which sought to take away codecision powers by changing the legal base from Article 179 to Article 181a and to include developed countries and expenditure on non-development issues in a development instrument, we have negotiated with the Council and the Commission an instrument which few thought possible 12 months ago, one that will streamline EU activities for the developing world while maintaining accountability and transparency.
I should like to pay tribute, in particular, to the negotiating team who accompanied me at those talks, to the successive presidencies for the work they have put in and to the Commission for a good outcome.
I have one reservation, however.
I believe it was Voltaire who said, 'I do not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'
Having approached the whole of the negotiations in a way that sought to accommodate, I was very disappointed that, on one particular issue, my views were not accommodated.
It is not about diluting the availability of health services for women in need.
In fact, if my amendments - which were modest - had been carried, the Cairo Conference and all the related issues would have been respected.
Indeed, having been at the centre of compromise, finding and supporting others, I was surprised that my modest proposals did not receive proper consideration.
Part of the reason for that seems to me to have been a piece of written advice that was circulated, which pre-empted my proposals by claiming that PPE policy had been decided.
As the signatures to the amendments show here today, that is not the case and should not have been stated, especially at what was a very sensitive time in the concluding stages of the negotiations.
I can support the general content of the common position, with that one reservation.
I think it is a very good outcome for us: Parliament has gained, insofar as we have maintained codecision under Article 179, which is a very important principle to us.
It is to be time-limited legislation.
The specific instrument for development policy is this instrument; it will not have any other content.
There will be more detailed financial provisions: the financial provisions of the proposal were another area of very serious concern for the Committee, as they were extremely general and very far from the level of detail to which Parliament, as part of the budgetary authority, was accustomed.
That has now changed, and the common position now includes a breakdown of funding by programme and, in some cases, within programmes.
We are also breaking new ground.
The new DCI will, for the first time, enshrine in a legal text the internationally accepted definition of development policy set out by the OECD Development Assistance Committee.
A Commission declaration attached to the new DCI will contain, also for the first time, the benchmark that the Committee on Development has been using since 2003 to promote increased focus on the key MDG sectors of basic education and basic health, and the Commission has never before accepted the Committee's 20% benchmark for these sectors, which has been accepted on this occasion.
In relation to democratic scrutiny, further headway has also been made on the matter of the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission on the draft strategy papers to allow effective Parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI, and I wish to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Commissioner Michel for their letter to me and to the chairperson of the Committee confirming that.
Parliament does not want, or need, to be involved in micro-management, but it does give us an opportunity, through whatever structures we decide ourselves, to get involved at an early stage, thereby giving Parliament a much improved role in the whole area of transparency and accountability.
With the exception that I mentioned, I consider the common position as established by the Council to be a very good outcome for the European Parliament.
As I said at the outset, I doubt very much that anybody 12 months ago would have thought that we could have achieved what we did achieve.
But it shows that, when Parliament stands together, when the different groups do not allow themselves to be divided and are determined not to give away the powers of this House, we can, with the other institutions, come up with a very good instrument and one that ensures that the prerogatives of this House are protected.
rapporteur. - Mr President, before turning to my own report, let me congratulate Mr Mitchell on his.
As the House will know, these two instruments started life as a single instrument and the Committee on Development was correct to argue that they needed to be separated because we were mixing apples and pears.
The development instrument essentially aims to promote the interests of developing countries.
The economic instrument, the one I am responsible for, is about promoting - not exclusively, but mainly - the interests of the European Union.
It was therefore wrong that these two objectives should have been contained in a single instrument.
The Committee on Development was correct to argue for a separate instrument and it was also correct to argue that it should be pushing hard for the European Parliament's involvement to at least be the same as it is under the plethora of existing instruments.
So, I congratulate Mr Mitchell on his report.
Turning to my own report, it is small in importance compared with the other external instruments, but still a significant tool of this European Union.
It expands on the existing programmes, firstly in terms of geographical areas: the existing programmes cover just six countries, this new instrument will cover 17 countries.
It is expanded in terms of objectives and, as one would hope with both the objectives and the geographical area being expanded, it is also expanded in terms of its budget.
So, while it is the smallest of the external instruments, it is still a significant instrument.
It focuses on furthering EU interests in industrialised countries and it builds on the highly successful executive training programme for Japan and Korea and the Gateway to Japan programme.
Both have been subject to a Commission-financed study, which demonstrates that they have increased the access of European companies in both Japan and Korea and increased the awareness of the European Community in those two countries and so are worthwhile in themselves.
The new programme will have five key objectives: to build on public diplomacy and outreach; the promotion of economic partnership and business; people-to-people links, particularly through education; encouraging dialogues; and finally the evaluation of small-scale cooperation projects to assist small and medium-sized enterprises to get access to third country markets.
These are all very worthwhile objectives.
In terms of the Committee on International Trade's approach, we have concentrated on three things.
First, given that the scope of the programmes has expanded from 6 to 17 countries, we have insisted that there is room for differentiation within the programme - a one-size-fits-all approach would simply not work in a programme like this.
I am glad to say that the Commission has gone along with the idea that the programme should be country-specific, rather than a general programme for 17 countries.
We have also tabled amendments to ensure that this programme is complementary to the other instruments that we will be adopting either today or at a later stage.
Again, given that the programme has expanded, we have insisted that there should be human rights and rule of law clauses in these instruments.
Again both the Council and the Commission have indicated a willingness to accept those amendments.
I am also pleased to say that, despite this being only a consultation and not a codecision matter, unlike Mr Mitchell's report, the Council has agreed to attach the two interinstitutional agreements on budgetary discipline and democratic scrutiny.
It has also agreed that Parliament should be more involved in this programme than originally envisaged and has accepted that, if the scope of the programme is altered, either geographically or in terms of its objectives, Parliament will be fully consulted.
The Commission has also agreed to bring forward multiannual planning for consultation with Parliament on this.
So the level of parliamentary involvement has been significantly increased.
Finally, let me conclude by saying that there is a chance that, if we adopt all the amendments today, this instrument will be adopted by the Council in exactly the form that it leaves Parliament.
That is quite an achievement, given that it is only a consultation exercise.
I would like to thank the Commission for its excellent cooperation, and particularly the Finnish Presidency, which, on a relatively minor instrument compared to the other instruments, has been fully engaged in Parliament's work, has kept us fully abreast of its position and has made compromises.
We have made compromises with the Presidency.
I think in the end we have got a very workable instrument and I would like to thank all the institutions for their cooperation.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, this December part-session is an important milestone in establishing an effective and streamlined legislative framework for the Community's external spending.
I must say I feel honoured that I represent the Commission in this part-session, as we are now close to concluding negotiations on the four remaining instruments for the delivery of external spending, for the future period from 2007 to 2013.
We have all come a long way since the Commission tabled these proposals two years ago.
The new simplified architecture was the first attempt to streamline all the instruments for external spending.
This was deemed the highest priority for the Commission in order to increase our own efficiency and coherence and that of our external action as a whole.
While both Parliament and the Council welcomed the simplification process, these proposals generated a very substantial debate.
Important questions were raised soon after Parliament began its work.
I greatly appreciate the efforts made by Parliament and the successive Council presidencies to find constructive solutions to the challenges we have encountered with these innovative proposals.
These efforts culminated in a successful trialogue in June 2006 when an overall agreement was reached on the architecture of the external financing instruments.
Reflecting your concern to ensure a strong development focus for the development cooperation instrument, we agreed to separate the instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries.
A specific human rights instrument was also established.
To address your further concerns, it was agreed that the instruments be adopted under codecision whenever the Treaty made this possible, and a separate instrument for nuclear safety cooperation was created so that the instrument for stability could pass from consultation to codecision.
In total four of the seven new instruments are now co-decided.
This gives Parliament a legitimate and unprecedented degree of legislative power over the framework covering external spending.
As for the development cooperation instrument, which represents the central brick in this new architecture, I greatly appreciate the fruitful cooperation with Parliament, especially during the last five months, and I thank the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, for the central role he has played in bringing the negotiations to a positive and timely conclusion.
I should further thank the Committee on Development's negotiating team.
The compromise as reflected in the negotiated common position of the Council represents a finely balanced solution.
I also appreciate that the Committee on Development endorsed this compromise and recommended the approval of the negotiated common position of the Council at second reading.
As requested by Parliament, the development cooperation instrument now includes indicative financial allocations, a mid-term review and an expiry date.
For the new co-decided instruments, we have also agreed that before undertaking the review Parliament should examine the operation of the instruments to identify any dysfunctional situations which may have arisen.
Parliament's report would be considered by the Commission in carrying out the review of the instruments.
This review should be carried out in 2009.
In response to the letter sent by the chair of the Committee on Development, Mrs Morgantini, I am pleased to confirm that this review date will also apply to the development cooperation instrument.
In comparison with the development cooperation instrument, and if budgetary clout is a measure of importance, the instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries does not stand out as the biggest amongst the external action instruments, but this should not lead to underestimating its utility and its relevance in enhancing the role of the European Union in the wider world.
Indeed, this instrument will directly help promote the EU's objective of becoming a more visible player on the global stage.
It will achieve this objective by providing a framework in which, through concrete initiatives, we can strengthen relations with key developed partners, promote Community interests, and also raise awareness about the EU there.
Since last June, the rapporteur, the Finnish Presidency and the Commission have worked hand-in-hand to ensure a timely adoption of the instrument, while making sure that the views of each institution are duly taken into consideration.
In this regard I would like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur, David Martin, and the Committee on International Trade as a whole for their hard work and the spirit of cooperation demonstrated in expeditiously processing the dossier.
This ongoing dialogue has permitted the factoring-in of Parliament's views in preparatory discussions in the Council held in parallel with parliamentary work and therefore, thanks also to this collaborative approach, beyond the Commission's own view and without encroaching on the Council's prerogatives.
I can envision with some confidence that key amendments regarding, in particular, references to the core values of the Community - democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights; the protection of the Community's interests; reinforced evaluation and reporting provisions for the specification of an indicative financial envelope for the period 2007-13; or the inclusion of the review clause - will find their way into the final text.
Furthermore, additional editorial changes will bring the final text more into line with language suggested by Parliament and with language already agreed in other external action instruments, to ensure sound coherence between them.
I am looking forward to a positive outcome to the votes on the development cooperation instrument today.
That will allow the Commission to start its work as of 1 January and for the delivery of the external assistance without any further delay, which is so important.
With an agreement on the remaining legislative proposals the European Union will significantly increase the effectiveness of its external spending and, in particular, its visibility on the international scene, allowing it to live up to its role as major donor of development aid.
Similarly, I welcome the positive view taken on the industrialised countries instrument in the report that is put before Parliament today.
I can give you a clear assurance that the final text, which the Council is set to adopt very soon, will also substantively reflect the main thrust of Parliament's resolution.
That is a testimony to our willingness to work constructively with Parliament on this dossier, something that will continue in future in implementing cooperation activities, with industrialised countries as well.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner and to thank the rapporteur for all his work and cooperation on this report.
The rapporteur and I often joke that we find very little to disagree on when it comes to international trade issues.
When it came to shadowing this report, once again we found very little to disagree on, partly because the rapporteur is such an expert in this area and has dealt with it in a number of other reports.
I should just like to repeat what good cooperation there was, and I have actually learnt quite a lot from him throughout this process.
One day I will find something to disagree with him about, but for now let us look at the issues.
We all agree that the proposal should be tightened and clarified.
It is very important that we define the EU's strategic interest, and I welcome the amendments adopted in committee to this end.
We must also have consistency across the financial instruments.
Once again, the rapporteur and I had a number of discussions in this area, and I am very pleased that these were adopted.
The other area is the review clause.
It is very important to decide whether this instrument should be reviewed during the lifetime of this Parliament or after the European elections of 2009 when new Members come in.
Those new Members will not have our expertise in this matter, and that is why I would have preferred to have seen a review within the lifetime of this Parliament.
Finally, the report has got it right on human rights and democracy, especially when we are dealing with developed countries.
Let us hope that we can continue to pursue these goals within the framework of trade agreements and continue to work with our partners.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, with the new development instrument we are at last getting a piece of development legislation that will give centre stage to the Millennium Objectives, which represent a pledge we made to millions of children in Africa, a pledge that has to do with education and health care.
Unfortunately, the bitter reality is that in recent years, the Millennium Objectives have, rather than coming closer, tended to disappear out of sight, and it was for precisely that reason that we were so tough in the debate on the present financing instrument.
For one and a half years, we debated long and hard about this new piece of legislation; that was no mean feat, and it turned out not to be in vain.
In the next seven years, we have one clear European Development Act which, with a clear, thematic programme and a geographic programme accounting together for nearly 70 billion, will map out the course.
This is putting an end to 16 different regulations that are difficult to implement and monitor.
The new Act has two clear priorities, namely the Millennium Objectives, and within these objectives education and basic health care, areas, in short, that really matter.
The campaigns we have launched in order to achieve this have not been in vain.
We have campaigned with school teachers' unions and many other organisations from the world of education, including Education International, in order to try to make education more central to European development programmes.
The same applies to our campaigns involving health workers in an effort to double spending in basic health care.
Finally, the Commission has now officially pledged to at least double its spending by 2008, with at least 20% of the geographical budget being spent on education and basic health care.
Including the thematic dimension of the Act, this amounts to more than EUR 2.5 billion.
With this new financing instrument, Europe, with its Member States, can now make a difference in Africa.
There are still more than 45 million children who have no access to schooling and millions of patients, especially girls, who have to go without basic health care.
In 2015, they will enjoy the education and heathcare provision to which they are entitled.
This will put an end to the fight I, together with my group, have put up from the moment I took my seat as an MEP in 1999.
I would thank all European citizens and organisations who have helped me along the way, ranging from the 'STOP AIDS Alliance' to 'Bono' - thank you!
On 1 January 2007, we start a fresh chapter, namely that of putting this act, along with all its principles and promises, into practice.
This is something to which the Committee on Development will be devoting much of its parliamentary time, both in terms of programming national policy plans and of monitoring their implementation.
We do not want a noncommittal attitude.
We want 100% commitment from all parties.
This is why we do not accept that the programming stage for the period up to 2008 should already be completed.
Consultations with civil organisations and parliaments over there and NGOs and our Parliament over here must be done in accordance with the new agreements.
This is incumbent on the Commission by law from 1 January.
I assume the Commissioner is in agreement with me on this and that he is prepared to confirm this unconditionally.
Ten days ago, the funding of the Global Fund was yet again set to jeopardise the arrangements made in respect of the thematic section for the Act of 2007.
Fortunately, with a letter dated 8 December, the Commission asserted its willingness to respect the thematic programming arrangement for 2007.
It would be good if the Commissioner were to confirm this, and by doing so, put the mind at rest of the 23 NGOs that will be presenting President Barroso with an urgent note on this matter this weekend.
I would wish the President, Mr Mitchell, the Council and Commission good luck with this success.
I am also enormously grateful to them for the thorough cooperation; I do hope that this House will reject the cancellation amendment, because I think we made it clear that we no longer accept amendments.
This Act is it; let us make it a success.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Regulation of the financing instrument for development cooperation and economic cooperation presented by the European Commission two years ago to the European Parliament did not satisfy the European Parliament.
The Regulation sought to curb the European Parliament's general decision-making powers, and it did not adhere to the principles of development cooperation policy, conflating economic cooperation with developing and developed countries.
Today in a second reading we are discussing a differently-named document concerning a European Parliament and European Commission Regulation defining a financing instrument for cooperation that supports development.
It was particularly important for the Committee on Development to have a financing instrument for development cooperation intended only for developing countries.
The document submitted for a second reading is really a compromise European Parliament, European Council and European Commission document, drafted in tripartite negotiations.
Consensus rule is back in, as is budgetary transparency and accountability to Parliament; past budget items have been returned along with detailed financial guidelines and specific development cooperation provisions.
It should be stressed that we agreed to rely on EC Treaty Article 179, since a broad definition of cooperation in support of development and a broad choice of action according to geographical and thematic programmes is assured by consensus.
The geographical programmes cover Latin America, Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Africa.
The specified thematic programmes include such programmes as investing in people, management of the environment and sustainable natural resources, including energy resources, participation of non-governmental organisations and local government institutions in the development process, food security and migration, and asylum.
It is gratifying that agreement was reached on basic education and healthcare financing and that more than 20% of the funds allocated to development will be earmarked for this, which is one of the priorities of the European Parliament Committee on Development.
The Commission made a commitment to carry out increased and more precise monitoring of implementation.
We regularly felt this was lacking when approving budget implementation.
The Regulation on Financing Instrument for Development Cooperation replaced 16 existing pieces of legislation, which is a good step towards improving and simplifying EU legislation.
I recommend that the Regulation be approved without addition or amendment.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mitchell, this House, the Council and the Commission have spent much time wrangling over the future development finance instrument, and have actually ended up finding a largely sustainable compromise.
The intention is that the new instrument should help us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, thus forwarding a very important objective of which both the committee and this House as a whole have been recurrent defenders, and, in view of the UN's recently-published estimate of their effectiveness to date, particularly in the fight against poverty, I see the EU as sending out a very important message in that respect.



It is evident that Mr Mitchell's dedication, as rapporteur, and that of the Committee on Development as a whole, to changing the regulation as tabled has very definitely paid off, and so, with compromise in mind, all the groups have held back from tabling amendments, although the rapporteur has not, and I have to say, with some regret, that this is where he comes in for strong criticism from me, for, rather than doing what he said he would and supporting those who want to grapple with the wording of the compromise agreement, Mr Mitchell has himself been tabling the relevant amendments, which I see as being, in many respects, highly problematic and outrageous, in that they demand nothing less than that the reproductive health of women should cease to be a goal in development cooperation; his amendments aimed at deleting Recital 18 and parts of Articles 5 and 12 do not merely do away with the wordings he finds disagreeable, contrary to what he has said, but also have the effect of removing other goals as well, among them the right to give birth free of risk and to generalised access to comprehensive, safe and reliable reproductive sexual health care and services, the reduction of infant mortality and the fight against diseases associated with poverty, particularly HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.
In so doing, he disregards not only the compromise already arrived at, but also world opinion as expressed at the UN conferences on population development, in Cairo, and on the situation of women, held in Beijing, and hence also the WHO's definition.
That I regard as a scandal, and I think this House would be making itself look utterly ridiculous if it were to adopt his amendments tomorrow.
My group will, as a matter of profound conviction, be voting against them.
I think it makes a great deal of sense to combine the EU's aid options - which have hitherto been highly chaotic - in a single instrument, but this must not have the consequence of important matters simply being dropped.
Since the rapporteur is questioning the compromise, I can already tell him that my group will, in future, be asking searching questions about one aspect of the new finance instrument in particular, namely the use of development cooperation resources to fund measures aimed against illegal immigration and used for the stepping up of border controls.
Article 16(2)c introduces into this compromise something that perverts virtually the whole of immigration and asylum policy, which, as formulated elsewhere in Article 16, is a positive approach.
You can be sure that my group, in doing this, will avail itself of one particularly positive aspect of the new instrument, namely the better opportunity given to this House to have direct input alongside the Council and the Commission, at whose insistence, significantly, trade will, in future, be included alongside the funding of development.
Notwithstanding the fact that the first words of the new instrument stress the importance of the developing countries' trading capacities, we will be most careful to ensure that we do not embark upon a new decade characterised by the covert promotion of external trade.
We will ask searching questions and take a critical line if, in so doing, your sole desire is to help the countries of the Global South to sell Europe the raw materials it needs without let or hindrance, for it is not selling all their raw materials, but rather fair trade with finished goods, that offers southern societies a chance to overcome poverty.
A fortnight ago, in the Financial Times, Philippe Maystadt, the President of the European Investment Bank, warned that Europe was imposing too stringent conditions on financial arrangements to be able to compete with Chinese or Russian businesses for African raw materials.
Where is this argument going?
Do we not then end up again tolerating slave labour in order not to lose the race for raw materials?
I find it quite remarkable, and a cause for rejoicing, that it is stated in the present financial instrument and in our compromise that the criteria to be met include that of 'decent work' on which the mind of this House is shortly to be expressed by a report.
I believe that this sends a very important message in response to calls - which I regard as wrong-headed - for the European Union, in future, to be less exacting in its political criteria in terms of the war on poverty and the advancement of development.
Let us instead use the new instrument, knowing how important coherence and policy are, to offer something better, with bauxite being turned into aluminium locally, using environmentally-friendly methods, by workers working under decent conditions and for living wages.
The new instrument will have achieved something if it manages to create the conditions with respect to education and health without which productive economic performance that benefits the local community is not even possible.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, our privileged and wealthy part of the world bears a great deal of responsibility towards those who are starving and have no prospects of development.
Of course, the aid which we provide to these people cannot solve all their problems, some of which have deeper, political causes.
However, it can help to resolve crises.
I think that we are unanimous in recognising our humanitarian duties, and this gives us great strength.
That is why I am all the more opposed to the introduction of legislation relating to so-called reproductive and sexual rights, which implies our political and financial support for abortion.
This proposal was not contained in the initial European Commission draft, and was only introduced in this Parliament.
This sends a very negative signal to those Europeans who have moral objections to abortion and do not want to pay for activities which hide behind the faÃ§ade of the technical term 'reproductive rights'.
After all, it is a means of undermining the common front against poverty and of weakening European integration.
Is that really what we want?
Can we ignore the consciences of many Christians simply because of the fact that today they are in the minority?
Today, we are clearly letting them know that Europe has become a project in which they will no longer play any part.
I therefore call on you to support Amendments 1, 2 and 3.
Without these amendments, I will not be able to vote in favour of this report.
Mr President, I see that there is a great eagerness in this Parliament to offer opinions on everything under the sun. Everything from extremely important issues such as chemicals legislation to small ones such as the standardisation of windscreen wipers crop up for consideration.
We are now debating the financing instrument for the EU's development cooperation.
I am convinced that all my colleagues in the Committee on Development want to see a reduction in world poverty so that vulnerable people around the world can live tolerable lives.
I believe that most of my fellow Members desire the same thing.
I should like, however, to call on them to stop and think a moment.
Is the EU really doing everything in its power to reduce poverty globally?
I find it very difficult to understand how, at one moment, people can sit and recommend aid under the auspices of the EU and then, at the next moment, support subsidies for EU agriculture or a harmful fisheries agreement with a poor African country in which corruption is a major problem.
If we really want to help poor and vulnerable people in the world, we should really come at things from another angle.
Let us abolish the EU's common agricultural policy and protectionist trade policy and let us stop protecting non-competitive European production.
My proposals would obviously not solve all the problems in the world, but I believe that they would be a good start.
(SK) First of all I would like to state that in my opinion both economic and development cooperation should be included in a single financial instrument underpinned by a double legal basis, namely Articles 179 and 181(a).
However, I respect the conclusions of the trilateral meetings which resulted in the original financial instrument being divided into economic and development cooperation.
The instrument used to finance cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories is financially flexible, and its expanded geographic scope reflects the current situation.
It also considers countries that are still on the DAC list to be developing countries despite the fact that they have long since ceased to be ones.
This includes countries like Brunei, Taiwan, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar etc. These nations are important trading partners of the European Union, and it is therefore necessary to expand the existing cooperation with countries such as Japan, South Africa and Australia to include the above-mentioned new countries.
As the countries covered by this financial instrument represent a very mixed bag, it is imperative that all treaties should include clauses on human rights and respect for democratic principles.
In my amendments to the report, I have highlighted the need for strengthening the role of the European Parliament.
In conclusion, I am in favour of the European Parliament endorsing every change on the list of industrialised counties and of the Commission being required to assess compliance with the original objectives and costs on a regular basis.
Finally, Commissioner, I would like to express my admiration for your work.
(NL) Mr President, since development cooperation has its own Commissioner, its own budget, and its own committee in the European Parliament, and since this House has codecision powers in this area, it has been an important sphere of activity since the beginning of European cooperation.
The European Union is right to feel responsible for contributing to peace and prosperity in countries outside of the Union.
The fact that the Commission has made an attempt to make improvements is a good thing.
While we invest a great deal, the results are sometimes far from satisfactory.
Africa is a case in point, for poverty there even appears to be on the increase.
Much needs yet to be done in order to achieve the Millennium Development Objectives.
The Commission's original proposal was meant to improve matters, but was, in fact, extremely disappointing and hardly confidence inspiring.
Both the budget for development cooperation and this House's involvement were at risk of being adversely affected.
The negotiations were not easy as a result.
All credit to Mr Mitchell who has done a fantastic job.
The upshot is that a separate development instrument will in any event remain in place, with codecision and with Article 179 as its only legal basis.
An agreement has been reached on the priorities of the Millennium Development Objectives within which priority has been given to education and basic health care.
This also includes reproductive health, and I should like to add, also in reaction to Mrs Zimmer, that the amendments have been tabled in order to underline the importance of this issue.
It is incorrect to say that Mr Mitchell's amendments are opposed to reproductive health.
He states - and I am quoting from his explanatory note to the amendments - that it is too important an issue to handle in two sentences flat, which is saying something completely different.
The new financing instrument for development cooperation is set to change the way Parliament works; we will need to focus more on the monitoring and implementation side of programmes.
I hope that we can count on the Commission's promised cooperation and openness in this matter.
(ES) Mr President, this debate is important because we are going to approve the instrument that will serve as a legal basis for using the resources that the European Union allocates to development cooperation and humanitarian action.
While the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 reduces the Union's capacity to act in almost all fields, paradoxically, the money available to us for our solidarity with the developing world is not being reduced, but rather it is increasing slightly.
This debate provides a satisfactory end to a process that has lasted an exceptionally long time, having had to overcome serious difficulties.
However, the instrument that we will approve has the merit of reaching the House as the result of a consensus between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
The search for that consensus was the reason for the process taking so long.
It was a complicated challenge, since the task was to condense, into one single legal instrument, the more than fifteen previously in force over which the bases for our development cooperation actions were spread.
It was a question of rationalising that task, and Parliament agreed with that.
Nevertheless, it had to reject the Commission's initial proposals when, supposedly for the sake of greater efficiency, it came to restricting the House's role, that is to say, to restricting democracy.
That was something that Parliament could not accept and our Committee on Development acted with a degree of responsibility that we should be proud of.
Despite what some people claimed, it was not a question of promoting the role of our committee.
It was a question of maintaining and increasing the role of Parliament, that is to say, the democratic responsibility of our House, in a field that is important from political and budgetary points of view.
Many of us have had to confront totalitarian powers, which justified their authoritarianism by stating that democracy complicated procedures and made management less efficient.
We all know what a fallacy that is, however, and that there can be no efficiency without democratic rules, both when actions are decided upon and when the executive's actions are subject to control.
Thanks to our firmness with regard to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, and thanks to all of the groups rallying round, our efforts ended in success.
We must thank the British, Austrian and Finnish Presidencies for the understanding they have shown towards our points of view, and also the Commission, which has sought ways to take account of Parliament's demands.
The text of the instrument is consistent with the European consensus on development and with the various strategies that we have been approving, particularly the European strategy for the development of Africa.
It is also consistent with the text of the Constitution, which makes solidarity with the countries of the South a constitutional priority for the European Union.
My concern is that, having consolidated Parliament's competences, we are now going to fail to meet the responsibilities conferred on us by the instrument and which are going to require a lot of work on the part of the House, its Committee on Development, its staff, which must be increased, incidentally, if we want to be in a position to take on the work, and, above all, on the part of the parliamentary groups, whose obligations are going to be increased since they will have to contribute to the strategy documents for each country targeted by European Union development cooperation, and in monitoring the programmes that are approved.
We must not end up in the ridiculous position of not being able to meet the obligation that we have worked so hard to obtain from the Community's institutional partners.
(FR) Mr President, it is always a pleasure to welcome a consensus and a good result. I therefore join my fellow Members in doing so.
Balance has at last been restored. We have a common legal instrument, expiring in 2013, and we have a mid-term review.
We have an appropriate instrument at last.
We have avoided confusing different terms: no mention is made of industrialised countries or human rights; only development is referred to.
We are able to set clear objectives and point out our political priorities.
We have, at last, an instrument that, as my fellow Members have highlighted, has its legal base in Article 179, which reintroduces the codecision procedure. Never again will the European Parliament be unable to co-decide on a development policy.
We have at last managed to ensure that the financial allocations are linked to different programmes, in order to increase our control.
I would therefore like to highlight the work of our rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, and the attention given to this matter by the Commission and the Council.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, we have taken due note of the Commission's commitments regarding our role during the mid-term review and relating to the rational anchoring of finances, to the dialogue on strategy papers and, as I would like to point out, to our priorities, namely health and education.
To conclude, I believe that our Parliament will have no problem in adopting this report and in adopting it unamended.
I will not waste your time by discussing these amendments, which are certainly out of touch and backward-looking and absurd in every way.
(PL) Mr President, the idea of the European Union providing aid to nations and countries in need is worthy of our support.
However, there are doubts as to whether political issues should be included in cooperation policy as conditions for providing this aid.
I understand the principle of not providing aid to countries that infringe human rights or commit various crimes.
However, using cooperation policy as a tool for forcing countries in need to adopt solutions applied in the European Union as a condition for providing aid is to put unlawful pressure on these nations and goes against the idea of solidarity.
We will do more to promote democratic processes if we show, in our own back yard, that we can protect civil rights and freedoms and ensure respect for and the development of the values which have always been part of the European identity.
Turning cooperation policy into a weapon for militant feminism, for example, which creates a lot of controversy in Europe itself, will undermine our status and power to act in other parts of the world.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the goal we have set ourselves - of increasing official development assistance and halving global poverty by 2015 - is an ambitious one, but it has to be said that we are a long way away from achieving it.
My view is that development assistance has to be a short-term measure, provided where people have nothing, in regions full of refugees or countries in crisis, for example.
In the long term, though, it cannot be a substitute for systems that actually work.
What matters, then, is that recipients of aid be given more power over their own affairs, and that some sort of accountability be required as a means of dealing with corruption and so on.
Africa is an example of how the way development cooperation works is not always ideal, and no wonder, when it was often used to promote the donor countries' exports, to shore up dictatorships or to drive states into debt and dependency, so it is not acceptable that China, for example, should encourage states to get back into the indebtedness from which they have only just escaped and become dependent in new ways, merely in order to secure supplies of raw materials.
Nor, however, is it acceptable that states should be so keen to hold out their hands to receive development funds when they are unwilling to take back any of those of their own citizens who have, in droves, sought refuge elsewhere.
Mr President, I rise to congratulate a number of my colleagues in the Committee on Development, and the rapporteur, Gay Mitchell, in particular, as well as my fellow coordinator, Mrs Martens, and all coordinators of political groups, for having conducted this matter over a period of two years to produce this result.
Why did it take two years, one might ask, given that what we have produced now could have been done in three months?
It took all that time because of a very stubborn attitude from a member of the Commission - a 'commissar', one might say - who was in a senior position in DG RELEX.
It is only because the Commissioners and the Council recognise that the European Parliament is a premier democratic institution, which must be able to criticise legislation and make it accountable.
At a time when the European Parliament and the European institutions are being seen to be remote from our citizens, for the Commission, as it was then, to produce a piece of paper that took away the powers of the Development Committee and the European Parliament to set development policy, was outrageous.
It is only because Parliament stood together as one, despite attempts by certain people to divide Members and to have us at each other's throats, that we succeeded in producing this.
I want this on the record because, as a coordinator for the Development Committee, I can say we went through hell trying to get this thing passed in a way in which parliamentary scrutiny, parliamentary control of policy, parliamentary control of strategy papers, parliamentary control of time-limits on legislation and parliamentary control of specific instruments for development policy were all going to be very important.
We must connect with our people, with our constituents, with our voters.
To have the Commission come in, as though it had come from Moscow in the old Soviet days, was absurd.
I say thank you very much to the Commissioners, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, in particular, and Mr Michel, for understanding that we have a democratic role to play.
(FR) Mr President, a joint declaration on development, a strategy for Africa, commitments on levels of development aid: the EU has certainly revised its political ambitions upwards in recent years when it comes to development cooperation, and this new financing instrument gives us a tool to match our ambitions.
A financing programme over seven years, devoted entirely to international solidarity, really is a great victory for our partners in the South, and it is a great victory for us here in Parliament, because, after two years of locking swords with the Council and the Commission, our main demands have been met.
It is a victory in terms of the commitment to allocate at least 20% of appropriations to the education and basic healthcare sectors, in order to increase the pace of progress on the Millennium Goals; it is a victory in terms of the creation of a specific instrument to fund the promotion of human rights and democracy in the countries of the South; and it is a victory in that it limits the scope of the new instrument to the countries of the South alone, in order to ensure that development appropriations are not siphoned off to other policies.
Finally, the provision of a mid-term review for this vital instrument will give us the opportunity to rework it shortly and to make any necessary improvements.
It is a pleasant prospect, which now allows us to conclude the process of examining this text in peace.
These victories will give rise to others, for example the ongoing negotiations on the programming of the European Development Fund (EDF), which I, as rapporteur, will make every effort to give the same priorities.
Although it is true that, despite our best efforts, we have not managed to achieve the budgetisation of the EDF or to get officially involved in the comitology procedure, in order to keep a closer eye on the implementation of development policy, we should nevertheless be delighted at our many victories, the most important of which is the promotion of a generous view of development policy.
In establishing this development cooperation instrument, the European Union is, more than ever, establishing itself as a leader in this field.
It was already by far the biggest donor in the world in this domain, and it was already doing more than the rest of the world for international solidarity. From now on, it will do even better!
I believe that, today, Europe can be proud of the fact that it has remained loyal to its values of generosity and solidarity.
I, too, would like to echo what has been said, and to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, all those who have worked towards this result - particularly Mr van den Berg - and all those who have made such valuable contributions to it.
I hope that this report will be adopted without amendment.
(ET) The financial instrument for development cooperation involves a very fragile compromise between the commission, the Council and Parliament.
We must also recognise that Parliament's views have largely been taken into consideration during the codecision procedure.
Any proposal to add a new instrument would mean that the instrument would not be implemented from the beginning of the following year, and the aid might not even reach those who need it.
The instrument will cover a broad range of developing countries, from the very least developed countries to high-income countries.
The instrument will also cover a wide range of topics and include activities that were previously financed from the environment budget.
I am satisfied with the course of the proceedings, during which the European People's Party has removed those motions to amend that contained mention of political institutions, and thus I will offer a brief conclusion.
I would like to emphasise once again that the financial instrument for development cooperation is a compromise between institutions, and the slowing of its processing would mean the delaying and interruption of aid, which certainly does not serve the instrument's purpose of promoting democracy and human rights.
I therefore support the passing of the report without any amendments.
(EL) Mr President, my intervention refers to Mr Martin's report, whom I must congratulate on his creative contribution.
His report refers to the financial instrument for developing cooperation with industrialised countries and territories.
The discussion regarding the institution of the said financial instrument is part of a wider problem that concerns primarily the harmonisation of the European Union's actions in foro interno, in foro externo and secondarily the cohesion of the European Union's entire foreign activity, whether political, financial or commercial.
In particular, the proposed regulation unites a heterogeneous group of countries as well as a wide range of activities in fields such as economy, commerce, research and scientific cooperation.
Distributing resources per field of activity on the one hand, and per country or group of countries on the other, should reflect the European Union's strategic, political, financial and commercial objectives.
Ladies and gentlemen, with respect to the cohesion of European Union's foreign activity I would like to refer to the new trade strategy that the Commissioner on International Trade, announced.
Given that this strategy concerns our next steps with important European Union trade partners, is a compatibility issue regarding the European Union's political priorities being raised?
Does it connect the range of subject matters covered by the proposed financial instrument with European Union's internal political choices?
Moreover, should not it promote even more the European Parliament's active role in the determination of priorities as well as the evaluation of programme effectiveness?
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that we are having this joint debate, since we will end up, in future, with a shared legal basis differentiating between developing countries and richer, industrialised nations, and so it is good that we should be discussing this today.
Mr Martin, the rapporteur, was right to point out that we have to seek after a more logical and systematic approach when it comes to defending the European Union's interests in our cooperative efforts with others, and I am glad that the Commission treated with respect his argument that further differentiation is needed, along with consideration of the countries' specific interests, more evaluation, and an early review.
I would like to add a couple of other points, which Mr Papastamkos has already addressed.
When this review is carried out, this differentiation must be reflected even more logically in our dealings on the foreign policy and trade policy fronts.
What I mean by that is that we currently maintain very intensive relations with certain countries, with free trade agreements and partnership agreements, but the thinking on the basis of which we cooperate using financial instruments is not always in line with our thinking about policy.
It follows that we should strive after greater strategic depth in financial cooperation too, for there is no point in having free trade agreements - with Mexico or Chile, for example - and having more of their kind in mind for the future, while not being logical in our cooperation; it is just as illogical to deny the least developed countries more intensive support than that given to those that are already on their way up and can be described as emerging.

It is in just this way that we need to become more specific in future, and I might add that that also involves Parliament being consulted not only on the financial instruments as part of the codecision procedure, but also as soon as dialogue towards the conclusion of bilateral agreements is embarked on, and that its agreement shall be an indispensable requirement, for this House's involvement will otherwise result only, in the final analysis, in a wedge being driven between the Commission and the Member States, and that will make full and democratic support quite simply impossible.
I would like to ask the Commissioner, as a matter of urgency, to stress, in the debates involving the Commission and the Member States, the necessity of Parliament's approval being given in all areas, so that our system of values - about which we talk unceasingly - may remain intact not only when we talk about other countries, but also when we make policy for ourselves.
(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank Mr Mitchell and the coordinators, and to congratulate them for managing to assert, through shared moral values, the will of a directly elected Parliament, which they have achieved in part thanks to our support.
Development cooperation must lead to development and not to stagnation.
It must lead to the rule of law, to the development of a free economy and, in turn, to pluralism in decision-making and respect for human rights.
As many countries in the world have shown, economic development is not in itself sufficient.
The pursuit of economic openness and rapid economic development is not enough when, in the absence of the rule of law, there is political stagnation, a closed society, corruption and the usurpation of power.
Economic development of this kind leads to serious political failures and security problems, and ends in terrorism.
We in Parliament have at our disposal an instrument whereby we can place conditions on development aid, guiding and earmarking it so that criteria are properly met and genuine development is achieved.
This instrument lays down precise financial conditions and provides for precisely controlled funding for development programmes, including those of non-state beneficiaries and local authorities.
With everyone better off, it will be possible for Parliament to influence the final form of national strategic documents and to assess their implementation.
Speaking as a member of the Executive Committee of the World Movement for Democracy, I welcome the possibility of promoting genuine democracy via our democratically elected Parliament.
I should just like to promise that, in common with the other Members of this House, I shall make every effort to ensure that we work effectively in conjunction with the Commission and the Council to achieve development throughout the world.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Mitchell and Mr Van den Berg on their excellent work on the development cooperation instrument.
I have to say, though, that I strongly oppose the amendments put forward by Mr Mitchell on recital 18, Article 5 and Article 12.
In a few days' time we will not have a separate line for the funding of sexual and reproductive health rights and I think it would be a grave injustice, in particular to the women who are at risk from very serious illnesses in maternity, to remove these references.
We are committed in various agreements already made by the European Parliament with the Commission, with the Council and in international agreements, to precisely the language that is contained already in this DCI, and it strikes me as disingenuous for Mr Mitchell to offer by way of explanation for these amendments the assertion that these matters cannot be dealt with in two lines.
These issues have been debated ad nauseam by this House and by most national parliaments and the outcome is always the same in this Parliament.
This Parliament stands behind the rights of people to choose independently their sexual activity, their sexual proclivities and their right to proper health services and to prevent the appalling death toll of something like 90 000 women who die annually as a result of backstreet abortions.
We need to end that and I believe we should leave the report as it stands.
(LT) Today the congratulations are ringing out particularly loudly for rapporteur Mrs Mitchell, who has achieved a good compromise after two years of negotiations with the Council over a very important matter.
For the first time we have a definition of development policy that allows resources for the support of development cooperation to be directed only to those countries that are most in need of them.
One fifth of the funds will go to the areas of healthcare and education, which is socially equitable support for countries trying to liberate themselves from the stranglehold of poverty, disease and inadequate education.
It is very important that Parliament will be able to exercise ongoing control and to have an effect on the allocation of funds.
The compromise which is being worked out shows that this is essential.
I believe that developing countries will hail this constructive step of the European Parliament and the European Commission, which enables us to hope that the funding of EUR 17 billion will be allocated thoughtfully, with maximum benefit to people facing the greatest adversity.
It is important to spread this news within European Union countries as well, particularly in the new Member States.
Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Mitchell and Mr van den Berg on the success of this report, which focuses on simplifying how EU aid would be spent in developing countries.
I also would like to state that unfortunately I will not be able to support the amendments that Mr Mitchell has tabled, for the same reasons as outlined by Mr De Rossa.
As he said, this is an issue that has been gone over on a number of occasions, both within Parliament and internationally.
I believe that we should stick to the agreements that have been there since Cairo.
'The US fights, the UN feeds and the EU funds'.
Those are the words of a French international affairs student.
However unfair, that paints a picture of the importance of the EU to developing countries.
In recent years, the world has been tragically hit by disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes in Pakistan and the recent flooding in Bangladesh.
The United Nations fund CERF was designed to fund and provide a rapid response to any sudden global emergencies and to provide critical funding which has already been put in place by international donors.
In the first five months of this year, CERF has provided EUR 200 million to more than 320 projects in 26 countries.
However, ECHO has refused to contribute to CERF to date, arguing that it has its own rapid funding mechanism for swift and even-handed funding in emergencies.
I would argue: what is the point in having two funds supposedly achieving the same goals?
Why not have one central fund which deals with these emergencies?
I would urge the EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid, Mr Michel, to open a line of discussions with the United Nations to streamline the global response to international emergencies.
Bureaucracy must not get in the way of saving people's lives, because that is what we are talking about.
Let us not fight over two different funding blocs when the aim is to feed and fund the people who have been hit by disasters as quickly as we possibly can.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, I wish to thank you once again for this closing debate.
We had long negotiations, which at times were not easy, many formal and informal trialogues.
As always, every party has to make its points clear, and sometimes that takes time.
However, the important thing is that we get a good result in the end. I have listened very carefully to all of you and I think we can all live with this result and we can look to the future.
There is now a new set of financial instruments and we want to ensure better external action and better visibility in favour of development, stability and human rights.
Let me now say a few words about some specific items mentioned in the debate.
On the question of sexual and reproductive health and rights, I am aware that the issue is of a very sensitive nature wherever it has come up in all the different fora.
It becomes an even more complex matter in a Union of 25 Member States, all of which have their own different traditions.
For this reason, the respective provisions in the Development Cooperation Instrument represent a finely balanced compromise, which I admit was difficult to achieve and which should not be reopened.
These provisions are largely taken from the old regulation on aid for actions on sexual and reproductive health and rights in developing countries.
Hence, these provisions already reflect a certain consensus as the old regulation was approved by Parliament in codecision.
Transferring the issue from the Development Cooperation Instrument to a separate regulation would not facilitate the problem, but rather protract the discussions on this very sensitive matter.
Such a solution would also go against the aim of simplification, which was the guiding principle for the reform of the external action instruments.
The respective provisions on the Development Cooperation Instrument reflect a balanced compromise, which most likely would not be improved by regulating the issue of sexual and reproductive health in a separate regulation.
I should also like to say a word on the question of the main thrust.
The Commission reaffirms that eradication of poverty and the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals are at the core of the primary objective of its development assistance.
The Commission commits itself to prioritising basic health and education and social cohesion as a whole in its programming and implementing role for country programmes.
Moreover, the Commission will endeavour to ensure that a benchmark of 20% of its allocated assistance under country programmes covered by the DCI will be dedicated by the year of review, 2009, to basic and secondary education and basic health care.
But I also have to say that the DCI also contains a thematic programme on migration and asylum, which is the successor of the old AENEAS programme.
The contents of this thematic programme are the expression again of a finely balanced compromise, in particular with the Member States in the Council.
In the light of the challenges which the European Union is currently facing in the field of migration, the thematic programmes will respond to those needs.
Indeed the root causes of migration will primarily be addressed through our geographic cooperation - I have just spoken about that.
Those who have prospects will not migrate, but there are many others.
It is combating illegal migration on the one hand, and working for legal migration on the other.
We must not close our eyes to the fact that migration, and especially illegal migration, is one of the big challenges of our time that we have to face.
I look forward to putting those instruments to work, together with you.
We have to look to the future.
One of the most challenging questions throughout the negotiations on these new co-decided instruments was the role of Parliament in the strategic planning, as expressed in the strategy papers.
Based on the declarations attached for the interinstitutional agreement on the new financial perspectives, the modalities of a democratic scrutiny dialogue have been fleshed out in an exchange of letters with the committees concerned.
The first pilot country strategy paper will soon arrive in Parliament.
We now look forward to the implementation of that democratic scrutiny dialogue.
Regarding the ICI, I should like to say to Mr Martin and Mrs Mann that, as you know, the legal base is Article 181(a) of the EC Treaty, which foresees the consultation procedure with Parliament in the legislative process.
But of course the Commission is always ready to exchange views with Parliament on aspects of cooperation with industrialised countries too.
We will certainly take the utmost account of any resolution that Parliament might adopt in that respect.
If, in the developing countries, we have not yet always seen the results we wanted to see, that is also because sometimes good governance has not yet been achieved.
That is another very important factor I should like to highlight because we are providing a lot of funding and we try to do our best.
Unfortunately, however, sometimes good governance is not there.
In conclusion, negotiations are always complicated, but what we wanted to have was simplification.
It is so important to simplify in order to achieve visibility and efficiency.
Reducing more than 40 different legislative instruments to seven policy-driven instruments has been difficult but I believe that in the end it has been a rewarding challenge.
Three new instruments are already in force: pre-accession, the neighbourhood policy instrument and the stability instrument.
Four instruments will be adopted shortly: the DCI and the ICI, the nuclear safety and the human rights and democracy instruments.
Everyone who has spoken today of the positive results of our negotiations on the DCI and the ICI has also seen that.
What this whole exercise has shown is that if we, the three institutions - the Commission, the Council and Parliament - work together in a constructive manner, in the end we can produce results of quality.
Again, I look forward to working together with you to secure a really good, efficient and visible implementation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon today.
Protection of groundwater against pollution and deterioration (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs KlaÃ on behalf of the Parliament and Council delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the protection of groundwater against pollution
(PE-CONS 3658/2006 - C6-8209;0382/2006 -.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the environment is a broad field; all human life on our continent is dependent on both air and water, and groundwater is among the most important and most vulnerable resources that we humans possess.
It recovers lost quantity only very slowly, and regains its original state only very slowly after pollution; cleaning polluted groundwater can be done, if at all, only at enormous expense and with recourse to enormous technical resources.
Our experience with air is currently teaching us that all the measures we have taken over the past decade have proved insufficient to prevent climate change and all its deleterious side-effects.
Where air is concerned, we in Europe can accomplish relatively little unless other industrial states around the world lend a hand.
Where groundwater is concerned, here in Europe, we alone have the power to secure this precious good for future generations, and in that the precautions we take and the protection of the groundwater ecosystem are of the utmost importance.
This has been my core concern, the thing for which I, as rapporteur, have fought, and I am grateful to all those who have supported me in this, by which I mean primarily you, the Members of this House, for, without your convincing votes at first and second reading, we would not have been able to achieve the result that we did in the conciliation negotiations with the Council, even though we had the Commission's support.
I would like to thank the Council and the representatives of the Commission for their constructive cooperation and for their support in the quest for compromises.
What, then, have we achieved?
The protection of the groundwater ecosystem and the precautionary approach have been explicitly included, the latter of which meaning, with regard to groundwater, that water that is still clean must be kept in good or very good condition.
It means not leaving action until the conditions defined by the limit and threshold values as 'poor' have already come about.
The reversal of trends and deterioration are regulated in such a way that not only the transition from good to poor conditions, but also ongoing increases in values within a category are considered and have to trigger action.
When laying down the threshold values for the materials described in part B of Annex 2, the Member States shall be required to take account of knowledge concerning toxicity to humans and the environment as well as of hydrological conditions, in other words, of background levels, in order to be able to take better account of the differing conditions from one European region to another.
For the purpose of reviewing the effectiveness of these measures, the introduction of a review clause was especially important.
The observation on the Nitrate Directive in Annex 1 was deleted and the reference to it in Annex 4 has been expanded.
The targets for protection and repair laid down by the Nitrate Directive and the Water Framework Directive in conjunction with this Groundwater Directive, which is derived from them, are comparatively stringent, and the new Article 11, on evaluation, is important in this regard.
The Commission's reports on groundwater must include an assessment of this directive in its relation to other relevant environmental legislation - such as the Nitrate Directive - and of the degree to which it is in harmony with it.
The wording of the directive has now been made clearer and less ambiguous, with concepts such as 'background concentration', 'starting point', or 'significant upward trend' being defined, and requirements that are unclear or open to reinterpretation being deleted.
Where its implementation is concerned, the Member States are allowed more scope for devising their own solutions, with the possibility left open of contractual agreements between, for example, farmers, water treatment companies, and local authorities, and, when the directive is adapted in future, this House will be allowed more scope for its own input, since the new comitology procedure enables it to raise objections when the lists of pollutants, indicators and limit values are altered, and its consent is required before specific substances can be deleted from the list.
The rural development regulation makes it possible for agriculturalists to be compensated for losses of income sustained by them in consequence of constraints imposed on their management of their land in order to protect groundwater.
We sought compromises, and we have managed to find them.
I am firmly convinced that we will be able to sustain and defend all this.
There are some irregularities remaining in the various language versions, and I ask the language service to iron them out.
The new groundwater directive will be an effective aid in protecting our groundwater, and so I ask all of you to vote to accept that which has emerged from the Conciliation Committee.
Member of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, I would like to both congratulate and thank the Parliament delegation that participated in the Conciliation Committee on 17 October.
In particular I would like to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who chaired the Parliament delegation and rapporteur Mrs Klass on their outstanding work and the result they achieved.
The Conciliation Committee's discussions were constructive.
As stated before by Mrs Klass, Parliament achieved positive results on certain important issues, especially on the vital issues of prevention of deterioration of groundwater and establishing quality standards for groundwater.
I am positive that Parliament will endorse the good results achieved by its delegation.
The European Commission supports the document that was adopted by the Conciliation Committee.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) When I entered the European Parliament two and a half years ago, I must admit I was afraid my fellow Members and I would become part of a Babelish confusion, and in fact, we would be able to do very little in terms of making decisions affecting half a billion citizens in Europe.
Well, now I am standing here and I can say that yesterday we helped to deliver the new chemical industry law, and today I may be actively involved in delivering another piece of legislation offering great hope: the law on groundwater protection.
I have spoken a great deal with Mrs KlaÃ, whom I would like to thank at this point for her selfless efforts, about how important and significant this law is.
About how we cannot be allowed to pollute the water we drink, without which life on Earth cannot be sustained.
It is not that anyone would have argued against the principle of it, but when it got down to the nitty-gritty, touching on actual cooperation between Member States, nitrate limit values and protection zones, some countries started giving their own interests priority over the Community's interests.
Finally, however, common sense prevailed and the agreement was adopted.
As a result of the successful 'trialogues', every citizen in Europe, regardless of whether their country shares a groundwater base with another country or not, is now in the same position, and will be able to enjoy a considerably higher level of water quality and safety than before.
It is now up to the Member States as to how they implement this law, how they integrate groundwater protection into their rural development policy and how they encourage agricultural practices to be adapted to this new directive.
Congratulations to Mrs KlaÃ, the Commission and Council on this water protection law which is of great importance to Europe.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to congratulate Mrs KlaÃ and the other Members for their work on the drawing up of this report.
I believe the result to be positive, thanks to the work of this House, which has improved it considerably, to the efforts that the Commission has made in helping us, and also, lastly, to the understanding of the Council in the Conciliation Committee.
Groundwater provides around 65% of all of Europe's drinking water.
The fact that we have obtained a definition of deterioration and that precaution and prevention are now seen as a principle, is really very positive.
In order to protect the environment as a whole and human health in particular, we must prevent and reduce the dangerous concentration of harmful pollutants in groundwater, I believe that this Directive is moving very much in the right direction.
The quality of water and, hence, the health of human beings are threatened by the presence of high concentrations of nitrates, pesticides, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and a long list of pollutants.
I am therefore particularly pleased with the agreement that we have reached with the Council, which will make it possible to implement a whole series of rules for preventing pollution and protecting groundwater.
These rules will oblige the Member States to prevent or restrict the entry of dangerous substances into groundwater, and in this field it is also very important that we take account of the different hydro-geological conditions in the different regions of Europe, because soil that continuously receives water is not the same as dry soil, which faces other kinds of problems.
Furthermore, I would like to stress the possibility for the Member States to establish protection areas of a size that the water authority, or other competent national body, considers necessary in order to protect drinking water supplies.
I believe that this is one of the most important elements to have been introduced.
I would like to end by calling on the Members to vote in favour of this report and I hope that the States will implement these measures as soon as possible, with a view to preserving the environment and protecting human health, thereby moving us in the direction of the sustainable Europe that we all want to see.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, my congratulations to the rapporteur Mrs KlaÃ, the EP delegation chairwoman, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Commissioner Dimas, the Council and all those who have made it possible for this directive to go through conciliation successfully.
Many will say that this directive is long overdue, and they are most probably right.
But, as my English colleagues wisely say, better late than never.
Many will also say that this directive does not go far enough in ensuring the utmost protection of our groundwater and they, too, are probably right; but when the issue at hand is so complicated and when the stakes and stakeholders involved are so numerous and significant, the need for an agreed compromise is paramount and essential.
Indeed, some compromises were made, for example on nitrates and on the revision clause period, but these were part of an overall balanced and fair agreement.
On the other hand, issues like the protection of public health being sufficient justification for laying down more stringent limit values for pollutants such as pesticides were correctly re-emphasised in the directive.
Additionally, and most significantly, reference to the water framework directive was justifiably included in a recital. But, perhaps most significantly, the EP delegation secured a broader role for Parliament in future decision-making and consequently a role in overall surveillance of correct and adequate implementation.
Indeed, implementation is an area where I feel that weaknesses may emerge and it cannot be emphasised too strongly that a watchful eye and strict adherence to the rules and regulations must be achieved if we are to secure high quality of our valuable groundwater reserves for ourselves and for future generations of Europeans.
In conclusion, we have before us a balanced and most satisfactory compromise that deserves our full and undivided support.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs KlaÃ, Commissioner, that the groundwater directive has not been watered down amounts to a tremendous success, and the proposals now made are a real step in the right direction, although we would, of course, have expected even more.
As we know, 80% of all drinking water is derived from groundwater, but 40% of Europe's groundwater is already polluted.
In Germany, the pollution of rivers in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria through fluorinated tensides has made it abundantly clear in just what peril our number one nutrient now is.
That the groundwater directive now contains a legally binding ban on the introduction of pollutants into groundwater must be counted a success, and it is to be hoped that this will bring in strict and efficient measures for sustainable water protection.
It is cause for rejoicing that Parliament has torn up the 'shopping list' of derogations from second reading, and fortunate that the agricultural lobby's feeble excuses for upper limits on nitrate have been thrown out; even farmers have to comply with the 50 microgram/litre tolerance limit, which is not actually that much to expect of them.
Nitrate is associated with cancer, and it has been found in Germany in concentrations of up to seven times those that are permitted, which makes it abundantly clear just how disturbing the situation is.
If this precious resource of ours is to be effectively protected, what we could actually do with is a limit value of less than 25 micrograms per litre.
Nitrates pollution continues to be the biggest and the most expensive problem where the protection of European groundwater is concerned, and so I regard it as seriously negligent of this House, and the Council too, to fail to push the case for protection against nitrates in order to set ambitious targets for it, but the fact that it has been confirmed and laid down that groundwater is, as such, to be protected, constitutes a major triumph.
We still know too little about the characteristics of our ecosystem, for preventive protection of groundwater is ten times as beneficial as measures to clear up the damage after it has been done, which are, in many cases, impossible.
We need to adopt the groundwater directive, and it must be the starting point for further measures to protect the environment.
In the forthcoming process of producing legislation on pesticides, I shall, in my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, be paying very special attention to the maximum quantities of pesticides in groundwater, for it is important that that be dealt with if the groundwater is to be better protected.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Directive on the protection of groundwater from pollution and deterioration is a necessary document.
It will have a positive effect on access to drinking water and water used in farming and industry, of which there is a shortage in many regions within the European Union.
Water is an economic and humanitarian matter in these regions.
Water shortages and the poor quality of the water available mean that it often needs to be delivered to holdings, where people work and live, from places ranging from a few to more than a dozen kilometres away.
The Directive does not restrict the implementation of national policies, which take into account the specific circumstances of individual countries.
It is a document which represents a compromise between our wishes and reality.
In its approved form, it is a document that is worth adopting.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs KlaÎ², for her work.
The UEN Group will support the jointly approved text of the Directive.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs KlaÎ² warmly on the result achieved.
Although the circumstances with regard to groundwater can be very different and the effects do not always extend across the border, it is useful nevertheless to have the prospect of a sound groundwater directive.
We have even managed to bring in the more ambitious requirement that the quality of groundwater should not deteriorate, and so, rather than fighting a running battle, we really are clamping down on pollution.
I am pleased that the directive has taken into consideration the specific protection measures that are already in place in some Member States, and I say that with particular reference to Denmark, which applies strict standards for pesticides on account of the fact that groundwater is used directly as drinking water.
Although the Treaty already provides for this, it is good that this directive explicitly confirms that Member States are allowed to take further action.
Finally, I should like to add that the option of withdrawing the current Nitrate Directive should be given serious consideration.
The objective, a limit value for nitrate, has already been laid down.
An effective regulation for the measuring method is also in place now.
The Nitrate Directive is now only about the means to achieve this end.
As I see it, the means should remain secondary to the end.
The mother can now throw away the bathwater with confidence, because the baby has now been washed, the mother, of course, being the framework directive on water, the bathwater being the Nitrate Directive and the daughter being the Groundwater Directive.
Madam President, the Commission, the Council and Parliament have all talked much of better regulation and removing duplication.
Yet here we have a new groundwater directive not to consolidate or replace, but to supplement, the existing directives: the Water Framework Directive and the Nitrates Directive.
The overregulated farmer, instead of having one clear-cut directive with which to comply, has to contend with aspects of four directives on this subject.
So, far from the promised rationalisation of legislation, we seem to be seeing more proliferation.
As for the assurance that loss of income suffered by farmers as a result of restriction on farming practices can be offset under the Rural Development Regulation, that is of no comfort in a country like the United Kingdom, where a large part of the funding for rural development is coming from the farmers themselves, through top-slicing their single farm payments via the misnamed 'voluntary modulation'.
(DE) Madam President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs KlaÃ for the outstanding work she has done.
When one first comes to the subject, one asks oneself who actually can be opposed to the protection of groundwater; one ought, of course, to immediately answer that question with 'nobody', but, as we see, we have among us a number of Members from the United Kingdom who still take the view that these are rules and regulations of which we have no need.
It must, though, be clear to anyone that our primary source of sustenance, on which we depend for our existence more than on anything else, needs to be protected.
Perhaps the news has reached even the United Kingdom that groundwater does not stop at national borders, and that is why we have the task of enacting regulations applicable to Europe as a whole.
What is being taken here is a first step, and in that respect at any rate, Mrs Breyer has got it right.
We must keep on working on this, but let us just remember that we have laid down standard values for pesticides and for nitrates, and the Member States are mandated to specify, subject to their own national circumstances, limit values for ten other pollutants.
We have managed, through tough negotiations, to bring in a prohibition of deterioration.
All these things are milestones as we journey in the right direction, and it really would be completely wrong to say that Europe is doing nothing in this area.
Perhaps I might also point out that it is now, in fact, possible to use European funds to compensate for the losses in income of which some Members have spoken, and so, in other words, the European Union is helping, by making the necessary funds available, the farmers, some of whom would certainly find implementing this problematic.
It is also for the Member States to put in place comparable rules by way of standardised measurement and testing procedures.
As I see it, we have taken a very good step in the right direction, but it is only a first step, and we have more work to do.
I think it would be fundamentally wrong to demand 'less Europe' in this area.
(DE) Madam President, I too would like to join in the congratulations to our rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ; the adoption of this compromise from the conciliation committee brings us to the end of the process of legislating on this extremely important matter.
Groundwater is the most vulnerable of the European Union's fresh water resources, and is one of the main sources for the public water supply not only in my own country but also in many other European regions.
Uniform standards for the most important pollutants, applicable right across Europe, are essential to the protection of our groundwater, for it is these alone that can prevent distortions of competition and environmental dumping.
This directive lays down limit values for nitrates and pesticides right across Europe, leaving it to the Member States to bring in their own threshold values for other pollutants such as arsenic, mercury, lead and chlorine.
The limit value laid down for nitrate is 50 mg.
It is fortunate that this House's demands, and the pressure it brought to bear, meant that the derogations provided in the Common Position in respect of agricultural activities could be deleted, for it is still the case that agriculture is primarily responsible for the pollution of our groundwater in many European regions, and if it is to be better protected, the practices of those engaged in agriculture and forestry in many parts of Europe will have to change.
The directive on the protection of groundwater obliges the Member States to take all action necessary to prevent hazardous substances finding their way into groundwater.
That they will in future be obliged to actually take these steps and will no longer be allowed merely to aim to do so is another of the significant triumphs of the conciliation process.
Even though the right of the Member States to take more stringent measures is already specified in the treaties, I am delighted that this principle has once again been explicitly entrenched in the groundwater directive.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, water is one of the most abundant resources on the planet: the oceans and seas cover 70% of the Earth's surface and produce three quarters of the oxygen we breathe.
However, we can only actually use 1% of this water, and many human activities are putting a major strain on the resource.
Polluted water, regardless of where the pollution comes from, gets back into nature one way or another, and is therefore liable to harm human health and the environment.
This proposal for a directive is a step forward for the protection of groundwater and in preventing its deterioration, because it provides for compliance with the precautionary principle, specifically in Article 6.
It will now be the responsibility of the Member States to take the necessary measures to prevent and limit the discharge of hazardous substances by defining zones to guarantee the protection of the bodies of water in question.
Farmers will be able to obtain compensation to cover the loss of revenue attributable to the obligations imposed in the protection zones, particularly in drinking water catchment zones.
Parliament will also be more deeply involved in future decisions, because it will be able to oppose amendments to the list of pollutants.
I would therefore like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ, and Mr Florenz and Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the tenacity they demonstrated during the negotiations with the Council and the Commission.
Parliament's delegation succeeded in toughening the obligations imposed on Member States with regard to the protection of groundwater.
Under these circumstances, I recommend that we adopt the joint draft at third reading.
(SV) Madam President, we have reached agreement, and it is now important that these things be properly implemented.
I should, of course, have liked the Member States to have been forced to take measures whenever a tendency to exceed the limit values is noted instead of once we have already damaged the groundwater irreparably.
In spite of everything, however, this compromise has its advantages.
I am particularly pleased about the opportunity it gives countries to ban dangerous chemicals throughout their territories in order to protect their drinking water.
I think that this is a good addition.
We must remember that, in the future, it is climate change that may be still more of a factor in destroying the groundwater.
It is important for us to take measures to combat climate change, as a further problem will arise if there are floods that sweep through, for example, poison stores in factories, causing the poison to end up in our watercourses and then to sink down into the groundwater.
Firstly, then, we need the Groundwater Directive, but we must solve the climate problems if we are to have a chance of protecting the groundwater in the future.
Madam President, I also wish to thank Mrs KlaÃ and the parliamentary team.
At this stage in the process so much has been said that I shall use this minute to recall some basics on groundwater.
It is important to remember that groundwater is very different to surface water, which moves in a continuously renewing cycle of flow, evaporation, precipitation and flow.
Only some groundwater is renewable and it can take water a very long time to percolate through the layers of the Earth's crust to renew the underground source which we can so quickly deplete.
Some sources of groundwater are not renewable.
We sink wells which, once exploited, go dry.
Lastly, pollution works in two ways.
Groundwater may be safe to use or it may not.
During the UN International Water Decade in the 1980s, deep bore wells were drilled in parts of water-starved India.
By the end of the decade people were beginning to show symptoms of skeletal sclerosis.
Now six million people suffer from severe skeletal sclerosis and 66 million to a lesser degree from naturally contaminated water.
As we search for more sources of water, it is important that groundwater be protected from pollution, but it is also important to remember that protection from pollution works two ways.
Madam President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs KlaÃ, and the Chair of the Conciliation Committee, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for this very good report and for the agreement that was achieved with the Council.
Clean water is, clearly, vital to life, and we are fortunate in Europe to have, at least relatively speaking, an abundant supply.
We must maintain, and indeed improve, the quality of that supply, reversing the damage already done.
I believe that in Ireland, in particular, considerable damage has been done by illegal landfill sites and the abundant spreading of pig slurry by farmers on land.
Despite the concessions made to the Council, I still believe we have a strong defence of the environment and water supply here.
The key points are the 'protection against deterioration' requirement on Member States, the requirement that nitrate quality standards be consistent with the Water Framework Directive and the requirement for a revision to be carried out every six years.
Finally, I want to refer to the enhanced role of Parliament under the new comitology procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon today.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.00 p.m. and resumed at 11.30 p.m.)
Welcome
I would like to welcome to the official gallery a delegation from the Afghan Parliament led by the President of the National Assembly of Afghanistan, Mr Mohammad Yonus Qanoni.
(Loud applause)
Mr Mohammad Yonus Qanoni is accompanied by four other Members of the Afghan Parliament.
Tomorrow I will have the pleasure of meeting this delegation personally. It has already held an exchange of views with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development.
We welcome you most warmly and we would invite you to remain in the gallery for the award of the Sakharov Prize to Mr Milinkievitch and, later on, the important debate on the European Union's annual report on human rights.
1.
Nomination of the Bulgarian Commissioner (vote)
The next item is the vote.
(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
We shall begin with the proposals for decisions on the appointments of the new Commissioners nominated by Bulgaria and Romania, respectively.
The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, will speak on its behalf.
President of the Commission. Mr President, today you are asked to give your opinion on the appointment of the two Commissioners that have been nominated by Bulgaria and Romania, Mrs Meglena Kuneva and Mr Leonard Orban.
It is the first time that an accession treaty explicitly makes provision for consultation of the European Parliament on the appointment of Commissioners from new Member States.
I very much welcome this important role given to your institution as it increases both the democratic rights of Parliament and the Commission's accountability.
I stand here before you today to ask for your approval of our two new colleagues.
I do this because I sincerely believe that they both fulfil the highest standards.
The approval by the European Parliament of the appointment of the two Commissioners-designate will allow the Council to formally appoint them.
Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban will thus become full Members of the Commission as of 1 January 2007.
As Commission President I am particularly happy and proud that Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban - two remarkable personalities - will join my team.
Both have worked incredibly hard to help their countries to successfully complete their final preparations for accession.
With their experience and their European conviction, both will bring a valuable contribution to the collegial work of the Commission on moving Europe forward, including the institutional settlement necessary to ensure a more democratic, transparent and efficient Europe.
In the course of the last weeks many of you had the opportunity to get to know the two Commissioners-designate, be it in a bilateral context or through the hearings.
Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban have successfully passed in the relevant parliamentary committees.
It is my firm belief that both candidates in the course of the hearings proved their personal integrity and independence, their general competence and professional experience, as well as their deep and genuine European commitment.
The promotion of linguistic and cultural diversity in the European Union touches the very substance of our European values and identity and is the prerequisite for communicating Europe and multicultural dialogue.
I am sure that Mr Orban is the right person to do this job.
The protection of consumer rights is central to the interests of each and every one of our citizens.
I am sure that Mrs Kuneva is the best person to do this.
1 January 2007 will be a truly historic moment.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will complete the fifth enlargement of the European Union.
Enlargement has not only contributed to peace, prosperity and stability throughout Europe but has also made all of us richer socially, economically, and culturally.
With Bulgaria and Romania becoming members of the European Union, we will see the fulfilment of the ambitions and hopes of so many people who have fought for freedom in Europe for so long.
The new Member States will now be firmly anchored in the community of European values which inform and permeate the public purpose of the European Union.
Their rightful place at the heart of this community will give them new confidence and new dynamism which I am sure will generate benefits for the whole of our Union.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am, quite honestly, surprised at being called on to speak right now, but life is always full of surprises.
I was very glad to hear what the President of the Commission had to say: the hearings have been held, and the result is that both Mrs Kunewa and Mr Orban have met with the approval of the relevant committees.
It is for me an honour and a joy to be able to affirm these two Commissioners; we, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will endeavour to work very well with both of them.
We have the goodwill to do so, and we say 'yes' to the appointment of both of them.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hearing of members of the Commission is an important prerogative of this House; it is one that we take seriously, and it appears to us that the Commission does so too.
It is for that reason that Mr Vosgenian, the first Romanian candidate, did not even get as far as a hearing that he would not have got through, and you, Mr President of the Commission, did the right thing in learning from that and taking action to get another candidate; that shows that Europe's democratic structures work when the institutions take their roles seriously.
Far from being a formality, these hearings are a real testing process, and the Socialist Group in this House believes that both candidates, Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban, have come through it well, and that they are equal to the task allotted to them, and so we will be voting in favour of both of them being appointed.
Even so, it still has to be said that the letter you, Mr Barroso, wrote in response to our questions, does nothing to make it any the clearer precisely what portfolio has been allocated to Mr Orban, and that shows that the search for a portfolio in a Commission consisting of 27 members can be interpreted to mean only that this Commission is being formed on the basis of the Treaty of Nice, a treaty that was, in the opinion of those who drafted it, not even suitable for 15 states, and it certainly does not work for 27 of them.
(Applause)
Institutionally speaking, then, we have reached our limit.
This criticism must neither be held back nor taken to be directed at Mrs Kuneva or Mr Orban, for it is to the discredit of neither of them.
Now, Mr Orban, Mrs Kuneva, we knew even before the hearings that neither of you are enthusiastic supporters of the social democratic movement, but we will not hold that against you, for everyone has the right to be wrong; even so, though, we appeal to you to take care, when you become members of the college, that that college does not lose sight of the need for a political balance, in Europe, between economic and social responsibility.
By voting for you, we are expressing our confidence that you will come to see that.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the imminence of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is underlined by today's vote on the nominees for the posts of two Commissioners and two Members of the Court of Auditors.
Both Meglena Kuneva and Leonard Orban were deeply involved in the negotiations for their respective countries' membership.
Each was dealt a tough hand of cards, especially if you think of the distance that each country has travelled on its road to membership.
It proved tougher than expected and needed two years more than other countries emerging from the former Europe.
We must learn now to adapt our Union to a wider membership - a fuller house - with inevitable family disputes.
All must learn to give a bit if they are to take.
Whether we yet have a full house, of course, is still a matter for debate and maybe Mr Brok would enlighten us towards the end of this week?
It is fitting that those who bore the burden of accession negotiations bear some of the fruit of their labours.
Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban have a great deal to contribute to Europe.
The depth of knowledge they have gleaned from the talks will stand them in good stead for their collegial decision-making on the upper floors of the Berlaymont.
Whether they choose to play the Queen of Hearts or the Ace of Spades in President Barroso's House of Cards is up to them, but I remain convinced that Romania and Bulgaria will be an asset to the Union, and not a burden as some would have us believe.
I know that some in this House are thinking of voting against one of the nominees for the Court of Auditors.
If we are serious about bringing two countries into the Union, let us be serious about bringing them in properly and not play games with the nominees.
Let me offer a word of advice to President Barroso as he chews on how to use the talents of his two latest recruits: there are not enough jobs for 27 Commissioners.
That is why we supported the Constitution's provisions to slim the College down.
Please ensure that Members of the Commission act in the Community interest and not as representatives of their home states; define their jobs clearly, more clearly than you have done in your letter to President Borrell, allegedly 'clarifying' the role of intercultural dialogue.
It has left many of us with more questions than answers.
However, we wish you success. We wish the two new Commissioners success and we expect that you will do the job we need to advance the cause of Europe.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will vote in favour of the integration of Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban into the Commission.
We would like to congratulate them on their nomination and we hope that they will be able to work in a team whose internal cohesion, motivation and European vision is not, unfortunately, that which we hope for and which the European Union needs.
In this respect, our vote of approval today is more a sign of welcome to the two new Member States, represented here by the two new Commissioners, than support for the current Commission and its policy.
Mrs Kuneva, you will very quickly become aware that, in the Commission that you are entering today, the industrial lobbies have much easier access and much easier lives than the consumer movements.
I hope that you will be able to introduce change and stand up to this in some way.
Mr Orban, you will quickly become aware that protecting the cultural dimension of the European Union is a very difficult task, in a Commission which is perhaps too open to one part of our world rather than to others.
Mr President, casting our vote of approval in this matter for us also means setting a precedent in some way, by voting on individual Commissioners; this is something that we have often called for and that we hope to be able to do in the future.
(Applause)
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I would like, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, to welcome our two new Commissioners, Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban.
My group will approve these two nominations.
I myself would have preferred it if the President of the Commission had made the most of the conclusion of this stage of enlargement to engage in a fundamental debate on an interim assessment of his Commission, to reshuffle the cards within the enlarged Commission, if appropriate, and, finally, to submit the whole of his team to Parliament's vote.
At a time when so many questions are being asked about the operation, the direction and the future of the EU, this would have done the Commission's authority and parliamentary democracy no harm at all.
As we can see, this was not what was decided.
Even so, all the best to Mrs Kuneva and Mr Orban.
(Applause)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, today we mark another step in the progress of Romania and Bulgaria towards welcoming them back into the family of democratic nations within the European Union.
I welcome the appointment of Commissioner-designate Kuneva and Commissioner-designate Orban, and I hope that all colleagues within this Chamber will not use political points to try and attack them in the important role that they will undertake in the future.
In particular, the respect for diversity that will be required in the European Union of the 21st century is encompassed by the portfolio that Commissioner Orban will have, and I call on all colleagues to be as generous as possible towards him, and to all the Commissioners, but in particular to be helpful towards him in suggesting new ways in which that diversity can be protected within the European Union.
Finally, at this important juncture, it is vital that all peoples across Europe come together and unite, and understand that, no matter what may divide us in our different ideologies, or in our different political opinions, or, indeed, in our different religions, the things that bring us together, the things that we share, are far more powerful and far greater, in order to effect change for the good, not only in Europe but on the world stage.
Rather than being bogged down in mere politics, let us look to the bigger picture.
Let us grasp the opportunities that have been given to Romania and Bulgaria today, but, most importantly of all, let us grasp the opportunities which have been given to the European Union to act as a beacon of hope, of democracy, of freedom, of respect for human rights, across the world.
In particular, let us ensure that we can do this collectively for the betterment of all mankind.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, today we are being asked to approve the nomination of European Commissioners from Bulgaria and Romania.
Well, I do not approve.
I voted against the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, as did many of my colleagues from the IND/DEM Group.
My colleagues and I from the UK Independence Party were vilified in 2004 because we opposed the accession, but we did so for several reasons, not least that we are totally opposed to the European Union's empire-building because it is a thoroughly undemocratic organisation that undermines self-government.
We also voted against it because we knew that there would be mass migration from some of the new Member States to Britain - a mass migration with which my country's infrastructure cannot cope.
Two years later we have been shown to be right: an estimated 650 000 people came to Britain from the accession countries during the first year of membership. Furthermore, such has been the drain of skilled workers, that we now have the ridiculous situation in which the President of Poland is putting out statements calling for his fellow countrymen to return to their homeland.
Will the EU empire-builders ever consider the immense social cost of their actions?
We now stand at the cusp of a tragedy: two further countries, which have recently thrown off the yoke of communism and grasped their freedom, are about to throw it away by taking on the yoke of Brussels, with all its suffocating bureaucracy and its relentless pursuit of power.
It will not be many years before Bulgaria and Romania discover what a mistake they have made in subjecting themselves to the will of an intolerant European Commission.
It will be like exchanging an iron curtain for a vast curtain of paper, which could end up being almost as big a threat to civil liberties and prosperity as was its predecessor.
Freedom is indivisible.
It should never be given up in the pursuit of economic gain, particularly when it has been won at such a high price.
(Applause)
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add two quick comments to what Mr Titford has just said with regard to these Commissioners from two friendly nations - one Slavic and the other Latin - which have recently been freed, it is true, from the yoke of communism, and who we hope will not find themselves under another yoke.
My first comment is that Mr Orban's portfolio, multilingualism, must treat the learning and use of the national languages of the Member States as a priority, including within the European institutions.
In a little while, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give our opinion on the appointment of two members of the Court of Auditors.
I have in front of me the French versions of those reports: one of them has been drawn up by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz, a Spanish rapporteur, on the Bulgarian candidate; the other, by a Hungarian rapporteur, on a Romanian candidate!
In these French versions, the biographies of the members of the Court of Auditors and the questionnaires are in English. So there we have an important area for Mr Orban to work on: ensuring that linguistic diversity is respected in our institutions!
I would also like to wish Mrs Kuneva good luck.
She has had a very difficult job defending the interests of her fellow Bulgarians during the negotiations: I hope that she will find it easier to defend the interests of European consumers.
I would finally like to say that we are opposed to the application of the protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice that states that, from the point when the European Union has 27 Members, the number of Commissioners will be less than the number of Member States, which would deny some of them any representation within that institution.
We have two and a half more years to show that that measure is entirely useless and contrary to the equality amongst nations that should govern the future of our international organisation.
We shall now proceed to the vote on the proposal for a decision on the appointment of the new Commissioner proposed by the Republic of Bulgaria, Mrs Meglena Kuneva.
The vote will be by roll call in accordance with Rule 99(4) of the Rules of Procedure.
(Parliament approved the decision)
(Loud applause)
Thank you very much.
Congratulations, Mrs Kuneva.
Few Commissioners have received such long and loud applause as you.
2.
Nomination of the Romanian Commissioner (vote)
We shall continue with the vote and vote on the proposal for a decision on the appointment of the new Commissioner proposed by Romania, Mr Leonard Orban.
(Parliament approved the decision)
(Loud applause)
Thank you and congratulations to you too, Mr Orban.
(The sitting was suspended for a few moments while awaiting the award ceremony for the Sakharov Prize and resumed at 12 noon)

Formal sitting - Award of the 2006 Sakharov Prize
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, it is a great pleasure for the European Parliament to receive the winner of the 2006 Sakharov Prize, Mr Milinkievitch, leader of the opposition United Democratic Forces in Belarus.
Please believe me, Mr Milinkievitch, when I say that we are particularly happy to have you here with us today.
(Applause)
There have been times when we thought that you would not be able to come.
Our Sakharov Prize winners have often been unable to come here to receive the prize.
Aung San Suu Kyi, Wei Jingsheng and the Women in White have regrettably been unable to attend this ceremony.
We should remember that we Europeans, at home in our consolidated democracies, often take human rights for granted, seeing them as something natural and indisputable, like the air we breathe.
We enjoy our political and civil freedoms, sometimes forgetting what it costs to obtain them and accustomed to exercising them.
We become accustomed to good things very quickly, and even countries that have obtained freedom later enjoy it as if they have always had it and as if everybody had it.
We must remember, however, that billions of people on our planet lack the freedom that we enjoy.
Our Union is based on respect for human rights, and defending them and promoting them around the world is part of our raison d'Ãªtre. Not just for moral reasons, but also in our own interest.
In terms of Europe's interests, it is a priority that our freedom should be exercised by the whole of humanity.
The Sakharov Prize is therefore an expression of the European Union's defence of and commitment to human rights, and this year it is being awarded to a person who is dedicating his life to the fight for freedom in his country.
Everybody knows that the presidential elections in Belarus in March were neither free nor fair and that the European Union was not able to send its observers, their access to the country being denied.
Mr Milinkievitch has had the courage to challenge the last dictatorship in Europe; he has managed to unite the democratic opposition forces in order to restore political rights and freedoms in his country.
He has headed mass demonstrations and has been arrested for urging his fellow countrymen to defend their fundamental rights.
Mr Milinkievitch, you have become a symbol of resistance to oppression and of hope for a democratic future.
We share your ambition that Belarusian society should obtain the right to elect its leaders democratically, the right to independent information, the right to create non-governmental organisations and the right to an independent and impartial judiciary.
That is something that the European Parliament has always defended.
We have protested against the violence, the arbitrary arrests and the politically-motivated sentences by the Belarusian regime against people fighting for fundamental rights in that country.
The Prize that you are receiving today is a demonstration of our support for all of the people fighting alongside you.
This is not the first time that we have awarded this prize to people from Belarus.
In 2004, this Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to the Belarus Association of Journalists, to professionals who were risking their lives in order to discover the truth and to make it known.
Today, two years later, we are once again showing our full support for the fight for democracy in Belarus, because things have not improved since then.
The death penalty is still carried out regularly in that country.
I wish to condemn the arrest and sentencing of Aleksander Kazulin, who is currently on hunger strike in prison, and I wish to tell you that we are convinced that Belarus's future lies in sharing in the freedom and prosperity of democratic Europe.
You are a scientist, Mr Milinkievitch, as was Andrei Sakharov himself.
Both of you have shared the same opinions, the same values and the same education and you have experienced the same tragic consequences of confronting a totalitarian regime.
Today, the prize bearing the name of the scientist Sakharov is being awarded to another scientist, but above all it is being awarded to the hope of a democratic Belarus and to all the people fighting alongside you to make it a reality.
You have the floor, Mr Milinkievitch.
(Sustained applause)
(The President awarded the Sakharov Prize)
leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall speak in my mother tongue because I would like to say what I think, and I always think in Belarusian.
I am therefore going to speak in the language that best allows me to express my feelings.
(Parliament stood and applauded Mr Milinkievitch.)
(The speaker spoke in his mother tongue, the text below being a translation)
I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament most warmly for awarding me this high honour, the Andrei Sakharov Prize, named after the brilliant physicist and ardent defender of human rights.
I would also like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you.
This prize is not for me alone!
It is for all the Belarusians, for all of those who were in the square in Minsk last March, who have been thrown into prison and expelled from universities and workplaces.
This prize is for all of those who are carrying on with the fight.
There are many of us!
We are the ones who want Belarus to return to the family of European democracies and who are ready to sacrifice our personal well-being, our freedom and even our lives to get there.
Belarus has always been a European country.
It has given a lot to Europe, making many sacrifices.
In the 19th century, it gave Europe a prototype for a first democratic constitution, the statute of the Grand-Duchy of Lithuania.
It gave the world several eminent personalities, such as Guillaume Apollinaire, Marc Chagall, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Dimitri Shostakovich and Tadeusz KoÅciuszko.
The Belarusians were the second in Europe to translate the Bible into their mother tongue.
During the Second World War, it was in Belarus that the most powerful resistance movement in Europe emerged, costing the lives of one out of every three inhabitants.
Of the six million Jews exterminated in the Holocaust, one million came from Belarus.
If anyone deserves freedom, it is us!
We have earned it through the whole of our history and the sacrifices we have made on its behalf.
Every century, as a result of endless wars, Belarus lost from a quarter to a third of its sons and daughters. It lost its elite.
Our people have suffered the forced uprooting of their national identity and the eradication of their historical memory.
In 1991, we were delighted to finally achieve our independence, but at the time we did not realise that freedom and independence are not the same thing.
Today, we are once again fighting for freedom and defending our independence.
We are doing so not just for ourselves, but also for our children, who, like French, Lithuanian, Polish and British children, have the right to live in a free country.
It was our children who spent long nights standing on the square in Minsk after the elections on 19 March, when the adults could not stand the cold and returned to their homes.
It was our children who were thrown into closed lorries, suffocating, and imprisoned, while their parents spent days looking for them.
It was our children who, having been released from prison, were expelled from universities for their choice of conscience.
But not for one moment did they doubt the justice of our common choice.
I am proud of them.
Throughout the week following the elections, when we were remaining on the square and protesting against the outrageous falsification of the results of those elections, the authorities arrested more than a thousand people.
Minsk's prisons had never been full to bursting: that was exactly what happened during that week.
The regime realised that that protest movement could only be ended by military force.
That is why, during those few days, the authorities arrested everybody who came to the square, even those who were simply bringing food, water and warm clothing to the people living in the 'tent city'.
On 19 March, the authorities did not expect to see tens of thousands of people coming out, despite the threat of reprisals.
That was our first victory.
I am very well aware that we will need many more similar victories before we can put an end to that illegal regime.
The former presidential candidate, Mr Aliaksandr Kazulin, is now in prison, sentenced to five and a half years.
He has now been on hunger strike for more than 50 days.
His state of health is extremely serious: he has lost 40 kilos, and his life is in danger.
This prize is also for him, and for Zmitser Dachkevitch, Pavel Seviarynets, Mikola Statkevitch and AndreÃ¯ KlimaÇ and all of the other political prisoners in my country.
This prize is a sign of Europe's awareness of the situation in Belarus.
This prize is a wonderful example of moral politics.
This prize is a recognition of Belarus's European future.
This high distinction today could have been received by the person who was the leader of the Belarusian democratic movement for several years, Professor HienadÅº Karpienka.
Or by the former Internal Affairs Minister, Yury Zakharanka.
Or by Viktar Hantchar, the vice-president of the last legitimate parliament in Belarus.
These people are heroes, fighters for the freedom of Belarus, but they have disappeared without trace or have been murdered.
These are the methods, as old as human hate and as horrifically outmoded as the inquisition, that the Belarusian authorities currently use against their opponents.
In his speech on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, Andrei Sakharov said: 'I am convinced that international trust, mutual understanding, disarmament and international security are not possible without an open society with freedom of information, freedom of conscience, glasnost, the right to travel and the right to choose one's country of residence'.
I share that view.
The academic Sakharov always preached non-violent resistance.
I agree with him in that regard too.
We have everything we need to win: faith in Belarus's European future, solidarity, courage and experience.
For many young people, blue - the colour of the European flag - has become a symbol.
In March, that flag was raised alongside our white, red and white national flag.
As a sign of those countries' solidarity with us, the flags of Lithuania, of Ukraine, of Poland, of Russia, of Estonia, of Azerbaijan and of Georgia were also flown.
We must conquer the fear that has impregnated people's consciences over the last ten years as a result of constant propaganda.
Andrei Sakharov issued a warning: 'Freedom of thought is the only safeguard against the contamination of people by collective myths, which, in the hands of perfidious hypocrites and demagogues, can turn into a bloody dictatorship'.
That is what is happening today in Belarus.
Monuments to the glory of Stalin are reappearing.
Resurrecting the 'best' traditions of the Soviet system, the official media endlessly pours out torrents of lies and slander, as in Sakharov's era.
The main enemy is the West and local democrats are depicted as its agents.
The regime is in a difficult situation today. Its planned economy is not efficient, and Russia is threatening to put an end to economic preferences.
For that reason, the government is getting nervous and is trying to blame its political opponents.
At the end of November, at his meeting with Ukrainian journalists, Mr Lukachenka stated that, 'this opposition sneaks abroad to call for the application of economic sanctions against the country and is then happy that gas prices are going to rise tomorrow'.
I would like to take this opportunity to state from this European platform, taking full responsibility and to everybody, particularly the Belarusian people, that these are lies!
We have never called for economic sanctions against our country and we are perfectly aware that such sanctions primarily hit the ordinary citizens of Belarus.
The regime in power will always find ways to sustain its officials.
We have always stated that Russian gas would no longer be cheap for Belarus, that it was going to become expensive in Russia itself.
It is a shame that the Belarusian leaders have not taken the opportunity that had presented itself and that they have not taken advantage of the possibilities they have had for a long time to carry out real economic reforms.
Now the Belarusian people are going to suffer the consequences.
The main conditions that Moscow currently imposes on Mr Lukachenko in return for their long-standing economic and political support include joining the monetary union, effectively the Russian rouble, and the adoption of the constitutional act of what the Russians call the 'Union State'.
Accepting these conditions would inevitably mean a loss of sovereignty for Belarus.
The Belarusian political leaders are currently still resisting a move in that direction.
Mr Lukachenka has recently openly expressed his concern about the country's independence.
He talks about the link, which Belarusian democratic forces have been talking about for a long time, between independence and well-being.
But in his case, defending independence must not be confused with defending his personal interests and his desire to hold on to power at all costs.
He and his entourage are perfectly aware that, with the loss of independence and the arrival of Russian capital in the country, very few of them would keep their positions or their wealth.
We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that, led by an instinct for self-preservation, the Belarusian regime will accept Moscow's conditions and call a referendum to approve them.
There can be no doubt that only democracy, rather than dictatorship, can guarantee Belarus's independence.
The fact that we have not so far found a common language with Moscow does not mean that the Belarusian democratic forces are against Russia.
We want to live in a sovereign State and build the best possible relations with Russia.
We are prepared to take account of its interests, provided that they do not run counter to our own interests.
Russia is a strategic partner for us, as it is for the EU.
A democratic Belarus will be a credible and reliable friend to Russia.
We believe that banning entry to the countries of the European Union for people violating the Constitution and participating in repression is a very effective measure.
This list of enemies of democracy should be extended.
At the same time, I would appeal to you not to increase the cost of Schengen visas for Belarusian citizens.
From 1 January 2007, the cost of a Schengen visa is expected to be EUR 60.
For the overwhelming majority of Belarusians who desperately need free contacts with the West, that cost would be prohibitive.
That decision is in danger of creating a new 'iron curtain'.
These measures will benefit Mr Lukachenka, who is always telling the Belarusian people that 'nobody wants us in the West'.
We were very pleased with the European Commission's proposals last month.
They offer Mr Lukachenka's government a good opportunity to leave behind the international self-isolation and the poor economic situation that it is stuck in.
Aliaksandr Lukachenka himself was obliged to acknowledge, at the meeting of the government, that next year will be 'catastrophically tough'.
If the regime accepts these proposals, Belarus will be able to receive considerable support for the launching of the political and socio-economic reforms that have been so necessary for so long, and to begin a genuine rapprochement with Europe, including by means of gradual economic integration.
However, there is practically no hope that the Belarusian Government will accept the course of rapprochement with the European Union.
There have already been plenty of similar proposals, but the regime has never responded in a positive concrete fashion.
Its faithful are perfectly aware that, once it is launched, democratisation will inevitably and very quickly put an end to their stranglehold.
The current leader of Belarus would never win genuine free elections.
At the same time, this European Union proposal offers us the opportunity to make the citizens of our country understand that, despite what the State propaganda says, Europe is leaving the door open to Belarus, but to a free and democratic Belarus.
These proposals have appeared at a very appropriate time, during the local election campaign.
There will be no genuine elections, just as there is no genuine local government in Belarus.
Within the context of that campaign, we are distributing information on the European Union's proposals.
We appreciate your assistance very much and we thank you most warmly for it.
I would, however, ask you to extend it and make it more flexible.
We are talking about things that are already well-known: assistance for free media, support for civil society and for repressed people.
The European Union's current programmes are drawn up for countries that are already moving towards democracy and carrying out reforms, but they cannot work in the case of Belarus.
In order to promote democracy in countries such as mine, it is high time that a European Fund for democracy were created with real resources geared towards countries with dictatorial regimes.
Europe must not shrug its shoulders and say 'what can we do about it?'.
There is a lot you can do!
You can help us to break down the barriers to information and the restricted view of the world imposed upon my fellow countrymen by government propaganda, to create a public space conducive to open debate amongst the citizens, bringing together independent authors, intellectuals and moral authorities.
This will undoubtedly help civil society in Belarus to develop more quickly.
Europe's recent message to the Belarusian people was both a demonstration of your solidarity and a reminder to the current regime of its responsibility for its crimes.
The most important thing, however, is that that message should make clear that our country belongs in Europe.
It is my profound conviction that Europe will never be complete without Belarus.
That is why we repeat the same slogans as my ancestors who rose up against tyranny for the sake of freedom: 'For your freedom and for ours.'
As a Belarusian and a citizen of a European country, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart and I also thank you on behalf of all of those people who were on the square in March and those who have been, or still are, in prison for defending their fundamental right to live in a free country.
I thank you for having faith in our victory.
I promise you that our victory will not be long in coming.
My country has changed. It is less afraid and it believes in change.
Belarus will soon return to the European family and will once again be a free and democratic State.
Historically, dictatorships have no future and, as history shows, they end badly for the tyrants.
Under a dictatorship, the only real option is to fight, simply because we have no other choice.
Thank you for your support and long live Belarus!
(Parliament stood and applauded the speaker)
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr Milinkievitch.
The European Parliament is proud to have awarded you this Prize and is sure that the words you have spoken today will go down in history.
(Applause)
(The sitting was suspended for a few moments while awaiting the continuation of the vote)
Agenda: see Minutes
(DE) Mr President, this morning's sitting was yet another that ended half an hour early, and Mrs Kaufmann, who was in the chair, deserves thanks for having apologised for this to the visitors who were pouring in at the time.
I would ask that the person in the chair at any given time be given a bit more speaking time if it is in any case clear that the sitting is going to end earlier.
It is not good for visitors to come into the Chamber in the expectation of hearing a reasonably interesting debate, and then to find the place empty.
It would be possible to be a bit more flexible in this respect, and it would keep the Members happy too.
(Applause)
I share your desire for flexibility, Mr Swoboda.
I am very firm when time is limited.
When possible, I would like to increase the maximum speaking time.
Having said that, when the agenda's time, and the Members' time, has run out, what can we do?
Mr President, may I just say in that regard that you do not only have the option of letting speakers speak for longer, you also have the option of taking additional speakers under the 'catch the eye' procedure, which is perfectly within the Rules of Procedure.
Of course, Mr Corbett, provided that the speakers in question are here, because a President cannot give the floor to absent Members!
1.
Nomination of the Bulgarian Member of the Court of Auditors (vote)
(FR) Mr President, I should like to invoke the Rules of Procedure.
I feel obliged to point out - as I said a moment ago - that the report by Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz is not available in French, or, to be more precise, the version of this report presented as the French version contains the biography of the candidate as well as a reply to questions exclusively in English, which seems to me to violate our Rules of Procedure.
Mr Gollnisch, since you are a stickler for the rules, I am going to do you the favour of giving you the only reliable information: you are absolutely right, we should have full translations of all texts put to the vote.
And that is actually the case. All of the texts put to the vote are available in all languages.
Annexed documents themselves are not in any way put to the vote, according to our Rules of Procedure, and are not therefore subject to translation in their entirety.
Now you are fully informed!
2.
Nomination of the Romanian Member of the Court of Auditors (vote)
3.
Modalities of Iceland and Norway's participation in the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (vote)
4.
Community action programme in the field of consumer policy (2007 - 2013) (vote)
- Before the vote
rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply want to note that we, since we have reached an agreement with the Council and Commission ahead of time, can finalise this report at second reading, which will make it possible for the action programme in question to enter into effect on time, that is to say on 1 January of next year.
Secondly, I should like to point out that we have managed to secure a separate consumer programme after all, one with its own budget and that can develop its own momentum, and I think this is something the consumers will appreciate.
Finally, we have pinpointed three important new areas for consideration:
First of all, we have asked for more attention for new Member States that do not have as long a tradition in the area of consumer protection.
Secondly, we have managed to turn the spotlight to the older consumer, for, after all, consumer law should give due consideration to demographic developments.
Thirdly, in this action programme, we have managed - and this I consider to be of particular importance - to draw particular attention to the vulnerable consumer who in consumer law, where we need to work with the concept of the average consumer, cannot really be given a voice.
I do think this is important.
We may not have had a debate, but I thought it would be useful anyway to share this information and drive these important points home to you.
I can only emphatically appeal to you to vote in favour of the common position, for it reproduces exactly our agreement in this House and among the institutions.
