I should just like to highlight Chechnya, Zimbabwe and Colombia on behalf of the ALDE Group.
It is also very important that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, her staff and various bodies be given sufficient resources to enable them to work on the issue.
The three subjects that the EU is to pursue are very good, and have our support.
We should also have liked to see one on freedom of speech in relation to journalists.
Last year, more journalists than ever were killed on the job, and large numbers of them are in prison around the world.
The courage of these people is essential to our learning of human rights abuses, and it is thus a prerequisite for the session in Geneva.
For that reason, it is our duty not to forget the work they do.
Â Â  . â Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, you rightly referred to the many initiatives taken by the European Union at the sixtieth session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
I agree, but I also remember what Shirin Ebadi said following that sixtieth session.
Speaking of the silence on Iran and on the human rights situation in Iran, she said: âsilence is an insult to the victimsâ.
Those words have stayed with me and I believe we must also remember that at that sixtieth session a number of countries, among them China, Zimbabwe and Cuba, took extremely strong initiatives with a view to stripping the Commission on Human Rights of its substance.
The European Union must be particularly vigilant in the face of such extremely damaging strategies on the part of some countries.
I hear what you say, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, about us having several instruments available âÂ I am thinking of China.
But why should they be mutually exclusive?
For countries such as these, the European Unionâs credibility, its effectiveness, lies in showing that it does not have double standards: yes, it has several instruments, but they are not mutually exclusive.
I believe Parliamentâs resolution will help to make the European Unionâs activity more cohesive and coherent; at any rate, that is what everyone who has spoken in this House wants.
We have emphasised a number of rights that are considered new rights, third generation rights.
It would be much to the European Unionâs credit and advantage to emphasise those rights, which are connected with globalisation.
I am thinking of human rights, the rights of man and the responsibility of transnational corporations.
The UN is working on these questions; the European Union could encourage and support it.
We have also spent a long time debating the right words for the fight against terrorism, which remains a cause for anxiety in many respects, as Mr Ribeiro pointed out.
We would like the States to be given recommendations by the UN on counter-terrorism, because we find there are serious failings in this area.
I will end very quickly on the question of journalists in war zones.
We are talking about a dramatic situation that everyone finds moving.
I do not believe the international machinery for protecting such journalists is coherent and effective enough and we ought to give this question some thought, too.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation of the full and accurate report.
I nevertheless seem to detect a kind of reverence and a respectful distance â which I also felt during the speeches given by the Commission and the Council â when certain powerful quarters are named, when it is they who are responsible for the failure to uphold human rights.
In particular, with reference to Iraq, injustices and violence must be condemned with equal force whatever their origin, whether terrorists or the occupying Anglo-American forces are involved.
If prison conditions really were the measure of a societyâs level of civilisation, then the West would be in a terrible state in view of situations such as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.
In this case it is not enough to ask the United States to clarify the situation.
Here there is nothing to clarify but we have a political and moral duty to voice a firm condemnation.
I also believe that in Afghanistan too, infringements of human rights should be condemned, including when they are carried out by international forces.
Moreover, the United States should be called on to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
The law must be equal for all and noÂ one must have any kind of international immunity.
We recently voted to start negotiations with Turkey, and thereby contracted a debt which we must honour: namely, to continue monitoring, day after day, how the situation develops â not just in the legislative field but also in everyday policy â with regard to respect for human rights, in particular those of the Kurdish population, political recognition and a commitment to finding a solution to this conflict, and also recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and withdrawal of troops from the northern part of the island.
These issues must be explicitly set out in the report.
Human rights must also be interpreted in a broader sense: we cannot only condemn violence and the death penalty when individuals are concerned, while overlooking entire political decisions that condemn millions of people to death.
I refer to the liberalist economic and financial policies which force, for example, 800Â million people to live on less than a dollar a day and deny tens of millions of people access to treatment for AIDS.
In the Amazon, where 20% of the entire planetâs freshwater flows every day, tens of thousands of people in Manaus have no access to drinking water because the service has been privatised.
That is an example of how our model of development violates the most important human right, that is, the right to existence.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to human rights, I would like to take the opportunity to mention a .
I am not referring to an actual person, but to peoplesâ right to self-determination which, unfortunately, is very often hidden, ignored, trampled on and violated.
Too often, when we speak of human rights, we only refer to the rights of individuals, whose freedom, integrity and health must â quite rightly â be respected.
The rights of peoples are, however, just as important, and one of the most important of these is the right to self-determination.
This is why, as I found no trace of it in the report, I have tabled an amendment to rectify this omission, and hope that it will be received favourably by my fellow Members from all political parties.
Â Â  An excellent report, which reflects the criticism of the current state of human rights in the world.
The report also includes documents guaranteeing citizens their rights.
I am surprised that the priorities do not include the undignified position of women and the failure to guarantee their rights.
Our problem is, however, that we sometimes notice failures to observe human rights elsewhere in the world but we do not notice them in our own environs.
We assuage our consciences with the fact that we have instruments of justice, by means of which citizens can insist upon their rights.
We tend to forget that Lady Justice is sometimes lazy and it takes her a long time to make decisions.
Basic human rights include political rights.
Political ethics are lacking if we fail to acknowledge such rights for our political rivals.
Mr President, I am talking about the undignified position of the non-attached members in this Parliament.
We are able to work, thank you, but we are not included in your Hontov system.
This seems to be solely for the elite, or is it just one of those documents which subscribes to the principle of winner takes all?
Mr President, I was very aggrieved when the President of the European Parliament did not have a seat at the table for the negotiations with President Bush.
I was very pleased that the situation was rectified, because it was not just matter of the personal position of Mr Borrell, it was a matter of the position of the President of the European Parliament.
I therefore ask that you do not see my contribution as relating to individual people but to our voters, who are entitled to respect.
Â Â  Mr President, high standards of human rights are part of the of the EU, both internally and internationally, in its foreign and development policies.
I am, however, a little cynical when I see references to the UN Human Rights Commission, whose current membership includes Saudi Arabia, which publicly beheads people for drug and alcohol offences; Cuba, which executed three people last year for attempting to flee the country in a hijacked ferry and locks up political dissidents, and Zimbabwe, which is a dictatorship in which press freedom is suppressed and people are subject to arbitrary arrest and torture.
Ironically, all three countries are cited in the resolution.
This is reflected in the 'no action' taken over Zimbabwe and China, where there is extensive use of the death penalty, even for such crimes as corruption, pimping, drug offences and tax fraud, its systematic torture of dissidents and its restrictions on freedom of speech, including the Internet, and religious practice, getting off the hook.
China also has a nasty habit of sustaining brutal regimes like Sudan, Burma and North Korea, irrespective of the atrocities they commit, on the basis of non-interference in their internal affairs.
Nevertheless, the UNCHR is the only international vehicle we have for promoting human rights globally, so we must stick with it.
I welcome the bulk of this resolution, in particular the defence of the state's duty to protect its citizens against terrorism and the need to continue dialogue on human rights with countries such as Iran, whose track record is appalling with the recent execution of a 16-year-old girl for sexual misdemeanours.
I also take issue with listing India, which is a democracy and subject to the rule of law, being in the same list as China and Zimbabwe.
The Indian State actually practices positive discrimination in favour of the lower castes.
Some recognition must also be given to Uzbekistan and President Karimov's recent undertakings that there have admittedly been excesses in his country in the fight against Islamist terrorists, but he now wishes to free up the press, establish an independent judiciary and abolish the death penalty.
These are serious considerations.
I feel strongly that we must encourage countries and their leaders who are not totally beyond the pale to move in the right direction and reward them for it.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the violation of human rights in Belarus, one of the countries that shares borders with the European Union.
According to a report on human rights violations in 2004, published on the Internet by the independent Belarussian civil initiative Charter 97, approximately 1 500 people were detained or arrested for political reasons in Belarus last year.
Approximately 20 newspapers were closed, and three opposition politicians were sentenced to several yearsâ imprisonment.
The political regime of President Lukashenko exerts control over the media and violates basic human rights, civil rights and political freedoms.
The Belarussian people are denied the right to independent information as well as the right of political parties to conduct their affairs freely and the right to freedom of assembly.
In February of this year, Belarus was also the scene of protests relating to economic issues.
Everything indicates that the situation in that country will become more critical as a result of the presidential elections that must take place no later than September 2006.
Lukashenko will run for the third time in these elections.
It should be remembered that the referendum held last year, which did not comply with any democratic principles, allowed him to hold this position for life.
On the other hand, the civilian population in Belarus is rousing itself, above all under the influence of the democratic breakthrough in Ukraine.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am saying this as a representative from Central Europe, and as a former leader of Solidarity, the trade union that began a peaceful revolution in Poland 25 years ago, guided by the idea of human rights.
The European Parliament must not resign itself to the creation of a new curtain on the borders of the European Union, this time separating a democratic Europe in which citizens can develop freely from an authoritarian Europe in which political regimes violate basic human rights.
We must remember that the flag of the European Union has become a symbol of freedom and hope for a better world in Belarus.
We must bear in mind those young people who on St Valentineâs Day distributed light-blue ribbons with gold stars on the streets of cities in Belarus.
The heart of Europe now beats in Minsk, and the fate of democracy on the European continent is being decided there.
Â Â  Mr President, fortunately, there are other bodies, apart from the UN Commission on Human Rights, that are concerned with this problem.
This leads me to make two comments.
The first is that we might find it useful, in the context of the interinstitutional dialogue with the presidency, the Commission and the European Parliament, to ask ourselves just how useful the UN Commission on Human Rights really is, and to question the sometimes surprising presidencies it appoints, and the virtual absolution it grants to its members.
It may be that the presence of the Union will result, not in blackmail, but rather in a re-examination of the real usefulness of the Commission.
I believe that we could use our place within the Commission to attempt to push it towards fairer solutions.
My second comment concerns effectiveness.
I note, Mr President, that you proposed that we should actually restrict the number of subjects and countries concerned, and that seems quite sensible to me.
The fact is, however, that the resolution tabled by Mrs Flautre is pretty well exhaustive, so that one could take oneâs pick.
I see it includes the rights of children, religious intolerance and the death penalty.
Allow me to add two further subjects which we could include, namely freedom of expression, because it is an essential catalyst in the development of human rights, and slavery in all its forms.
As for the countries involved â Korea, Burma and Palestine â it seems to me essential to add to the list the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which causes the equivalent of a tsunami every three months, with 3.6Â million deaths since 1992 in an atmosphere of general indifference, and finally Darfur, which is really starting to be the âforgotten manâ in this context.
We could concentrate our efforts on these five subjects and these five countries.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights represents an opportunity to tackle some outstanding issues.
The European Union must sponsor specific resolutions on matters such as the situation in Colombia, corporate responsibility in the area of human rights, and the right to self-determination for forgotten peoples such as those of Tibet and the Sahara.
Resolutions concerning discrimination for reasons of sexual orientation or gender must also be supported, in line with the Brazilian initiative.
In addition, the Union should promote the reform of the aforementioned Commission.
As an essential pre-requisite to membership, governments must first be required to have ratified the main treaties concerning human rights.
They must also have fulfilled all the requirements concerning information, applied the recommendations adopted by the bodies charged with monitoring those treaties and issued open invitations to UN experts in human rights.
A determined effort will be required to tackle these matters, and I urge the European Union to take them seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, between 14 March and 22 April, the UN Commission on Human Rights will be holding its 61st annual meeting in Geneva.
We can only hope that the Commission will be guided by strict ethical and objective criteria alone and will no longer be influenced by considerations more akin to cynical than to the defence of human rights.
This was, unfortunately, all too often the case, and it was clear to everyone how the United Nations in general and the UNCHR in particular applied double standards.
That was the case during the Cold War and I fear that this is still true of the UNCHR to some extent today.
Last year, for example, during its 60th session, the UN Human Rights Commission rejected the resolutions on Zimbabwe, which the European Union helped to submit, as well as the resolution on China.
With regard to those countries, the UN went as far as to adopt what is referred to as a no action motion.
Could it be that in some cases â I am mainly thinking of China â the concern over human rights on the part of the UN bureaucrats decreases proportionately as the economic interest of the countries in question increases?
We hardly dare to imagine, but certainly in the case of China, it is striking how there are those who, time after time, apply double moral standards.
China is the world leader when it comes to death sentences and executions, yet that does not appear to stop various EU Member States from pushing aside major ethical principles and keeping quiet about human rights when the Chinese leaders come to visit Europe.
Of course, major deals are yet to be clinched â Airbus springs to mind â and it is, of course, considered more expedient to keep quiet about that troublesome Dalai Lama or those awkward Taiwanese.
Those double moral standards are also being applied to Turkey, as speakers from different groups in this House have pointed out on different occasions over the months whenever this became topical.
Accession negotiations with Turkey had to begin, by hook or by crook, and despite the persistent reports about countless cases of torture, about taking away the freedom of opinion and assembly, about the stateâs policy of denial of the Armenian genocide, about the permanent occupation of Northern Cyprus, it was inconsistent with the truth that Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria.
These are only two examples to illustrate that in this world, still takes precedence over the major democratic and ethical principles to which no more than lip service is being paid.
Neither the UN, nor our own EU, are credible disciples or moral philosophers in this respect.
Â Â  Mr President, if the European Union really wants to make a difference on human rights, it has to start to get serious.
For millions of people, the key to a better future, economic development, and to the much-needed improvement in human rights is good governance, and yet there is reluctance on the part of the European Union to confront regimes that are serial abusers of their people.
In Africa, and this is a continent to which the European Union apparently attaches special importance, a very clear test case of the seriousness of our resolve is Zimbabwe.
For years the people of Zimbabwe have suffered under the vicious, bigoted and corrupt Mugabe regime.
This Parliament has been consistent, through many resolutions, in its call for robust action against Mugabe and those who keep him in power.
I am sorry to say that the Council's reaction has been limp-wristed.
At least last week Council renewed its targeted sanctions, but these are not being applied with any real vigour; they are not hurting Mugabe's cronies.
With elections in Zimbabwe just five weeks away, simply renewing existing EU sanctions does not send a clear message to the regime that it must change for the better or face the consequences.
It was disappointing that the Union failed to take the opportunity to threaten further specific sanctions should violence, oppression and intimidation mar the elections in Zimbabwe.
Conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling.
The opposition MDC has no access to the state-controlled media, its meetings are disrupted and there are over 400Â court cases pending against MDC candidates.
The voters' rolls are out of date, the opposition has no idea where polling stations will be and to get food, people are forced to attend Mugabe's rallies.
No robust international observer mission has been invited and there are arrests of the few remaining international journalists.
At the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the EU should sponsor a specific resolution on Zimbabwe and, in any case, use all means at its disposal over the coming vital weeks to ensure free and fair elections in that benighted country.
Â Â  Mr President, a debate about Europeâs commitment to worldwide respect for human rights in a UN context would not be complete without it being stated that one in five people, mainly women, still have no access to food, water, health care or basic education.
I consider this to be a worldwide violation of human rights.
The Millennium Goals are the concrete objectives to which Heads of Government across the world have committed themselves in a UN context in a bid to improve that situation.
Five years after this ambitious plan, we have to conclude that those objectives are a long way from being met.
By 2015, all children, and girls in particular, should be attending school.
That, in practice, appears to be an empty shell.
The right to development is being denied to many.
It is now up to the EU finally to deliver on those Millennium Goals in the spirit of putting your money where your mouth is.
Most Member States are a long way off the 7% mark of development cooperation.
The European Union is still a long way from meeting its pledge to spend 20% of the development budget on basic education and basic health care.
When we come to set down the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 â which involve billions â it is these that we should make into the real human rights issues.
If those objectives are met, 500 new people can escape from extreme poverty, more than three hundred million people can live without hunger, thirty million children can be saved from premature death, two million fewer mothers will die in child birth, one hundred million more girls and young women will be able to attend school.
That is respect for human rights.
Â Â  Mr President, someone once described the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva as the annual human rights circus.
After all, in recent years, it has turned out several times that the show has been run by countries that are known for violating human rights.
By concluding strategic alliances, they stand by each other and even manage to give each other pats on the back.
It is high time the make-up of the UNCHR, as well as its voting procedures, were subjected to a thorough overhaul. If not, it is at risk of being sunk by its own lack of credibility.
The European Union also carries a major responsibility in this.
It must work towards more coherence and more consistency in its human rights policy.
The EU should finally play a pioneering role, so that the 61st session does not end up being an unnecessary ceremony, but an efficient and credible consultation producing fair, and above all, concrete, results.
Â Â  Mr President, as we prepare for the Geneva meeting, it must be said that it has been a tough year for human rights around the world.
At the same time as focusing our attention on various details, we should still make very specific mention of the leading violators of human rights, China and Russia.
It is only right that Parliament should not be silent on the Chechnya question, for example.
Regarding China, I would like to mention a small detail: two words that cause immense suffering.
These two words of accusation can destroy the innocent lives of peace-loving citizens.
Using the concept of the âEvil Cultâ as a pretext, the authorities in China arrest and imprison countless numbers of people. Their only crime is belonging to a religious community.
These people are not responsible for civil disorder and do not pose a threat to others.
They are simply asserting their basic human rights: in this case the right to assemble and practise a religion.
The âEvil Cultâ is, as a concept, much too vague to be regarded in any way as reasonable grounds for arrest or imprisonment.
As is often stated, our policy on China and Russia is closely tied to factors connected with policy on trade and energy.
Sometimes I cannot help wondering what the future will bring in this regard.
What will growing dependence on, and the need for, energy, which is already the norm in the EU, mean for European human rights policy?
At the moment we are 50% dependent on energy imported from outside the EU, and, according to the Commissionâs calculations, that will rise to 70% by 2030.
It has already been mentioned here that expressions of concern by Parliament and in particular the Member States have in certain cases come up against the passivity of the Member States of the Union and the commercial interests operating in the background.
If that is what the situation is like now, how far will we go when our dependence increases and we are competing more and more alongside China and India for Russiaâs energy resources?
Unless we realise this and identify the risk inherent in the situation we are in, the result may be an inadvertent weakening of our human rights policy.
It could close mouths when they should be open.
We need a pre-emptive strategy which takes our weaknesses and inclinations into account in our desire for a diplomatically comfortable existence.
Â Â  The debate is suspended.
The debate will resume at 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I would simply like to say that I am occupying a seat on the committee chairmenâs bench to which I am not entitled, because I am no longer a committee chairman, while MrÂ Jean-Marie Cavada, who is the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is sitting up in the gods.
I hope that the officials will correct this situation, so that I can sit in a place more suited to my humble station and Mr Cavada can occupy a position appropriate to the dignity of his office.
Â Â  The relevant departments will certainly note your comments.
In the meantime however, you, together with your colleague, may remain in your current seats, and this will not even affect the use of the voting cards.
We will of course deal with this matter.
Â Â  Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission declares that, with a view to ensuring that business operators in the European Union are not placed at a competitive disadvantage to business operators outside of it, it will involve business representatives and trade federations in the legislative process that will lead to the adoption of provisions allowing the amendment of the Community Customs Code.
This will include those where provisions resulting from international agreements may be granted by publishing relevant documents and draft legal texts for meetings of the Customs Code Committee on the Europa website, so that traders and trade federations can make their views known to the Commission and the committee before a decision is taken.
Secondly, the Commission will hold regular consultations on specific issues with a trade contact group that is already established and is made up of representative European trade federations.
Thirdly, representative trade experts will be involved in committee proceedings in accordance with Article 9 of the rules for the committee procedures.
Â Â  . Mr President, two minutes is too long to summarise the substance of the work we have carried out.
Everyone is aware of the merit of the proposal and it is commendable that we have managed to reach an honourable compromise between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, which means that Parliament can vote â I hope with the broadest possible majority â for this report.
The signal is clear: Europe is committed to considering vocational training one of its trump cards in order to win the battle of international competition, and to this end it is sending out a message to the enterprises and individual countries of the Union.
This message has an intrinsic value which, if supported by a unanimous decision of Parliament, would take on even more importance.
Â Â  President Yushchenko, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure, on behalf of the House, to give a warm welcome to MrÂ Yushchenko and to offer him our most sincere congratulations on his election to this high office.
We had hoped to welcome MrÂ Yushchenko to the House on 27Â January.
As you will recall, however, it snowed heavily on that day, disrupting transport across much of Europe.
MrÂ Yushchenko was therefore unable to reach Strasbourg.
Today also happens to be your birthday MrÂ Yushchenko, and on behalf of the House I would like to wish you many happy returns of the day.
We all have birthdays from time to time, but we are not all called upon to play a leading role in events such as those your country has just experienced.
I should also like to welcome the large delegation from Ukraine seated in the official gallery.
MrÂ President, the recent election in your country confirmed that the people of Ukraine have embraced democracy.
They gave ample proof of their maturity and showed their determination to work for peace and progress in the future.
I am sure that the images of the mobilisation of your fellow citizens at the end of last year are still fresh in our minds and will remain so for a long time.
We are impressed too by the ambitious democratic and economic reforms you plan to undertake.
The task ahead of you will not be easy, but you can be assured that the European Union will support you.
I would remind you that on 13Â January this year, the House adopted a resolution calling, and I quote, âon the Council, the Commission and the Member States to consider, besides the measures of the Action Plan, within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy, other forms of association with Ukraine giving a clear European perspective for the country and responding to the demonstrated aspirations of the vast majority of the Ukrainian people, possibly leading ultimately to the countryâs accession to the EU.â
This was the European Parliamentâs standpoint.
I am simply repeating what the House adopted, putting the seal on a process in which we have all been very much involved.
We believe that the 12 days of the Orange Revolution served to do more than demonstrate the strength of the longing for democracy in your country, MrÂ Yushchenko.
They also demonstrated the European Unionâs ability to take political action in its immediate vicinity.
There are therefore two reasons for us to rejoice.
We can celebrate what you have achieved in Ukraine, and we can congratulate ourselves for the part that, as a political entity, we played in bringing it about.
This all constitutes a further reason to welcome you in our midst, albeit for a short time.
I wish you a pleasant stay in Strasbourg, MrÂ Yushchenko, and give you the floor.
Â Â  (1). Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and a great pleasure for me to address you here in this Chamber.
The European Parliament is a symbol of democracy within the European Union and democracy is the value that unites all of us today.
Democracy is the cornerstone on which our prosperity is built, as is the case with every country which has chosen the path of democracy and freedom, and for our entire continent which was enabled to build a union of free countries.
I am therefore very proud to be able to address the European Parliament.
I am also very proud to be able to be representing a country that has created a new symbol within the European continent.
The Berlin Wall was pulled down and our Orange Revolution too became a new symbol within a democratic Europe.
All this means that totalitarianism will no longer be possible on our continent.
Our people were able to choose the path of freedom and truth, showing that they were able to fight and to do their utmost to live in a Europe which is united and free.
The borders of Europe now extend from Lisbon to beyond Kiev.
We have chosen the European civilisation.
It is not just a question of geography, it is a question of our spiritual values, of our shared moral values too.
In my country we have seen the President elected democratically for a second time and this time it has happened in a transparent and democratic way.
Democracy won the day even though it cost the people of my country and me myself a lot of effort.
This victory became possible because we saw the development of a proper civil society in Ukraine.
Journalists, politicians, businessmen, judges, public servants, all became mobilised, thanks to the establishment of what is almost a new nation, that is to say Ukraine.
You in the European Parliament should consider yourselves the godfathers and godmothers of that newly-born democratic Ukraine.
During those unforgettable days of the Orange Revolution your support was of great encouragement, a great symbol for us, helping us in our struggle against the fear we knew during the month of December, which was a very difficult month to live through.
Here in the European Parliament we heard, we understood, that a new democratic society was possible within Ukraine.
A new page of the European history book was being turned.
In true Ukrainian fashion I would like to thank you for your support and for your struggle for our freedom.
Thank you, all of you.
Dear friends, we are here together.
Ukraine still needs to do much to become a full member of the European family but we have already attained our main objective.
We are now united by shared values.
We have a shared history. We have shared aspirations.
These things unify us and this feeling of unity is so much more important than mere statements that people make.
My country today has embarked upon a path of new reforms.
This process reminds me of the process of making bread: you need good ingredients, you need hard work.
When the dough is ready it then depends on how you shape it for it to become a good loaf.
For us in Ukraine, our objective for this bread is that it be shaped by the new standards and new values adopted in accordance with European standards and values.
European integration is the only true path open to Ukraine.
Over recent days we have already moved towards integration into the European Union.
We have chosen our strategic and political path in that direction.
Over and above words, we need to see action.
In the past, democracy, the rule of law and even the media were very difficult in Ukraine.
There was a lot of corruption. That forced the people out into the streets and into the squares to call for better conditions, for internal reforms to take place and for us to move towards the European Union.
Ukraine and the European Union should not forfeit this single and unique opportunity.
We appreciate your commitment to grasping this historic opportunity.
By adopting its resolution on 13 January this year the European Parliament has shown how visionary it is by recommending to the Council, the Commission and the Member States that they support Ukraine in its European aspirations.
I believe that the extension of the Ukraine action plan is an extremely positive gesture.
We, in Ukraine, will do everything we can to implement the provisions of the action plan from our side.
I would emphasise once again how we will do our utmost to achieve this.
It is one of the most important tasks ahead for my government.
Ukraine will do its utmost so that we can now conduct a joint analysis, enabling us to show how much progress we have made.
I hope that in the year 2007 it will be possible for us at the end of the action plan to begin negotiations for membership and that we could open up the process of negotiations for membership in that way.
The neighbourhood policy already seems to have been overtaken by events.
The scope and dimension of our relations should be based on the fact that Ukraine is an integral part of a united Europe already.
Once again I emphasise that we feel that our cooperation with the European Union is situated very much within the framework of the action plan, but going beyond the neighbourhood policy and we are proposing that, as of now, we undertake actions with a view to the future membership of Ukraine in the European Union.
We know the position of our partners who propose that different scenarios be developed.
We feel that it is important for our own aspirations to be supported.
My final objective and that of my country and my government is for Ukraine to join the European Union.
The final outcome of the conclusion of the action plan, which we are fully prepared to implement faster than was originally planned, could then allow for the creation of an association agreement.
Ukraine can make an official request on the basis of ArticleÂ 49 of the European Union Treaty, and we can do our utmost to meet the Copenhagen criteria.
I would emphasise once again that we understand that most of the work for joining the European Union will fall to us.
We are the ones who have to make the effort, and if we cannot implement quick reforms, the European Union will not be able to help us.
Nobody can do that work for us.
My government has already drawn up an action plan for the next five years, with the ultimate objective of our joining the European Union.
The Deputy Prime Minister responsible for European cooperation is currently drawing up all the detailed aspects of that action plan.
We shall be doing our best to ensure that we have a transparent economy, an economy that works, to alleviate taxes, fight against corruption, and ensure that the judiciary and the media are independent.
During my presidency, there will be no talk of the infringement of human rights in Ukraine.
Our ambition for European integration requires us to make progress in the reforms that I have just listed.
These are important objectives for us and clearly it is going to require much work to adapt our society.
We will have to adapt our administrative structures to European standards to ensure that people shoulder their responsibilities.
We want the people of Ukraine to trust the administration again and for them to understand our policies.
We will be introducing social reforms, reforms in the areas of education and training, and social protection.
One of the most important priorities is the reform of the judiciary.
We will be fighting against drug trafficking and illegal immigration and doing our utmost to ensure that our judicial system works properly, based on European standards, and with regard to human rights and respect for the dignity of human beings.
I am convinced that we can avoid discrimination of any kind being tolerated in our society and in our fight against the scourges with which we are all familiar in Europe.
Ukraine will continue to fight for the rights of its citizens to become true European citizens, for them to feel that they belong to the European family.
We shall be doing everything we can to implement things in a meticulous way at all levels, in the economy, in social life and in every area of society.
We need to ensure that all this is done with a European vision and in a European spirit.
There is very much a European philosophy underpinning my work and the work of my government.
I can show you that my government will be moving from words to deeds, and the practical support of the European Union in these endeavours will only be effective if that is the case.
Now the definitive choice of Europe cannot be refuted by anybody really.
It is the only path open to us to bring us closer to the European Union.
It is now time for a decisive step to be taken also vis-Ã -vis Ukraine.
The Atlantic Alliance is something that will further assist the creation of civil society, the rule of law and respect for human rights in my country during my presidency.
We are more interested than anybody in developing our relations also with the Russian Federation, our big neighbour.
We do not see our moving towards Europe as a problem for Russia because it will help to bring the Russian Federation itself closer to Europe.
Nobody can say that Ukraine moving towards Europe could prevent us having closer cooperation with our Russian neighbours.
Do not believe those who say that Ukraine moving into European structures is against the interests of Russia.
I am convinced that this is not the case and, in fact, the opposite is true.
If Ukraine were a member of the European Union and NATO, it would not mean that we would use that membership against the interests of Russia and the Russian people.
A stable Ukraine, just as a stable Russia, is something that should be considered as guarantors for our common and shared values.
As far as our cooperation with the Russian Federation is concerned, there will be a new regional policy to develop that.
As far as concrete actions are concerned, we have already begun to undertake such actions with the European Union aimed at a peaceful settlement of the Transnistria dispute.
We feel that this is a way that we will be able to help to contribute to European values becoming rooted in our region.
Transfrontier cooperation, energy networks and the like will become ways of fleshing out our cooperation in concrete terms, from Baku to the western frontiers of the European Union.
In this way we can bring European standards into our region.
This is clearly one of our priorities.
We feel that this is the only vision that will enable my country properly to meet these aspirations.
Dear friends, nothing is guaranteed.
We have to defend our common values on a day-to-day basis.
We have to build jointly the walls of the house within which our peoples live.
Unless a house has solid foundations it will collapse.
And as it says in the Bible: a house divided against itself cannot stand.
It is the strength of Europe that is to be found in this unity.
You, yourselves, have been the witnesses to the emergence of this new colour on the European map - the colour orange.
You know that Ukraine can also form part of the future of Europe.
The time has come now for us to work hard; the time has come now for us to take concrete measures.
It is not going to be easy for us to do this, but I know that, by going together down this path, in this direction, we will be able to achieve our final goal.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ Yushchenko.
In your address you have restated how history has decreed that the creation of an independent Ukraine should be linked to the creation of a strong political Europe.
We stood shoulder to shoulder at a critical juncture, and you have made it clear that you wish to continue our association in the future.
You can be confident that the European Parliament will support your stated desire to create a Ukraine based on political freedom, economic progress and social cohesion, which are the three distinguishing features of European society.
Â Â  . Mr President, on several occasions there have been lengthy discussions with both the Dutch and the Luxembourg presidencies and an informal trialogue to reach an informal agreement within the procedure under Article 251 of the Treaty.
I am a little surprised, therefore, that the ALDE Group, having been involved in this, have asked for a split vote.
If we do not vote in accordance with the block compromise we would be unpicking everything that had been agreed, or the basis of the agreement, in the compromise.
So I urge people to go for the block compromise and support the first two parts in its entirety.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have a purely technical point concerning Amendment 13.
All language versions of this should be made to conform with the Spanish original so that, for example, in English it will read: 'investigate and develop technical control and inspection solutions'.
Â Â  Mr President, I beg your attention for a few seconds, because the wording of this oral amendment is different from the one on your voting lists.
At the end of paragraph 9, after the words âasks for an immediate withdrawal of troops from the country as stated in the UNSC resolutionsâ, I propose that we should add the words âand will make that condition a crucial assessment criterion when the time comes to sign the Association Agreementâ.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, further to the statements made in the course of this morningâs debate by the various parliamentary groups, and having contacted all of the them, I should like to propose the adoption of a new paragraph 18(a).
I shall now read the proposed text in Spanish: âCalls on the Council to adopt the decision to organise a Euro-Mediterranean Summit of Heads of State or Government to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process. Highlights, in this connection, the importance of the parliamentary dimension of the process and calls on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly due to meet in Cairo from 12 to 15Â MarchÂ 2005 to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly so as to be involved in celebrating the tenth anniversaryâ.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I merely wanted to make a comment concerning the presentation of the oral amendment tabled by MrÂ Morillon.
It has just been voted on and we support it.
I should like to point out that in view of the agreement that seems to have been reached between all the political groups, the last part of paragraphÂ 9 should become a separate paragraph.
I have in mind the reference to sending an electoral observation mission to Lebanon.
MrÂ Morillon did not take this into account when tabling his amendment and I think it is important.
Â Â  . With this further agreement, which the rapporteur endorses, we are taking another necessary step on the road towards fully integrating the new Member States.
Like the other agreements that have already been concluded, this one gives further proof that the EUâs traditional partners have taken a positive view of the enlargement, a sign that Europe is now an increasingly relevant political entity.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .
This recommendation arises from the recent EU enlargement and is intended to incorporate the new Member States into the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement of association between the EU and Egypt, by concluding an additional protocol to this agreement.
It is similar to other previous recommendations.
The conclusion of this protocol will, , cover the importation of agricultural products from Egypt to the new Member States that will be subject to its provisions.
I have supported these association and cooperation agreements.
I feel that they will constitute another positive step in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
In addition to focusing on its citizensâ well-being, the EU should also help to make its neighbours economies more dynamic, which, moreover, is in line with its strategy of a âEuropean Neighbourhood Policyâ (COM (2004) 373 final), adopted by the General Affairs Council on 14Â JuneÂ 2004.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . â The Commission is proposing that the Council authorise the Member States falling under the EUâs common visa, asylum and immigration policy (including Sweden) to ratify, in the interests of the Community, the Seafarersâ Identity Documents Convention of the International Labour Organisation.
The Convention does not imply any change to the Regulation governing the area, which expressly lays down exceptions from the visa requirement for civilian sea crews.
Consequently, it is unreasonable that Member States should need the Councilâs authorisation; a view obviously shared by France, which has already ratified the Convention.
The June List does not, therefore, see anything to prevent the Member States from making their own decisions on whether they wish to accede to the Convention, without authorisation from the EU.
Â Â  . Following the work already done at first reading, and in light of the cooperative work carried out with the Council, I believe that this report should be adopted, given that the issue before us, relating mainly to a harmonised risk assessment system, strengthens the security of the Communityâs external borders, an issue of vital importance to all of us.
Â Â  . The new challenges and threats to the stability of the international community and, more specifically, that of the European area and its internal market, which have been brought on by the emergence of an increasingly volatile and unpredictable new reality, require us to adopt fresh preventative measures.
The aim of this proposal for a regulation amending the Community Customs Code is to incorporate the basic principles underlying the new concept of security management for external borders, including the introduction of a harmonised risk-assessment system.
Accordingly, the aim is to tighten up security around goods crossing international borders.
To this end, the proposal redefines the role of customs officers and introduces a mechanism for setting risk-selection criteria at Community level, together with a computerised risk management support system.
These elements meet the expectations of European citizens as regards improving general security levels.
I welcome the adoption of most of Parliamentâs proposed amendments adopted at first reading. I am also pleased about the unanimous vote in the committee concerned.
Â Â  . This report supports a regulation to establish a common framework for the presentation of Community statistics on vocational training in enterprises.
Although it sounds rather dry, this proposal is to be warmly welcomed as it underpins the policy of lifelong learning as a basic component of the European employment strategy (as acknowledged by the Lisbon European Council in 2000).
The report requires Member States to compel enterprises to report on levels of training, it also calls for access to vocational training to be broader so that workers have access to training regardless of their contract type and even if they are employed in businesses with less than 10 employees.
Â Â  . My view on this issue, like that of the rapporteur, is not entirely devoid of doubts.
Beginning with the key elements, it strikes me that there is potential conflict in the Council seeking to authorise the Member States to do what, in Franceâs case, they have already done, particularly in an area in which there is no clear guidance as to whether this power rests with the Community or forms part of the exceptions enshrined in the Treaty.
Furthermore, the shortcomings that the rapporteur highlights regarding the substance of the convention in question may also make us consider that we should think carefully before adopting it.
Against this backdrop, one might vote against this report, for the reasons I have stated.
There are two factors, however, that have led us not to do so.
On the one hand, given that it is the Council that wishes to authorise the Member States, the Member States are requesting that authorisation.
On the other hand, it is not for Parliament to analyse the efficiency of a convention that is considered efficient by the signatories to it.
I therefore voted in favour of the report, with the reservations that I have mentioned.
Â Â  . Article 3(j) of the EC Treaty states that the activities of the Union should include the promotion of coordination between employment policies of the Member States with a view to enhancing their effectiveness by developing a coordinated strategy for employment.
Furthermore, one of the innovative elements of the Lisbon strategy is the promotion of lifelong learning, and this forms part of all of the Member Statesâ national action plans.
A legal basis at European level for compiling comparable data which give a true picture of continuing vocational training must be seen as an essential element both from the point of view of coordination and of what is referred to as effectiveness.
The regulation before us establishes a common framework for producing Community figures on vocational training in enterprises.
This will be the decisive factor in the adoption of strategies arising from the promotion of active lifelong learning policies.
Portugal has already taken steps in this direction, with the introduction of measures into labour legislation under the heading of continuing lifelong learning for workers and companies.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . The Lisbon strategy set out a range of instruments aimed at creating more and better jobs.
One of those instruments is lifelong learning.
Lifelong learning is a long way from being a reality for European workers, however.
Improving vocational skills is not accorded its due merit, even though the Member States place the issue at the heart of reducing unemployment and promoting productivity.
In the EU of 15, only 8.5% of European citizens enjoyed this professional benefit.
What kind of figures will we now see in the Europe of 25?
We are speaking about something that has little practical substance.
Because I feel that anything that is not measured cannot be managed, conditions must be created whereby comparable data that will give a true picture of the situation as regards continuing vocational training can be regularly and systematically collected.
I am also in favour of including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in statistics of this kind.
Despite the amount of bureaucracy involved, it is worthwhile involving the SMEs in this process, albeit by means of simplified processes, because they account for some 90% of European enterprises.
Promoting training for our workers and investing in their lifelong employability are sustainable ways of achieving greater competitiveness in the European economy.
Â Â  . The Member States have negotiated a new version of the Seafarersâ Identity Documents Convention of the International Labour Organisation, aimed at simplifying the formalities involved in going ashore in countries of which they are not nationals.
Unlike the rapporteur, I am not in the least surprised by the decision to enter biometric data in seafarersâ identity documents, because there can no longer be any doubt that the security of travel documents must be tightened up and that new technology of this kind offers a series of advantages in terms of identifying individuals and preventing documents from being falsified.
The global aim of this proposal is thus to ally flexibility with security.
As regards the issue of the âmodelâ chosen, which consists of a fingerprint printed as numbers on a bar code, there is no interoperability problem, either with passports or with visas, since fingerprints will be included in both proposals, hence they are comparable.
As for the technical discrepancy and the different equipment required, it should be pointed out that this is the least costly solution.
Furthermore, we are still waiting for the Commission to table a proposal with the model chosen for the introduction of biometric data on visas, ...
Â Â  . Based on the principle that the issue before us is only that of identifying seafarers when they go ashore, we agree with the general thrust, which is that seafarersâ identification documents should be considered sufficient and that no entry visas should be needed, for example when ships are docking or making ports of call and in the previously mentioned cases of transit, transfer or repatriation.
Furthermore, according to Article 9 of Annex I of Legal Decree No 280/2001 of 23Â October, the Portuguese marine registration certificate âcan constitute a marine identification document for the purposes of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No 108â.
All that remains, therefore, is the âvisasâ issue, and in our view they should not be required.
Consequently we broadly agree with the proposals contained in the report.
There is one issue, however, that has not been analysed, which is the Commissionâs proposal that the Council authorise Member States to ratify an ILO Convention.
This is a further example of undermining national sovereignty, and we are opposed to the move.
It should be pointed out that France has already ratified the Convention concerned, effectively exercising its sovereignty as an independent country, without, of course, asking the EUâs permission to do so.
Â Â  . Given that only Member States can sign up to International Labour Organisation Convention No 185, the Commission took part in the talks as an observer, proposing that the Council authorise the Member States bound by Community rules in this area (Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, of 15Â MarchÂ 2001) to ratify the Convention in the interests of the Community.
Despite some reservations of a technical nature (not least with regard to the operational capability of checking by means of biometric data) put forward by the rapporteur, I believe, as he does, that this proposal for a Council decision, if adopted, essentially confers symbolic value on this authorisation.
If all Member States are entitled to ratify the Convention simultaneously, this will confirm âin the eyes of the rest of the world the importance the Community attaches to the Conventionâ.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, we are in the habit of making a lot of noise when it comes to the explanations of vote.
I would simply like to say that I welcome the adoption of the Wortmann-Kool report, which is probably one of the most remarkable legislative acts of the European Union in recent years.
Here in this House, in the presence of Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, following the Erika I and Erika II maritime packages, I called for the creation of a European maritime safety zone.
If ever it materialises, it will have a legal basis and it will be ambitious.
Never has the European Union gone so far in imposing sanctions of the most severe kind, in other words criminal sanctions, on the pirates of the seas who blight our coastlines and who very often devastate entire livelihoods as well as the flora and fauna of coastal areas.
I believe we should be very pleased with the considerable progress which has been made, and hope that the Council will now follow it up.
From now on, no one will be able to put the blame on the European Union, as we witnessed in the case of the and that of the .
Member States are now facing up to their responsibilities.
Personally, I would like them to accept those responsibilities fully, because Europe is not only defending itself in this way against maritime pollution, but also sending out an international message which is even bolder than the MARPOL legislation, and it is in a position to change, throughout the world, the legislation against pollution and against the pirates of the seas.
I should like to finish by expressing a hope, the hope that the legislation we adopted to prevent the dumping of fuel waste at sea will be revised with the same degree of ambition.
In my opinion, the only solution is to equip our ports with free fuel-discharge facilities, because with this kind of dumping, as you know, it is naturally difficult to catch the perpetrators, who generally operate at night in foggy weather.
I believe, therefore, that we ought to set up a system like the one used for disposing of household waste, with a port tax and port discharge facilities, thereby making it possible for all vessels to discharge fuel waste in purpose-built facilities in all European ports.
If we make this additional progress, I think that we shall then be the world leaders in safety and sanctions against pollution.
Â Â  â Mr President, as far as the Wortmann-Kool report is concerned, I should like to report that we New Democracy MEPs voted in favour of the amendment tabled by vice-chairman Mr Varvitsiotis supporting the compatibility of Community law with the MARPOL international convention on questions of culpability in relation to sanctions for accidental pollution.
We believe that in both territorial and international waters what applies in the MARPOL convention should also apply in Community law and this concerns equal treatment for ships under the law and efficient management of pollution at global level, because shipping is a global activity and must be governed by international conventions.
Regional measures, wherever they have been applied, have been unproductive and are confusing.
Similarly, we New Democracy MEPs also supported Amendment 37 which, on the one hand, calls on us to impose a regime of cooperation between the national authorities, because numerous accidents are caused by a lack of cooperation and inadequate exchange of know-how and, on the other hand, stipulates the need for a cost-benefit study to be carried out on the new measures and the new policies which the European Union wishes to apply for the development of maritime transport within the framework of efficient management of waters and their protection from pollution.
Â Â  .
I believe that the EU must act clearly on this issue and must provide a responsible framework of rules for the maritime transport of oil and other noxious liquid substances.
It is therefore important to combat illegal discharges and to move towards uniform implementation and interpretation within the EU of the international rules in force.
The proposal for a directive incorporates into Community law a range of international rules governing discharges, based on global agreements (MARPOL) and specifies which contraventions of the discharge rules are criminal offences, providing guidance concerning the nature of penalties to be imposed.
In light of the fact that MARPOL rules are relevant, clear and reasonable, they should be incorporated into Community law, given the increasingly international nature of maritime transport.
A further relevant point is undoubtedly the establishment of measures to protect crews, and the possibility of prosecuting others involved in the chain.
It is essential that the imposition of sanctions should encompass all those responsible for polluting the marine environment.
Â Â  . The disaster caused by the sinking of the oil tanker is still fresh in the minds of all Europeans.
The memory of that disaster has led the EU to seek to prevent something of that nature from happening again.
In addition to addressing the issues involved in preventing maritime accidents, there is also a need effectively to combat deliberate maritime pollution, which is the biggest problem that the oceans face today.
In this context, discharges from ships on the high seas require particular concern and attention.
I endorse the view expressed in Spain, France, Italy and Portugalâs declaration to the Council, namely that the EU should go further in combating illegal discharges in the exclusive economic zone.
In so far as international rules allow, they reserve the right to do so themselves.
I have doubts as to the legality of laying down criminal standards based on Article 80(2) of the Treaty relating to transport and as to whether the basis presented by the Commission and Parliament would be lawful, given that criminal sanctions must meet the objectives of the European policy on the environment and transport.
Â Â  . I abstained in the final vote on the proposal for a directive on driving licences, because it is the direct opposite of the âbetter regulationâ which we talk about so much.
This mass of detail, with so many exceptions, is not an example of good legislation.
We could even ask ourselves whether we need a European directive in this field at all.
This over-detailed directive is contrary to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Why, in this area, can we not accept the principle of the country of origin?
Â Â  . â In our opinion, it is a good thing as far as possible to harmonise the rules for, and appearance of, driving licences within the European Union.
The Commission proposal for a directive has become too detailed, however, as have the amendments tabled in the European Parliament.
In our opinion, the principle of subsidiarity and the country of origin principle should apply to the provisions governing driving licences for motorcycles and mopeds.
The validity of driving licences and the need, or otherwise, for medical examinations of their holders are also issues on which we believe in the principle of mutual recognition and have confidence in the Member Statesâ ability to make well-considered, sensible decisions.
It is often said that the Member States have to trust each other when it comes to legislation and rules.
In our opinion, that is also the way it should be with regard to provisions on driving licences.
We are voting against this report, as we are of the opinion that provisions on driving licences can be harmonised without this detailed proposal for a directive.
Besides, we already have a directive on driving licences that has regulated the appearance of driving licences issued within the EU.
Â Â  . âOur rapporteur has been at pains to consider the highly diverse views on this extremely controversial subject.
I endorse his report because his proposal will genuinely improve safety and free movement for road users and offer more opportunities for control in order to reduce the possibilities of fraud.
It is an outrage that some people in Europe have been driving on forged driving licences for ten, twenty, thirty and more years.
I am in favour of harmonised rules and driving examinations; I am also in favour of harmonised age requirements, both maximum and minimum, and I have no objection to a provision requiring older persons in the 70+ age group to renew their driving licences more often, which may entail eye and other medical tests.
However, this should remain a matter for each individual country.
I personally would endorse the introduction of a single European model of driving licence, that is to say, a plastic 'credit' card type with a microchip inserted, in five yearsâ rather than in twenty years' time.
It is undoubtedly the case, though, that road safety in Europe would also be improved if those EU countries which still drive on the left â which is the wrong side, from my perspective â could be induced to abolish this system.
Sweden proved years ago that switching is possible.
I would like to be able to drive my car in Ireland without feeling that I am a danger to myself and other road users.â
Â Â  . I support the stated objectives of this directive as it now stands, namely to reduce fraud, to guarantee truly free movement of EU drivers and to reinforce safety on European roads.
I feel the amendments from the European Parliament have improved the proposal.
Nevertheless, difficulties do remain that can be tidied up, particularly concerning motorcycles, caravans and motor-homes.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mr Grosch on driving licences.
Protection against fraud, the free movement of drivers and road safety are key factors in the defence of freedom of movement in the EU.
This positive idea should not be spoilt by excessive regulation leading to more obligations and obstacles for the drivers concerned.
If we are to enjoy the benefits of greater freedom of movement, we must accept the harmonisation of the basic rules intended to foster safety on the roads, to prevent fraud and to punish offenders.
When it comes to beneficial and entirely justified measures such as this one, we must avoid increasing regulatory and bureaucratic constraints, creating additional limitations for those learning to ride motorcycles or creating more restrictive conditions concerning the period of validity or renewal date of driving licences.
Although the amendments that I endorsed did not secure majority support in this House, I feel that the balance of the text is positive, hence my vote in favour.
Â Â  . â The myriad models and types of licences that allow a citizen of the Member States to drive a motor vehicle may, in a Community in which freedom of movement is the norm, place worrying constraints on the ability of the Member Statesâ authorities to exercise control, at the inevitable expense of legal certainty and road safety.
The European driving licence information network and the mutual recognition of sanctions may be valid ways to help to address the situation.
Fighting fraud, free movement for motorists and road safety are, in fact, the main issues involved here, and we need to move towards the harmonisation of criteria in order to achieve the same degree of reliability from Lisbon to Nicosia.
In my view, such harmonisation must take account of the principles of subsidiarity, suitability and proportionality so as to avoid duplicating bureaucracy and creating obstacles to the free movement of people and goods.
I believe the step-up approach, or progressive access to certain types of vehicle, particularly motorcycles, may have a positive effect in cutting the number of road accidents among young people, and it is worth examining the possibility of introducing it.
All things considered, I voted for the proposal.
Â Â  . â I voted for the Sommer report as I believe inland waterway navigation is a key factor in transport intermodality.
The European Union has a dense network of canals and natural rivers which are not yet being used to their full extent and are worth exploiting in view of the safety and environmental friendliness of this mode of transport.
This proposal, which is intended to establish a Europe-wide framework for the introduction of inland waterway transport information services, may contribute to improved and more effective traffic and transport management on inland waterways.
It is time to ensure the interoperability of such services and to lay the foundations for modern supply-chain management.
Real-time information thus clearly makes the sector more competitive.
This proposal does not excessively constrain action by the Member States, and it should also lead to significantly less subjective error and fewer accidents.
The new technologies to which it refers may give the sector a boost and affect the distribution of modes of transport in the economy.
Intermodal transport systems, which form a basic model for future transport, should therefore take account of the positive role that inland waterway navigation can and must play.
Â Â  . â This Commission proposal represents a major effort to reduce the excessive demands on our roads, particularly with regard to heavy goods transport in Europe.
I have been continually stressing the need for that for a long time now.
Inland waterway navigation is a safe and environmentally-friendly mode of transport but unfortunately accounts for only around 7% of the freight traffic in the 15 âoldâ Member States.
Like inland waterway navigation, coastal navigation also deserves greater attention and promotion.
Rather than merely being sectors ânot to be neglectedâ, as the Commission describes them, both are solutions worthy of promotion and development.
In addition, the proposal seeks to create a Europe-wide framework for the implementation of inland waterway transport information services, involving the use of modern information and communications services designed to bring about improvements in traffic and transport management on internal waterways.
The intermodality proposed in Europeâs transport policy and the high levels of environmental protection and quality that we want can only be achieved by revitalising areas of activity that can transform these ambitions into reality.
I hope, therefore, that this proposal for a directive can be one more step on the road towards a genuine strategy for long-distance sea and inland waterway transport in preference to road haulage.
Â Â  . â The June List has chosen to vote against the proposal on the recognition of seafarersâ certificates.
The Swedish Government Officesâ information note 2003/04:FPM113 states that there has been a âmarked increase in the amount of fraud in connection with the certification procedureâ.
Likewise, the Swedish National Maritime Administration has expressed concern that the right to lay down necessary conditions will be lost if this directive is adopted.
The June List is fundamentally sympathetic towards the country of origin principle and supports the idea of removing the barriers to the functioning of the internal market.
In this specific case, there is much, however, to indicate that the European Union is not yet ready to take that step.
Â Â  .
Levelling downwards â that is the technique constantly used by Brussels to harmonise European and non-European legislation.
In this case it is the certificates issued to seafarers.
The recognition of certificates issued âoutside the European Unionâ is simpler than the scheme in force within the EU.
That inevitably leads to the recruiting of more seafarers outside Europe than in it.
This report recommends that our recognition procedures be simplified, but not that existing procedures outside the EU be brought up to the same standard, which would have had the advantage of limiting the numerous cases of fraud which occur.
We must not sell off our seafarersâ diplomas and qualifications on the cheap.
Their occupations are difficult, and the constraints attached to them â low wages, long voyages, restrictive working conditions â certainly do not encourage young peopleâs interest in training for them.
This is a market in which there is a growing shortage of qualified workers, and that works to the advantage of a cheap and under-qualified labour force from the countries of Asia and elsewhere in the East.
We must restore the career ladder, and attach importance to diplomas and qualification certificates, not the contrary.
Finally, we must abolish flags of convenience on the rust buckets which swarm over and pollute our seas and oceans.
Â Â  . â I voted for the report by Robert Evans on the recognition of seafarersâ certificates because I believe we need to halt the decline in the number of EU seafarers through measures to protect the freedom of movement of workers in this sector.
This proposal aims at simplifying the procedure for recognising seafarersâ certificates.
The proposal would reduce the administrative burden, combat discrimination and promote the mobility of workers in the maritime sector.
Measures such as those proposed therefore have my support.
Â Â  . â This Commission proposal is designed to simplify the recognition procedure for seafarersâ certificates because a situation has arisen where the recognition of certificates from outside the EU is now simpler than that of certificates from within the EU.
The aim is essentially to bring European rules into line with international agreements, namely the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention).
In particular, the 1978 Convention laid down specific criteria for the recognition of certificates for masters, officers and radio officers issued by the parties.
I consider it a timely proposal and, of course, I underline the fact that it adopts language proficiency requirements for seafarers â a command of English, which is obviously the international â and provides for mechanisms to prevent fraud in the certification process (Article 5 of the Commission proposal).
Reducing the burden of regulation for workers in this sector in Europe is another positive aspect of this proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, I will be very brief.
I want to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party as to why it abstained on the amended proposal and then voted for the legislative resolution.
Our explanation of vote is very simple.
We believe that joint deployment plans are important for the effectiveness of the agency's work.
That is why we voted for those amendments.
Amendment 36 to 43 clarify the rule of the agency in implementing these joint deployment plans and they also give an appropriate role to Regional Advisory Councils.
Â Â  . The setting up of a Community institution to ensure a certain level of coordination in the work of national fisheries inspectors is a useful initiative.
What is crucial, however, is the scope of the competences of the institution that is set up, and its mandate.
I cannot vote in favour of the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency.
Control of such matters falls under the jurisdiction of the Member States, both practically and in legal terms, and the proposal for a regulation violates the equilibrium between the institutions.
Another aspect of the common fisheries policy is the protection of aquatic resources.
The Lisbon strategy states that sustainable development entails paying attention to both the ecological and social factors of this development.
By protecting aquatic resources, we also protect the people who make their living from these waters.
We should review overly ambitious conservation plans that only allow for short periods for the renewal of fish stocks, as is in the case with the cod stocks in the Eastern Baltic.
The period that has been agreed on gives rise to unacceptable social tensions.
Â Â  . â I congratulate MrsÂ Attwooll on the important and timely report she has produced on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy.
I give it my full support, particularly since the proposed changes seek to clarify the role of the agency as a facilitator, particularly in the context of the formulation of joint deployment plans, which involve a pooling by Member States of their control and inspection resources, as well as the nature of the functions performed by the Fisheries Monitoring Centre.
The establishment of the agency deserves our full support, since its role will be that of a facilitator of fisheries plans to be drawn up by Member States for the inspection and control of their resources.
It will be a support body for the implementation of the new common fisheries policy, which will help to create more uniform and effective control and inspection procedures.
For it to function effectively, however, an operational organising structure needs to be set up to act as a facilitator of the whole procedure.
Â Â  . Brussels loves agencies.
There are agencies for everything, from the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen to the European Food Safety Agency in Parma, via the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao.
Now there will also be a Community Fisheries Control Agency, in other words a real European Fisheries Ministry.
This FBI of the sea will have the task of coordinating the control and inspection activities of Member States in the fisheries sector.
It will be the strong arm of a control system which has been, until now, somewhat modest.
Parliament wanted such a control system both in Community waters and in international waters.
Multinational inspection teams will therefore be created, at sea and on land.
The agency will be able to charter and operate surveillance vessels, which it will place at the disposal of observers.
Yet who will those observers be?
They will be inspectors from other countries, unfamiliar with national regulations, and this constitutes a refusal to acknowledge each Member Stateâs own competence.
They will therefore be able to inspect, without necessarily finding infringements, without necessarily improving control.
Thus, in the territorial waters of sovereign states, it will no longer be a matter of simply reinforcing Community sovereignty but also of strengthening foreign sovereignty.
Â Â  . Common fisheries policy rules must be implemented effectively and in a uniform way.
Strengthening control was one of the key priorities of the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy.
I therefore welcome this proposal to establish a fisheries control agency.
I believe that this agency should be established without delay.
I did have some problems with the text as adopted by the Fisheries Committee.
This Parliament from the outset has championed the cause of including fishermen and their legitimate representatives in the decision making process.
In this context Parliament gave a resounding approval to my report on Regional Advisory Councils, or RACs, as they are known.
It should be no surprise to anyone that fishermen will have the greatest interests in this agency.
And yet they are being inexplicably excluded from the proceedings.
I believe that there is a vital need for transparency in this issue.
I therefore submit that fishermen must be included.
I believe that the overriding consideration is that the agency must operate in strict conformity with Community interests.
I believe that the question of voting rights in this new agency should not be used as a subterfuge to allow the Commission to dominate proceedings.
Â Â  . â The issue of fisheries is of great importance for Europe as a whole, but above all it is especially important for Portugal, because, in this respect, the interests of our country are not always adequately safeguarded by Community policies.
The regulation establishing a Community Fisheries Control Agency therefore deserves particular attention.
Although the Member States will retain control over fishing activities, the fact is that the Commission is responsible for the operational coordination of monitoring activities and, above all, has the common interest to protect.
We must therefore focus on the way in which this common interest is pursued, without forgetting the need for full compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.
The resources needed to achieve that have to be guaranteed, especially in the case of Portugal in view of its vast EEZ.
Lastly, I must admit to having certain reservations, because there is a risk that the establishment of a new Community agency will result in some overlap of functions and duplication of costs.
Â Â  . â It has been common practice to establish Community agencies whenever the importance and sensitivity of particular topics seem to require the European Union to examine and respond to them more quickly and effectively.
I am afraid that the practice will continue and will extend to topics the effective scope of which does not deserve such an investment in terms of human and material resources.
That does not seem to be the case with the Agency proposed here, which may be an asset to the sector if the principles guiding its establishment are taken into account.
I must, however, warn against the risk of centralisation and loss of powers by the Member States.
I believe they should retain their essential powers in this area without any undue imposition or regulation by the Agency, which should take particular care to comply with the principle of subsidiarity.
To that end, I believe it would have been beneficial if the draft report had unequivocally delimited its competences and the functions of each of its sections.
Â Â  .
UK Conservatives abstained on the vote on the creation of a centralised Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo in Spain for the following reasons: Firstly, the policy of centralising fisheries control is politically part of the integrationist agenda of the European Commission which as Conservatives we oppose.
Secondly, we accept that in the event of a Conservative government withdrawing from the CFP and returning fisheries management to local and national control many UK vessels will nevertheless continue to fish in EU waters out with the UK 200 mile limit.
In these circumstances, and accepting the fact that the Commission policy to create an EU Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo is a , it will be in British interest to a working relationship with this new body.
We therefore felt it was appropriate rather than opposing outright the proposal to abstain in this vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to explain why I did not support the amendments to paragraph 20.
It is important that we look at the idea of banning smoking in public places in the European Parliament.
We look to the European Commission to do something, but it is wrong at this stage to start talking about having exclusions for certain areas or little glass cabinets where people can smoke, because somebody has to clean those areas afterwards.
Workers have to clean them and I am not sure there is any evidence to show that such areas actually prevent smoke escaping.
We should not prejudice the debate at this stage.
Primary responsibility in this area lies with Member States.
Member States should conform with legislation, the Commission should help coordinate it and bring forward best practice.
Member States cannot escape their responsibilities by passing on to Europe things they are not sure they want to do at home.
I am very much against the idea of prejudicing the whole debate by deciding now what we are going to do.
Â Â  . â The Moderatedelegation in the European Parliament today voted in favour of the Ries report on the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004â2010.
In our opinion, it is wrong, however, of the European Parliament to call on the Commission to take the initiative on issues of lifestyle-related diseases or various measures against smoking.
Decisions on these issues fall within the competence of the Member States and should ultimately be taken primarily by individuals and not by politicians.
The Moderate Partyis of the opinion that the EU is an important tool in the pursuit of a better environment, but there are nevertheless limits to its responsibility.
The responsibility of the EU should only extend to those environmental issues that are clearly of a cross-border nature.
For this reason, it is wrong to call on the Commission to work, on the one hand, on eco-labelling of construction materials and, on the other, on drawing up lists of hazardous places of work and on setting up environmental ambulances.
Â Â  . â I voted for this report, which denounces the major downgrading in approach and ambition between the Commissionâs Environment and Health Strategy and what should be its implementation, the Action Plan.
Parliament considers that the Action Plan can at best be seen as a research plan, which does not in itself mitigate the problems of disease caused by environmental factors, at least not in the short term.
Of the examples mentioned, I must highlight the criticism that, of the thirteen actions set out in the Commission's Environment and Health Strategy for 2004-2010, only four are concerned with specific measures and none of them sets any targets, and the fact that there is no mention of the mental and neurological health impact of pollution.
One of the greatest omissions, however, is without doubt the lack of any evaluation of the consequences of current European Union policies, such as the common agricultural policy and the liberalisation policies that promote the privatisation of essential public services, subordinating them to the profit motive, as is happening with water.
Another omission is health in the workplace, particularly regarding hazardous locations and jobs.
Â Â  . I am supporting this report because of the amendment to Paragraph 6 of the original, discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
I understand the need to use the 'precautionary principle' to protect consumers from the possible long-term dangers of the phthalate family of chemicals including DEHP, but I represent a factory in Quedgeley, in Gloucestersire, Gambro, which has received the Queen's Award to Industry and has 120 employees.
This factory uses DEHP for devices that help control blood clotting.
People in such circumstances have to worry about the next 25 minutes rather than the next 25 years.
In those circumstances, the exception that allows DEHP and other phthalates to be used 'where such a restriction would have a negative impact on medical treatment' is entirely appropriate.
On that basis I will vote for the amended Ries report.
Â Â  . â The health effects of environmental pollution are of fundamental concern to society, and a broad commitment to this issue is important.
Consequently, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole. We disapprove, however, of its lack of emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity.
A European Environment Action Plan should only cover cross-border environmental issues.
Unfortunately, this is not the case with the present Action Plan.
We do not believe that the EU should be working on combating ill health caused by tobacco, alcohol, poor diet or lack of exercise (paragraphÂ 17), or that the Commission should be acting to put an end to smoking in enclosed areas (paragraphÂ 20).
The areas dealt with in the above paragraphs have an obvious impact on health, but are typical of issues in which the EU does not have competence and to which the principle of subsidiarity is applicable.
Nor do we believe that the principle of subsidiarity has been applied in paragraphÂ 28, which emphasises that particular attention should be paid to people living close to sources of pollution.
By way of conclusion, it is very important that the Commission, on the one hand, clarifies what total sums are to be released to fund the Action Plan and, on the other hand, explains whether it believes that a new financial instrument is required to fund it.
The costs of the Action Plan must be borne within the limits of the budget.
Â Â  . As a non-smoker, I am in favour of Amendment 4, which was â partly on my initiative â tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
This amendment would allow entrepreneurs in the catering industry to set up separate, and adequately ventilated, smoking areas.
In this respect, I should like to urge the Commission to leave scope for market-led initiatives to accommodate the problem of (passive) smoking in the catering industry.
Thanks to modern ventilation technology, the quality of indoor air can be raised to a level that is even higher than that of the air outdoors.
By imposing a statutory smoking ban from the top down, innovative initiatives of this kind are taken out of the market, and will take with them some of the dynamism from the economy.
Moreover, entrepreneurs as well as consumers, become restricted in their freedom of choice, so much so that I cannot reconcile this with the ideological principles that I as a Liberal uphold.
A European smoking ban will also have implications for employment in the tourism industry, as smokers are sufficiently well-informed about the dangers of smoking.
If there is a European smoking ban, what will the next ban be?
Alcohol, or fast food that results in obesity, driving cars, on account of road victims, or even sex, given that most people die in bed?
Â Â  . â I support the need to implement an action plan to evaluate and promote the environment and health with the focus on children.
The strategy governing this initiative, better known as SCALE â Science, Children, Awareness, Legal instruments, Evaluation â aims at implementing a transversal approach to this subject.
This is a matter of increasing concern to Europeâs citizens, above all because of the constant increase in four types of disease: respiratory diseases, asthma and childhood allergies; neurodevelopmental disorders; childhood cancer; and endocrine-disrupting effects.
In view of the situation, I endorse the intention to speed up and improve information exchange and communication procedures so that the actual causal relations between types of pollution and health can be made known more quickly and on a sounder basis.
The rapporteur invokes the precautionary principle to deny the need for absolute scientific proof that a particular product is dangerous before it is withdrawn from the market.
While I may even agree with the idea, I would, however, draw attention to the fact that interpretation of this principle by Community courts has been uneven and not always consistent, and it therefore really needs to be clarified.
Â Â  . â It is a fact that the Mediterranean is of strategic importance to the whole of Europe and that we need to develop a Mediterranean policy based on solidarity in order to act on the multiple shared challenges of peace, stability, terrorism, mutual understanding, the fight against trafficking in people, and the objective of creating a shared area of prosperity.
This must not, however, lead to increasing interference in the political life of individual countries, nor can it justify repressive and militaristic action that may have precisely the opposite effects to those declared, as certain recent experiences have already demonstrated.
The whole Mediterranean area is particularly sensitive and requires very special care, particularly with regard to the need to support peace in the Middle East, taking account of the defence of Palestinian interests and compliance with the corresponding UN resolutions.
That is why I distance myself from certain aspects of this resolution, which Parliament has adopted.
Â Â  . â It is the responsibility of the Member States to carry out control and inspection measures to implement the common fisheries policy (CFP) in their respective exclusive economic zones.
I am sceptical about the added value provided by the creation of a Community Fisheries Control Agency and believe that centralisation at that level conflicts with the Member Statesâ competences.
Indeed, it cannot be an accident that this regulation is appearing before the results of a feasibility study on the agency have been published.
I therefore voted against the report.
My position does not invalidate my belief that it is important to strengthen coordination among Member States in the area of control activities in order to ensure more uniform application of the CFP and to combat illegal fishing, and that we should increase the Community budget contribution to the investments that are needed to guarantee such control activities.
Without prejudice to questions of principle, I have to say that I disagree with the representativeness of the Administrative Board, its and the excessive influence that the Commission holds in it, particularly in the voting arrangements.
I also believe that, under the principle of co-management, the participation of the various representatives of the fisheries sector should be guaranteed.
Â Â  . â Europe must not ignore the lessons of history if it is to gain a clear understanding of its sphere and range of action.
It should not only realise that the âmiddle seaâ has always united more than it has separated, but it must also have the pragmatic desire to revitalise it as a major artery for political, commercial and cultural exchange.
While pointing out the aims and objectives that we have in common, I do not ignore the specific problems that affect a large part of the Mediterraneanâs southern rim.
I believe, however, that those problems should not merely be a cause of concern for their own peoples and leaders but, on the contrary, they need to be addressed through a programme coordinated and structured in conjunction with the European Union, within the neighbourhood policy that the EU is advocating.
In my view, some very positive measures have been adopted to that end, including the conversion of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum into the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly â an affirmation of a parliamentary political component which will make the interregional dialogue a permanent, institutional feature â and the declaration of 2005 as the âYear of the Mediterraneanâ by the Euro-Mediterranean Ministers of Foreign Affairs.
Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and the Commission statements on the 61st Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (Geneva, 14 March â 25 April 2005).
Â Â  Mr President, I too am grateful to the Council and Commission for being back here promptly for this debate which has overrun.
I only have enough speaking time to raise two issues.
The first is that of Colombia.
Human rights organisations and the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Human Rights defenders have expressed regret at the EU position on Colombia taken at the recent donors' meeting at Cartagena.
The EU has a special responsibility in negotiating on the Chair's Statement, and I hope the Council will confirm today that it will postpone producing a draft text until the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has produced recommendations for this year.
I hope that we in the EU will back those recommendations in full.
Second, last year's deferral for further consideration of the draft UN norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations must genuinely lead to action this year which will ensure that companies observe human rights obligations.
In this year, the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, minimum standards for companies are required which will reduce the number of victims of abuse across the world in future years.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we all agree that human rights are universal and indivisible and that they are also a measure of the quality of international relations.
That is why the European Union is committed to ensuring that respect for human rights is given the necessary priority, whether this is in the context of relations with China, Russia, Syria, Iran or North Korea, a list that is, of course, by no means exhaustive.
One of the problems in this debate is that definitions are sometimes blurred and can be manipulated for ideological reasons.
As regards the European Parliament's human rights resolution, it must not become a back door for a general liberalisation of abortion under the pretext of reproductive health; here, the protection of human life and dignity is at stake.
I would like to focus on just one case which is especially important as it concerns a country with which accession negotiations are scheduled to begin, namely Turkey.
However, this is not the main reason why I am raising this particular case.
Nor is it because it involves an Austrian citizen who was arrested and whose release may â thanks to the intervention of the Austrian authorities â be imminent.
The fact is that it could just as easily have been a citizen of another country.
What worries me, firstly, is that in Turkey, even today, the mere allegation of membership of a terrorist organisation is enough for an arrest warrant to be issued, even if the individual concerned has not committed any criminal act.
Secondly, I am also very concerned that arrest warrants issued by the State Security Court are still being executed, even though Turkey claims to fulfil the Copenhagen political criterion.
We all know that arrest warrants issued by this Court violate Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
If this case is symptomatic of legal practice in Turkey, neither the Commission nor the Council should proceed to the agenda.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I apologise for being a few minutes late.
On the subject of human rights, I believe that the views emphasised by the various speakers here in Parliament are to a large extent shared by the Council.
I would simply like to consider a few points and try to comment on them.
I think we all agree that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is not perfect, and that there are many criticisms that can be levelled at it.
Nevertheless, it has to be said that in the final analysis it is the only multilateral forum where human rights can be discussed on a truly worldwide scale, even if difficulties sometimes arise.
It is obvious, then, that the European Union should apply itself to improving the way in which the UN Commission operates.
We should play an active role in reforming its operation, and I believe that this is an extremely important point, in the context of the reform of the United Nations and of the multilateral system in general.
We are also aware that the handling of human rights issues in various countries sometimes forms part of a long-drawn process.
It is not possible to obtain rapid results, and that is why we need diversified approaches, working on different aspects.
I shall mention three examples, which have been commented on in detail in this House.
Firstly, there is Iran.
Of course, we could have a policy of confrontation with Iran over human rights issues, but the outcome of such a policy is still extremely uncertain.
However, in the general negotiating process â and heaven knows we are discussing highly sensitive and important issues with Iran â human rights have not been left out of the equation.
On the contrary, they occupy an important place.
Last week I had the opportunity to meet Iranâs Minister for Foreign Affairs, and we talked about human rights in a very specific way.
We clearly called for the reactivation of the group discussing human rights in Iran, and for the resumption of the dialogue with Iran on human rights in the context of the general relations which we wish to establish with that country.
I have some hopes that Iran will agree to reactivate that group.
For example, Iran has tried to obtain, in exchange, an assurance that there will not be any initiatives within the ECHR.
I do not believe that we can agree to that request: a deal is not possible.
However, what is important is that we have a dialogue with a country like Iran.
China was also mentioned.
I believe that the human rights dialogue with China is an extremely important aspect of our relations with that country.
As recently as this very afternoon, a meeting with China took place in Luxembourg on the subject of human rights.
We know that we are not going to modify, change or overthrow the Chinese system from one day to the next.
We have a long job ahead of us, but if we look for a moment at the situation in other parts of the world, we can see that this relentless, gradual but constant work on human rights can prove successful and produce results, and there are plenty of examples to demonstrate this.
The final example I should like to mention is Zimbabwe.
It is a very sad and tragic story, and it is not the only one in Africa â there are others.
However, in the case of Zimbabwe we have imposed sanctions which I would not describe as too lax, as someone did just now.
These are real sanctions.
We have even gone so far as to cancel an EU-Africa summit because of Zimbabwe, since we did not want the President of Zimbabwe to take part in that meeting.
We do not, therefore, have a weak and accommodating attitude towards that country.
We have made Zimbabwe the subject of strict observation as regards the elections which are due to be held there.
I do not think that we really have much hope that those elections will follow proper democratic procedures.
We shall therefore have to decide how we are going to continue our relations with this important country, and there are other countries in Africa which would be worth mentioning in this context.
Belarus has also been mentioned.
We have imposed sanctions on Belarus, a country which has to some extent isolated itself.
The question remains of whether, where human rights are concerned, we should isolate a country or seek to keep a minimum of dialogue open, especially in order to help those who are the first victims of restrictions on freedoms and human rights.
To conclude, I believe that Europe is making real, constant, active, but also diversified progress in the area of human rights, and we are not making this area a secondary priority as some people have said.
I believe that we want to play an important role and adopt a more global approach towards human rights.
Certain more specific rights have been mentioned, particularly in connection with multinational companies. That is why I believe that we should have a more innovative, yet multilateralist, conception of human rights.
I believe that Europe should show the way, working with others of course, but we must do so in order to achieve progress in this cause.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that human rights really do â and should â play a very important role, not only on the occasion of the sixty-first session, but also, of course, in general.
What is more, ladies and gentlemen, this is true at every summit or meeting which we hold with various countries.
Thus, on the occasion of the meeting with China in December last, we spoke a great deal about the human rights issue, and we are hopeful that China will ratify the international pact on civil and political rights.
I believe that it is also very important that these issues should always be on the agenda at our bilateral meetings too.
As Mr Schmit has already said, this does in fact happen.
The same is true of our new neighbourhood policy, about which President Yushchenko expressed a certain reticence today.
I have to tell you that I do not agree, and I said as much to him in Ukraine.
Although the neighbourhood policy we have designed is a gradual policy, it is also a policy which can bring countries together.
Ukraine is much closer to the European Union in the area of human rights and also in many other areas.
I am grateful to the Members of the European Parliament for the interest that they have shown.
I am also delighted to hear that a delegation of MEPs will be going to Geneva for the meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights next month, with the aim of facilitating various contacts.
The position expressed by Mrs Flautre, to the effect that our dialogue with a country is not incompatible with action within the United Nations, is a position entirely shared by the Commission and the Council.
This is why we have always clearly said that we would oppose any motions seeking to prevent a vote on any resolution, and have in fact done so.
This is the case with China.
The no motion vote forms part of the procedures of the Commission on Human Rights, but sometimes, unfortunately, it prevents us from working together.
I wish to continue in English.
I have listened with great interest to the comments about the situation of women, journalists and others in several countries.
It is very important that the Commission is active on human rights issues.
Let me say that the issue of human rights at the United Nations was also mentioned in the debate today.
We must look at the new ideas proposed by the different experts to the UN Panel.
There are some very interesting ideas.
One concerns the universalisation of membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights or, in the longer term, even the creation of a fully-fledged human rights council.
This is a very interesting idea and I feel we should support it.
The Commission is contributing to the internal reflection on all these issues.
It is still rather early in the process, as we are waiting for the report by the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, which will be submitted sometime around March.
However, I am convinced that the creation of a new human rights council would reinforce the credibility of the UN as regards human rights.
However, we must ensure that any UN reform process promotes respect for human rights, the promotion of humanitarian law, the rule of law and democracy, all of which are at the core of our peace-building response of the United Nations.
If we think of Iraq, we know that this is important.
Finally, it is important that we improve the efficiency of the whole human rights machinery.
The first speaker in the debate today, Mr Ribeiro e Castro, mentioned the broad scope of threats we face - for example, terrorism, organised international crime, trafficking, etc. I want to tell him that he is absolutely right that we must tackle these threats.
He has our full support.
I see these threats and the countermeasures to tackle them as a part of the human security concept.
This is a comprehensive concept of understanding of individual security, where, importantly, there are hard and soft threats.
The idea of freedom from need and freedom from fear are also important and both have to be eliminated.
Â Â  I have received one motion for a resolution to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The European Parliament must say a clear ânoâ to the export of arms to China.
I wonder whether a higher turnover for a few European arms manufacturers should mean that Europe has to give up its values and its ambitions to uphold human rights effectively in the world.
I believe that the Council of Ministers will take Parliamentâs stance to heart, and that it will abandon its pragmatic approach.
I would warn that Europe will otherwise lose its capacity to bring about positive developments in Asia and Africa.
What political tools will remain to Europe for the enforcement of human rights and social, ecological and trading standards?
Independent organisations have given evidence of the murder, persecution and abduction of ideological opponents in China.
This affects not only Falun Gong, but also Christians, Buddhists and others.
What credit will be due to an EU which breaks embargos, even though the reasons for which they were imposed are still valid?
The Union has still not carried out its own investigations into changes in access to human rights in China.
Is it also blind to the obvious infringement of rules on international trade and intellectual property?
What we are talking about here is also a safety hazard, after all; I can say this on the basis of my own experiences in the Czech Republic a couple of years ago.
Journalists revealed how arms were being exported to Congo, on which Europe had imposed an embargo.
This was due to a failure of politicians, who facilitated sales through the unreliable Zimbabwe, with the latter being happy to accept falsified end-user certificates.
We should remember that countries in which public control is not working - ...
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statement on the elections in Moldova.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the Presidency, I am very grateful to Parliament for the great attention that you are paying to the forthcoming elections in Moldova.
The Presidency is constantly and closely following developments in the political situation in that country, and in particular the preparation and conduct of the elections on 6 March.
The parliamentary elections in Moldova will also be observed by the OSCE.
The Moldovan Government invited international observers a long time in advance, and I hope that Members of the European Parliament will also take part in this observation mission.
As a future neighbouring country to the European Union, Moldova is of great importance to us.
You will not be unaware of the fact that the electoral process is giving rise to certain concerns, particularly as regards the position of the media and the way the opposition is treated.
The European Union examined all these issues with the Moldovan Government last autumn, during the visit of the Troika.
We clearly reaffirmed that democratic practices must be respected and that the elections must be free and fair.
More recently, on the subject of the elections, the European Union issued a declaration, the principal elements of which are as follows. The European Union reminded Moldova that its relations with the EU would depend on its commitment to common values.
This morning there has been a lot of talk about values and democracy in the Mediterranean context, and President Yushchenko has to some extent given us a master class in democracy and values.
It is therefore important that Moldova should rejoin Europe in this area too.
The European Union has appealed to the Moldovan authorities to ensure that these elections take place in an open and fair climate, that the media coverage of the election campaign is pluralist and impartial, and that the State administration remains neutral towards all candidates and their supporters.
The Union has also asked the authorities to ensure that the votes of expatriates are treated properly and impartially.
Finally, the Union has appealed to the Moldovan Government to take into account the concerns raised by the OSCEâs fact-finding mission and to implement the joint recommendations established by the OSCE and the Venice Commission in 2004.
Last but not least, the issue was examined at the meeting of the EU-Moldova Cooperation Council held on 22Â February in Brussels.
Democratic reforms and the holding of free and fair elections are also important components of the EU-Moldova Action Plan adopted by the Cooperation Council in the context of the European neighbourhood policy.
The action plan also refers to the subject of human rights in the context of our neighbourhood policy, a fact which was emphasised by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
I can assure you, Mr President, that the Presidency will be closely following the electoral process in Moldova, which is an important step in the European future of that country, which is now faced with the choice of demonstrating that it is ready, one day, to rejoin the family of Europe.
Â Â  .
Mr President, yesterday we had a EU Cooperation Council in which the new neighbourhood policy and the action plan for Moldova was adopted.
We also had an excellent frank and open dialogue in which I personally participated.
As my colleague pointed out, we clearly said that if Moldova really wants to get closer to the European Union then it is very important for it to also demonstrate that interest.
I think that the elections which are to be held very soon, on 6 March, will be an excellent moment to show what is really going on.
Moldova really has to promote respect for human rights.
It has to promote and empower civil society, it has to strengthen the independence of the media, and it has to ensure better follow-up of the Council of Europe's recommendations.
I said all of that to them personally.
We all agree that a vibrant democracy, a respect for the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free and independent media are necessary if it wants to promote the stability and prosperity of the country.
Since independence in 1991, Moldova has had a rather good record of free and fair elections.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and ODIHR, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, confirmed in its report on Moldova that the last two parliamentary elections did indeed meet international standards.
To Moldova's credit very few elections in the newly independent states had been assessed in such a positive way.
However, the OSCE's assessment of local elections since 2001 have reported that, unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated.
The organisation noted shortcomings in the context of local government elections held in May and June 2003, including abuse of administrative resources, heavy bias of state media in favour of the incumbents and the arrest of prominent candidates.
Reports on the October 2002 elections for the Governor of Gagauzia, an Autonomous Territorial Unit, also noted similar shortcomings.
In the run-up to the 2005 parliamentarian elections we are concerned that one of the joint recommendations, made by the OECE and Council of Europe Venice Commission, for improvements to the election legislation and administration have not really been completely implemented.
Other reasons for concern include also the apparent lack of confidence in the central election commission, problems with the accuracy of voter registers, reported abuse of the administrative resources by the authorities, control by the ruling party and government of the public media, and pressure on the private media.
In addition, up to one fourth of Moldova's population might not be able to cast their votes.
This includes Moldovan citizens living abroad, or in Transnistria.
Yesterday we heard from the government that there had also been some disturbances in the electoral process coming from outside the country.
That is how they described it and I think we have to ensure that we observe these elections very carefully.
As a result, the Commission has given funding for 25 specially named commissioners for this election observation, going into the OSCE/ODIHR mission.
It is important to know that this will not be an easy task and we should remain very vigilant.
I also welcome the visit to Moldova in January of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Mr Terry Davis, and the launch of the OSCE's election observation mission.
I shall take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the very good work of this Council of Europe and OSCE support team.
We are in regular contact with our mission and, as I said, we are contributing EUR 50 000.
This was mentioned again yesterday.
I think the Moldovan delegation that wants to move towards Europe has shown great interest in trying to comply with the standards, but there is also some concern about the influences that might come from outside.
Again, I hope that Parliament, together with the Commission, follows events very closely as it may prove crucial to do so.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is examining issues relating to Moldova today, because Moldova is a small country that is somewhat overlooked by Europe.
It is a country with a rich history, and a country where there have been clashes between ethnic and national interests, as well as cultural, religious, economic and political differences.
Moldova is the point at which East meets West and Christianity meets Islam, and the point at which the interests of different rulers and powers have intersected throughout history.
Moldovaâs situation today is also difficult and complex.
We must remember that this is a country that, following the collapse of the USSR, experienced a tragic war in the Transnistria area.
This conflict has still not been finally resolved.
Moldova is currently struggling with many economic and social problems.
This sensitive region needs stability for the good of our entire continent.
Stability can only be safeguarded by full democracy, the rule of law and respect for human and civil rights.
Democracy cannot be imposed, it can only be supported, and this is our responsibility to Moldova today.
The elections on 6 March 2005 will be an important test of the extent to which the democratisation process has progressed, and of the extent to which the common good will prevail over individual interests.
These elections will determine whether Moldovaâs key economic, educational, and social problems will be successfully resolved.
These elections may open a new phase of development, and thus also give rise to the implementation of the strategy adopted last year for future membership in the European Union.
The elections will also set new challenges for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, judging from the Council and the Commission, the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council, it is clear that all of us â by which I mean the three institutions â have to give Moldova, the Moldovan Government, a joint signal in the run-up to the elections of 6 March, and that is also the very objective of todayâs debate and of the resolution which we in this House will undoubtedly be adopting by a large majority tomorrow.
Next Sunday, the Moldovan people will be able to have their say about the composition of a new parliament, and that is, of course, an important day for that country, for those elections will also result in a new national government.
I personally think that the poor shape Moldova itself is in will set the tone for the election campaign, because that countryâs development over the past year does not really instil hope.
It has now become Europeâs poorest country.
To us, I think that there are two other issues of key importance.
Firstly, there is the issue of Transnistria and the quest for a solution to the unacceptable situation in that part of Moldova.
I think that only a government with democratic legitimacy will have the authority to facilitate, and get involved in, new initiatives.
There is now room for this.
This morning, President Yushchenko made a clear statement about the new Ukrainian Governmentâs willingness to help find a solution, and this is where Ukraineâs help is absolutely necessary.
What I think matters, though, is that the elections should result in a government possessing the authority to help find solutions.
In addition, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, that countryâs future orientation is an important topic, and by and large, the parties seem to be agreed on the need for it to draw closer to Europe and to the European Union.
Needless to say, we would warmly welcome a new government in ChisinÄu setting course for Europe, and the action plan agreed upon with Moldova in the framework of the neighbourhood policy offers the concrete framework for this.
Cooperation and political relations with the European Union cannot be improved, however, unless the Moldovan Governmentâs mandate is based on an entirely democratic expression of the popular will; if not, it will be difficult to have dealings with that country in the years ahead.
A government that has been legitimised by the population is the EUâs first contact and when that government opts for a credible European course, it can count on the EUâs support.
When, however, the elections fail to meet democratic standards, that casts a shadow over future cooperation.
A democratic and credible regime and leadership are a for European involvement.
That is why we urge the present government to make every effort to ensure that the elections and the campaigns be conducted fairly and openly, and that is why balanced access to the media must be guaranteed across the political divide.
For the rest, I would concur with what the Commissioner said in this respect, and we also greatly appreciate the Commissionâs commitment to those elections.
Â Â  . Commissioner, Luxembourg Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, Moldova is the EU's least developed neighbour, and in addition to serious underdevelopment it also suffers from a number of other problems and serious burdens.
In addition to being the least developed country in Europe, Moldova does not have control over the whole of its own territory.
Its railway system is broken in two.
Foreign military units are deployed on its territory against its will.
Everything can be found there, including the worst forms of international crime and trafficking in weapons, drugs and human beings.
The country has serious problems, but its people know how to live and survive in desperate economic circumstances as this is what they have to do.
More than half the population is forced to survive on two dollars a day, and a fifth live on one dollar a day.
If this is not a miracle, then there is no such thing as a miracle.
For them there truly can be none.
We must be, and are, in solidarity with them.
We all nurture hope in the expectation of democratic and economic changes.
There will be elections in Moldova on 6 March, the results of which could increase our mutual cooperation and bring Moldova closer to the European Union.
Romania is becoming a member of the European Union, there have been great changes in Ukraine, and we hope that they will also succeed in their wishes and that the wheels of development and democracy will begin to turn faster in Moldova.
I wish that the Ukrainian president had used his speech today to encourage our friends in Moldova, because the Ukrainian example has demonstrated that outside interference does not help and cannot stop history.
We wish them success as well as new and better opportunities to make progress, and we look forward to working with them after the elections.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Republic of Moldova is a country which is often forgotten about in Europe.
It is a country rarely mentioned in lists of examples or in key speeches, yet its fate is closely bound up with the European Union.
Only when the Transnistria conflict is resolved and Moldova can genuinely protect its own borders once more will it have the chance to develop economically.
We know that Moldova is the poorest country in Europe and that its young people are leaving in droves.
That is why the resolution of this conflict is also important for us, and democratic elections are essential for this process.
Democracy-building and successful economic development in Moldova will increase the European Union's security as well.
I am pleased, therefore, that the Commission, the Council and MrÂ Solana have also finally understood â and I emphasise the word 'finally' â that a solution to the Transnistria conflict is a key security issue for Europe and that we must do all we can to move this process forward.
Nonetheless, and I emphasise this point again too, democratic development in Moldova is the responsibility of its parties, government and administration.
It is they who must now ensure that the elections are free and fair and take place without ballot-rigging, so that a government can be founded on trust and become a significant interlocutor for the EU.
That is the signal which will set the Republic of Moldova on course towards the European Union.
Â Â  I agree with most of what has been said by previous speakers.
I too share their concerns with regard to the need for a calming of the situation in Moldova, and for closer cooperation with this European country.
The Commissioner has mentioned several problems relating to the elections.
We discussed these problems yesterday when preparing our resolution, and I believe that the motion before the House is an acceptable compromise.
As regards the problem of the media, I have information from sources provided by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe that there has nonetheless been a shift.
Roughly half of broadcasting time in the state-owned media is allocated to the opposition and half to the ruling parties, with this rising to one to twenty in favour of the opposition in the private media.
It also seems that the problems relating to voting by students have been resolved, since they will be able to vote both at their places of residence and at their places of study.
There has also been a shift with regard to identification documents, as extensions have been granted both for passports from the Soviet era and for those about to expire.
In conclusion, it seems to me that progress has been made, and that there are no obstacles that could prevent the elections taking place democratically and transparently.
It will, however, be up to us to monitor this.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in one year, nine months and eight daysâ time Moldovaâs neighbour, Romania, will become a member of the European Union.
When discussing the political situation in Moldova, we should therefore remember that we are talking about democracy or the lack thereof in a country that will soon be a neighbour of the Union.
If it is said when discussing Iraq and Iran that they will be neighbours of the European Union following Turkeyâs entry into the Union in around 20 years, we should take an even greater interest in the Unionâs present neighbours, such as Ukraine and Belarus, or Moldova, which will be our neighbour in the near future.
The elections that will take place in Moldova in 11 days will not be entirely credible if there continues to be no fair election campaign preceding them.
At present there is no such campaign, and no sign of there being one.
Yet elections without campaigns are like a fish out of water, and we must therefore judge the Moldovan authorities not only on whether they observe procedures on the day of the elections, but also on whether they ensure that a normal campaign takes place.
At the same time, we should not forget that the elections in this country have an international context, whether we like it or not.
Â Â  Mr President, Moldova is a small landlocked country, the poorest in Europe, whose importance to the EU will rise as our frontiers will border it by 2007.
It is also the location of a frozen conflict in its breakaway territory of Transnistria, under Russian military protection since 1991, following a bloody secessionist conflict.
This territory is a haven for gansterism, smuggling and money laundering and corrupts the local authorities around the Odessa oblast in Ukraine.
President Voronin, whom I met a year ago, in spite of being a Communist and ethnically Russian, is committed to EU and NATO approximation for his country after a row with President Putin, who failed to withdraw Russian troops by 2002 from Transnistria, as agreed.
I have no doubt that the parliamentary elections on 6Â March, although far from perfect in terms of media bias in the run-up and the monopoly of administrative resources, will not be subject to the kind of fraud seen under Prime Minister Yanukovych in neighbouring Ukraine, which sparked off the famous Orange Revolution.
The European Parliament, the parliamentary assemblies of the Council of Europe and NATO, as well as OSCE/ODIHR presence in Moldova, with Romanian and Ukrainian help, will prevent such a scenario.
The new parliament must help Romania, Ukraine, Russia, the USA and the EU get together with the Moldovan Government to solve the Transnistria problem.
Reassurances of strong safeguards for Slav minorities must be given, probably along with a form of devolved government to the territory, which, after all, has never been part of historic Bessarabia or been Romanian speaking and which Stalin annexed cruelly to create Moldova 60 years ago.
I personally would start by advocating tightening of the sanctions against Tiraspol by asking President Yushchenko of Ukraine, who was here this morning, to further demonstrate his independence from Moscow by preventing Mr Smirnov and his 16 cronies from travelling to Ukraine as the EU has already done with the visa ban.
I would also ask the Council to bring in a policy to prevent any aircraft landing in EU territory having taken off from Tiraspol military airport, thus ensuring they all fly out of Chisinau, where they can be openly inspected for smuggling, including arms trafficking.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, since the Orange Revolution, the European Parliament has been paying more and more attention to its neighbours in the east.
Todayâs resolution confirms that the bold decision, made on 13 January, to offer EU membership to Ukraine was not made hastily.
The Moldova resolution is well balanced.
We both confirm our support and indicate our understanding of complex situation in the region.
Moldovaâs territorial integrity has been breached: contrary to the wishes of the democratically elected government, foreign troops â the Russian army â are stationed there.
By the way, it is ironic that today, 23 February, is the day that the Soviet Unionâs vassal states, Estonia and Moldova included, were for decades required to celebrate as Soviet Army and Navy Day.
The European Union is ready to support the Moldovans, both in the process of European integration and in the restoration of their territorial integrity.
The European Union, within the framework of the European Securityand Defence Policy â ESDP â must also be prepared to support border control between the Moldovan separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine.
Todayâs speech in Parliament by the Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko gives us cause to believe that Ukraine considers the solution of the Transnistria problem to be a serious issue.
The democracy of the Moldovan elections does not just depend on how the votes are counted.
The elections are not democratic unless all political parties have fair and equal access to the media during the election campaign.
I am referring here to Teleradio Moldova airtime.
At the same time, opportunities for election advertising, both on the streets and in the media, must be made available.
This is the minimum; without this, we cannot declare the elections on 6 March to be democratic.
The European Union must be prepared to treat Moldova on equal terms with Ukraine.
I do not see any reasons why the European Parliament should not support Moldovaâs European Union membership prospects during the democratic and economic reform processes.
The first Copenhagen criterion â democracy â is, of course, a prerequisite for Europeâs support and cooperation, but the other two â a free market economy and the rule of law â are equally essential for Moldova.
A clear position regarding these issues is necessary if we are to be honest with ourselves, with Europe, and with the Moldovans.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schmit, the President of Ukraine has summed it up very aptly today.
The principle that his country associates with Europe is democracy â and the democrats in the Republic of Moldova are looking to us as well.
What they want from us is not only a commitment to them as Europeans, but also a clear signal over and above the neighbourhood strategy.
That is why I believe that â especially in the light of events in its neighbour, Ukraine â we must offer Moldova a clearer perspective.
With the Thessaloniki strategy, the EU mapped out a course for the countries of the Western Balkans.
What about the countries that are only now shrugging off the shackles of the past?
Ukraine has set a precedent.
It is to be hoped that the Republic of Moldova will follow suit on 6 March, and even Belarus will in future have no option but to embark on the path towards democracy.
What we need now is a Thessaloniki strategy for these three countries.
It is an anachronism that the Republic of Moldova is the only country in the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe to have no prospect of accession to the European Union.
It would be splendid if, very soon, this House could welcome a democratically elected President from the Republic of Moldova who is genuinely committed to democratic politics.
At the moment, that is not the case, as I saw for myself during my visit to Chisinau ten days ago.
If, though, there is to be a European Republic of Moldova, the election on 6 March must be democratic.
We appeal to our European friends in the Republic of Moldova to go and vote, to vote for democracy, and to make the Republic of Moldova freer, more democratic and more European so that this House can very soon bid their country welcome.
Â Â  â Mr President, the predominantly Romanian-speaking area that used to be referred to as Bessarabia, and is currently known as Moldova, alternated between being Romanian and Russian.
It would never have existed as a state had it not been for the pact between Stalin and Hitler that redrew the Soviet Unionâs western borders on the eve of the Second World War.
Both in the Romanian-speaking sector to the west of the Dniestr and in the Slavic sector to the east, there is shared nostalgia for the kind of society that existed in the days of the Soviet Union.
All those circumstances are not the ideal foundation for democracy, tolerance, transparency and pluriformity.
They can result in the different peoples seeking a regime whose authoritarianism is directed against those perceived as being opponents.
One cannot therefore exclude the possibility the elections being as flawed as were last yearâs in Ukraine and Belarus.
That is why it is important for us now to express our desire that Europeâs poorest country should have normal parliamentarian democracy, with equal rights and opportunities for all parties taking part in the elections on 6 March.
Â Â  âThank you Mr President.
As we know, on 6 March Parliamentary elections will take place in Moldova, which I hope to be able to observe as a member of the European Parliament's delegation of election observers.
However, today I would also like to express my concern about the pre-election situation in Moldova.
The situation in Moldova is complicated above all because to this day the Transnistria problem remains unresolved.
Neither the international community nor even the European Union have yet been able to persuade Russia to keep its 1999 Istanbul Commitments and withdraw its army from Transnistria.
Transnistria has become a region involved in money laundering, and the manufacturing and illegal export of arms.
This in turn, either directly or indirectly, serves organised crime and international terrorism.
Today, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner expressed concern about the environment of the forthcoming elections, about the influence which some have been trying to exert from outside for some time.
Yesterday Moldova's Prime Minister Tarlev spoke about this at a press conference in Brussels and today the world's news agencies are speaking about it.
In conclusion I would like to express the hope, that the European Union and international community will not be impotent and that the European Union will not only observe the elections and monitor the situation, but will take concrete steps to help Moldova's democratic forces and will not allow the situation in that country to become unstable.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike certain fellow Members, I think that Parliament is welcoming and feels close to the Moldovan people and in particular to their efforts to put in place a complete democratic system and achieve greater civil progress.
We are united by strong ties and by common interests and we wish to pursue the cooperation already underway in the framework of the neighbourhood programme.
We are taking note of what happens, of the contradictions and the delays, but also of the positive action carried out by political and social bodies, institutions and associations, in particular secular and Catholic associations, which are fighting to defend the inviolable rights of children and to combat the trafficking of girls forced into prostitution.
There is a two-fold issue that we must address: human rights and political rights.
From this point of view, the forthcoming elections on 6Â March are an important occasion and it is right to call for them to take place with the greatest transparency to ensure the fullest participation possible.
I believe it is right and proper also to call on the governments and the States where large numbers of Moldovan citizens live, including Italy, to provide the practical means for thousands of Moldovan immigrants to fully exercise their right to vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, the peoples do not need instructions or recommendations and, more to the point, they are not under surveillance to ensure they choose the governments they want.
It is unacceptable for the European Union and the European Parliament to intervene repeatedly in the internal affairs of other countries.
In the case of Moldova, hypocrisy about the democratic process really does exceed all limits.
If anything has to be denounced, it is the open intervention of the United States of America with funding of USD 1.7 million for the organisation, which supports the so-called opposition to the present government.
This is the big problem of foreign intervention in the internal affairs of Moldova.
The stand of the United States of America, which acknowledges precisely this intervention, is provocative.
They protested through its embassy, accusing the government of Moldova, and this protest was of course also signed by the embassies of large European countries.
None of the motions tabled has the courage to refer to this problem.
You are not interested in democracy or genuine democratic elections.
You want to subjugate Moldova.
Finally, today is 23 February, the anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army and honour should be paid to the millions of Red Army soldiers and officers killed during the Second World War in order to crush fascism.
Â Â  . Mr President, I think this debate has shown that Moldova is not the forgotten country of Europe.
It has shown that we are interested in this country which, in spite of everything, is a little behind compared with general development in Europe, in other words development towards greater democracy and also development towards economic and social reform, the fight against corruption and the fight against trafficking in human beings, all subjects which are very important in this context.
I believe that the lesson which we can draw from this debate, and on which Parliament, the Council and the Commission all agree, is, as someone has already said, to send a strong signal to Moldova, to the effect that it must not miss a historical opportunity in the wake of the events in Ukraine.
I believe that this message should be transmitted clearly and firmly to the Moldovan authorities, not only with the elections in mind, but after the elections too.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has spoken about the European neighbourhood policy.
By means of that policy, by means of our action plan, we must put pressure on the Moldovan authorities, the authorities currently in power but also those who will be in power tomorrow, so as to ensure that these reforms really are carried out and that they really do have some substance to them.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Transnistria has been an issue in the debate here today, and is an issue on the ground.
We talked about it at length yesterday.
As Austrian Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson-in-office in 2000 I tried hard to find a solution to the Transnistrian problem.
At the time there was a .
Prime Minister Primakov had been nominated by Russia and there was a chance to get somewhere.
However, immediately afterwards, this question unfortunately erupted again and no solution has been found.
Therefore, I am very happy about the Secretary-General's new special representative, because it is very important to go further.
This was said yesterday.
We must do everything we can via our action plan, but we must also find a solution to this very difficult problem.
I will be going to Moldova shortly after the election, as soon as a new government has been formed.
I said this yesterday at our meeting and I can also officially announce today that the Commission will open a new delegation there.
If we want a new neighbourhood policy, then the time is now.
It is important and I hope that I can combine my visit with the opening of such a delegation.
Moldova is the poorest country in Europe today.
But let us not to go too far.
Let us act.
Rhetoric and vision are necessary, but it is even more necessary to look at the complexity of the situation.
I know the country because I went there many times in my former capacities.
Many things need to be done.
The action plan is appropriate to that.
Please look at the action plan.
I have heard that some people want to go beyond the action plan, but this is not the time for that.
It is now the time for the neighbourhood policy to bring these countries closer to the European Union.
However, it is a question of give and take.
These countries also have to accept the helping hand we are stretching out to them.
Â Â  At the end of the debate, I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, all initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and hunger are worthy of support.
Rich countries and supranational organisations with significant financial resources, such as the European Union, bear a special responsibility in this respect.
In order to reduce hunger effectively, there must be an appropriate hierarchy of spending in the budgets of all countries.
Priority should be given to measures that promote a pro-family policy, understood in the broadest sense of the word, in order to ensure that everyone has adequate conditions in which to live and develop. It is an unfortunate fact that large sums of money are still being wasted, as they are earmarked for measures that directly and indirectly attack the family and those who are weakest and poorest.
It is reprehensible to treat poor persons and backward regions as though they were objects, by means of showy and sham aid measures aimed at broadening the spheres of influence of the modern superpowers. It is shameful to enslave poor countries by means of usurious financial systems.
Ladies and gentlemen, the following teachings of the Holy Father John Paul II should be an inspiration and source of strength to us in the fight against world hunger and poverty; âmillions of our brothers and sisters are suffering from hunger, and many are dying of it, especially children. In an age of unprecedented technological development, the tragedy of starvation is a great challenge and a great indictment.
After all, the earth has enough resources to feed all of humankind.
Why then are millions of people dying of starvation today? What is needed is a serious and worldwide examination of conscience regarding social justice and basic human solidarity.
We would do well to remember the basic truth that the earth belongs to God, and all the riches it contains have been placed by God in manâs hands to use in a just fashion, so they can serve the good of all. The very law of nature bears testimony to this.
Our common cry for bread on behalf of all who are suffering from hunger must not fail to be heard. We address it first of all to God, but we also address it to the politicians and economists, upon whom rests the responsibility for a just distribution of goods, on both a global and a national level.
We must finally put an end to the scourge of hunger.
May solidarity prevail over the unrestrained desire for profit. Upon each one of us there rests a small part of the responsibility for this injustice.
Each one of us in some way has first-hand experience of the hunger and poverty of others. Let us learn to share our bread with those who have noneâ.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the light of these teachings by the Pope we must revise our current political activities, all the more so because the problem of hunger is affecting an ever increasing number of citizens of the European Union.
More than five million people in Poland are already living in extreme poverty.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  Mr President, during my two minutes speaking time 40 people will die of hunger: 3.5Â seconds per person; 24 000 people per day; 9 million every year; 400 million in the past 50 years â 3 times the number of people killed in all the world wars of the last century.
We talk, we debate, we wring our hands. What we do not do is do something about it.
