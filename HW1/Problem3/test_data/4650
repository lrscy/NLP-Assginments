I should also like to place on record a protest at the absolute lack of interest shown by many Arab countries in these peoples, a large part of them Muslim.
While Europe and the West took action, those extremely wealthy nations, those multi-billionaire countries and regimes that profess Islam excelled in their parsimony.
Â Â  Mr President, I first wish to join with others in offering my sympathy to the people of South-East Asia who have been so badly affected by this awful tragedy.
We are still seeing pictures and videos of what happened and it is still hard for us to comprehend the massive scale of destruction and the loss of human life.
The reaction from the citizens of Europe and other parts of the world has been absolutely outstanding: people have really shown their humanity to the people affected.
The amount of money that has been privately donated has been extraordinary.
The response of the governments around the world has also been good.
A number of things have been mentioned.
One is that it is very important to use military and civil resources as soon as possible â as the United States has done â in this disaster.
They can be first out there to address these awful problems.
I also wish to say, as have other speakers, that, after the meeting on Monday night, I am not completely convinced by President Barroso's position on the resources.
Resources should not come from existing budgets and from money that has been promised; there have to be new resources.
We have to show the people that we are serious about this and we have to ensure that what happened in areas like Iran and Afghanistan does not reoccur in terms of how we ...
Â Â  Mr President, the earth moved, tragedy struck and our world changed.
The awesome pictures of that mighty sea consuming the land and crushing people, homes and landmarks were terrifying and terrible.
The world was shocked by the fate of human beings, the suffering of survivors and the plight of orphans.
In Europe we are mourning thousands of our own citizens, but with admiration for and gratitude to the local people who, despite their own loss and pain, found the courage and compassion to care for bewildered and frightened foreign tourists.
The earth moved and the public were moved. The first to act were not governments, but people.
People across the world opened their hearts and opened their purses, shaming governments into matching the monies their peoples had given.
Now we demand real, lasting and effective action.
Humanitarian and reconstruction aid must be given and used with transparency and accountability, and debt systems reformed.
Our actions must help to bring peace, support good governance and human rights, involve local people and overcome poverty.
Promises must be kept and we must develop the early warning systems which, as we now know, are already available in the form of the underground testing systems based in Vienna.
Above all, Europe must now respond to the new public mood which demands that the divisions of our world must be healed through a determined combating of poverty and disease and the removal of barriers that have stopped poorer countries trading in our markets.
The people of our world have never felt closer.
Surely our governments â north and south â and our European Union, can build on that.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express our horror, our condolences, our solidarity and our commitment to contribute to alleviating the effects of this disaster.
The suggestions of the Socialist Group appear in the joint resolution, which we will vote for with conviction and which can be summed up in seven points.
Firstly, the positive assessment of the appropriate actions of the Council and the Commission, which reacted immediately to the disaster and committed the necessary resources and informed Parliament â although it is noted that there has been a lack of information and communication with society, which may have led some Members to conclude that there has been nobody on the ground, when in fact there has been admirable action.
Secondly, the resources promised by everybody must be produced immediately and, in any event, according to a set timetable.
Thirdly, all of the European Unionâs resources must be fresh money, and in no event must they be taken from other programmes; President Barrosoâs arguments have not been convincing in this regard.
Fourthly, the commitment to follow emergency actions with the essential reconstruction actions, in agreement with the main protagonists; the countries affected.
Fifthly, the commitment to implement an early warning system capable of preventing similar disasters.
Sixthly, the commitment also to implement a reaction mechanism for disasters of a permanent and professional nature, able to intervene in the event that prevention does not succeed.
And there is an important point of reference in the Constitution in the form of the creation of a corps of humanitarian aid volunteers.
Seventhly, these actions must not all be the result of impromptu actions, of coalitions made up of arbitrary groups of countries, but they must be the result of mobilisation within the framework of the United Nations, and with the active and visible participation of the European Union.
The European Union, Mr President, must be a match for this disaster and for the mobilisation demonstrated by our societies.
Â Â  Mr President, there is no doubt that the huge number of deaths resulting from this disaster essentially reflect the enormous vulnerability of the peoples of the region.
I therefore believe we have a responsibility, which at the same time is an opportunity.
I am talking about dealing seriously with the issue of the debts of the countries affected.
Furthermore, in some cases, this debt was taken on by corrupt and dictatorial governments, such as the Indonesia of Suharto, which were given money in an unscrupulous manner, leading to what to today is known as the debt of hate.
Certain donors, therefore, have a responsibility that should firstly be investigated and then met.
There is a twin opportunity here: while, on the one hand, it is extremely urgent that we cancel that debt immediately â not as an act of compassion, but as recognition of the fact that the people who have already suffered as a result of irresponsible regimes should not have to suffer all over again by having to pay off their debts â on other hand, international aid must be based fundamentally on donations and not on new loans which increase the burden of that debt even further.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the tragedy in Asia is still inconceivable for many of us.
We are all in mourning, irrespective of nationality, and our sympathy grows out of this solidarity.
Let us make use of this feeling of solidarity in order to choose better priorities in future.
Environmental researchers maintain that the disaster could have been avoided, if not completely then in part â with far fewer casualties and material damage â if the coral reefs and mangrove forests had been left in place.
If human safety, instead of military security, had been the main priority, we should probably not have been forced to see so much death and destruction as we have now.
If governments had carried out some sort of objective analysis of what threatened not only their own countries but the planet and the whole of humanity and had prepared themselves for these threats, then warning systems would have been in place and the emergency work would have been better planned.
Large and wealthy powers are prepared to conduct wars, including nuclear wars, at a couple of minutesâ notice.
There is no notice or warning for poor people in Asia, however.
In the meantime, the world spends grotesque sums on its war against terrorism â a small problem in terms of the number of lives lost â and on a war that, as matters now stand, merely produces more terrorism.
Is no serious attention devoted to the problems of poverty and to ecological security?
Let us learn our lesson one day.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean is in many ways a turning point in the history of the modern world.
For the first time, we have had a genuine wave of sympathy for people from, in general, the whole world, and not just a part of it, who have been affected.
Cynics point out that this has to do with the fact that the area around the Indian Ocean contained so many tourists from rich countries who were also affected when the disaster happened.
That is true, but it must be remembered that this, at the same time, shows that tourism, like trade in goods and services, in actual fact brings the people of the world together and makes us realise that we belong together.
I nonetheless feel uncomfortable about the fact that, in this case, the EU seems mainly to be interested in promoting its own stances in connection with this tragedy which, upon examination, reveals that what are needed are warning systems, not the EU.
It is a global issue, and one that is principally for the UN.
Money does not need to be channelled via the EU; it should come directly from the relevant countries and people.
The issue is one of coordinating operational aid, and that is the main task of the UN.
What task remains?
That of rapid intervention to evacuate citizens of EU countries.
In this case, the problem was not that the EU had no policy but that some countries, such as Italy, implemented this very well while other countries, such as my own, implemented it badly.
We must not try to use tragedies for EU purposes, but look to see what the EU in actual fact has to contribute, presumably in terms of consular services.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, last week I had the opportunity of meeting with people from countries hit by the disaster and today I should like to voice those people's concerns.
Firstly, they are concerned that the funds pledged will, in actual fact, not be made available.
Secondly, they wish to rebuild through their own efforts the lives and natural resources that have been destroyed.
Thirdly, people are afraid that assistance will disappear into the donors' bureaucracy.
As a representative of a new Member State I can understand this, as aid that had been granted to us was sometimes diverted into the coffers of the donors' own consultants.
What can we do to dispel these concerns?
Firstly, I should like to stress the difference between aid given to Africa, for example, where severe and long-term structural problems need to be resolved and where it is sometimes difficult to absorb resources, and the region now hit by the disaster, where people need rapid and immediate assistance, where ordinary economic life needs to be rebuilt, where people know how to work and know what needs to be done.
Therefore, in the first instance, European aid must be unbureaucratic and should be awarded also in the form of small grants, for example, directly for the reconstruction of small fisheries, tourism and other types of activities.
Secondly, given that the UN has the main coordinating role, Parliament should hear the UN's opinion at the next session, on both the situation and the use of aid.
Â Â  â Mr President, as Vice-Chairman of the delegation to ASEAN, I should like to express my sympathies with the families of the victims in South-East Asia, and also to the families of the victims who came from Europe.
We can be proud of the substantial amount that the European Union is preparing to remit to the countries in South-East Asia, an amount decided on at the Geneva donorsâ conference.
Nevertheless, last weekâs joint meeting in Brussels of the development, foreign affairs and budget committees gives us reason to fear that this is simply a matter of deploying funds allocated to development.
Although the decision has been taken to mobilise EURÂ 100Â million from the emergency aid reserve, we do not at present know what will be the actual share of reallocated credits and that of the funds that have just been raised.
As it is obvious that Europe will not be able to increase its aid, it must therefore concentrate its efforts on making the best possible use of it, by directing it towards the coordination of its own responsibilities, namely sanitary and medical projects, the restoration of infrastructure and reconstruction.
It is also important that such coordination of sanitary projects on the ground, alongside the UNâs agencies, should be accompanied by follow-up aid, especially in the countries riven by conflicts, and by the coordination of civil and military assets, particularly for the purposes of reconstruction.
This is where, in order to deal with natural disasters, which are unfortunately becoming more and more frequent, it would be desirable to pool to some degree European capacities for civil protection, an option open to all the Member States and involving interoperable and rapidly-deployable joint teams.
Moreover, alongside direct aid and the analysis of what has just occurred, we cannot do without careful consideration of how to prevent it occurring again.
Europe could propose, at the Kobe conference, the use of the World Environment Fund to develop civil security units or even to set up a fund for voluntary contributions towards an early warning system, such as exists in the Indian Ocean.
Let me conclude by saying that I think that the worldwide impetus generated by this unprecedented disaster makes it necessary for the developed countries, today, to give consideration to the rescheduling of these countriesâ debts across the board.
Â Â  Mr President, the heavenly feeling I had on Sunday morning, while having breakfast on the Indian coast, later turned to horror when I set off for the hinterland and saw the images of violence and destruction that Sundayâs killer had left in its wake.
Many days later, it turned out that 150Â 000 people had been killed and 2 million made homeless.
The EUR 475 million from the EU is a serious contribution for Asia and for African countries, but as Mr Deva and Mrs Mathieu stated, we see it as unacceptable that some of those funds should be made available by reprogramming funds for Asia and funds from the European Development Fund (EDF).
I would add that that also applies to pledges from the EU Member States to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion.
The Commission and the Council must therefore ensure that additional new funds are created.
That is a tough demand by Parliament, and we will be discussing it again in due course.
It is vitally important that the UN should play a coordinating role, and that the role of local organisations and local priorities should be respected.
Together with our counterparts in the national parliaments of the Member States, we in this House must set up a kind of tsunami watch to monitor whether the pledges are delivered upon and to ensure that prompt transitional regulations are put in place.
What action is the EU taking in terms of flexible reconstruction to prevent a recurrence of what we saw happening after hurricane Mitch â a yawning chasm emerging between emergency aid on the one hand and structural aid on the other?
Commissioner Michel has pledged a scoreboard of EURÂ 475 million in commitments/funds.
That should be done on a quarterly basis, with us being informed as to what progress has been made with regard to the early warning system in Asia.
We would like the same system in Africa, because that has so far been refused.
What matters most in my view is that the poorest of the poor, those poor fishing communities, receive the pledged funds and that they can have a say in how they are spent.
If not, the money will be caught again in intermediate layers, which would be a crying shame.
I would therefore urge you to give clear instructions to your EU delegations on the ground and to include this quality requirement in your scoreboard.
With regard to Europe, I should like to quote the words of Johan Cruyff: ââ â for every disadvantage there is an advantage.
I hope that we can use this momentum together for the benefit of effective European solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to speak on behalf of the Group of the Greens in thanking all those who have made donations or pledged them, but I also want, in my capacity as chairman of the delegation for relations with Iran, to emphasise my concern that the events of a year ago may repeat themselves, for, on 26 December 2003, an Iranian village was destroyed by an earthquake.
Massive amounts of aid were promised, but the money never arrived.
Terrible anniversaries like these stick in our minds, and in everyone elseâs.
The credibility of this House and of the European Union depends on three things being done.
Firstly, the other areas must not be neglected; secondly, when remitting debt or allocating donations, it must be ensured that they are not misappropriated and used for military purposes; and, thirdly, I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that we need â and as part of the European security strategy â the capacity for humanitarian and civilian intervention.
We have already decided to set up the European Civilian Peace Corps, and it is in our Constitution.
Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, we should take up Commissioner Ferrero-Waldnerâs proposals by preventing deficits and doing away with those that occur.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that the first thing we have to do â as I said in the joint meeting of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Development and Budgets â is to express our recognition of the reaction of the European institutions, and in particular the Commission, which we so often criticise and which on this occasion I believe has been a match for the serious circumstances and the example offered by civil society.
I believe that the most urgent thing at the moment is to try to help the victims who still need water, food and hospitals and who need communications to be re-established.
Furthermore, as Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said in her speech, we must now produce a rehabilitation and reconstruction plan in which we should mobilise a whole series of budgetary resources, in particular additional resources, as Mr van den Berg quite rightly said a moment ago.
I believe that the European Union has acted properly; now we have to establish an effective method for helping the victims.
Mr President, I believe another particularly important point â and I would ask the Commissioner to communicate this comment to the Commissioner responsible for Transport â is that it is incredible that at European level there is still no common system for the prevention of tidal waves.
This is a very cheap system and I believe that the European Union, in the field of aid to the developing countries, the ACP countries and the countries of the Mediterranean rim, could offer it in a genuinely significant manner in order to prevent that kind of disaster.
One of the elements, Mr President, of the draft resolution Parliament is going to approve tomorrow that I believe to be correct is its reference to the solidarity demonstrated by the local populations and the solidarity and support they have offered to the families from the European Union who have fallen victim to this tragedy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to begin by expressing my deep sympathy for all those who, across the world, have been affected by the Asian tsunami.
What needs right now to be focused upon are the emergency efforts to relieve human suffering, take care of the injured, identify the dead, be available to the grieving, and facilitate and support the reconstruction.
As decision makers, we must also accept our long-term responsibility.
The earthquake disaster in South-East Asia is, without doubt, greater than that which struck Iran last year.
Our unreadiness to respond practically to disasters is as obvious now as it was then.
If emergency services are to operate effectively, there has to be an international organisation whose national components have taken part in frequent joint exercises and that operates in crises caused by, for example, earthquakes, floods or terrorist attacks.
The EU should therefore have an emergency service that operates both within and outside European borders and that always sends help immediately, irrespective of whether it is Spaniards, Swedes or Somalis who have been affected.
What, after all, can be more important in a form of international cooperation such as the EU than, specifically, the saving of human lives?
An EU emergency service should strengthen and supplement the Member Statesâ own emergency services and civil crisis management and, of course, cooperate closely with the UN.
What is important is that it have a permanent structure and be given responsibility in the following areas: analysing â and making plans in response to â the need for future emergency efforts; planning and implementing common exercises; and coordinating and mobilising resources for evacuation, medical care and the transport of food, medicines, clothes and other aid materials in the crisis situation.
I would call upon the Council actually to set up such an EU emergency service.
I hope that the Commission will lose no time in extending the existing responsibility for crisis management in order that still greater responsibility might be accepted in the future disasters for which I unfortunately believe we must prepare ourselves.
Â Â  Mr President, I have just two points to make.
The disaster in Asia may well have been natural, but it was also an ecological one.
Enormous damage was done to wide stretches of beach, reefs were destroyed, their coral filled with sand and dirt, and machinery washed out to sea constitutes a ticking time-bomb.
All this makes these regions less attractive to tourists.
The first priority, along with the repair of the damage to the environment â in so far as this is possible â is the reconstruction of facilities for tourists.
Although foreign tourists play an important part in the economy, unplanned mass tourism is not environmentally sound.
Any reconstruction must be broader based and more sustainable.
Lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of the past.
The disaster can also be seen as an opportunity.
In this respect, the pilot project undertaken by the Thai Ministry of the Environment jointly with the UN and the World Bank to repair the environmental damage on the island of Koh Phi Phi strikes me as showing the way ahead.
Â Â  Mr President, the huge extent of the disaster and destruction caused the tsunami, as well as its emotional and physical impact, will be felt among the victims for years to come.
I would congratulate the Commission and Council on their rapid and sufficient response immediately following the disaster and on the involvement they have displayed.
Now, a few weeks down the line, we must prepare one of the most extensive reconstruction programmes ever.
My main concern is that we should prevent past mistakes from being repeated.
In any event, aid to Asia should not be at the expense of relief to other poverty-stricken areas such as Africa.
The worldâs attention is on Asia, with good reason, but tomorrow too, some 20Â 000 people will die again of poverty-related illnesses, such as HIV, aids, malaria and tuberculosis.
Tomorrow too, many more people will die or be forced to flee their homes, for example in Darfur, Sudan and elsewhere.
These people should not be the victims of the useful and generous campaigns for Asia.
Another point is how we as Europe can ensure that aid ends up where it is intended, namely with the victims and not, therefore, with dubious or criminal organisations, or in the pockets of corrupt officials.
Sound coordination is an absolute condition, and the UN has an important role to play in this.
I am pleased that, in Jakarta, agreements to this effect have been reached, and they need to be observed.
It is vital that we should pull out all the stops to prevent criminal organisations from being able to make an easy profit from the chaos by engaging in looting, child trafficking or whatever.
This is where international cooperation is of huge importance.
It is also important, as has been stated before, that an early warning system for seaquakes be put in place.
In short, I hope that the disaster will be not only a unique example of financial solidarity, but also a unique example in terms of showing how aid programmes should be implemented.
Not only should we give with a heart, as somebody said, but also with our brains.
Â Â  â Mr President, as others have said, those who have suffered so much in this disaster want more than just promises of support or the transfer of money from one disaster to another â from Africa to Aceh for example.
After all, when USD 1.6 billion was raised for relief in Iraq it was largely at the expense of Africa.
We need new, additional money, and the needs of victims of other crises, such as those in Sudan, Congo, Haiti, Liberia and northern Uganda, should not be forgotten.
Our efforts should moreover not be at the expense of the eight million people who die every year from preventable diseases such as malaria.
I would urge the Commission to look again very closely at the ACP's request to have their own disaster warning facility and would also urge that particular attention be paid to the needs of Somalia and the Seychelles, where thousands of people have been displaced and their livelihoods destroyed.
One of the paragraphs in our resolution opposes the use of the EDF B envelope to support those countries in East Africa.
Indeed, it is very unclear how funds can be made available for Somalia from an EDF envelope from which it does not even benefit.
Â Â  Mr President, the world was shocked by the massive undersea earthquake, which took place on 26 December 2004.
I believe that the inability of the European Union to react to the tragedy with the same single-mindedness as the United States, which sent its Secretary of State, is a clear indication of the urgent need for an EU foreign minister.
I do not share the view of some colleagues.
The EU's delay in responding at an appropriate level was deeply shocking and is unacceptable; senior EU leaders were not visible.
However, I welcome the response, as now set out by the Commission President.
The current figure for loss of life is over 150Â 000, and it is feared that the effects of the tsunami, through diseases like cholera and malaria, will claim more victims.
However, we must not take for granted the great outpouring of support from the public, who were way ahead of the politicians.
We must now prepare for the time when donations turn from a flood to a trickle, once the glare of the media is turned away from Asia.
I would like to make two suggestions.
One is that we should somehow try to legislate, or to get Member States to legislate, for the 0.7% of GNP contribution, as required by our commitment to the United Nations.
I do not think it satisfactory, even in the motion recently adopted by this House, to express the that this will happen by 2015.
What happened in South-East Asia indicates how urgent this is, and the Commission should now be trying to work for some sort of a treaty base to compel Member States to meet this commitment of 0.7%.
Secondly, implementing a coordinated and sustained effort by donor governments gives rise for concern.
Some time ago, a EUR 2.5 billion commitment to Honduras for reconstruction after Hurricane Mitch was barely delivered on to the extent of one-third of that commitment: this is totally unacceptable.
This House is not going to accept that once the glare of publicity leaves South-East Asia, the commitments we make now will not be met.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, the tsunami means that we must rethink our whole development policy.
The fight against poverty must become a core commitment so that todayâs interdependent world may be governed by criteria of equality and justice.
With the tsunami, all of us, rich or poor, are in the same boat.
I do not think it is enough to reprogramme what has already been allocated or even to buy fishing boats in Europe and give them to fishermen in the affected areas.
We have to move on urgently from words to deeds, cancelling the debts of all poor countries, opening our markets to trade with those countries, allocating 0.39% of Europeâs GIP to development aid by 2006 â in line with the moral commitment we accepted at Monterey â and, lastly, establishing a levy on international transactions to finance development and thus to meet the Millennium Objectives.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to add to Mr Martensâ words of appreciation for the Commissionâs rapid and effective response to the request for aid.
There are three points I should like to discuss.
First of all, there is a point I should like to consider in my capacity as a member of the Subcommittee on Human Rights.
One of the shadowy sides of tourism in that area, including large-scale tourism from Europe, is the trade in women and children and the violation of childrenâs rights.
A situation such as this again makes evident how dark this shadow is. It would be right and proper for the European Union to make money and manpower available to tackle that very issue and to demonstrate, in that dark situation, that we too are on the side of the people, and to solve that great evil.
My second point concerns the enormous damage suffered by fisheries.
As we in Europe have a great deal of expertise in that area, it would be appropriate if the European Union, as well as concluding fisheries agreements across the world, were to assist those coastal areas at this particular time, ensuring that the necessary attention is given to equipping fishing vessels and safe fishing, that high levels of funds are invested in this area and that we focus on this accordingly.
The third point concerns food aid.
Very often in large-scale food aid, we notice that, due to enormous price rises on account of the enormous extra demand arising in those areas, the poor in nearby regions suffer as a result.
In that respect, the European Union could play a leading role in ensuring that those markets are not disrupted, and that in terms of food purchasing, it is considered worldwide how that issue could be solved.
It is then that the quality of aid can improve in the areas close to those affected, too.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the presidency for briefing Parliament just after last week's Council.
The occurrence of the catastrophe meant that global security had failed, and, this time, terrorists cannot be blamed. It was caused by nature and global unpreparedness.
Both the UN and the EU are taking action but they must learn a lesson from this.
We need to make global the early-warning system that could have saved lives; the EU's Galileo system could help.
We need to invest in the Union's civil protection system, coordinating and strengthening prevention and the rapid-response capability for all Member States.
We need to make use of the Union's military logistics â not just for Member States â to assist in the accessible areas affected and to invest in capacities and their rapid implementation in similar emergencies in the future.
We need to follow closely and politically the reconstruction in Aceh and in Sri Lanka to prevent the resumption of war.
Finally, the EU and its Member States need to honour commitments under the Millennium Declaration and engage all rich nations in fighting the tsunamis of poverty, which kill hundreds of thousands every month through hunger, disease and war, in particular in Africa.
I should like to conclude by saying that we should not let the dead die in vain.
This tragedy must be the turning point for global governance and for a just globalisation.
Â Â  â Mr President, the globalisation of solidarity is having a visible effect.
On Monday, we had a meeting with the Commission to discuss what concrete financial aid the EU could provide, thus backing up its words with practical action.
It is encouraging that sufficient funds have been made available, but it is doubtful whether it will reach those who need it.
In the EU, people have donated billions; one television programme in Germany brought in EURÂ 40 million.
Those who are often accused of being interested only in themselves did not look away; when reports were shown of the hell in paradise, they were watching them.
It is to be hoped that the measures that have been planned will succeed; I am thinking here of, for example, the installation of satellite-based early warning systems â to which Members have referred â to prevent disasters.
There is also the need for the speedy reconstruction of villages, towns and the environment on which people depend for their livelihoods and for expert care for traumatised widows and orphans.
What particularly concerns me now is the aftermath; if the survivors are to be helped in the long term, we need partners and allies in the shape of NGOs, many volunteers who can help people where they are, and we also need effective structures to develop partnerships between towns.
Some of these have not yet come into being.
Tourism must be revived there; these ASEAN and SAARC countries, some of which I know well, are waiting for us, their friends, to return to them.
Let us hope that people will still be helped when the newspapers have found other things to write about and the cameras have been switched off.
Â Â  Mr President, the whole world is struck with horror at the extent of the catastrophe, and so I welcome all the more the great generosity on the part of the EU, the Member States and, above all, of the public.
While there is an urgent need for emergency aid, we also need to ensure the long-term and sustainable reconstruction of the stricken regions, and it also appears to me that the donor nations need, as a matter of urgency, to discuss seriously the generous remission of the affected statesâ debts, and, in addition, work towards a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Aceh.

It is a matter for shame, though, that a debate is now being set in motion as to whether Germany, among other countries, is even in a position to help.
I am referring here to Mr Stoiber and Mr Wulff, who otherwise always parade the Christian aspect of their party around as if it were a monstrance.
Fortunately, though, the overwhelming majority of people takes a different view, not only in Germany and the EU, but also around the world â something that the people of Beslan have shown by their outstanding example.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of us can get these images out of our minds â these images of suffering, death, destruction, mud and tears â and the cries for help, the cries of despair and lamentation, not to mention the stories told by the victims, are still echoing in our ears.
We are witnesses to one of the greatest of natural disasters and know that it is not the only one in the world.
We live in a global world, faced with global responsibilities, and we are in search of global solutions.
We have to acknowledge our increasing dependence on one another and that we are closer to one another than day-to-day political polemics and debate would have us believe.
First of all, I would like to thank those people who, even though affected by the disaster and with needs of their own, helped many citizens of our Member States.
I would like to thank the millions of donors, who, rather than averting their gaze, are looking to see what they can do; who are not merely lamenting the disaster, but doing something about it.
I would also like to thank the public services, the aid organisations and the volunteers, who set their hands to the task immediately.
I do also have a request.
I would ask the Commission to make haste to put the projects out to tender, so that the co-funding can be secured and all offers of help can be coordinated.
Secondly, I would ask that Commissioner Ferrero-Waldnerâs request should not simply be filed away in a drawer, for we were all taken by surprise by the violence and extent of the catastrophe.
Even at home, in our own states, we can do more in the way of crisis management, coordination and prevention.
We still have to learn what could be done better.
Thirdly, I would like to ask the Commission whether, in the interests of long-term support for its aid measures to the worst-hit countries, it is contemplating making use of the Regulation on a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from July 2005 to the end of 2008, and, if that is the case, by how much does it envisage the preferences for the benefit of the affected countries being extended?
Â Â  Â Â Â Thank you, MrÂ President.
Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no one in this House who doubts that the countries affected by the tsunami tragedy need rapid, effective and coordinated aid.
The European Union must do more than merely send funds, however.
We cannot limit our role to that of a generous donor who believes that sending out money will solve the problem.
We must plan a programme of long-term infrastructure and economic reconstruction in the countries of South-East Asia and Africa affected by the tsunami tragedy.
In addition, a special early-warning system should be put in place to protect the international community from similar disasters in future, and special funds should be set aside for these measures.
As a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia, I would ask that this Delegation become an active and natural point of reference for issues concerning aid for tsunami victims and measures to prevent any irregular use of funds, as the latter could occur if proper monitoring procedures are not put in place.
I thank you.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, concern is sometimes voiced that aid measures for victims are becoming a strange kind of competition between individual countries and organisations, and that all that matters is who gives the most.
A belief that certain interests, and not always innocent ones, are trying to profit from this aid, or in other words that this aid is not in fact unselfish, but that it serves a particular purpose, is also occasionally behind these concerns.
Yet I do not share such concerns in the face of an act of solidarity on such an unprecedented international scale.
On the contrary, I would be more than happy to see nothing but solidarity in our conflict-filled world, and nothing but solidarity of this kind, not hostile or violent solidarity aimed at pitting the strongest against the weakest.
There are at least two issues to which we must turn our attention, however.
The first is the following question: why are the financial contributions of individual countries noted so scrupulously in lists of aid donated?
Why do we refer to the contributions made by Germany, France or Sweden, and not the to contribution made by the European Community?
We are Europeans, after all.
We stress this fact at every given opportunity, yet unfortunately as soon as money is involved, nationalist sentiments come to the fore.
The second question relates not to the principles according to which aid is granted, but to the way it is organised.
The tragedy in Asia has made us painfully aware that, just as we need a central headquarters where military actions are coordinated in times of war, we need a central headquarters where aid can be coordinated whenever disasters occur on a scale such as that in Asia.
We are all aware that we live in a divided world, and that we will not succeed in setting up such an institute at a global level, but we must set up a rapid reaction centre of this kind at EU level.
Voltaire called for such a thing after the earthquake in Lisbon, an event he could not accept as he claimed it defied his reason.
Today we know that such events do not defy rational thinking, and this is all the more reason why we must take rational steps to counter them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there was a good response from the Commission, given the organisation for providing emergency aid that we have at present, but the disaster gives much cause for reflection.
A lot could have been done differently, both at EU level and in those countries mainly affected.
Historically, the problem is that, generally speaking, too little attention has been given to the readiness to respond to disasters.
It is relatively simple to mobilise large amounts of money both from the general public and from governments in an emergency situation.
It is difficult obtaining resources for preventing disasters and preparing to respond to them.
It has, for example, been known for a long time that the countries around the Indian Ocean had no system of warnings against not only tsunamis but also other major disasters, especially cyclones.
Nothing has been done by the governments concerned or by various donors.
The only country in the area that has acted upon the risks and prepared itself effectively is, in actual fact, Bangladesh.
In the same way, the EU civil crisis force that is now being discussed could already have been established.
This is not the first time that the need for such a force has become apparent.
EU activity should be more coordinated specifically in this area.
Coordination and cooperation are required not only in order to set up this force but also in order to organise all the relief consignments in an emergency situation.
There is a lack of coordination in this area.
The UN has the main responsibility, but we know that the UN does not have the required capacity.
A far better coordinated EU â and I am talking here about the Commission and the Member States â could have been of great help at the height of the disaster.
That is something we must pin our hopes on for the future.
Finally, the reconstruction.
Just like a number of other speakers, I should like to see the EURÂ 350Â million talked about by MrÂ Barroso this morning take the form of fresh money rather than be extracted from the ordinary budget.
If rapidity of response requires the use of already appropriated resources, we should ensure that these are subsequently and appropriately replenished.
Otherwise, Asia will, as a region, miss out on EURÂ 150Â million in development aid.
Finally, I would direct my last point to the Commission.
Examine seriously all the reports that show how badly the ecology of the area had been damaged prior to the disaster through misdirected exploitation.
In the reconstruction, it is vitally important to take account of the environment if the necessary conditions of life are not to be further eroded and if the risk of further disasters is to be reduced.
Â Â  Mr President, natural disasters cannot be prevented, but the political dimension of such an issue can be found in international cooperation in the development of emergency and early-warning systems.
By investing in these we might be able to minimise the number of human casualties.
I do not know if a certain organisation hit the nail on the head last week when it estimated that EUR 0.5 would have been enough to put observation buoys in the Indian Ocean to warn of danger, but the funding for this project had not been found. In any case, the example is a telling one in terms of the figure given.
Preventive action is always many times cheaper than dealing with disasters after they have happened.
It has now been decided to establish an early-warning system in the Indian Ocean region.
Telecommunications companies will be able to be linked up to the system.
They will be able to collect information on impending disasters from the monitoring system and send warning messages to people travelling in the region in their native language.
This is excellent â in this way, we will be able to transform this immense loss and tragedy into an experience which in future may save human lives.
It is good that EU Foreign Affairs Ministers and Ministers for Development Cooperation are responding quickly, agreeing on EU measures to help people in the crisis area and begin reconstruction.
Nevertheless, we need to remember that the promise of new rapid deployment troops concentrating on civilian rescue operations was not a new and creative idea.
It was a promise of troops that was not delivered on in time: according to the decisions taken at an EU summit in 2001, the troops were supposed to be ready by the end of 2003.
Now a new deadline has been set for 2007; who knows what it would have been but for this disaster.
We just have to hope that all the promises made will be kept.
We all knew that natural disasters occur all the time.
This incident alerted the Western world, as the presence of tourists made it seem so near.
Hopefully, this awareness of human distress and mutual solidarity in the world will be permanent.
This is about human dignity.
Help is needed when the face of human suffering is a foreign one.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency, I would like to thank the European Parliament for this debate, which testifies to the great groundswell of solidarity shown by the peoples of Europe when this terrible calamity struck.
The Council has listened carefully not only to your Houseâs suggestions, observations, and comments, but also to its criticisms.
I would like to make it very clear that Europe has been neither inactive nor passive.
It acted quickly â very quickly, indeed â and at every level, in providing humanitarian aid, organising consular cooperation, maintaining a state of alert, preventing the outbreak of epidemics, and, politically, confirming the UN in its coordinating role.
There has also been very effective cooperation between Parliament and the Council.
This very morning, in the context of the trialogue, which took only a few minutes, we managed to raise EURÂ 100 million, that being the first instalment of additional humanitarian aid.
What this shows is that, in cases of urgency, our institutions work marvellously well.
The measures decided on by the Council on 7Â January are being monitored on a regular basis and the Council will ensure that any further action that proves to be necessary is taken.
Close coordination with the UN, with the other donors, and with NGOs on the ground will continue, thereby guaranteeing the aidâs maximum effectiveness.
I also commit the Presidency to a continuation of this dialogue with Parliament and to regular exchanges of views with it on the various measures that are decided on in order to address the problems faced by the countries affected by the disaster.
Although I am unable to reply to all the questions that honourable Members have raised, there are some that I would like to revisit, starting with the question of the need to reinforce the European instrument for coordinating civil protection.
To be sure, this instrument already exists, but its coordination needs to be improved and its means reinforced.
The President of the Commission this morning announced that it would be submitting to the next General Affairs Council proposals for improving this instrument.
This is quite definitely an important and core issue.
Among the other issues that have been raised, I would refer in particular to that of the vulnerability of children, to which we must attach enormous importance, cooperating fully not only with UNICEF, but also with specialised NGOs in this field.

Another question touched upon the internal conflicts raging in at least two of the countries affected by the disaster.
These internal conflicts must not, of course, be allowed in any way to prevent humanitarian aid being given and getting through to the people who need it.
No doubt the European Union will be able to involve itself further in helping these countries to find solutions to these conflicts, by which they have already been ravaged for some time, even for many years.
The Council also undertakes to monitor the performance of its commitments, particularly the financial ones, to follow up its aid and to remain present on the ground, particularly during the reconstruction period, which will be crucial, in that it will follow the humanitarian aid stage, and Europe must very definitely be present and involved in it.
I would also like to highlight the issue of debt relief, concerning which a meeting has been held today.
I believe that the help countries need with this must indeed be given to those who ask for it.
My final, and important, point has to do with preventing natural disasters and giving early warning of them.
We need to invest more in this area.
The fact is that we must make use of all the technological means at our disposal in order, in so far as possible, to prevent a repetition of such catastrophes as these or, at least, to limit the fallout from them.
Â Â  . Mr President, your debate today on the issue of the earthquake and tsunami in South-East Asia shows the commitment of the European Parliament to see action by the European Union to help the countries and populations in need.
I can assure you that the Commission will deliver the help that is needed and will do this in close cooperation with you.
I thank you for a number of useful comments and suggestions in this respect.
As regards the reaction of the Commission's Civil Protection Unit, it immediately organised the sending of Member State experts to the affected countries â the first experts arrived the day after the disaster.
What are the concrete measures to be taken?
As the President of the Commission underlined, there are a number of proposals to be implemented, some of them in the short term, others in the mid- and long-term.
On the humanitarian side, in addition to the support package already adopted, it is proposed that EUR 100Â million from the Commission's Jakarta pledge be allocated from the emergency reserve.
I understand that the budgetary authority has already agreed to this politically.
On the reconstruction side, some EUR 350 million of partially new funds should be made available, and funds already programmed streamlined.
I have noted your concerns about the reprogramming, but I should like to assure you that this improved streamlining of all the available funds is the quickest way to deliver aid and, in many cases, will be necessary, as some projects cannot be carried out in some of the affected areas.
There is a proverb in my country: one who gives fast gives twice.
It is important that we bear that in mind.
Not only are the amounts of aid important; the quality and mechanisms for aid delivery are too.
In this respect, the Commission should obtain the support of the Council and the European Parliament to use the derogations and accelerated procedures in full.
Moreover, the coordination should be organised by the countries and the financing programmes approved by the governments themselves.
Of course, budget support needs to be properly supervised to ensure sound financial management.
Trust funds with the countries concerned, based either on UN and/or World Bank trust fund formulae, may be a good answer to this concern.
My colleague, MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner, is currently visiting the US, meeting MrÂ Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, to discuss these issues.
Besides humanitarian and reconstruction support, there are a number of flanking measures that need to be taken.
The Commission has taken action in various fields: reinforcing EU coordination capabilities to respond to crises; debt relief for the countries in question; trade measures â one of the questions raised â such as the possibility of accelerating the entry into force of the new scheme for a generalised system of preferences; early warning systems; satellite monitoring and research and development; preparation for disaster management; fisheries; justice and home affairs; health and so on. We are looking at a wide range of actions.
Of particular importance here are the measures for early warning of disasters and preparation for crisis response.
I also believe that prevention is crucial.
The best help is to save lives.
This tragic event needs to be seen by all of us as a kind of opportunity and commitment to organise ourselves better and coordinate action in the event of a disaster.
We can agree that the European Union has a global responsibility.
Such events can be addressed only in a global way, at a global level.
Allow me to underline once again that the Commission counts on the support of the European Parliament in order to help the countries and populations in need.
Â Â  As I wind up the debate, I should like to state that I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on transatlantic relations.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Security Strategy confirms that our transatlantic relationship is unique and irreplaceable.
By taking common action, the European Union and the United States can constitute a considerable force in the service of our shared values in the world.
The conclusions of the November European Council refer to the responsibility shared by the European Union and the United States in the face of the major challenges such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the peace process in the Middle East, and the eradication of poverty from the world.
The Luxembourg Presidency is firmly committed to implementing these conclusions.
I am sure that todayâs debate in this House will help us to accomplish this task.
Relations between Europe and America are founded on shared interests and on the promotion of such shared values as freedom, democracy and human rights.
They also benefit from the interdependence of their economies, something that is unique in the world.
These factors, taken as a whole, explain why, even when the recent Iraq crisis was at its worst pitch, there was continuing trans-Atlantic cooperation on most of the major issues, whether the Balkans, the Middle East peace process, the fight against terrorism, or non-proliferation.
Despite certain isolated differences, the economic relationship has continued to develop.
The United States and the European Union share great responsibility for international economic and monetary stability.
It is worth adding that the latest agreement on aircraft construction demonstrates our ability to resolve our differences in a spirit of cooperation and partnership.
If the state of the relationship has been, and remains extremely positive, it is nonetheless true that it must adapt to change on three fronts.
This morning, the President of the European Council stressed the fact that the status quo is not a credible option.
For a start, the end of the Cold War has made for fundamental changes in the international order.
Faced with the Soviet menace, trans-Atlantic unity was a necessity in terms of mere survival.
Today, the more important element of choice and political will has been added.
The tragedy of 11Â September changed the way in which America perceives the world; it obliges us, too, to revise our definition of collective security.
This obviously affects relations between the United States and the rest of the world, including the European Union.
The internal transformation of the European Union into a more political union endowed with a common foreign and security policy, with a single currency and with an area of justice and freedom will inevitably be reflected in its relations with America, changing their quality and intensity.
All these factors together means that, of the three major components of the relationship with the United States â NATO, bilateral relations and EU-US relations â it is the third that is growing in importance.
In this context, President Bushâs visit to the European Union on 22Â February acquires exceptional significance.
The Presidency intends to take this opportunity to give the relationship fresh momentum.
The Presidentâs visit is a powerful political and symbolic act.
We see it as communicating Washingtonâs acknowledgement of the shared interests and values that link America and the EU.
This visit must be well prepared, and I will give close attention to honourable Membersâ suggestions on the subject.
We are, to be sure, advocating a pragmatic and constructive approach to the future, but it will also be an ambitious one.
European unity is one of the conditions on which the establishment of a strong and balanced trans-Atlantic relationship depends.
We have to work on it.
It is also important that the EU should put forward its own initiatives in clear terms.
Furthermore, as stated in the European security strategy, Europe must continue to develop its own capacities.
There are few areas in which the EU and the United States do not cooperate.
Time does not permit me today to look at all the policy areas concerned, but there are three that are particularly urgent.
The first is the conflict in the Middle East, the resolution of which is a matter of vital importance not only to those involved in it, but also to Europe and the United States.
We are working towards such a resolution within the framework of the Quartet, with the Americans, the United Nations and Russia.
The latest developments in the region open a unique window of opportunity.
Like the Americans, we Europeans must encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to seize this vital opportunity to relaunch the peace process and do everything possible to support the parties in their search for a just and lasting solution.
I would add that Mr Poettering, speaking this morning, highlighted the political role that the European Union must play in the quest for the peace that is needed.
The second issue has to do with Iraq and, over and above that, with the destiny of the region.
Although the present situation there is extremely problematic, it is in the interest of all, and particularly in Europeâs interest, that Iraq should emerge from the present crisis.
The elections at the end of this month will take place under difficult conditions, but we must hope that they will create the conditions needed for a democratic and sovereign Iraq to make a new start.
Turning to Iran, the European Union and the United States, different though their methods and approaches may be, share the same objective, which is to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons.
The European Union has embarked on more wide-ranging negotiations with Iran; we have high hopes of them, and that not only in the nuclear sphere.
The outcomes that are emerging will be, or could be, a great success for the European foreign policy and for Europeâs approach.
Finally, there is the disaster in Asia, which we have just been discussing, and which is a clear illustration of the need for good cooperation between the European Union and the United States when such calamities strike.
The acknowledgement of the central role of the United Nations in coordinating aid, something to which many of you referred and which the European Union advocated from the outset, has been an encouraging sign in that the Americans very quickly came to accept it.
There are very many areas in which Washingtonâs and Brusselsâ views largely coincide, including the long-term stabilisation of the Balkans, Afghanistan, the main aspects of the fight against terrorism, which must reconcile the demands of freedom and security, and the relaunch of the Doha round, among others. In other fields, we have to accept that, although we have shared goals, we have different approaches, and Iran, as I have already stressed, is one of them.
In short, there are areas on which we really do differ, including climate change, the International Criminal Court and capital punishment.
Although we must try, by means of some sort of dialogue, to resolve our differences in so far as we are able to, we must also be realistic enough to admit that it will not always be possible.
When that happens, let us, as friends and partners, be honest enough to acknowledge our differences, but also make sure that they do not affect our relationship as a whole.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make one final comment.
The best proof of the trans-Atlantic relationshipâs maturity would be for us to talk less about this relationship in general than about the tasks we set ourselves towards the end of making the world a safer place and giving its economic, social and ecological development greater balance.
It is true that this yearâs second anniversary of the launch of the âNew Transatlantic Agendaâ encourages us to reflect on the state of this relationship and of its institutional process.
The Presidency is willing to listen to any suggestion towards improving it in a pragmatic way.
It is by action and by the development of good policies through dialogue and cooperation that we will best be able to move the trans-Atlantic partnership forward.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to convey Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's apologies.
She very much regrets being unable to attend this debate. However, the reason she is not here is pertinent to this debate.
She was due to participate in your debate as originally scheduled, but is now on her way to Washington for meetings with the present and future American Administration, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, future Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the future National Security Adviser, Stephen Hadley.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will brief the Committee on Foreign Affairs on this visit on 25 January 2005.
The Commission welcomes the opportunity to discuss transatlantic relations with you early on in this parliamentary term.
Reviewing the state of our relations with the United States will be high on our political agenda over the next few months, and for good reason, since the outcome will have a major influence on developments in the transatlantic relationship over the coming years.
This debate today is both timely and welcome.
I would like to start by stating two simple and irrefutable facts.
First, EU-US relations are truly unique and irreplaceable.
Second, the balance sheet of the transatlantic relationship is fundamentally positive.
On the economic front, we have the largest trade and investment relationship in the world, with figures like EURÂ 600 billion worth of trade in 2003, and an investment stock measured at EURÂ 1Â 500 billion in 2002.
These investments have created, directly or indirectly, some 12 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.
But our relations extend well beyond the domain of economics, even if some media reports continue to focus solely on past divisions over Iraq.
We are working together with remarkable success in places such as the Balkans, Afghanistan and Ukraine.
That being said, it is clear that the EU-US relationship must adapt to the changing security environment and to changing global priorities.
It must also adapt to changes within the European Union.
We are convinced that as the enlarged EU's foreign policy strengthens, so too will the scope and intensity of our relations with the United States.
In essence, the European Union and the United States are both founded on the same principles and values: respect for the rule of law, democracy, human rights and of course free market economies.
We also share many common interests, such as the fight against terrorism, promoting solutions to regional conflicts, dealing with third countries, improving transatlantic economic relations, concluding the WTO Doha round, and creating global prosperity.
In many cases, we share the same strategy for implementing those goals.
In others, although we share the same goals, we have different approaches to implementation.
There are also issues on which our views fundamentally differ, such as how to tackle climate change, and on some aspects of human rights and international law.
Looking at the key EU-US issues today, it is natural to begin with our multilateral efforts in the Indian Ocean.
The recent human tragedy clearly demonstrated that in times of crisis, only effective international cooperation can prevail.
EU and United States assistance has been vital, and together we have set a good example of effective multilateralism.
We want to continue this preference for effective multilateralism by working closely with the United States on issues such as United Nations reform and climate change.
Turning to one of the most significant areas of dispute between the European Union and the United States, my colleague Mr Mandelson announced yesterday that the EU and the United States have agreed terms for launching negotiations on subsidies affecting the civil aircraft sector.
The objective of these negotiations, which will last three months, is to eliminate subsidies and to establish fair, market-based competition between Boeing and Airbus.
With this agreement, the EU and US have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute that has arisen between them over trade in large civil aircraft, and to devote time and resources to doing so by negotiation, rather than pursuing the dispute through WTO channels.
This is a significant move. However, it is the beginning of a process and not a conclusion.
Much work remains to be done.
The Commission intends to work closely with Member States and Airbus, as well as with the US trade representative, to achieve a final result that maintains Europe's competitiveness in this important sector.
On regional issues I would like to highlight three areas of common priority.
First, we should redouble our efforts to bring peace to the Middle East now that a new Palestinian leadership has been elected.
It is crucial that we, through the Quartet, use the positive momentum among the parties to ensure full implementation of the roadmap without delay.
Second, we must continue working together to help put Iraq on the road to democracy, peace, prosperity and stability.
Third, we share the objective of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability and we should both do our best to ensure that Iran fully implements the Paris Agreement.
Doubtless many of you have the feeling that we could do more and work better together.
The Commission shares that feeling.
In order for our cooperation with the US to continue developing successfully we must be united, consistent, effective and pragmatic.
Important work is already being done to reinvigorate our ties.
The Commission is assessing the contributions made to the discussion by the stakeholders on how to enhance the EU-US economic partnership and we will propose a strategy, with concrete steps, by the time of the next EU-US summit later this year.
We are also reviewing the institutional framework of our relations.
The Commission will submit a communication on both the framework for relations and economic partnership to Parliament and the Council in the spring, prior to the EU-US summit.
The European Parliament has an important role to play in furthering EU-US ties.
We have been listening carefully to your views within frameworks such as the transatlantic policy network, and we look forward to a general constructive dialogue with you on the future of the transatlantic partnership.
You are an important ally for us in ensuring that this partnership flourishes and grows stronger in the coming years.
We are convinced that further dialogue between you and the US Congress will be essential to cement a good basis for our bilateral relations.
Finally, let me underline that the Commission attaches great importance to the visit of President Bush to Brussels on 22 February.
We see this as a major opportunity to revitalise our partnership and define common priorities and missions.
We will do everything in our power to ensure that the visit is a success and that it confirms what we already see as auspicious signs of an improving relationship.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that this debate on transatlantic relations should leave aside all of its ideological waffle and focus, as the representative of the Presidency-in-Office has quite rightly said, on trying to replace the discord of the past with the harmony of the present.
The European Union and the United States have a shared history, common values and the same passion for freedom, and this is because the transatlantic link is written into the genetic code of the European Union.
It is clear â as both the Commission and the Council have pointed out â that we have differences separating us, such as the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, extraterritorial laws and trade policy, which the Commissioner referred to a moment ago.
But I believe that we must place much more emphasis on what unites us rather than what separates us.
It is clear that the objectives we as the European Union pursue â as the President-in-Office of the Council said â with regard to peace, stability, the fight against terrorism, weapons of mass destruction etc. can be achieved much better in cooperation with the United States rather than by speaking out against them â as Commissioner Patten said in one of his recent speeches â just as the United States will be better able to achieve their objectives in cooperation with the European Union rather than in opposition to it.
The United States are an admirable people; they represent 3% of the worldâs population and are able to produce 30% of its goods and services, and they have been able to create a political, economic and military superpower that is unprecedented since the Roman Empire.
I believe that the forthcoming visit by President Bush offers a wonderful opportunity to restore that strategic alliance, that harmonious partnership between the European Union and the United States, and to ensure that the values we both advocate â including human rights and fundamental freedoms â can be taken on in all regions of the world, be consolidated and be truly effective.
Â Â  . Mr President, despite quite a few differences of opinion, we must, as a matter of urgency, improve relations between the USA and the European Union, which have, to a greater or lesser degree, gone sour.
Paradoxically enough, it is the re-election of George W. Bush that offers the opportunity of making a new start in transatlantic relations.
After all, President Bush, as he has already indicated himself, needs European involvement in order to be successful in the core task of his foreign policy during his second term in office: the fight against terrorism and, particularly, addressing the problems in the Middle East.
In that respect, the interests of the United States and Europe still run parallel to a large extent, even if the gulf between us sometimes seems wider than ever.
We have a few difficult years behind us, particularly where Iraq is concerned.
President Bush has announced his wish to strengthen relations with his European partners, and in this light, we warmly welcome his visit to Europe next month.
Both sides have to make an effort if there is to be a significant improvement in relations.
The Americans will need to take greater account of their European partnersâ views than they have done before, but Europe, in turn, will need to be prepared to let its own former differences of opinion become a thing of the past.
We are therefore hopeful that the Americans will reassess their relationship with their European partners.
We are also cautious and even somewhat sceptical, because for the time being, there are no concrete signs of real changes of direction on the part of the Americans.
I am therefore convinced that in the near future, we will, in this House too, have even more extensive debates on transatlantic relations when the time comes to discuss an own-initiative report on the subject.
We believe Europe must adopt a clear common position, on which basis it can conduct dialogue with the United States on how to tackle world problems together.
The debate on transatlantic relations is therefore closely linked to the European debate about our own effective common foreign policy.
In that respect, it is impossible to ignore the, at times, fundamental differences of opinion on how to tackle global problems.
The fact that a number of issues, including Kyoto, the International Court of Justice, the disarmament issue and non-proliferation, will also be mentioned in the next few years is, to us, an important point in the discussion.
These are all areas in which the differences are often still gigantic.
Legitimacy of international action is one of those points we would actually like to mention, where the difference of opinion in the debate of the past few years has been crucial.
The guiding principle of European external policy is multilateralism.
We remain of the opinion that a decision to intervene should lie with the UN and cannot be taken by individual countries or coalitions of countries.
Europe should defend that position, and we must make it an absolute priority to reform the United Nations and make it a truly effective and representative platform.
It is preferable that this be done in tandem with the Americans, but we should not shy away from tabling our own proposals.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EU and the United States have many values in common.
We have a lot of historic links, and there is considerable gratitude towards the United States, which has helped us on many occasions.
Together, we have a great responsibility to work for peace, democracy and human rights throughout the world and have a common interest in close and unreserved cooperation in the fight against terrorism and in the interests of global security, disarmament and effective international institutions.
It is no secret that we have big differences when it comes to views of the International Criminal Court, Kyoto, multinational agreements, the treatment of the GuantÃ¡namo Bay prisoners, the death penalty and a number of trade issues.
These are important issues for the EU and our citizens, and they are always on the agenda in discussions with the United States.
Relations have also become extremely strained in connection with Iraq, and we can spend forever â as we have in fact done in this House â debating the whys and wherefores of what went wrong.
We must put that behind us and together accept responsibility for the Iraqi peopleâs being able to enjoy peace, security and democracy.
The opportunities for a fresh start in the Middle East peace process have also increased following the Palestinian election.
This is a sphere in which the EU and the United States can together play an important role.
We have a very important six months ahead of us.
The two summits between the EU and the United States must lead to a new lease of life in our relations.
Together, we can achieve a lot.
It was good to hear of Luxembourgâs ambitions, even if the Presidency does not have its earphones on at the present moment.
We hope that the Bush administration Mark Two will realise that there is much to gain from cooperation with Europe that is characterised by trust.
The EU must also make great efforts, and I am therefore pleased about the constructive tone that exists in this House.
We must formulate clear short- and long-term strategies for what we wish to accomplish, and how.
A number of factual matters have been mentioned, as well as the matters of how we are to set up a free trade area and a Transatlantic Parliamentary Assembly.
The EU has partnerships with most countries in the world.
It is odd that we have such an insubstantial agreement with, in particular, the United States â our closest neighbour of all and our most important partner.
That is why I look forward to what the Presidency and the Commission are shortly to present to Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disastrous floods in South-East Asia have shown us how great is the worldâs need for cooperation between Europeans and Americans, who, even though their abilities certainly differ, can, when they combine them, give the world the vital aid that it needs.
The disaster has also shown, though, an urgent need for closer cooperation between us.
A friendship must be able to cope with criticism and plain speaking.
I am sure I will not be saying anything new if I list the critical issues that need to be put on the agenda again and again.
From Kyoto to Guantanamo Bay by way of the International Criminal Court, there are problems that we must â and will â raise with our American friends, but we want to be fair too; we want to give President Bush a chance to mend the relationship in his second term of office.
We very much welcome his statement that he attaches particular importance to Europe.
Nor do we want to overlook the fact that, despite all the difficulties we have had and still have, cooperation is proving successful in many areas; whether between federal states, between think tanks or citizensâ initiatives, cooperation is working with extraordinary success in many areas, as well as in business and the economy.
As for the future, many tasks await us; there is the conflict between Israel and Palestine, there is the mullahsâ regime in Iran to be brought to heel, but there is also hunger and disease to be combated.
Here we must cooperate; the world cannot afford unilateralism.
Â Â  . Mr President, on 22 and 23Â February, the US President, George W. Bush, will visit Europe, where, after a visit to Brussels, he will be received in Mainz by the German Chancellor.
I am delighted that protests will be held on the occasion of this war criminalâs visit, and I myself will be addressing the demonstration in Mainz.
The fact that transatlantic relations are now so good surprises some people, but this is merely down to the fact that the EUâs policies do not differ in any fundamental way from the line followed by the US Government.
The debate on the EU Constitutional Treaty made it apparent that EU Heads of State or Government want the EU, too, to become a global and even military player.
Two examples of this are the militarisation of the EU, with the inclusion of an express commitment to rearmament in the new EU Treaty, and the fact that economic and monetary policy is based on neoliberal principles.
As I see it, a form of transatlantic relations whereby the EU becomes a world power, mostly working together with the USA, but sometimes competing with it, is the stuff of nightmares.
Â Â  Mr President, at the start of President Bushâs second term in office, what transatlantic relations demand of the European institutions is a sense of realism and enlightened self-interest, which are valuable qualities, and they desperately need them.
Indeed, it is the United States alone that can guarantee some sense of order in our complex and unpredictable world; the United Nations certainly cannot do it.
Simply think of the recent mass killings in Darfur, Sudan.
It is also Washington which guarantees NATOâs continued existence, thanks to which Europe need not fear conventional military threats today.
Moreover, in terms of combating terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the European Union is really no match for the United States.
Indeed, a sense of realism and enlightened self-interest on this side of the Atlantic Ocean require solid, open-handed, transatlantic relations.
I truly hope that the need for this will come to be generally accepted throughout all the European institutions, including this House.
Meanwhile, we now look forward to President Bushâs visit to Brussels being a fruitful one.
I warmly wish the Council and Commission much strength and dedication for this visit.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I believe that transatlantic relations also include relations with Canada, as well as those with the United States.
From listening to this debate, one would not think so.
However, as Chairman of the European Parliament Delegation to Canada, I fully recognise the importance that the Canadian Government attaches to its relationship with the 25 Member States of the European Union.
It is important that we continue to maintain a high level of dialogue at summit and ministerial level to address critical issues facing the European Community.
The new EU-Canada Partnership Agenda was launched under the Irish presidency in Ottawa on 18 March 2004.
It has established a coordination group to ensure the prompt and effective implementation at political level of decisions concerning all elements of the relationship between Canada and the European Union.
This intensified dialogue will allow for a more strategic, sustained and coherent approach to all issues affecting Canada and the European Union in an increasingly wide range of sectors. These include: environmental issues, justice and security matters, migration and integration affairs, fisheries, education, culture, youth exchanges and transport security.
We will work together to enhance the frequency and level of contact between the Canadian International Development Agency and EU agencies responsible for development assistance in order to bring forward common approaches.
Global issues of maintaining peace and security are best addressed in an effective multilateral system within a European Union working together with the US Government, the Canadian Government and our partners at the United Nations to combat international terrorism, tackle global poverty and promote democratic values.
We know what our collective challenges are in this regard, so let us go and meet them.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, transatlantic relations are the foundation for the future of both Europe and America, especially given the increasing significance of China, India, or indeed of Asia as a whole, and also of Latin America, in particular Brazil.
Rivalry between Europe and America is a dream come true for the enemies of Europe and the United States, and this is perhaps something that should be borne in mind by the participants in the demonstration in Mainz, referred to by MrÂ PflÃŒger.
I say this as a representative of a country in which the overwhelming majority of citizens were opposed to the Iraq war, but are simultaneously in favour of close ties between Europe and the USA.
The situation has now changed, as the outgoing/incoming President Bush is no longer vying for another term.
He no longer needs to convince Americans and Europeans that he was right about Iraq, and will therefore be open to arguments put forward by the Old Continent, or in other words, by the EU.
Furthermore, eight of the countries that recently joined the EU have traditionally had better and deeper relations with America than parts of the âoldâ Europe.
This means there is a new and improved outlook for the marriage of convenience between Europe and America, and indeed we know from experience that such marriages last a good deal longer than marriages for love.
Europe is not Juliet Capulet, a compatriot of the President, and the USA is not Romeo.
Cooperation and a strategic partnership between the USA and Europe are what is needed.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our relations with the United States of America are based on three factors; common interests, common values and competition.
Competition must be organised sensibly, and economic competition is of primary importance.
Our common interests are based on a desire to maximise security; this includes security in foreign policy, the fight against terrorism and other aspects, such as the major environmental issues, which need to be resolved.
Moving on to competition, however, this also means that the major industrial nations of Europe and North America must unite, not at the expense of the poor, but by laying down a joint and fair framework, which is a key prerequisite for a peaceful world.
In spite of the disputes which sometimes arise in connection with practical policies, our core values are the same.
We have fared extremely well in Europe with a combination of these three factors, and it is because these relations were in place that this Europe of ours is, by and large, free today.
We should make it quite plain that we are not building the European Union in opposition to the United States, but to make it strong and enable it to become a partner of the United States once again, as only those who are strong can become partners.
There is, however, another aspect to which thought must be given.
The EU has treaties, association agreements and suchlike with nearly every country in the world, and the Americans have NAFTA, APEC, and others, but apart from NATO no contractual agreements exist between the EU and America.
For this reason, we should ensure the eventual creation of a transatlantic marketplace, which would help us in many ways; for example, in organising competition sensibly and in a way which does not violate multilateral frameworks, in jointly protecting our interests and in standing up for our core values.
I believe this to be one of the main challenges facing us.
Today we adopted the Constitution.
Victor Hugo once said that he dreamed of a Common Assembly which would unite Europe in peace and maintain relations with the other great democracy on the far side of the Atlantic.
I believe that this must be our goal, particularly on a day like today, when we have just voted in favour of the Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will follow very similar lines to MrÂ Brokâs, although I will be focusing rather more on economic relations.
The resolution includes a paragraph on the idea of a transatlantic marketplace, a proposal which has already been put forward in several of Parliamentâs resolutions.
It is an extremely simple idea, based on the premise that our economic integration is much deeper than we are aware and than we perceive it to be, as well as on the premise that this economic integration facilitates healthy growth and secures jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and hence enables us to help the whole world participate in this prosperity.
This applies to both the multilateral and bilateral agendas.
What we lack, though, is a rational view of this economic and social reality in the political sphere.
This means that we cannot continue with the existing New Transatlantic Agenda on its own, and especially not with the Positive Economic Agenda, which is far too technical and apolitical, as well as being impossible to explain to the public.
Changes must therefore be made to these agendas, and we must develop some kind of plan, idea or strategy to form the basis of this transatlantic marketplace.
What is needed is therefore not a free-trade zone, but a genuine harmonisation of the two economies, which in fact already exists in reality.
The idea of the internal market must be adopted, realities acknowledged, geopolitical and geostrategic changes which have taken place in the world recognised and a model applied that already exists in the sectors of competition and trade, where experts work together across the Atlantic.
One need only look at the current figures and the relevant Commission documents â for example the Quinlan and Hamilton report â to see that economic relations are currently very close.
To give but one example; US investment in the Netherlands in 2003 was at approximately the same level as total investment by US companies in the whole of Asia.
I hope that this example will stir the Members of this House into action, and I hope that we can build on it and start to cooperate properly.
Â Â  Mr President, following the election of Mahmoud Abbas and the formation of a new Israeli government said to be in favour of withdrawal, there is renewed hope that progress can at last be made in the peace process.
It is a fragile hope, and the window of opportunity of which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, spoke is a narrow one.
I would like to see our trans-Atlantic relations strengthened by the resolute commitment that the European Union and the United States must make, that this opportunity be not lost.
The new Palestinian president must indeed be strongly encouraged in his self-confessed willingness to renounce violence and thereby relaunch dialogue.
This courageous stance will, however, become untenable unless he soon â that is to say, between now and the summer â gets distinct indications that this attitude is in no sense a sort of capitulation.
We have always known that this conflict, so long and painful, would, at its end, have neither victor nor vanquished.
Whether rightly or wrongly, the Arab world regards the Americans as having taken Israelâs side.
That is why there are such expectations, and not only in Palestine, that the European Union will balance perspectives and give its own guarantee.
Here more than elsewhere, and now more than ever, our expectation of you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that this necessary complementarity of influences be reinforced and put to work for the sake of peace and in order to strengthen trans-Atlantic relations, which is indispensable.
Â Â  â Mr President, the course of transatlantic relations is characterised by the single imperialist policy of the United States and the European Union against the peoples.
You have together unleashed three wars against the peoples.
This is the first and major merit.
Secondly, there is the common policy of serving and consolidating the interests of big business; division and competition for the sharing out of markets and spheres of influence.
The decisions by the summit in Dublin set in motion the replacement of the NATO army in Bosnia by the euro-army, approved the aggressive plan for the Middle East, ratified and legalised the occupation of Iraq, promoted terrorist policy against the peoples and applied new anti-democratic measures, such as biometric data, global personal files and much more.
A joint attack on pension systems and labour relations was likewise decided, together with the creation of better conditions for action by big business.
The review of the transatlantic programme being debated expresses the demands of European and American big business to speed up anti-grass roots measures and the aggressive policy.
That is why the workers, the peoples of Europe, have no delusions about the character of the European Union and the United States of America.
Besides, you even accept here in the house that you have common values.
To close, Mr Bush is coming, but he will have a macabre escort, the hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians murdered.
The people of Europe will ...
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, leading EU politicians throughout the EU, and also in this House, have made certain statements and expressed certain opinions that underestimate the role played by the United States in the history of Europe.
They also underestimate the importance of that role, both over the past few decades and at present.
Such statements and opinions should be regarded as highly irresponsible, because transatlantic cooperation provides us with an opportunity to find common answers to the global threats facing humanity, such as poverty, natural disasters and environmental degradation.
It also enables us to work together to combat AIDS and terrorist attacks.
Unfortunately neither the European Union in its present guise nor the super-state outlined in the draft Constitution, with all its bureaucratic red tape, wastefulness and sluggishness, are capable of reacting in an appropriate manner to global challenges of a political or economic nature.
The Americans take effective action and have a free market, whilst we have merely a caricature of such things in the shape of the Lisbon strategy.
Relations between the European Union and the USA should be characterised not by stereotypes, an unjustified feeling of superiority and a desire to compete at any price, but by political realism, and we should engage in practical transatlantic cooperation instead of becoming mired in pseudo-platitudes.
Â Â  Mr President, it is of the utmost importance that we should, from time to time, deliberate about the state of transatlantic relations.
The past few years have done nothing to improve our relationship with the United States.
This is undoubtedly largely attributable to the US intervention in Iraq, but there are also other problems, and one that springs to mind is the unacceptable pressure brought to bear by the US administration, and the American President himself, in favour of Turkey being allowed to join the European Union.
I do not think it does transatlantic dialogue any good if one party interferes in the otherâs internal policy matters.
Having said that, we should also admit that there is in this Parliament a certain kind of primary anti-Americanism, which certainly does not make things any easier.
Europe and the United States share the same values, democracy, human rights, and the free market economy being among them.
These are often referred to as universal values, but they are, in fact, Western, or rather European.
We also share a number of common enemies.
In the first place, there is the threat of Islamic terrorism, even though opinions differ as to how to address this problem.
In this respect, we should not remain fixated too much on multilateralism versus unilateralism.
In practice, multilateralism often means that we hide behind bodies such as the United Nations, so that, in practice, little or nothing ends up being done.
We should not blame the Americans for our weaknesses in the military field and in the field of external policy; we have only ourselves to blame.
We could take a leaf out of their book.
Just think of the tsunami in South-East Asia.
American military were very quickly on the ground to provide practical aid.
The European Union was present in the form of Commissioner Michel who came to take stock of the damage and to share out a few bags of rice in front of the television cameras.
The contrast was harrowing and spoke volumes.
Â Â  Mr President, I share the view of those, in particular our spokesman, Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, who have said that this issue of transatlantic relations should now be focused on what we have in common rather than on our differences, which we all know and which many speakers have mentioned.
It is a time not to look back in anger but to look forward with hope.
In this context, with the arrival of the President of the United States next month, is it not possible for the Commission, the Council and Parliament to think of three major areas where we could cooperate in the terms we have used in our joint resolution on a Community of action?
A Community of action that will seek to develop a peace initiative in the Middle East; a Community of action that will search for global security in the fight against international terrorism, cooperation in development assistance and in facing the new global challenges of the disasters in the Middle East which the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned.
Last but not least, a Community of action that will pick up the ideas which, I hope, the Commission will come forward with on strengthening the economic partnership.
That is the idea, which Parliament has endorsed on several occasions, of completing the transatlantic market and fixing a date of 2015, so that we can really mobilise the communities on both sides of the Atlantic to complete a barrier-free transatlantic market.
Last but not least, the Commission will be coming forward with its review of the New Transatlantic Agenda, and we in this House have insisted on many occasions â and once again in the joint resolution â that we should take the opportunity to upgrade this relationship; show that it is visible to the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic, and not exclude, as the new transatlantic agenda does today, the political communities.
We need to find a way to bring all the actors together in what we have called a partnership agreement, because I am certain that if, with the arrival of the US President, the opportunity is taken by the incoming administrations on both sides to shape a new strengthened transatlantic partnership, we all will be beneficiaries.
Â Â  Mr President, if you are to build a genuine partnership, there must at least be two parties to it, so can we expect from George Bushâs second term something different to the unilateral policy of his first?
The way the South-East Asian post-tsunami crisis has been handled would tend to lead one to answer in the negative.
The Bush administrationâs initial response was to propose the setting up of a coalition of donor countries around the United States, rather, of course, than place its intervention under the authority of the United Nations.
The European view of this initiative is that it is a sign of âno changeâ from the previous term.
Europe must say to America, as one does to a dear friend, âyou are cutting yourself off; your policies are isolating you.â
Not all the coalitions in the world will be able to do anything about it; they will not be able to paper over public opinionâs profound crisis of confidence in the United States.
One French essayist summed up this widespread sentiment in these words: âThe United States is in the process of becoming a problem for the world.
We were more used to seeing them as a solution.â
Let the Americans defend their interests, let them resolutely defend their security; nobody will hold that against them.
What causes doubts to arise, though, is the Messianic and ideological motivation that the US administration attaches to its intervention in Iraq.
These doubts take root when human rights violations involve all the belligerent parties in Iraq, and doubts become grave concern when whole populations are infected with hatred of the West, as a reaction to an ill-thought-out military intervention which obviously underestimated how resistant the people of Iraq would be to the transition to democracy thought up by the Pentagon.
The Americans did not always espouse this doctrine, though; in the past, they chose to focus their foreign policy on the search for consensus and a sort of general interest.
They preferred agreement to coercion and acted within a multilateral framework.
In so doing, the USA performed its duties as the worldâs major power and strengthened its authority.
The American intervention in Iraq put an end to that, but it is not too late to change, provided that the Americans themselves take the initiative in so doing.
What must come first is the normalisation of their relationship with the United Nations.
The UN is the sole authority competent to decide in favour of international military intervention, and we must invite the United States to join Europe in committing itself, on the one hand, to multilateralism and respect for international law and, on the other, to reform of the United Nations, particularly as regards the Security Council and the way it is made up.
Â Â  It is not only necessary to strengthen transatlantic relations now, but it is also possible.
This relationship must not be based on rivalry of self-interest, but only on common interest and values.
Coequal partnership is needed, but it requires a strong and united Europe capable of action.
Without it, we are not able to enjoy the benefits of transatlantic relations.
We need not deny that we have disagreements and conflicts of interest, but we must realise that we have a common interest in the most important issues, including the war against terrorism, the fight against nuclear proliferation, the Doha process and even the question of changes in climate.
I believe that there is an opportunity to renew our relations now.
President Bushâs upcoming visit can reaffirm this chance, and we must also do our best not to miss it.
Â Â  Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, PresidentÂ Bushâs approach to the major challenges of international policy in his second term is likely to differ somewhat from the approach he adopted in his first.
It is likely to be less unilateral, more political, involve less use of force and be more open to dialogue with international organisations.
This means that his visit to Brussels in February will be all the more important, and, as MrÂ Schmit has said, it ought to act as a major impetus towards more open transatlantic relations.
It should also be an opportunity to familiarise ourselves with US plans for the next four years, and to set out our European expectations.
In this respect, it would be useful if President Bush were to speak before this House.
After all, he is a representative of Europeâs closest ally, so why should he not be invited to speak here?
At noon we voted on the resolution on the Constitutional Treaty.
The Constitution is intended to help create a European identity, but there are those in Europe who would like to create this common European identity in opposition to America, by means of cheap anti-Americanism.
This is not the right approach to take.
Europe and America are linked by common values, as well as by their history, their Christian heritage and their common strategic interests.
This is something that should not be forgotten when differences of opinion arise.
It should not be forgotten either when we face new challenges, as our security also depends on coming up with a wise response to these challenges.
I believe there are three key areas in which the United States and Europe should stand shoulder to shoulder in 2005.
Reference has already been made to the Middle East and to the need for peaceful solutions, as well as to common security.
I should like to note that attention must also be paid to Eastern Europe, or in other words Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and to our common concerns regarding anti-democratic tendencies in the Russian Federation.
The European Union and the United States should cooperate in order to set the process of democracy in motion in countries where this has not yet happened, such as Belarus, and to support pro-democratic trends in countries where the transition to democracy has already begun, such as Ukraine.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we want Europe to be a friend of the United States.
No global problem can be addressed without cooperation between the European Union and the United States.
We therefore think it is right to take the opportunity offered by the new signals coming from the US administration to rebuild cooperation between the European Union and the United States and, in this context, President Bushâs visit will certainly be an important occasion.
American decisions have certainly played a major part in the problems that have arisen in recent years, but the splits within Europe and our inability to put across our point of view have also been a factor.
I therefore want to underline the fact that Mr Bush must find a Europe that is more united, true to its principles and proud of its identity.
We must highlight what we have in common with the United States â freedom, freedom of the economy, democracy â but also what sets us apart, at least in relation to the current prevailing trends there â multilateralism, the primacy of law over force, and therefore the primacy of international institutions, which need to be reformed, the rejection of the death penalty and protection of the environment.
Europe has to be able to influence the United Statesâ decisions, and it will be able to do so if it is united, if it is not split between a traditional, sterile anti-Americanism and the choice of those who rush to side with the coalition of the winners.
Or the coalition of the willing, rather, because they are not winners, as the disaster in Iraq shows.
Europe should therefore be itself, united and true to its principles.
That will be the best basis for a more fruitful and constructive transatlantic relationship.
Â Â  Mr President, relations between the United States of America and Europe are going through a critical phase.
Since the collapse of communism the main focus of attention for the United States and NATO has moved to Central Asia, and the EU is developing its own defence cooperation strategy.
There are many issues that the United States and the EU disagree about: they must face up to the fact and discuss them.
It is important that transatlantic relations in the future are built on dialogue, not confrontation.
Whilst terrorist attacks might increase the feeling of solidarity between Europeans and Americans, they have also highlighted the difference between their ways of thinking and acting.
The relationship is nevertheless unique and based not only on common interests and values, but also on competition.
Regarding global issues, the EU and the United States need to act in a context of broader cooperation. Cooperation must be increased on environmental issues, natural disasters and humanitarian catastrophes.
The EU and the United States should be involved together in the financing and building of effective early-warning systems in areas prone to risk.
Finally, I wish to say that I appreciate the fact that President Bush will be visiting Brussels right at the start of his second term.
Â Â  Many thanks, MrÂ President.
Poland has good reasons for attaching particular value to both the United Statesâ presence on the European continent and to cooperation between the EU and the USA. This is because of our geopolitical situation and historical experiences.
Yet at the same time, Poland wishes to be a committed and entirely credible member of the European Community.
We feel European, and we see our future as intimately bound up with that of the European Union.
This places a clear duty on us to undertake efforts aimed at achieving the best possible relations between the EU and the USA, as we are aware of their particular value.
The aim of such relations is security and stability, both inside and outside the Euro-Atlantic area.
Another way to ensure this security and stability, and perhaps even the most important way, is through support for democracy wherever a chance presents itself of achieving such democracy.
This results from a faith in our values and from the conviction that putting power in the hands of citizens is the best guarantee of stability and security.
What requirements must be met to achieve democracy?
Firstly, societies must consent to the assistance they are offered.
Secondly, the root causes of threats to stability, whether economic or social, must be eliminated.
Finally, and this is an important point; extensive cooperation must take place within the Euro-Atlantic structure.
Many examples can be found to demonstrate the importance of these three requirements for the attainment of our goals.
The latter have not been attained in Iraq or in the Middle East, where it is difficult to talk of success, although the situation in Afghanistan has already improved somewhat.
We can, however, celebrate a genuine triumph in Ukraine.
We acted in line with the wishes of the people of Ukraine and eliminated the root causes of threats.
In addition, extensive cooperation took place within the Euro-Atlantic structure.
Yet we should not forget that long-term support and long-term cooperation, in particular between the European Union and the USA, are needed to ensure long-term success in Ukraine.
The proposed common foreign policy, provided for in the Constitutional Treaty, may prove to be an important instrument, allowing Europeans to act appropriately.
This policy leads us to hope that our support for a free and democratic Ukraine will have the desired effect.
I thank you.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, since the end of the Cold War transatlantic relations have undergone a transformation, and have become one of the pillars of a novel and newly emerging world order.
There can be no doubt that these relations are no longer exceptional, as they were during the last century.
They are, however, a reliable and stable point of reference for both the USA and the European Union in a new international context.
Despite all the differences between American and European policies â differences which became even more pronounced during PresidentÂ Bushâs first term â the European Union and the USA are still each otherâs closest partners with regard to both political and military matters and economic and cultural issues.
The European Union cannot tolerate unilateral measures by the United States that take no account of the architecture of international relations.
America should not exploit its military superiority to impose its political will on the rest of the world and to place itself above international law.
It should not exploit such superiority to dominate the political situation throughout the world.
The modern world does not need US domination.
Instead, it needs intelligent cooperation between the European Union and the USA on the fight against terrorism and against the causes of terrorism, and on measures to extend democracy and ensure respect for human rights, respect for international law and the development of a global civil society.
It also needs joint initiatives to promote economic growth in developing countries, sustainable development, the elimination of hunger and the reduction of poverty on Earth.
As I have already said, at the beginning of the twenty-first century the world does not need US domination, but cooperation between the European Union and the USA.
At the same time, we must also subject anti-American sentiments in the European Union today to a critical analysis, as we cannot allow a pan-European nationalism opposed to America to emerge in Europe.
Europe does not need to create an enemy overseas in order to construct its own political identity.
In other words, Europe does not need the new kind of ideology HannaÂ Arendt warned against in the 1950s.
Quite the reverse is the case.
The European Union needs to take measures to familiarise modern America and its citizens with the achievements of European integration in recent years.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate has rightly highlighted the need actively to rebuild relationships between the USA and Europe.
That need has been recognised by almost all sides across the House. Certainly it is reflected within our Parliament's delegation for US relations.
This is not only because we enjoy the most important global trading relationship, a trading volume of more than EUR 1 billion per day, but also because we share a common interest in finding solutions to major issues such as climate change, terrorism, security and peace in the Middle East.
Since the re-election of President Bush, we have noted the many positive comments from the US Administration in support of better relations.
Europe has seen visits last month from Secretary of State Colin Powell, today from Head of Homeland Security Tom Ridge and will see a visit tomorrow from Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.
I understand that President Chirac will visit Washington in the next few weeks.
All this is welcome but these visits have almost all taken place within the context of bilateral relations rather than through visits to EU institutions.
On the day when this Parliament has strongly supported the new EU Constitution, it is worth noting that the US still largely sees its European relations in these bilateral terms.
I have high expectations that our new ambassador, MrÂ Bruton, will be able to raise the profile of the EU.
I suggest that he be invited in future to attend debates of this nature.
I also welcome President Bush's intention to visit the EU institutions next month, but I await further details of how widespread the US authorities consider EU institutions to be.
For instance, I am not aware that he has any intention to address this Parliament.
I believe that our Parliament also bears some responsibility here.
In 1999 we gave our full support to the creation of a transatlantic legislative dialogue, major parts of which we and the US have never implemented.
As Mrs Mann said previously, we gave our support to the creation of a single transatlantic market by 2015, but we have not seen many steps towards taking that forward.
I believe we need a renewed sense of purpose to reforge the transatlantic relationship.
I trust that we will take the very many positive ideas and words of this debate forward into practical and effective steps, which will be to the mutual advantage of both sides.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief, as I see that there is very wide agreement on the need not only to strengthen our trans-Atlantic relationships, but also to resolve the differences that have recently become apparent, and build a strong relationship across the Atlantic.
The idea of setting out a sort of programme, a list of economic and political priorities, strikes me as a useful one, and one on which work needs to be done, particularly in view of President Bushâs visit to Brussels.
The idea of creating a transatlantic market place is not an entirely new one, but it must be gone into more deeply and thought through in a mature way. It is important in its own way, provided, of course, that it fits in with our concept of multilateralism.
Transatlantic dialogue therefore needs to be stepped up at every level, and the reason why I include your House in this is that, although power in America is in the hands of the administration, that is to say, the President, there is also an important centre of power within the Congress.
I therefore think that it is very important to build up inter-parliamentary relations within the context of a renewed dialogue across the Atlantic.
Someone pointed out that we had had nothing to say about Canada.
I would remind you that the Prime Minister and President of the Council made reference to Canada during his speech this morning.
It cannot be denied that our relations with Canada are of crucial importance in the context of this trans-Atlantic dialogue, and so we treat them with the importance that they deserve, but the fact is that, today, we have focussed primarily on trans-Atlantic relations in respect of the United States, in view of what has happened, and in view, not least, of President Bushâs visit.
Â Â  .
Mr President, listening carefully to the discussion and suggestions I detect a very positive spirit, which encourages me that we can take the debate, and our relations with the United States, still further.
It is true that we have been through a turbulent period, but it is also true that we have now emerged from that period, showing that the transatlantic relationship is still strong and durable.
The EU-US summit of June 2004 clearly demonstrated how much we have in common and the readiness of both sides to focus efforts on the key challenges ahead.
It could be described as cooperation between partners with common interests and common values who are competing with one other in a fair way.
I would like to touch on matters that have already been raised concerning the question of the transatlantic agenda.
As you know, the relationship today is based on the Transatlantic declaration of 1990 and the new Transatlantic agenda declaration and action plan of 1995.
Those are the instruments which guide the new relationship with the United States.
However, following calls from the European Parliament, and most recently from the Foreign Affairs Committee Resolution of April 2004, we are reassessing the framework for our relations.
We are launching an independent study, to be completed early this year, assessing the current cooperation framework.
It will include an analysis of alternative preferences for cooperation.
The contractor will also look into the advantages and disadvantages of the framework agreement.
However, what we have always held to be important is the substance of the relationship.
We believe that it is the substance that matters and try to focus on that.
Concerning economic issues and economic cooperation, I would underline that the Commission strongly supports the aim of closer economic cooperation between the European Union and the United States.
The last EU-US summit called for a forward-looking strategy to promote integration, drawing on ideas from both sides of the Atlantic.
The consultation of stakeholders ended in December 2004, and we have recently been assessing the results.
The aim is to identify and overcome the real obstacles facing economic cooperators, with the new strategy to be presented to the next EU-US summit in 2005.
It is too early to commit to any option at this stage, but we should certainly continue to reinforce cooperation in the areas highlighted, especially in the European Parliament's recent resolutions on the transatlantic partnership.
The European Parliament's input will be welcomed as we review our economic relations with our US partners.
We are facing many common threats: international terrorism, Aids, poverty and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
We need to be constructive in engaging on issues where we have differences, such as climate change, the International Criminal Court and trade disputes.
It is clear that EU-US agreement is a necessary condition for progress on global issues.
The recent catastrophe which we all faced is a clear lesson to us all that we cannot do things in any other way.
We need to lay the groundwork for an effective multilateral system, based on a revitalised UnitedÂ Nations in which the United States fully participates.
Finally, I should also underline that relations with Canada â which have been mentioned â are truly flourishing.
That may be why more has not been said about them.
The transatlantic partnership with Canada has always been an extremely important relationship for us.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a simple reason for this.
Canada has already been mentioned several times, but I believe that this report and the resolution should really concentrate on Europe and the USA.
If the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission wish to make repeated references to Canada, however â and such references are indeed sensible and necessary â I would ask them not to forget Mexico.
As Chairman of the Delegation to the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, this is a matter of some importance to me.
If we are going to discuss NAFTA, then we should discuss NAFTA as a whole.
I would ask you to bear this in mind.
Â Â  â MrsÂ Mann, that was not exactly a point of order according to the Rules of Procedure.
At the end of the debate I have received six motions for resolutions(1).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on debt relief for developing countries.
Â Â  . Mr President, this debate on debt relief is opportune.
Discussions on debt relief for the countries seriously affected by the disaster in the Indian Ocean are going on in Paris.
Relief of this sort must be on a substantial scale and be implemented rapidly.
I might mention, incidentally, that the Paris Club is meeting today to discuss the possibility of a moratorium on the debts of the countries that want such relief.
Let us acknowledge, though, that the situation of Iraq, which gave rise to this question and this debate, is quite specific and quite exceptional.
The debt relief for the Republic of Iraq, and I would call it substantial debt relief, which was decided on by the Paris Club in November, is without doubt indispensable if the countryâs economy is to be rebuilt, and also if a sovereign Iraq with democratic and legitimate institutions is to be reborn.
Nevertheless, the question of the relief needed, as I have just said, for Iraqâs debts, also arises â and, let me say, with the same urgency â with reference to the least developed countries.
It would be incomprehensible, not to say absurd, for debt relief to be granted only to a country that had fallen victim to a natural disaster or to conflict.
Absolute poverty itself gives rise to real disasters on a daily basis, in the shape of malnutrition, chronic illiteracy, high rates of infant mortality, AIDS, and more besides.
It stands in the way of development and promotes all sorts of conflicts causing thousands, indeed millions of deaths, which the media often ignore and pass over in silence.
We see, then, that the relief of the poorest countriesâ debts is at the heart of the fight against poverty as well as of support for a policy aimed at eradicating it and of the relaunch of a development process in line with the millennium objectives.
A high level of debt and a debt burden no longer in proportion to a countryâs economic capacity hamper any prospect of development and lead, paradoxically, not to the hoped-for economic upturn, but to the rampant destitution of the poorest countriesâ populations.
Faced with this state of affairs, the European Union has not been inactive, nor will it be so in the future.
The Monterrey conference saw it make practical commitments, the potential revision of which will be debated at the April General Affairs and External Relations Council.
Its efforts at relieving the debts of less developed countries took practical form in the HIPC (High Indebted Poor Countries) initiative, which was proposed by the World Bank and the IMF in 1996 and reinforced in 1999.
This is a coordinated approach aimed at bringing the poorest countriesâ debts down to a sustainable level, including not only public, bilateral and multilateral debt, but also trading debt.
This initiative has the potential to help forty-two countries, thirty-eight of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.
The results achieved to date are positive but, as yet, insufficient.
Little impact has been had on trading debt.
Around 60% of the HIPC initiativeâs funding was provided by the European Union.
A number of creditors have not yet done anything about relieving the debt.
The United Kingdomâs forthcoming presidency of both G8 and the EU has made debt relief for the least developed countries a priority objective.
We want to work closely with the United Kingdom, thus enabling the European Union to develop a coherent and ambitious approach in this area.
Debt relief must continue to be one of the priority objectives of the EUâs cooperation and development policy.
It cannot be addressed in isolation from other policies: trade policy, including the adoption of a new generalised preference system, positive conclusions from the Doha round that are favourable to developing countries, increased development aid concentrating on the eradication of poverty, support for good governance, and the settlement and prevention of conflicts.
Â Â  . Mr President, we all agree that for some developing countries external indebtedness is a major obstacle for growth and development.
We should acknowledge the merits of the debt relief initiative currently applied, the Highly Indebted Poor Countries â or HIPC âInitiative, which was launched in 1996.
This is the most comprehensive debt relief initiative ever taken.
It will reduce the debt burden of the highly indebted poor countries by approximately two-thirds, demonstrating a commitment to poverty reduction.
The Commission and the Member States have gone beyond the HIPC requirements.
Most Member States have committed themselves to cancelling 100% of the bilateral claims.
The Commission has done the same for all special loans in least developed countries eligible for HIPC debt relief.
However, it is now widely recognised that HIPC relief will fail to ensure long-term debt sustainability.
It is clear that more needs to be done for the poor countries that benefit from the HIPC Initiative.
Pressure is increasing to extend debt relief to the other developing countries.
The World Bank and the IMF are developing a new framework for long-term debt sustainability in low-income countries. This should help to prevent the accumulation of new debt.
The Commission is following this debate closely to ensure the transparency of the decision-making process.
The Paris Club of creditor governments has developed the so-called Evian approach to deal with non-HIPC countries.
It takes into account debt sustainability considerations, allowing the Paris Club to adopt its response to the financial situation of the debtor country and to make the resolution of crises more orderly, timely and predictable.
One application of these new rules was the Iraqi case.
The Commission is not against debt relief in favour of middle-income countries.
It supports the Evian approach of the Paris Club, which looks at the financial situation of each country rather than defining standard terms as has been done in the case of Iraq.
Iraq is not indebted to the Commission but, as a sign of solidarity with the Iraqi people, the Community pledged a contribution of EUR 200 million to the Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq at the Madrid Conference.
However, the Commission does not want assistance for Iraq, whether through debt relief or other mechanisms, to be given at the expense of the poorest countries.
More recently, the UK and the US have both called for 100% cancellation of multilateral debt for low-income countries, although with different approaches towards its financing.
The proposal of full cancellation may appear attractive, but it entails risks in terms of aid allocation.
The Commission's finance study demonstrates that the HIPC Initiative has already distorted the allocation of aid because the levels of debt relief are not related indicators of poverty, nor â and this is very important â do they reflect performance in tackling poverty.
The countries benefiting most from the initiative are by no means the best performers or the poorest countries within the group.
Some examples will illustrate my point.
The country benefiting most on a per capita basis from HIPC debt relief is Guyana, with USD 769 per capita received.
It ranks 92nd in the Human Development Index.
However, Niger, which ranks 174th in that index, receives only USD 48 per capita relief.
The total cancellation of debt for all African countries would lead to considerable inequalities in the distortion of aid among them, measured by their relative poverty levels.
Eritrea â one of the poorest countries in Africa â would receive USD 56 per capita, while the Seychelles, one of the richest countries of the continent, would receive USD 2 572 per capita, which makes a huge difference.
Further debt relief could lead to further distortions in aid allocation.
In a world of limited resources, debt relief granted to middle-income countries should not detract from the amounts available to the neediest ones.
So, debt relief is a bad aid allocation mechanism, but it can be a good way of delivering aid, as it provides a quick method of disbursement, ensuring a predictable flow of resources directly into the budget with limited transaction costs.
It could also be used to protect vulnerable, low-income countries from the effect of exogenous shocks.
In these cases, some sort of temporary relief of the debt could help mitigate the adverse effects of external shocks on the poverty-reduction strategies of beneficiary countries.
That is also the case as regards the moratoriums, which, as already mentioned, were discussed today by the presidency in Paris in relation to the tsunami-affected countries.
To sum up, debt relief is not a panacea which by itself creates new resources, nor does it automatically translate into services for poor people or economic growth.
However, it may be an effective way to deliver support and a good way to provide swift assistance after shocks.
To tackle poverty and to attain the Millennium Development Goals, the real challenge is to ensure appropriate levels of development financing.
We need to reach agreement on new and sufficiently ambitious targets for official development assistance by 2009 for us to have a real prospect of attaining those goals.
Debt relief can be a useful tool in that quest, but it can by no means offer a really full response.
Â Â  . Mr President, the debt burden is a major problem and is once again receiving extra attention as a possible means of helping with reconstruction following the tsunami.
I am glad to see the debt burden high on the agenda.
Debt relief is one of the millennium objectives for development.
Interest charges often weigh down heavily on the budgets of the developing countries, and, in some cases, cripple further development.
Although we have to look into what can be done about this, the subject is a complex one and does not lend itself to impulsive action.
I can imagine that for the countries affected by the tsunami, a freeze will be granted for payment of interest and redemption, but in general, debt relief should not be dependent on incidental tragic events.
There is a difference between cancelling and relieving debt.
Our group is not in favour of general cancellation of all debts, which some in this House advocate.
We say âyesâ to debt relief, but only where it is necessary, only for the poorest countries and always subject to conditions.
What we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have contributed to a resolution is a statement to which, indeed, the Commissioner has made reference: debt relief is not a panacea against poverty.
We must realise that the amount that will possibly be written off will be deducted from the amounts available for development cooperation.
Debt relief alone does not offer a country new sources of income, neither builds schools or hospitals nor reduces poverty in those countries; on its own, it provides no incentive for further development, the funds available for which will be considerably smaller after debt cancellation.
Where the development of a country is concerned, an important part of the responsibility lies with the country itself.
Debt relief makes sense only if it goes hand in hand with good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, and investment in the countryâs own population; in short, if the money actually ends up with the poorest.
Debt relief cannot, then, be a goal in itself; it is meaningful only if it is actually an incentive for development.
Then we can be generous, but â as is the case in all forms of development aid â that generosity cannot be unconditional.
Â Â  . â The European Union and the international community are preparing to write off some of Iraqâs debts and, at this moment, the debts of the countries ravaged by the tsunami.
While I am glad to see this, these are reactions in the heat of the moment, associated with a pressing current situation, and it is the debt problem of the global south as a whole that must be treated with the same urgency and speed, for this disturbing reality with which we are faced is indeed urgent.
The amount of debt repaid by the South in a year far exceeds the annual total of public development aid, and it is the South that is funding the North.
Over twenty years, the countries of the South will have already repaid six euros for every euro borrowed and they will still be being asked for another four.
If the South is to make progress, its debts must be cut back, and, today, practical responses are only slowly forthcoming.
I welcome the United Kingdomâs initiative, it having announced its intention of cancelling its share in the debt incurred by the poorest countries to the World Bank, and I am impatient to see the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as a whole do likewise.
Were they all to follow the British example, 45Â million more children would be able to go to school, 140Â million people would be able to have access to clean drinking water â provided, of course, that the amount of cancelled debt was added to the current development aid, and provided that the North stopped taking with one hand what it gives with the other.
Right now, it is imperative that a global, fair and sustainable solution be found to the problem of debt, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is persuaded that it is the European Union and its Member States that can take the initiative in this.
They can do this by writing off all the poorest countriesâ debts, by taking measures to alleviate the position of threshold countries, by no longer imposing âstructural adjustmentsâ as conditions and, of course, as has been said, we have to make this part of an all-round aid policy and, with all haste, seek new sources of finance.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I am glad we are having this debate today on debt relief.
It is vital that even as we pay necessary and proper attention to tsunami relief, we also remain focused on the wider and longer-term issue of poverty reduction and the millennium development goals.
Debt relief is key to achieving the millennium development goals.
In the past, the measure used to calculate whether debt was sustainable was a calculation of debt payment against export income, but the really crucial question is how much of the national budget is being used to repay debt.
In many African countries, debt service payments still take up a larger share of the budget than health services.
In Ghana, for example, 11% of government spending goes into repaying debt, while only 9% is spent on health.
If we want debt relief to contribute to achieving the millennium development goals, then we need to acknowledge that debt is unsustainable wherever it prevents a country financing its poverty reduction programmes.
It follows that international money to fund debt relief must be in addition to, and not instead of, aid.
I am very concerned that the United States envisages a reduction in aid budgets to fund debt cancellation.
In fact, debt cancellation needs to go hand-in-hand with an increase in aid and the ALDE resolution includes a renewed pledge that Member States give 0.7% of GDP as overseas development assistance.
It also follows that debt reduction can only contribute to achieving the millennium development goals if it takes place under good governance.
Nothing will be achieved if the money saved through debt relief is spent by a corrupt dictator on expensive palaces or, even worse, on attack helicopters to terrorise a section of the population.
The governments of developing countries have a responsibility to invest in their own people, but we in the European institutions have a responsibility to make sure that flexible mechanisms for debt relief are available.
Â Â  . Madam President, the world finds itself in an extensive and continuing debt crisis, which continues to be one of the main obstacles preventing countries of the South, or at least a great many of them, from achieving independent and dynamic economic growth.
This is made clear by two figures; firstly, a great many of the poorest countries are forced to spend over 40% of their GNP on debt servicing.
In such circumstances, independent economic growth becomes all but impossible, and this is why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative.
Secondly, for every euro we now give in development aid to the countries of the South, an average of nearly EURÂ 1.50 is paid back to the countries of the North in interest payments.
This is another reason why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative; given that Indonesia, the country we are currently debating, would have to pay back EURÂ 4Â billion this year, it is abundantly clear that this would immediately cancel out any kind of development or disaster aid.
I was therefore delighted to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say today that he was in favour of full debt cancellation for Indonesia.
We need an international conference on debt relief, but the Paris Club, being no more than a meeting of creditors, is incapable of staging one.
We need an international conference in which participants include creditor countries and debtor countries, as well as civil societies which have been affected and which would act as monitoring bodies, with all participants having equal rights.
Both the European Union and this House should lend their support to the holding of such a conference.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, noÂ one can have a good conscience about asking the developing countries to keep on repaying their debts, as they have already paid these debts back seven times over, and yet their liabilities are four times greater than they were to begin with.
I should therefore like to contradict you on one point, MrÂ PotoÄnik; you quoted absolute per capita figures, yet such figures are not the decisive factor.
Every inhabitant of Brandenburg, my home, is in debt to the tune of EURÂ 16Â 000, but our national economy is structured in such a way that we can cope with it.
The national economies of the developing countries cannot cope with such debt, however.
In my opinion, therefore, the main issue at stake is not whether we grant a debt deferment, debt reduction, debt moratorium or suchlike, but whether debts are cancelled, as these countries need the money that at present they spend almost exclusively on interest â not even on repayment â to tackle their economic, social and environmental problems.
We would be helping them to help themselves.
Anyone who thinks that this would cripple the rich industrial nations should take note of the fact that the Iraq war costs the USA USDÂ 150Â million every day.
President Bush has asked Congress for a further USDÂ 80Â billion, and yet Pakistanâs debts run to a mere USDÂ 11Â billion.
A comparison of these figures makes it obvious that the debt could be cancelled entirely, and this must be our goal.
Furthermore, it is often said â and I have heard it said again in this House today â that debt is offset by development aid.
I am sorry, but if the political will is there, and if we genuinely wish to help these countries, the poorest countriesâ debt must be cancelled entirely.
In addition, the rich countries must finally adhere to their voluntary commitment of spending 0.7% of GDP on development aid.
Such an example should really be set for these countries and for the European Union.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has undertaken to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, which is both an ambitious and essential undertaking.
The external debt burden of developing countries is an insurmountable problem.
It makes it impossible to reduce the proportion of the population living in utter poverty.
Having understood this, the European Union has already earmarked USD one million for debt relief.
The HIPC Initiative encompassed 42 of the world's poorest countries.
The amount of debt to be written off for 26 of these countries will be 50% or USD 25 billion.
Other financial instruments will also be used.
These and other measures, however, are still insufficient to decrease the external debt burden of poor countries.
Therefore new opportunities and focused measures must be sought.
A broader spectrum of countries should be given the opportunity of qualifying for debt relief, similar to Iraq.
Debt Relief International should be more closely involved, and a real opportunity to escape from economic stagnation should be provided, moving purposefully towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals.
Â Â  â Madam President, on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, I should like to express my great satisfaction and my appreciation of the European Union, the Member Statesâ governments, the international agencies, the humanitarian organisations and every individual European citizen for the colossal solidarity that they have shown in recent weeks.
I welcome the decision made two hours ago by the members of the Paris Club to grant three countries affected by the tsunami a moratorium on their debt repayments.
This comes after the agreement in November 2004 to cancel 80% of Iraqâs foreign debt, as a tangible sign of support for the reconstruction of that country.
Furthermore, the examination by the Extraordinary General Affairs and External Relations Council, which met last week, of the follow-up measures for the affected countries â such as trade support and bilateral partnerships â had a positive outcome.
My greatest hope, however, is to be able to see a similar commitment not only at times of war or natural disaster but on a continuous basis for those countries where conflict, epidemics and hunger are unfortunately on their daily agenda.
According to the United Nations, in fact, there are at least 14 forgotten crises, most of them affecting African countries, for which the United Nations has requested support worth USDÂ 1.7Â billion.
For the sake of those and other developing countries, we have to aim at fully achieving the Millennium Objectives, something that we are still far from doing, as well as reducing or cancelling their debt, if possible.
That is an appropriate, necessary and urgent commitment.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to join the previous speaker in thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Schmit, for having placed our concerns regarding a new debt relief initiative in a broader context from the very start.
I am somewhat disappointed at the Commissionâs statements, however, which did not go anywhere near far enough.
I agree with MrÂ Schmit that it should not only be the countries affected by the terrible natural disaster that are considered when talking of the implications of foreign debt.
It is not only natural disasters which affect countries; it is also the devastating effects of poverty, which is on the rise throughout the world, as well as the fact that the amount spent by many countries on debt servicing is many times greater than that on social expenditure, and the fact that we are a very long way from meeting the Millennium Development Goals agreed on by all UN members.
We are currently all very proud of our unprecedented readiness to make donations and provide assistance.
I believe that we are entitled to be proud, but â and this is a point I should like to make to the Commission â we must not give a little with one hand and take away a lot with the other.
The relevant figures have already been cited, and we must also ask ourselves whether it is morally justifiable, and compatible with good governance, for poor countries to have paid back the debts they incurred in the 1980s seven times over.
Parliamentâs resolution also states quite clearly that the HIPC Initiative, which has been described by MrÂ PotoÄnik as the most comprehensive debt relief initiative ever undertaken, is only a small step, and is of course by no means enough.
I should like to know what the Council Presidencyâs specific goals in this field are, both working alone and in cooperation with other international partners, as on the basis of your comments my impression is that the driving force on this issue will be the Council, not the Commission.
Â Â  Madam President, I believe we must beware of imagining that reducing or cancelling the debt is an end in itself.
Instead, it is one of the many means at our disposal for aiding development and goes hand in hand with preferential loans, free funds and the system of generalised preferences we are implementing in Europe.
Since this reduction in the debt is not an end in itself but a means, we must, I think, have the decency to bear in mind that it is a means made available through the efforts of our countriesâ taxpayers and that it must therefore, of course, be made conditional upon the achievement of results.
Our partners, and principally our African partners in NEPAD, have also understood perfectly well that they themselves have to make efforts, particularly in terms of good governance and respect for our common values, to put their countries on the road to development.
Where this matter is concerned, let us therefore have the honesty to recognise that the best pupils must be rewarded.
If it is agreed that reducing the debt is an operation in itself, consideration must also be given to the subsequent debt, since no country will, of course, be able to continue its development without getting into debt.
We therefore need to have a forward-looking vision and not just appease our consciences by saying: the debt is reduced or cancelled; now let them get on with it.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for us, cancelling the poorest countriesâ debts is, indeed, an absolute necessity if we wish seriously to tackle North-South inequalities and maldevelopment as much as underdevelopment.
It must nonetheless go hand in hand with the more vigorous combating of corruption, tax havens and globalised financial crime.
Nor can it involve absolving all those, including leaders of states, who have scandalously feathered their own nests out of disregard for their people and for sound budgetary management at even the most basic level.
Cancelling the debt would also constitute a first stage in reforming our development aid policy in depth.
A reconsidered policy of North-South cooperation should thus be based upon much more ambitious objectives, particularly regarding matters relating to energy, water, health and education, and should affirm and clarify the notion of the global public good.
We urgently need a very strong commitment by the EU in this connection, accompanied by clarified objectives and backed by much greater resources â a plan equal in scope to the post-war Marshall Plan, but with a determinedly European name and structure.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I shall first address the Council, because we have in fact just heard that the Paris Club decided a couple of hours ago to freeze the debt of certain countries affected by the tsunami.
We believe this is a short-sighted decision, because we think those countries need not a moratorium but the cancellation of their debt, as had been proposed by almost all the humanitarian aid organisations â Oxfam, ActionAid, etc. You will know more about it than I do, Minister.
In that respect I agree with the Commissioner: a different kind of trade policy is needed.
Thailand was asking us to lower the cost of accessing international markets, but the West is unbending on that point: protectionist barriers cannot be touched.
The last item on the agenda: it is not just Iraqâs debt and that of the countries affected by the tsunami that need to be cancelled urgently.
Indeed, it would be a serious matter if the message being sent out to the international community were that it needs to be struck by a war or a natural disaster causing 200Â 000 deaths in order to be entitled to solidarity from the West.
Â Â  Madam President, there is nothing wrong with cancelling debts, certainly if it involves countries in desperate need, as is at present the case in South East Asia.
As various speakers have said, though, one should not generalise.
Some countries are governed well, and others badly, and we cannot promise all of them that we will write off their debts and solve their problems overnight.
In practical terms, for example, it is unacceptable that Zimbabwe should be treated in the same way as Uganda.
Every aspect, every country has to be considered on what is politically speaking the best solution, and debt cancellation is one of the ways of contributing to the countryâs development.
The resolution is extremely vague.
What, for example, are the practical implications for the European budget?
I believe that only the European Investment Bank grants loans, and the European budget stands surety for those loans.
What will happen if we cancel those loans?
How much will this cost?
Perhaps the Commission could elaborate on this.
Â Â  Madam President, the Council is able to concur with a good portion of what has been said. We have all understood the urgency and the exceptional nature of the situation confronted by a number of countries, particularly those affected by the natural disaster.
Where Iraq is concerned, I do not believe that anyone doubts the necessity of helping with the reconstruction of that country. That being said, there does arise the issue of what is to be done for all the other developing countries.
First of all â and I rather concur with what the Commissioner said â we cannot be content to proceed in the same way where everyone is concerned.
Developing countries are not all alike.
There are very different situations.
I therefore believe that we must concentrate firstly, and crucially, upon the poorest and least advanced countries and ask what we can do specifically for them.
In the first place, we can relieve, or indeed cancel, their debts.
I believe that this is an initiative that must be supported and promoted.
Within which frameworks are we to act?
There is the debate to be conducted within the framework of the forthcoming European Councils; I mentioned in particular the April European Council which is to concentrate upon analysing and, if need be, revising the European Unionâs undertakings when it comes to achieving the Millennium Objectives.
There is the European Unionâs support for the initiatives taken within the G8, particularly those of the G8 Presidency at the forthcoming summit in the United Kingdom.
Europe must therefore promote this idea of debt relief or, indeed, cancellation.
It cannot, however, do so indiscriminately as, by proceeding in that way, its action would lose credibility.
Secondly, cancelling or relieving the debt only makes sense if the rich countries increase their development aid.
The European Union has entered into undertakings in this regard, and they should be implemented.
Thirdly and finally, the debt â large though it may be â must be placed within a broader political framework for development cooperation.
There is no point in cancelling the debt if, at the same time, our borders are closed to certain imports from developing countries. There is no point in cancelling the debt if we then subsidise certain products in our own countries and thereby hinder the development of these same products in the developing countries.
To summarise, I believe that cancellation is an important factor, though not the only one, in a development strategy, or genuine development partnership, which the European Union must buckle down to.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Commission has taken careful note of this discussion on the important issue of debt relief.
A number of important and useful suggestions and comments were made today. I should like to respond as follows.
First, it should urgently be emphasised that poverty is not just a question of debt relief.
The real issue is appropriate levels of development financing.
Second, it is important to distinguish between different countries, in particular between the least developed countries and other developing countries.
Third, the figures on debt relief were not presented to you with the aim of cutting back on aid, but rather the opposite: to use this criteria in order to alleviate the debt burden for those countries that really need it most.
Fourth, the UN and the Commission will coordinate their efforts with other international organisations on the HIPC and other initiatives.
Fifth, a new World Bank-IMF sustainability framework recognises the inadequacy of existing debt relief efforts.
The new framework will: first, set indicative debt burden thresholds that are country-specific; second, take account of external shocks; third, ensure greater transparency and dialogue in assessing that sustainability.
That is what the new sustainability framework is all about.
Lastly, relief for Iraq should not be at the expense of the poorest countries, and a debt moratorium for countries hit by the tsunami would be appropriate.
