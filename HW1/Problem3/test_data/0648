The Convention should reflect upon these issues.
There are, however, positive new things in the report worth mentioning.
Data protection and transparency are included.
Rights to these must be developed in the Treaty.
Data protection and the right of access to documents are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The time is now ripe for citizens' right to information under Article 255 of the Treaty to be made more specific.
In conclusion, the European Parliament has an important role to play in issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and rights.
I hope that the Convention consolidates this role by creating a democratic system of decision-making and a right for people to go to court and, in certain cases, obtain damages if their rights have been infringed.
The issue clearly needs to be explored further.
Mrs Swiebel has made this clear.
That is good, but there should preferably be a more concentrated approach next time, with the issue explored more deeply rather than just broadened out.
We must clearly develop our methods for the future.
Mr President, I want to begin by thanking my colleague, Mrs Swiebel for the sterling work she has done on this report.
There is no doubt that we in the EU are well off when it comes to respect for freedoms and rights.
That is precisely why we are having this debate, that is to say with a view to constantly improving the situation, retaining a high level of protection and openly debating the deficiencies that exist.
It is an important issue that affects what is most basic to a properly functioning EU - mutual trust between the Member States.
We are not perfect.
Rights are infringed, and there are failures to respect fundamental freedoms and rights, and it is not just 'everywhere else' that these things happen.
My own country, Sweden, has, for example, been singled out in connection with a high-profile death in which the actions of the police, prosecution service and coroner have been sharply criticised.
I want to make it clear that the Swedish Government had been responding to the criticism for a long time and had instituted an inquiry that was completed last year.
The perspectives from which the inquiry was conducted clearly included that of citizens' rights.
Another very important issue is that of the rights of European citizens in legal processes such as arrests.
There are Member States in which people are held without trial for long periods; we must debate this issue.
Our young people travel throughout Europe.
No one on EU territory should need to feel anxious that their personal freedom may be infringed because of inefficiency at police stations and in prisons.
We must therefore emphasise very clearly that all European citizens are guaranteed certain rights in legal processes in all the EU countries.
I look forward to the Commission's continued work on this issue and to its proposals.
Trafficking in human beings, particularly women and children, is a fact in this EU of ours.
The EU is in many cases the final destination for people who, in desperation and confusion, are taken away from their home countries.
It is a modern slave trade, and we must ask ourselves how that trend can be stopped.
I am concerned about the fact that many EU countries accept various forms of prostitution.
It turns the EU into a favourable market for traffickers in human beings throughout the world.
There is an unambiguous link between human trafficking and prostitution.
They are two sides of the same coin.
I should have liked to have seen the report be clearer on this point.
We must make great demands of ourselves in the EU, now that we are making demands of the candidate countries.
There are many very good points in Mrs Swiebel's report and a huge amount of hard work has gone into its preparation.
Inevitably, it makes many of us feel uncomfortable when we find our own countries being referred to as not having ratified many of the human rights conventions.
On a day in which we celebrate the action of the governor of Illinois on the death penalty, I am glad to see that Mrs Swiebel congratulates the Irish Government on having finally abolished the death penalty.
Of course, it has not been used for a great many years and was maintained on our statute books only for the killing of policemen.
But I would particularly like to welcome her section on the rights of children.
I have been a Member of this Parliament probably longer than most people here at the moment.
Until the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was drawn up, the rights of children, the intrinsic rights of children, were not recognised, discussed or seen as part of fundamental human rights.
However, the UN optional protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography is also referred to.
We did not consider any of these issues when we started discussing human rights and holding the annual discussion on human rights.
For example, the issue of the exploitation of children on the Internet was not even a twinkle in the Commission's eye until relatively recently.
It was not an area about which we actually had a great deal of knowledge or information.
The section recognising these as important rights for children that have to be protected is to be warmly welcomed.
I hope we will see this section enlarged as the years go by and as we discover, unfortunately, just what a dangerous world it is for many of our children.
I would like to thank Mrs Swiebel for making this such an important part of the report.
Mr President, Mrs Swiebel's report contains a couple of interesting points.
I endorse what Mrs Banotti has just said about children's rights.
Examining this in detail in a parliamentary report is an excellent idea.
I would like to add something to Mrs Swiebel's wish to see such reports play a role in criticising and possibly punishing Member States who fail in their duties when it comes to enforcing the constitutional state and democracy.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, then the Treaty of Nice and possibly as part of the Convention, we do in fact have more opportunities to give Member States a good ticking off if they make mistakes, and even to kick them out of the Community.
It would be excellent if Parliament had a role to play in this.
Her suggestion that the European Social Charter be compared with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is also a very good one.
I think that the Charter of Human Rights should be given priority, but it is a good idea to measure everything we do against both of these charters.
That must be an absolutely basic requirement.
The European Parliament would then win the confidence of the Council, for example, with a view to communitisation.
The Council, the people, the Member States and the parliaments of the Member States must know that we are using our powers in the proper manner.
In the event of a procedural opportunity - in other words if we were to play a role in criticising Member States - I would be in favour of personally coming clean if we make a mistake.
The report does, however, fall short when it comes to the severity of the treatment, and could thus become a millstone in the struggle for the communitisation of the third pillar.
There is, after all, no real consistency in the application of the Charter of Human Rights.
You could much rather regard Mrs Swiebel's ideology and views as a guide for assessing Member States.
A country can easily be respectable even if it is criticised by Mrs Swiebel.
Certainly if I read paragraph 133.
If you tell the public that a climate of immunity from punishment is developing in Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, they will laugh their heads off.
That really is too ridiculous for words.
Nevertheless, you also cannot say - to give you yet another example of sloppiness - that unmarried couples should have the same rights as married couples.
That is idiotic; it will not make you popular with unmarried couples.
The fact is they do not want all these rights.
I am very much in favour of promoting gay rights, but not by saying that you will also get the rights you do not want.
The report is thus riddled with all sorts of examples that are also impossible from a legal point of view.
Mr President, the major split in the vote on this report in the relevant committee must mean that Mrs Swiebel has not sought a unifying solution.
She has selectively presented a list of areas which are not only deeply controversial politically - for example, in their view of the family and of family legislation - but also demonstrably do not belong among the European Union's areas of competence.
Mrs Swiebel would have to search high and low in the UN Charter on Fundamental Rights, the European Convention's Charter of Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights for a reason why these issues should be included in a report on fundamental rights.
Mrs Swiebel, does, for example, the fact that polygamy is not accepted in the European Union mean that Muslims resident in Europe are discriminated against?
Is this a crime against human rights?
The question no doubt needs to be answered when so many new subjects have been added to the topic of human rights.
I would also ask Mrs Swiebel why, in addressing so many new subject areas, she makes no mention, for example, of the fact that the Netherlands has legalised prostitution.
There is therefore a need to 'import' women into a country in which prostitution is, strangely enough, considered to be a lawful and approved activity.
Why does Mrs Swiebel make no mention of her own country's assisted euthanasia policy, which is abused by some doctors and which leads to people ending their lives without dignity?
There are instances in which so-called assisted euthanasia is abused.
Why is no mention made of parents' right to allow their children to grow up in a drug-free society in which parents know that the law is on their side?
Mrs Swiebel has been very selective.
We Christian Democrats will of course vote against this report, because Mrs Swiebel has failed in an important task of the European Parliament.
Mr President, I subscribe to the general comments made by my honourable friends in the Europe People's Party and shall confine myself to commenting on two criticisms levied against Greece which, because they go too far, undermine the credibility of the report and real fundamental rights.
The first concerns the ban on women pilgrims entering Mount Athos in Greece.
This ban has been in place for 1200 years and is enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union and the Greek constitution.
It cannot therefore be changed, nor should it, because to do so would be to accept that the home is not inviolable.
Mount Athos is home to 5 000 monks and it is their right to receive whomsoever they please in their home, just as it is our right, as simple citizens, to receive and offer hospitality to whomsoever we want in our home and keep out anyone we do not.
This is not a tourist area and any women interested in how Orthodox monks live need only visit the hundreds of other monasteries in Greece and other Orthodox countries in order to satisfy their curiosity.
My second comment concerns conscientious objectors.
Unfortunately, religious convictions or an aversion to the violence which the army may stand for are used as a pretext by a number of people to avoid military service and while away their days in the civil service at the state's expense, even though some of them have no hesitation in using violence if it serves their ideological purpose.
May I inform you, my honourable friends, that some of the November 17 terrorists who were recently arrested in Greece, whose much-publicised trial is due to start in a few days' time, and who have so far murdered some 50 foreign diplomats, ministers, politicians, journalists and judges, have stated that they are conscientious objectors and have been exempted from military service, while another conscientious objector serving in a mental institution has been getting his kicks out of torturing the inmates.
It is a pity that we always go too far and end up ridiculing fundamental rights.
Mr President, the weaknesses of this report do not lie in the fact that it condemns breaches of human rights where they exist but, in my opinion, in the way in which it has been drafted and in the methodology used to present these condemnations.
In choosing to give, in the explanatory statement, a lengthy and detailed description of possible breaches of fundamental rights by some Member States, this report has led to claims and accusations against these Member States that cannot be refuted and have not even been submitted to a democratic vote because they are not included in the text of the motion for a resolution.
These claims are therefore unfair, because they do not allow for any response, even though they clearly have no validity in plenary since they are not included in the motion for a resolution.
Furthermore, with regard to the sources the report has used, and without wishing in any way to call into question the credibility of many NGOs, I must point out that a report drawn up by the European Parliament ought to distance itself from and even reject the conclusions of each of these organisations, and avoid including, sometimes inaccurately, aspects of these studies.
For example, regarding Portugal, it is claimed that discrimination exists on the grounds of sexual orientation, on the basis of the conclusions and observations of one NGO, which I shall not name as it appears in the text, and the rapporteur states that the Portuguese Penal Code contains legislation that discriminates in this field, an assertion that I reject on the grounds of a simple reading of the law.
In fact, the Portuguese Penal Code makes no distinction in the field of sexual orientation with regard to the age of consent.
Mr President, I believe that the European Parliament must responsibly assume its powers for safeguarding human rights and should never confine itself to simply transcribing the opinions of third parties.
This will clearly always be the case until we have a legally applicable Charter of Fundamental Rights; only then will things be done differently.
We all want to ban breaches, but there are no political breaches of rights - there are legal breaches or practical breaches and these either exist or they do not.
No amount of political flexibility, no interpretative criteria will enable us to uncover breaches of rights where these are not considered to be breaches under the law.
Nor, on the other hand, can we allow any breach of rights to be justified by political criteria.
This is why I shall not be voting in favour of this report: the fundamental balance that is needed for delivering an opinion on such sensitive matters is absent from this text and it has therefore failed to win my support.
Mr President, I would simply like to ask you to take note of the fact that in item 19, in the penultimate sub-paragraph, there is a correction to made in the Spanish version.
This point says 'recommends that the Member States should introduce a sunset provision in their specific anti-terrorism legislation'.
I have checked the text by Mrs Swiebel and, indeed, 'specific' should be replaced by 'exceptional'.
Specific legislation can be common legislation which under no circumstances must be subject to sunset clauses or anything similar.
It should not say 'specific' but 'exceptional'.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0449/2002) by Mr Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled 'Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union' (COM(2002) 233 - C5-0505/2002 - 2002/2212(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are dealing with here is the integrated management of our external borders, which is where, I am sure that we are all agreed, security, for the European Union, begins.
They are also the starting point for defence against such menaces as organised crime, terrorism, smugglers, and illegal immigration.
We know, though, that our external borders continue to be the weakest link in our internal security system as a whole, and the reasons for this are well known.
They have to do with the different ways in which Schengen is interpreted, with differences in technical standards, and with the various agencies engaged in border control, with differences in training and, in general terms, with the lack of any Community, or even joint, action in matters concerning border control.
If, however, we want to improve border security and hence make the EU more secure, we need equally high standards on all our external borders, both as they are at present and as they will be in the future, all of us being aware that the EU is about to be enlarged and that this demands that action be taken.
The security that we are aiming for is something on which our internal security as a whole depends, as also does our ability to make a reality of the fundamental principle of freedom of movement.
I welcome the initiatives taken by the Laeken European Council in December 2001, when it mandated the Commission and the Council to take appropriate steps to deal with this.
I certainly welcome the Commission proposal, congratulate the Commissioner on the excellence of his preparatory work, and welcome the Council's plan of action.
On these things there is broad agreement.
I can also tell you - and I am glad to be able to do so - that these proposals met with broad consensus in the committee.
I want, therefore, to express my gratitude for the close cooperation, which has seen all parties united in a concern for security.
I believe that, in going ahead in this way, we have set a very good example, and I would be delighted if the same broad support and consensus were to be demonstrated tomorrow.
What, then, are the crucial points in my report, on which there is such agreement?
I would like to single out five of them.
The first is that we need to analyse and redefine the tasks involved and establish a common set of legal regulations.
In order to do this, we also need to analyse the operational practice involved in the transposition of the Schengen acquis, which we know varies to a large extent.
The Common Manual on border control should be revised to include the common standards and to take account of best practice.
It strikes me as particularly important that we should have not merely a Common Manual, but should also establish a monitoring body to verify, at regular intervals, that the provisions are being implemented and adhered to, which is what common standards and high quality are all about.
Leading on from that, the second priority is joint training and re-training.
We must at long last give tangible effect to Article 7 of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement.
We are already engaged in drawing up a common core curriculum for border guards.
What we need, however, in order to create a multiplier effect so that high standards may be guaranteed in the long term, is the establishment of a European Staff College for the training of senior officials, which should be supported through the ARGO programme, thus enabling the standard of training, as well as the common operating standards, to be maintained in the long term.
The third priority is that the equipment used should be interchangeable.
In this area, there is a lack of compatibility within the Member States, and practical cross-border cooperation is made utterly impossible by the completely incompatible technical standards involved.
If we go over to using shared satellite or radar systems or start cooperating across borders, then compatible equipment becomes an absolute necessity.
It would, moreover, make sense in the future - for reasons of economics as much as any other reason - to have these standards in the joint procurement of technical systems, which can be very expensive.
Fourthly, we should carry out an ongoing risk analysis.
As Europol also has systems for analysing organised crime, we should have them carry out a risk analysis, the results of which - reporting on situations and outlining any assistance needed - would be communicated to the Member States and made available in order to make the common standards a reality here.
It would be desirable - and, in terms of increased efficiency, an overall objective - for data to be exchanged between the Schengen, Europol and Eurodac systems, with, of course, all necessary data protection provisions being adhered to.
There is no doubt that this could achieve certain synergies.
The fifth priority is that a European Corps of Border Guards should be established, made up of specialist units and with Community funding, which would, in an emergency and at the request of the Member States, support the national authorities at vulnerable border points for limited periods.
This would enable us not only to achieve an optimum standard of security at particularly vulnerable sections of our external borders, but also to share the burden of dealing with a specific situation on the external border, which the country involved cannot be expected to bear alone.
By doing this, we would be providing assistance and sharing a burden, although it has to be said that, in principle, general competence in matters of control of the external borders should remain at national level.
It is my hope that all this agreement will give us the necessary stimulus to at last bring about in reality what we owe to the public - a greater degree of security even when enlargement has taken place.
We can get down to work.
Parliament will give its full support to the endeavours of the Commission and the Council if they go down this road.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Hubert Pirker for his report, which has focused not only on the Commission communication on the management of the EU's external borders, but also on the action plan adopted by the Council.
We might also say that the two documents, the Commission proposal and the Council action plan, contain a great deal of common ground.
I believe that, in fact, the four fundamental objectives that were set for us at Laeken form part of this action plan: increasing mutual trust between the Member States with regard to controlling our external border, which is a common border, which means that poor control over the border in one State has inevitable knock-on effects on the security of all the other Member States of the European Union, the effectiveness of the fight against illegal immigration, the particular priority that must be given to controlling the external borders to prevent the entry of terrorist groups or agents and, finally, to safeguard the high level of internal security in the European Union, without which we cannot preserve freedom of movement and the abolition of controls at our external borders.
As Mr Pirker emphasised, the objectives of this action plan are clear; and I believe that, rather than talking about objectives, we must define targets and work out what actually needs to be done.
Firstly, in the legislative field.
We have the Schengen acquis, that, as Mr Pirker quite rightly underlined, is implemented very differently in the various States.
We need to harmonise the way in which the Schengen acquis is implemented and we are doing so in two ways: firstly by revising the Common Schengen Manual, and the Commission will, in the first six months of this year, be submitting a proposal for this revision.
Secondly, however, by also establishing a code of good practice for establishing common standards.
The second objective is the training of border guards.
I believe that, at this very moment, a meeting is taking place in Vienna, in which the Commission is participating, to define a proposal for a common curriculum for the training of border guards.
This project is being led by Austria and by Sweden.
The third objective is to use modern information technologies to improve the control of our external borders.
In this field, the Commission plans at the Salonika European Council, this coming July, to present a viability study into the launching of the on-line visa system at European level.
We will similarly be presenting the first proposals on the control of the European Union's external sea borders.
The fourth objective is to define a common risk analysis model for controlling our external borders.
In this field we already have a model, defined on the basis of a proposal presented by the Government of Finland, and a first meeting was held under the Danish Presidency of the so-called 'SCIFA+', which is the body that coordinates the border control services of all the Member States of the European Union.
As a result of the functioning of this new body at European level it has been possible to develop, as early as in 2002, two practical operations.
The first was the operation 'Ulysses', which was coordinated by Spain and involved joint teams from various Member States on controlling the Mediterranean; and the second was the operation of a joint team led by Germany to control its land borders.
These two operations were, in 2002, funded by the ARGO Programme and new actions for operational cooperation have already been presented for 2003.
Finally, the Seville European Council supported the principle of sharing responsibilities for controlling the external borders.
This is a sharing of responsibilities in financial terms, in terms of sharing equipment and also with a view to creating, eventually, a common border guard force.
The Commission presented an initial evaluation of the financial situation.
We must acknowledge that the data that the Member States provided us with on the real expenditure of each of them on controlling the external borders were very different and were hard to compare.
The Commission therefore requested further clarification and intends, during the Greek Presidency, to propose criteria for sharing financial responsibility for controlling the external border of the European Union.
I hope that, with the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Pirker, which will be voted on here tomorrow, Parliament will be able to give a decisive boost to this ambitious, demanding and crucial programme of action to control the external border of the European Union in order to enhance the domestic security of all Member States.
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Coelho.
Free movement within the Union is one of the most cherished achievements for this House and for many citizens in the European Union.
The rules which regulate the free movement of persons within the Union are Community rules.
Many of the measures it has been necessary to establish in order to guarantee it are scattered around our legislation.
To guarantee this free movement requires a high degree of trust and cooperation between the Member States, particularly in the management of external borders.
There is plenty of information on the reality of the situation to demonstrate that we have difficulties here, including the arrival on the coasts of the south of the European Union of people who hope that this will be the first stage of a journey but for whom it is often dramatically the last, the women rescued on a daily basis from their captors and exploiters, who offer them to Europeans who ask no questions about their origin, or the tragic spectacle we have witnessed for months in relation to the Sangatte centre.
We believe that the European Commission has raised the need to deal with this issue correctly and in a timely manner. Firstly, because the enlargement of the European Union obliges us to do so.
Secondly, because their proposal is a good signal to the Convention that it should resolve the legislative mess involving one of the Union's fundamental distinguishing marks; internal free movement. Thirdly, because it presents today, with the legal framework we have - and perhaps also the financial framework - the possibility of making progress on this objective.
I agree with the notion that there is room to better guarantee both the freedom of security of those people who are in Community territory and the situation of those who wish to pass through it.
Therefore, and despite our extremist tendencies, the Socialist Group will vote in favour of the Pirker report.
I hope that the enthusiasm and broad support of this House are contagious and that the Council will go beyond its political declarations and actively and enthusiastically support this proposal.
As the Commission itself says, the topic in this case is integrated management of the Member States' external borders.
Even if the motion for a resolution in this report is adopted, moreover, it will, of course, in itself have no direct legal effects.
Rather, the motion and the Commission's communication will acquire significance in the light of a series of other decisions concerning the development of police cooperation.
In this context, the proposal signifies a development that, in my view, is a threat to democratic control and the rule of law.
This is a policy that would considerably weaken the national authorities in favour of the EU authorities.
The unmistakeable ambition is to develop a supranational border police force in the longer term, one of several steps on the road towards an actual federal police force.
This expansion of the police service is, at one and the same time, about unthinking EU integration and the securing of Fortress Europe.
The latter is an obvious consequence of that outside pressure that is due to the prosperity of the EU countries as compared with the wretched social conditions endured by our neighbours, a contrast basically due to the EU countries' policy, pursued for many years, of exploiting our neighbours.
So much for the motion's real background.
The content of the motion is no less alarming.
The common legislative body, the system of coordination and operational cooperation, the interoperational facilities and the permanent exchange of information and data, in short the overall development of the police service, does nothing less than dismember that rule of law which, on the basis of experience in the Nordic countries, I see democratic activists as having sought to establish over the years.
What does the Commission have to say about democratic and judicial control?
What we have is a non-binding and ill thought-out policy to the effect that control must be ensured.
How?
No answer.
What does the report have to say?
Not a word.
EU border police and a common body for external borders?
No thank you.
Mr President, here, at last, is a report which is genuinely Community-focused, although it takes as a starting point the specific, technical issue of the management of the Union's external borders.
It is a very topical subject, as has been pointed out, if you consider that the Union's current external borders will be radically changed and extended in May 2004 when the 12 new Member States become part of the political and geographical structure of the current European Union.
It is therefore more than appropriate that we should now be proposing the model used thus far on the basis of the consolidated experience of the 15 current Member States before the entry of the new candidates.
The Pirker report drops into this wide-ranging framework a number of practical proposals on how to achieve integrated management of our external borders, without interfering in the territorial sovereignty of the individual States but rather defining the ideal formulae for harmonious cooperation.
This is an acceptable approach which will involve the creation of a Community corps of border guards in the coming years - not straightaway but after we have fine-tuned techniques and procedures with appropriate measures for training staff and achieving cooperation between the different current corps of border guards.
Hitherto impromptu experiments with mixed patrols have yielded excellent results. As far as my country, Italy, is concerned, these have been developed on borders with Member States such as France and Austria and on borders with third countries such as Switzerland too, and with a candidate country, Slovenia.
The section which addresses the issue of combating illegal immigration is extremely innovative. This involves a difficult, daily undertaking, particularly on the part of border States such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece.
However, the problem is everybody's problem, not just the problem of these States, for, thanks to Schengen, an illegal immigrant who succeeds in penetrating the Adriatic coast has automatic access to many other Member States, at least those in the Schengen Area, which therefore have a major responsibility as well as a great opportunity.
Therefore, the rapporteur is right to propose to call upon all the countries to work together to contribute to and bear the costs of external border controls, whether they have external borders or not.
Indeed, it would appear to be clear that it is appropriate for all the countries to contribute if we are to achieve an effective control and monitoring service, particularly in the places where the flow of illegal immigrants is currently greatest - a genuine flood of new illegal immigrants is, even as we speak, pouring into the Union - for this is not just a problem for those who are directly involved in the daily fight against illegal immigration: it is also a problem for all those countries which are the automatic destinations of these illegal flows.
Mr President, I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council for bringing this forward and recognising the need for further cooperation in this field, a very difficult area.
I disagree, to an extent, with Mr Krarup, in that this is an issue that no one country can address on its own.
It is vital that there are common policies, agreements and understandings between the 15 Member States.
Having said that, we recognise the different situations in each Member State.
Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ spoke earlier about the situation on the southern border of Spain.
My own country, the United Kingdom, consists of one large island plus the north of Ireland.
Other countries each have their own circumstances that need to be addressed: Greece, for example, has some 400 islands, and Luxembourg is land-locked.
We all have very different situations and, in their own ways, these are very difficult to monitor and manage.
But we do not manage very well with 15 countries at the moment.
Mr Coelho quite rightly drew attention to the fact that when we are 25 countries in the EU - and later on 27 or 28 - it will be even more challenging.
It is very important that we at least make the effort to get into position now something that is trying to address the issue, trying to face up to the challenge.
We must make certain that we respect the rights of the individual. I agree with Mr Krarup on that.
We can only do this if Member States work together, if we copy good practice from one country to another, if we do not repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past.
Effectively, this means border management, hand-in-hand with common policies on asylum and immigration.
It means being prepared to constantly update and upgrade, and it means border management which takes account of citizens' rights of movement.
If we put those together we will address the issues for the years ahead in an enlarged European Union.
Mr President, when Commissioner Verheugen reported to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the subject of eastward enlargement, I put two questions to him.
The first was whether the Commission regarded a common framework for border control as necessary; and the second was whether the Commission believed that the candidate countries would be in a position to secure their borders with countries outside the EU to the same high standard of protection as the existing Member States already did.
The Commissioner's reply was that the candidate countries would have no problem with guaranteeing a satisfactory level of protection on their own, and that there was no need for a European approach.
The Commission has now changed its mind and presented a sensible proposal for a common framework for control of our external borders.
Mr Pirker's report supports it and adds to it at various points, and Mr Coelho is unfortunately no longer here to hear me say that it goes without saying that I wholeheartedly support it too.
It is to be regretted that Commissioner Verheugen has wasted a lot of valuable time by talking rubbish.
One example of why this is a matter of urgency is the border between Germany and Poland, 456 kilometres long and formed by a river, where traffic across it is at present monitored by some 10 000 border guards.
Poland's border with its non-EU neighbours is over 1 200 kilometres long and runs across fields for the whole of its length.
The belief that, within the next few years, Poland will be able to secure this border on its own in anything like the same way as external borders used to be secured, is utterly illusory.
This is where European solidarity is needed, as the defence of the external borders by a number of Member States is to the ultimate benefit of all Member States.
Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands reap the benefits of a high level of external border control.
Any European concept of external border control must, at the end of the day, be enshrined in the Treaties, both by the allocation of combined powers to the EU and, on the other hand, by giving it institutional form as a European body in parallel with Europol and Eurojust.
And, in these present times, as Cato did in the senate of ancient Rome, I will end all my speeches with the same words: Commissioner Vitorino, I wish that the Convention would demonstrate greater courage in this area.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel myself honoured to be allowed to say the last word here today.
Before wishing you good-night, I would of course like to avail myself of the opportunity to tell you what I think and, as one who comes from Germany, to set out in clear terms the importance of external border control, Germany being, as Mr von Boetticher has just said, a country with a vast external border.
So, Commissioner, we are very glad that you have presented this communication, and also that the report by the PPE-DE Group's Mr Pirker has proposed the right thing and enjoys our support for that reason.
I assume that Parliament's united manifestation of agreement with the Commission in this area will, perhaps with the Greek Presidency's help, make it possible to win the Council over, as the Greek Presidency has already signalled the importance it attaches to combating illegal immigration and smugglers of any kind.
I have high hopes of them.
This Parliament does of course have Members who persist in regarding the reinforcement of police or border control units as problematic, and who tell us how much better all these things should be done.
Over and over again, they ask why we need the police so much.
I can tell them in all frankness that I should prefer to deploy as many police officers as possible and have a secure border that prevents refugees escaping to their deaths.
I become really fed up with it all and find myself thinking that the responsibility must be shouldered by us all together.
We cannot keep on standing idly by while people die, and the only way we can prevent people dying is if our borders are secure and illegal immigrants are no longer exploited or abused by gangs of smugglers.
It is for that reason that I hope we can all reach our objective together.
Good night.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 9 p.m.)
I would like to congratulate Mrs Swiebel on the fruitful work she has done this year (particularly in recognising the rights of third-country nationals and in introducing the rejection of double punishment), but I regret the fact that the time limit for the drawing up of the report has been exceeded to such a great extent, hindering my work and that of my future colleagues.
As successor to Mrs Swiebel for 2002, I wish to work within the spirit of this Charter, to work in a spirit of continuity and to make the Charter as fully visible as possible.
To this end, two public hearings are scheduled, with the innovation that young people will be involved, by means of delegations of secondary school children, as will the media, with the participation of representatives from prominent sections of the media.
It is our duty to ensure participation by young people, to increase their awareness and provide them with information, and also to involve and mobilise opinion formers, since they are our best vehicle for coming closer to the citizens and for allowing Europe to become more closely involved in the daily lives of Europeans.
Specifically, in relation to its examination of the human rights situation, my report, like previous ones, will be based on the structure of the Charter and will highlight certain points which I will treat as my political priorities.
In general, I wish my report to be a progressive one.

Community railways
The next item is the joint debate on the following four reports, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:
A5-0417/2002 by Mr Jarzembowski on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways (COM(2002) 25 - C5-0038/2002 - 2002/25(COD));
A5-0424/2002 by Mr Sterckx on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on safety on the Community's railways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (COM(2002) 21 - C5-0039/2002 - 2002/0022(COD));
A5-0418/2002 by Mrs Ainardi on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/48/EC and Directive 2001/16/EC on the interoperability of the trans-European rail system (COM(2002) 2- C5-0045/2002 - 2002/0023(COD)) and
A5-0441/2002 by Mr Savary on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on establishing a European Railway Agency (COM(2002) 23 - C5-0046/2002 - 2002/0024(COD)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to warmly thank the four rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done, which means that the plenum is being presented with some generally positive reports, which move in the same direction as the Commission's proposal and support the Commission's approach.
I would like to thank Parliament, which, furthermore, has dealt with these reports as a global package, resisting the temptation to divide it up, which would undoubtedly have hindered our common objective of finally creating a genuine European rail area.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the second stage of a prolonged process.
Following the entry into force on 15 March 2001 of the three directives of the infrastructures package, which will have to be incorporated into the Member States' legislations from 15 March 2003, we must now complete the legislative framework in order to speed up the creation of a genuine European rail area.
The four proposals we are going to debate today fall within the framework of this process.
I will firstly comment on the proposed amendment to Directive 91/440/EEC, extending access rights to infrastructure and freight services within the Member States, and to speed up the opening up of the market.
The rapporteur is Mr Jarzembowski, who has done a wonderful job.
Ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on European transport policy provides an alarming description of the development of rail freight transport.
Over the last twenty years, the quota corresponding to this sector - within the overall distribution of goods transport in the Union - has been reduced by half, from 15% in 1980 to 8% in 1999.
Over this period, the quality of services provided to clients has not improved and in certain Member States it has worsened.
This is therefore an extremely pressing issue.
I do not believe we can wait until 2008 to open up international goods transport to competition throughout the European network.
We must also deal with domestic transport.
That is why certain modifications are proposed to replace the timetable and methods for opening up laid down in Directive 2001/12/EC, without waiting any longer for the opening up of freight transport, both national and international, to the whole of the network.
In practice, this total opening up of access rights in the field of freight would be effective by 2006, which would mean bringing forward this opening up to the whole network by two years.
Ladies and gentlemen, the second proposed directive relates, of course, to rail safety.
I believe that the issue of safety in transport is something which occupies and preoccupies all of us, especially at the moment.
I would also like to thank Mr Sterckx for his work.
We must guarantee that the integration of the European rail network does not mean a reduction in the maximum levels of the safety standards in the various Member States of the Union.
But at the same time we must guarantee that the establishment of common rules prevents any possibility that, as a result of safety issues, the market may be harmed or there may be any discrimination in access to the networks.
The creation of an internal market in rail services would not be possible without the establishment of common safety rules.
Furthermore, the opening up of the markets and the end of the monopolies considerably modify such an important factor as the system of responsibilities in the field of safety, and it is therefore necessary to establish a coherent, transparent and clear framework which prevents any doubt in this area.
The safety directive focuses on four areas: the designation of national safety authorities, separate from the operators, with clearly defined responsibilities; the determination of the essential elements of safety systems in relation to the operator of infrastructures and rail companies and the establishment of a mechanism for determining and adopting common safety objectives and methods - a role to be played by the rail Agency; the establishment of a common system for the issuing, content and validity of safety certificates; finally, the introduction, as in other sectors, of the principle of independent technical investigations in the event of accidents.
We now come to the third proposed directive.
If we establish the network, if we guarantee a common level of safety, with clearly defined responsibilities, it is also necessary to establish an interoperable system.
Hence the amendment of Directives 96/48/EC and 2001/16/EC on interoperability, whose rapporteur is Mrs Ainardi.
As well as the modifications which experience suggests we should make, it is essentially a question of guaranteeing coherence in the scope of the network in which opening up of access is carried out and the network in which the interoperability standards must be applied.
It is also a question of sending a very clear message about the need to standardise equipment, with a view to reducing costs.
We cannot just remove administrative borders, but we must also remove technological borders in order to create this European rail network.
I would like to express my gratitude for the work done on an enormously technical and arduous subject, but on which the work of Parliament and the rapporteur have once again been of the highest quality.
I will finally comment on the fourth proposal, to create a European Railways Agency, on which Mr Savary has done some very considerable work.
The Agency is the cornerstone, it will complete the circle and will be the instrument which will allow us to make progress in the field of the interoperability of rail safety and therefore to guarantee the integration of the European rail network.
This Agency will provide technical support for decision making, without autonomous competences, and will provide the Commission with opinions and recommendations.
The texts in question will be adopted by the Commission in accordance with a comitology procedure, as is currently the case in relation to interoperability.
Its main fields of activity will be as follows: the technical drawing up of texts planned for the directive on safety - common safety objectives and common safety methods - and for the directives on interoperability; the creation of a network of national safety and interoperability authorities; technical advice to the Commission and the national authorities on specific cases in the field of safety rules.
This Agency, which will be made up of some 100 people, will be responsible for promoting the work of the technical approximation of rail systems and will be independent, although it will work in close cooperation with experts in the sector.
Mr President, to conclude, the texts proposed intend, on the one hand, to ensure that 15 incompatible national systems develop technically towards an integrated and competitive European rail area and, on the other, to speed up the opening up of the market in freight transport, so that operators can provide effective services in any part of the Union.
Let us finally opt for a modern railway, worthy of the twenty-first century, which is able to compete effectively with other modes of transport.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is a good day, even if there are not so many people listening at the moment - and I hope that the press will report on this important debate - because we are finally on the way towards also establishing an internal market in the rail sector.
This is an absolutely crucial point, because this is the only internal market that is actually still lacking in the transport sector.
That is why, Commissioner, our four reports express our full agreement, in principle, with the Commission's basic ideas.
However, being a self-assured Parliament and co-legislator, we have also tabled some substantial amendments to the four Commission proposals.
I hope that the Commissioner will support all of them.
Why have we tabled amendments?
By tabling these amendments we are seeking to hasten the revitalisation of the rail sector in the European Union.
We must create the necessary framework conditions sooner, because if we do not manage to revitalise the railways, we will not meet our European transport policy objective - laid down in the White Paper - by 2010 either.
By 2010 we want to bring the different modes of transport back into balance, which in practice means that we want to carry more freight by rail instead of by road and more passengers by rail instead of by air or road.
To achieve this objective of putting a larger proportion of the overall volume of traffic back onto the railways, we need to create appropriate framework conditions.
These must be such that the rail networks really are opened up throughout the Union to existing and new railway undertakings, that is that network access is liberalised.
In addition, by adopting European standards we must also physically cross internal borders, meaning that trains must be able to cross borders without stopping or slowing down, so that we can also make the advantages offered by the internal market a reality from the technical point of view.
And we need a high level of safety.
Since in the future we will not only have the national railway companies in the Member States but also increasing numbers of private railway undertakings, operating across the Union, it is no longer sufficient for the national authorities to be responsible for safety standards. Instead we need common, high European standards of safety for the benefit of passengers and railway staff.
Finally, we need a European railway agency to energetically push forward all of these measures and monitor them.
We have made progress on interoperability, but too slowly.
At a conference, technical experts informed us that it would take 30 years to achieve interoperability, that is for trains to be able to use different networks without stopping.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we wait that long there will not be any railways left in Europe that are operated on a commercial basis.
However, we want the railways, and so all of us here need to energetically drive these measures forward, and that is why we need a European railway agency.
In an internal market for railways designed in this way, it will be crucial for modern, forward-looking railway undertakings to attract more freight and more passengers onto rail by providing services that customers want and that run on time.
If we continue to have the kind of planning system that we have today, which means that a railway undertaking cannot guarantee when a train travelling from Germany to Italy is going to arrive - there are hour- and even day-long delays - then rail is not going to be able to compete with HGVs.
But we want to create the framework conditions to ensure that trains can compete with HGVs.
I should like to make four brief comments on my report.
The first, Commissioner, is one on which I think we now agree.
The Commission wanted to postpone the introduction of the special rail network for freight services in Europe, the so-called Trans-European Rail Freight Network, which the first railway package already states will come into being on 15 March 2003.
We are against this and think that we need this special rail network on 15 March of this year so as to gain experience of cross-border freight transport.
I hope that the Commission agrees.
Secondly, we think that the aim set by the Commission of opening up the whole network to freight - both cross-border and national services - by 1 January 2006, as the Commissioner also indicated, should be clearly stated as from now, and not expressed as one-and-a-half years or two years after entry into force.
We want everyone to know that on 1 January 2006 they can be prepared for the networks actually to be opened up to freight services.
Thirdly, it is our view, Commissioner, that we also need to extend these rights to use rail for freight transport to other transport operators, not only the traditional railway undertakings or the new railway undertakings, but also the shippers and carriers.
Because only if all the players in the sector are on board - and that includes the shippers and carriers - will we be able to transfer freight from road to rail.
I therefore hope that you will also agree to the independent rights that we want to grant them.
My final point, Commissioner, relates to something that you did not address just now, but I should in any case like to make this request.
You said that the Commission did not want to table proposals to open up the networks to passenger services as well until 2003.
We in Parliament are one step ahead of you and have said: no, we do not want there to be so much domestic air traffic in Europe and would prefer passengers to take cross-border passenger train services. We therefore also want the rail market in passenger services to be opened up.
We are proposing making it possible for cross-border passenger services to operate from 1 January 2006, like freight services, and national passenger services at a later date, from 1 January 2008.
Commissioner, it is precisely if we want to ensure that airspace is used sensibly that we need to attract more passengers onto the railways.
I hope that you will support us in this.
Two final comments on the Sterckx report: I think that this report on safety standards is so magnificent that all I can say is that its main points go to the heart of the matter, in that it makes the provisions more precise and advocates a high level of safety in the interests of passengers and staff.
That is why we will be fully supporting this report.
Finally, Commissioner, I hope that you agree with us that we should encourage the Greek Presidency actually to adopt the common positions in March so that we can move the procedure forward and perhaps conclude this chapter, on opening up the railways in the European Community, by the end of the year.
Even if one or two Member States should have problems, the Community Treaty allows a decision to be taken by a majority in the Council of Ministers, and we should encourage the Greeks to take advantage of this possibility.
- (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that most of us in Parliament agree that we need a European approach and that national monopolies have no future.
It is, however, clear that in a European market such as this, where more players are entering the arena, there must be proper safety arrangements.
The safety situation is satisfactory at the moment.
Rail is a safe means of transport, it must remain at least as good and we must try to improve safety levels wherever possible.
The directive we are now producing is an initial step towards European safety policy.
At the moment there are still too many different rules and regulations which make this railway market in Europe too complex in many cases.
We must therefore develop a standard procedure for the different Member States in this directive.
Firstly, a structure.
Who is responsible for what?
The railway companies are naturally responsible for what they do, and as a Parliament we are adding the infrastructure managers to this.
Every Member State should therefore have a safety body which operates independently and openly and is transparent.
Everyone must know how things stand.
With regard to the operational side of things, however, I think that the safety bodies must be able to make use of the existing railway companies' know-how, knowledge and experience.
Secondly, we must have a common approach to safety, a common safety goal.
As a Parliament, we think that, once established, this goal must be put before the Council and Parliament again and must not only be assessed by a committee of national experts.
We must not only have a common goal but also a common working method, and I am somewhat stricter than you are when it comes to discouraging new national rules.
We will have to be as strict as possible in this regard, and the Commission must have the last word.
We must also - and I am somewhat more ambitious than the Commission in this regard too - establish a European objective, and we must state that our objective is to achieve one single set of European regulations.
We do not necessarily have to achieve this tomorrow, but we must at least be able to say what we are aiming for.
All players must have a management system, and there must be common safety certificates for staff, for rolling stock and also for the infrastructure manager.
As far as staff are concerned, I think that a European driving licence for train drivers is important.
We must work on this.
Communication is also important; that is something I have added to my report.
If you cross language boundaries you must also make sure that you solve language problems.
The agency must have its say about how this is to be done.
It is an important point, however.
Thirdly, we must develop a common method of investigating accidents, investigating incidents, an independent investigative body and criteria that must be respected in these investigations.
I think that we have achieved a balance between making our approach as European as possible with supervisors who are as independent as possible, and achieving a theoretical model that is also workable in practice.
So you must not simply dismiss the knowledge that the old monopolies have at their disposal; you must use it to create a workable system.
I am convinced that where we are now is an initial phase, that this is an initial step.
We will have to discuss safety a few times more and amend and adapt directives over the next 10, 15 and 20 years.
The structure we are now setting up will also have to prove its soundness in practice, and we must ensure that we are flexible enough to acknowledge our mistakes and to do something about them if necessary.
I also think that we have achieved a good balance when it comes to the involvement of the staff concerned.
It is important for the people who work on the railways to be involved in the things that concern them.
Safety is also the work of man, and the people who are responsible for this work must be involved in the decision making.
I think that this is in fact clearly stated in the directive.
With Mrs Ainardi's report on the technical obstacles and Mr Savary's report on the Railways Agency, which will be very important in the future as it will have to do a great deal of the work, we are thus taking a significant step towards a European railway environment.
Mr Jarzembowski's report is also a significant step forward.
What we need are open, dynamic, commercially-oriented railway companies that think European, not just nationally or locally.
The culture of the national monopoly is still very much in evidence and too often prevents Europe's railways from operating efficiently.
As Mr Jarzembowski and the Commissioner have also said, we need a dynamic rail industry.
When you see how the transport economy has developed, you cannot do without railway companies.
I get terror-stricken whenever I hear people from railway companies saying that if we do not adapt quickly we will have no more goods traffic on the railways, and we will be priced out of the market - not by the prices themselves but by bad working practices.
Rail is a sustainable means of transport and we must look after it.
With our reports and your proposals, Commissioner, I think that we are taking a significant step forward, for we need to progress towards a European transport market.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given that the European Union has published a White Paper explaining the need to revitalise rail transport, it is essential to ensure interoperability within the European rail system if it is to be developed. This is crucial to the future of European railways in the twenty-first century.
Rail is a more sustainable means of transport, entailing fewer external costs than road transport.
It is also more environmentally friendly and safer. Despite all this, rail freight has declined over the last twenty years.
It is my view that there are three main reasons for this decline.
Firstly, we have industrial strategies favouring road transport and 'just-in-time' management, resulting in a greater number of journeys and greater dispersal and fragmentation.
Furthermore, there is distortion of competition between road and rail transport. The level of social regulation relating to road transport is notably low when compared to that for rail.
I am thinking, in particular, of the fact that the regulation outlined in the Markov report to be discussed this morning does not address the question of a limit on driving time adequately.
Despite the fact that Mr Markov and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposed reducing driving time to 45 hours, the limit remains at 56 hours, which is clearly still far too long.
Lastly, I share the view that the development of different networks according to national specifications has limited trade and has lead to inadequate cooperation and incompatible standards.
My report on the high-speed network and the conventional network respectively, therefore seeks to make standards more compatible by bringing the two existing directives into line with each other. The report also includes a series of proposals to speed up harmonisation and to extend its scope.
I would like to point out that my report is closely linked to the report on establishing a European Railway Agency.
Consequently, a number of decisions on points concerning the Agency are included in my report as they stand in order to ensure that the package is coherent.
While preparing my report, I met with operators, experts, the Commission, trade unions and public authorities on many occasions. As a result of the meetings, I identified a number of issues to which I would like to draw your attention.
Firstly, in order to achieve interoperability, I think it is absolutely essential to take full account of the skills and know-how of the professionals working within the sector.
The European Union must ensure the involvement of the sector if it is to harmonise the rail system.
For example, during one of the meetings I had with railway staff, they proposed a recording device.
I took this on board, as I believed it to be relevant.
The introduction of a recording device now has universal support and is included in my report.
Secondly, further to all these meetings, it has become clear to me that harmonisation and safety rules are inextricably linked.
Harmonisation in this area cannot be carried out at a minimum level.
Safety standards vary across the European Union.
Lowering safety standards to facilitate access to infrastructure would be counter-productive and even dangerous.
Reducing safety would not be in the interests of harmonisation.
One question remains unresolved, namely funding.
Enormous investment is needed to achieve this new stage of development.
No specific budgetary provision is envisaged, though this is certainly called for.
I am delighted that agreement has been reached on Article 29 of the Sterckx report, which promotes social dialogue.
I also consider the agreement reached on the Savary report to be very important. This concerns the participation of staff representatives in drawing up technical specifications on interoperability (TSIs) which are of direct concern to them.
To ensure consistency between the various reports and the unity of the package, I would like to propose three oral amendments which take account of the agreements reached on the Sterckx and Savary reports.
I would also like to propose an amendment on the financial questions. Whilst I am aware that not everyone will share my point of view, I hope you will all understand the importance of the issue.
The package as a whole is extremely important, given what is at stake.
We bear an enormous responsibility for the future, as we are planning the European rail system for the twenty-first century.
I would in addition like to express my opinion on the package as a whole.
The Jarzembowski report proposes the complete liberalisation of rail freight services by 2003, and of national passenger services by 2008.
I must say that I am concerned about the proposals aimed at speeding up liberalisation, following up those proposed by the Commission.
The transposition of the first package is only just taking place in Member States, and an assessment of the consequences has therefore yet to be undertaken.
I am still concerned at the conclusions of the Barcelona Council, which sensibly called for a report to be drawn up and an assessment to be made before any new proposal is presented.
I agree that we need to revitalise the rail system.
It is my view that the harmonisation of standards is a very relevant issue, as is the need for an Agency and strict safety rules.
I do not however see why and how it should be deemed necessary to undertake the development of the rail network and opening it up to competition at the same time.
The Sterckx report on safety is also very important since, like the Commission, it is concerned in particular about the harmonisation of safety standards.
The harmonisation of safety standards should, however, take account of the real situation of the sector, especially as regards implementation time.
It would be useless, or even detrimental, to attempt to apply European standards too quickly.
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my conviction that both the long-term development and the revitalisation of the sector are at stake. The players in this sector count, be they operators or railway staff.
Their skills and knowledge are valuable. The European Union can and must show that it intends to involve them in the development of the rail system.
I would first like to congratulate the Commissioner and thank all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism who have worked so enthusiastically on these documents. I would like to express my appreciation first to the four rapporteurs for their excellent work, and to all the political groups.
I think that we have all put a lot into this second package because we feel that we need to develop the European rail network.
In the first place, I believe that we must make it clear to those who might have certain concerns or prejudices about the issue, that Europe really does need a railway network. Europe needs a railway network because it will have to deal with serious environmental problems in the years to come.
The public will not forgive us for not developing alternatives to road transport. Furthermore, European Union involvement in railways represents an opportunity for the sector, not a constraint or a threat.
What is clear is that the rail systems inherited from the old nation states are today no longer able to meet current demands.
As the Commissioner has reminded us, it is apparent that as regards freight transport in particular, in regions like mine, the cancer of lorries and cars is spreading day by day and people are continually asking us for solutions.
I therefore believe that we need to commit ourselves firmly to developing the European rail system.
At present there are three solutions or approaches to this problem.
The first way involves national tensions or, in other words, undeclared protectionism. It also entails corporatism and national vote-winning measures.
I think that this approach, evident in France and Germany, is not the way forward.
We should not fear opening up within the European Union.
Once again, this represents an opportunity for the rail sector as a whole.
There is a second way of addressing the problem. I think that the incidents involving the Prestige and the Erika should give us cause for reflection.
There is a price to be paid for transport.
Transport policy cannot solely involve lowering prices through unbridled competition. We must not ignore recent maritime disasters.
As a result of these terrible events we are today to set new standards and doubtless increase the cost of transporting dangerous goods by sea. At the same time we are moving in the opposite direction in the rail sector, and saying that policy of dumping at any price and competition at any price is an end in itself.
I think that the third way of tackling the rail sector is that of opening it up in a controlled way. This involves maintaining the culture and expertise developed by the rail sector while ensuring that networks are opened up.
In my opinion, this is the Swiss way.
The first way, the French and German way, is too conservative. There are lessons to be learnt regarding the second British and Dutch way.
The third, the Swiss way, opening up within a framework of functional integration, should be our enduring model. If we do not adopt this model, we are likely to be severely disappointed.
The European Union should of course direct this policy. In particular, it should have control of the implementation of rules and European harmonisation measures incumbent on all Member States.
I believe that safety must be an absolute priority, because a safety culture is crucial for the railways.
It is therefore essential that we adopt this approach. I would like to thank Commissioner de Palacio for the proposals that formed the basis of these very important reports.
As regards the Sterckx report, a crucial document in my opinion, we must be fully aware that safety policy must not amount to a policy for diluting responsibilities. We must not draw up a policy that will entail the levelling-down of safety standards.
Rather, we must have a very demanding policy that maintains functional integrity. This means maintaining the functional integration of the railway while ensuring political and judicial independence.
As regards the Ainardi report, I would simply hope that the amendments compatible with those relating to the Agency are adopted.
Lastly, on my report relating to an Agency to harmonise rail safety, the competent committee has already voted on 48 amendments. I thought we could have left it there, but yet another amendment has just been tabled.
We hoped this Agency would be an executive Agency of the Commission, steered by the Commission as far as possible. Thus we have an amendment stating that the Commission would preside over the Agency.
This falls within the scope of the executive. One would therefore assume that the European Parliament would not be represented.
I would like the number of Member States not to be increased but to remain at six. I would like them to adopt an executive posture, rather than what could be termed a parliamentary or legislative one.
I trust they will find it in themselves to do so.
In addition, we hoped to make the Agency a common organisation for the whole of the European rail industry.
I am personally convinced that we will not be able to develop a European rail system if the players in the sector are not agreed on working together to develop it.
We have therefore proposed including representatives from the entire rail sector on the administrative board.
Clearly, this will allow progress to be made on many issues.
Lastly, we hope there will be consultative committees, inquiry bodies and safety authorities. I have to say that personally I would be very worried if Amendment No 49 were carried, as this would destroy the entire proposal.
It seems to me that, on the occasion of this significant vote on the Agency, it would be unfortunate to content ourselves with the text adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I will finish on that note. I had intended to comment on the Jarzembowski report but I have run out of time and will do so in private.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time transport policy was a poor relation in European policy.
In plain language, for a long time nothing happened at all.
It required a judgment by default from the European Court of Justice for things slowly to start inching forward, step by step.
Admittedly, we have seen some movement on air and maritime transport in recent years - this is pleasing, and we are grateful for this, not least to the Commissioner - but the tragic events off the Spanish coast have shown that we are still a long way from where we actually should be.
It is above all in the sector that is being discussed here and now that we are still a long way from where we should be, namely in the rail sector.
Much ought to have been done here in the last few years and it still has not been done, including establishing genuine coordination between the Member States.
Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out that the rail sector is the only one in which the internal market is not a reality.
I would perhaps express this in even stronger terms: where rail is concerned we have probably not even started to make it a reality.
That is why the necessary balance between the individual modes of transport is still lacking.
This has also been mentioned once already today.
It cannot be stressed often enough.
The results are as bad as you would expect, particularly between road and rail where the gulf is tending to widen in the absence of sensible joint solutions.
The European rail system and its connection to the system in the candidate countries, which will soon be members of this Union, needs to be revitalised and made to work; otherwise a lot more will go wrong on our railways and we will have even more problems than we do now.
As an Austrian I am not only referring to transit across the Brenner Pass and the Alps; essentially this applies to all regions of Europe, all of which are sensitive to a greater or lesser degree, not only those that have been under intensive discussion over the last few days.
In this context, I should like, en passant, to apprise you of one fact, which is not without interest, because unfortunately it is never adequately taken into consideration in the discussion: the Austrian railways are the only ones to have increased their share of the freight market in the last few years.
All of our other neighbouring countries have continued to let road strengthen its lead over rail.
Now what is at issue specifically in the Ainardi report, for which I was also responsible as shadow rapporteur?
Interoperability should and must be made a reality across the entire network.
We cannot concentrate, as we did originally, on individual parts of the network - high-speed lines and so forth - and treat them separately.
We have to try actually to find one single structure, obviously with the necessary exemptions for regional railways - if they really are regional railways - for heritage railways and others.
When it comes to drafting and adopting these technical specifications we must firstly bear in mind that this is not the job of the European legislator, but that specialists must set to work on these, and European politicians are only called on to monitor progress.
What is important here are reasonable costs and a high degree of safety.
Both aspects have been addressed often enough here today.
I do not need to emphasise this particularly, but I do think that we should take them seriously.
Where safety is concerned, I would specifically point out that we have now tabled a proposal to extend the black box system to the railways.
This means that we also want to make progress on research, so as to ensure that in the long term we arrive where we need to arrive, at a functioning European transport system.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their work in this very important area.
This is a difficult and complex subject not made any easier by the position that the whole railway industry finds itself in.
If you look at rail freight in Europe, for example, the drop in traffic is quite alarming.
If nothing is done, then within the next 15 years rail freight will not exist.
There has to be change in how railways work, both in the passenger and freight sectors.
The industry itself has to recognise that its service levels have been unacceptable and Member States must also recognise that investment levels have been in decline for many years.
This is nowhere more apparent than in the field of interoperability: 15 different systems, different signalling systems, different power currents and an obsession at national level with working their own system to the detriment of international cooperation and to the detriment of interoperability.
It is the inability of a train to cross borders without changing locomotives, changing drivers or even changing bogeys that is the problem for our railways.
A 40-tonne heavy goods lorry is fully interoperable.
A freight train is not.
That is the difficulty that faces the industry. It is not an easy problem to overcome.
We need to give the railways time to improve their interoperability, but we must also remind them that time is running out and frankly with regard to freight the industry is now drinking in the last chance saloon.
I, on behalf of my group, have followed the report by Mr Sterckx with regard to safety more closely than the others.
It is our belief that in any work in the area of safety those who work in the sector must be involved.
In this regard a difference exists between us and the PPE-DE Group.
Our main goals are to ensure higher levels of safety whilst fully integrating our European rail system.
We must get away from the 15 different systems I mentioned earlier; however, we must ensure that Member States have an input, and in those areas where higher standards exist we must insist that they are maintained.
Dilution of safety standards is not an option.
That is why, as a group, we have submitted a number of amendments to Mr Sterckx's report.
All of us here are supporters of railways.
Indeed some of us are somewhat fanatical and are often called anoraks by our colleagues.
I hope the Commission proposals and Parliament's response are seen by those in the railway industry as an honest attempt to ensure that Europe's railway industry has a future.
In order to reach that goal we need politicians, we need governments, we need the Commission, but most of all we also need all sides in the railway industry working together.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I should firstly like to thank all the rapporteurs involved in the railway package.
They have done some excellent work.
Development of the railways, however, was far too late in getting started.
Now such areas as the promotion of competition in both freight and passenger transport services, increased interoperability and improvements in safety are huge challenges which really do require swift action to be taken.
The competitiveness of the railways has seriously decreased.
There has been a shift to transportation along congested roads as well as by air, because the railways have not been able to improve their services quickly enough.
This railway package will enable us to promote the competitiveness of the European railways, and improved competitiveness will mean that companies and the public will have the chance to utilise a more environment-friendly form of transport.
At the same time congestion can be relieved and short flights replaced by railway transport services, which will result in a better balance between transport operators.
Development of the railways will also clear the way for increased use of intermodal transport, as at the same time attention will be paid to improved interoperability of the ports and railways.
As shadow rapporteur, I have followed Mr Savary's drafting of the report closely.
Mr Savary has also done good work.
A properly established Railway Agency would boost development of the railways and monitor and promote innovation and good practice.
Our group believes, however, that the same principle should be followed regarding the composition of the Agency's administrative board as that which applies to the Maritime Safety Agency.
We have tabled an amendment on this for which we hope there is support.
These days, people and goods are travelling ever longer distances.
Much too much of this travelling is taking place on the motorway or by air.
Travelling by rail is more environmentally friendly, but most of our railway networks date back to an era when we stayed within our own state boundaries much more than we do now.
Virtually everyone now agrees on the need for modernisation with trains that can travel on the other side of the border with the same carriages, the same crew, the same voltage and the same safety requirements.
This can be achieved quickly by improving cooperation between national railway companies or by merging large-scale and cross-border activities into one single European operation.
Regrettably this increase in scale is now being misused to force all the Member States of the European Union to allow other companies with private capital to access the railway network.
Liberalisation means that we will only be able to travel where entrepreneurs can expect to make a profit.
The additional costs for planning, supervision, safety and infrastructure are being paid by the government, in other words the taxpayer, and the financial benefits go to international companies.
This compulsion to liberalise will make it more difficult to guarantee continuity and safety.
Despite the European unity that has been achieved, there is currently less cross-border rail traffic in many places than there was in the time before the EU was created.
International night trains are being cancelled, long-distance connections are being severed, railway timetables for 'abroad' are no longer being issued, boarding bans are being introduced and there will be no railway facilities for the rapid transportation of perishable goods.
Even before the compromise of the end of 2000 concerning corridors for goods transportation by other companies comes into effect, attempts are already being made to push through even more far-reaching liberalisation with the aim of putting international goods traffic first, then domestic goods traffic, then international passenger traffic and finally all traffic in the hands of companies that have fewer obligations to society as a whole.
In the Netherlands, which wanted to take the lead, liberalisation has resulted in a significant reduction in the quality of train services.
Part of the package of four reports that have just been presented will have a detrimental effect on the railway company's duty of service.
If we do not accept that part, the future will look a great deal better.
Mr President, I would first like to thank all fellow MEPs and rapporteurs.
The aim of all reforms must be to create a sustainable transport policy in Europe.
Liberalisation can sometimes be a means to achieving this, but never an end in itself.
The extremely poor situation in respect of maritime transport must indeed be a warning to us.
Freight traffic in Europe has become a problem due to the enormous increase in the number of lorries on our roads.
I myself regard early liberalisation of goods transport by rail as a sure fire way of quickly reducing the number of lorries on the road, provided that it is given sufficient support.
Indeed, we do not view liberalisation as an end in itself, and we are therefore not in favour of liberalising passenger transport.
Passenger transport by rail is a public service and must remain so.
Transport must also remain affordable for everyone, so it should not only be the profitable lines that are allowed to be leased or sold.
The negative consequences of liberalisation are already being felt by travellers.
International lines outside of the high-speed network are being cut back.
One example is the fast overnight connection between Brussels and Milan which, as my Italian colleagues know, has been scrapped as a result of competition from air travel, a mode of transport in which the environmental costs are not calculated into the ticket price.
That there is a problem is, however, demonstrated by the poor rail connection between Brussels and Strasbourg I got a taste of yesterday.
The European Commission has done too little research into the consequences of liberalisation for rail transport.
We think that an assessment is urgently needed before we go any further down the road towards liberalisation.
We cannot make decisions on accelerating the pace of liberalisation of rail transport until such time as we have a clear picture of the impact this liberalisation will have on working conditions, safety, the environment, the effective improvement of consumer choice and the growth of the sector.
With this in mind, we have therefore submitted an amendment to Mr Jarzembowski's report.
The three other reports closely reflect the problems and issues of the sector.
Firstly that of safety in the Sterckx report.
Then coming up with practical ways of cooperating effectively in the Ainardi report.
Finally, a Railways Agency to support the entire harmonisation process and to get it on track in the Savary report.
The era of containers being transported from the North Sea port to Northern Italy on trains crawling along at 18 km per hour must be consigned to history as soon as possible.
The Sterckx, Savary and Ainardi reports place the emphasis on cooperation and consultation between different companies.
These companies could naturally have done this themselves, but they seem to only spring into action when competition is imminent.
Europe should naturally have organised this internal rail market much earlier.
This Railways Agency should have been in place thirteen years ago.
The free movement of goods was not organised in a sustainable way in the twentieth century.
The twenty-first century must bring the changes we so urgently need.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are indeed some excellent sections in the reports on the development of rail transport we have before us.
In particular, Mr Jarzembowski is right to be concerned about the decline of rail transport compared to road and air transport.
As regards freight, the Commission has noted that the market share of rail freight transport in Europe has declined from 21% in 1970 to 8% in 1998.
During this time, however, the volume of goods requiring transportation has increased considerably and people are travelling ever more frequently.
These developments have had disastrous consequences.
This increase in the flow of goods and people has disastrous repercussions for three spheres. There are consequences for the environment as road and air transport cause more pollution than railways.
There are consequences in terms of increased traffic as the road network and air corridors are saturated.
There are also consequences in terms of personal safety as it is safer to travel by train than by car, given that many tens of thousands of people die in road traffic accidents in Europe every year.
The French suffer more than most from these road accidents. The higher road death toll is not down to the French being more reckless behind the wheel than their European neighbours, as the French Government maintains.
The explanation lies in the fact that the major trunk routes used by lorries in France linking Mediterranean countries with Northern and Eastern Europe have now reached full capacity.
These lorries sometimes hog the carriageway for several kilometres and cause many accidents and traffic-jams. The suffering endured by thousands of drivers who became stuck in their cars in temperatures of as low as -5Â° during the night from 4 to 5 January was certainly the result of snowfall, but it was mainly caused by the shortcomings of the motorway maintenance services and lorries stuck in the snow on the road.
I do not think, however, that the proposals presented in the reports of our fellow Members, which the Commission supports, address the situation appropriately.
In my opinion, France has no need of a European Railway Agency or more European regulation in order to free up its roads. It needs a government that will assume its responsibilities and tackle the causes of the problem.
We should ask ourselves why the French Government has failed to follow the example of the Swiss Government on this matter.
The government should build a piggyback rail network and oblige all lorries travelling through France to use it.
We should ask ourselves why so many French companies transport their products by lorry and not by train, and why millions of French people use their cars rather than using public transport.
One reason is that the SNCF is in the grip of the trade unions and is consequently becoming worse and worse at fulfilling its role as a public service.
Another is that French people no longer feel safe when using public transport because of security fears and because they are intimidated by the yobs who go on the rampage on it.
A third is that the car is one of the few remaining freedoms in an increasingly regulated society.
Our leaders are out of touch with reality.
They have official cars and dream of recreating life under Mao.
Many Maoists have in fact been reincarnated as environmentalists. Our leaders would like to see us using clapped-out public transport or bicycles, as the people did under Mao, whilst they themselves enjoy the means of transport the people have provided for them.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs, who have done a magnificent job.
Although there are some differences of opinion on the detail, we are in very substantial agreement with the reports and will - at least I assume we will - be adopting them today, because, as Mrs Peijs has just said, it has been possible to reach some important compromises.
This package, building on earlier decisions, will actually take us an important step closer to establishing a European railway.
The restrictions imposed by the nation-states, and the fears that they still have, will - I hope - soon be consigned to the past.
I dealt personally with Mr Jarzembowski's and Mrs Ainardi's reports.
Mr Jarzembowski's report - and once again Mr Jarzembowski has disappeared off somewhere; he is a real European high-speed train and is never where he actually should be, but be that as it may - proposes extensive liberalisation.
Obviously for us Social Democrats - let me be quite open about it - this is a tricky business.
Today, for various reasons, a large majority of us will go along with these proposals: firstly, because they are part of an overall agreement, as part of which we have also, particularly in the Savary report, obtained a series of provisions guaranteeing workers' rights and opportunities.
I have no fears in this regard, Mrs Peijs, but we certainly must focus on the working conditions and health and safety in the sector for the sake of those employed there.
Secondly, there are unfortunately a number of countries that are still very restrictive where market opening is concerned.
I therefore assume that a more constructive and reasonable compromise proposal will emerge from the conciliation procedure.
Thirdly, it is my view that we need to put pressure on the national railway undertakings, be they public or private.
Many of these railway undertakings have not read the signs of the times; they have entered into cooperation with each other only to a very limited extent and only in some areas, for example high-speed trains.
The railway companies have either not recognised that nowadays transport services at least have to be European - which has of course long been the case for HGVs - or they have not done anything about it.
A certain amount of pressure to liberalise and move towards market opening is therefore certainly very important for the national railway companies.
Turning now to Mrs Ainardi's report, this is also a very good piece of work.
We regret the fact that, particularly in this report, too little account has been taken of some aspects of social harmonisation, because there are understandably fears on the part of workers that this will lead to a kind of social dumping.
I believe that it is particularly important for the workers to be included in the process of reforming the railways.
The civil servants and others employed in the railway sector also need to know that the times of national, restricted, controlled railway undertakings are over, and that this is about creating a European railway.
Once again, I believe that the essential point here is that, hopefully, today's decision will send out a signal to the railway undertakings, so that they will make it their own business to create a real European railway.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, in particular on their close cooperation, because the interrelated nature of the package requires the reports to be relatively interdependent.
I would also like to mention that the committee of which I am chairman has worked well on this matter, as always.
It is no coincidence that, during 2002, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism initiated 34 reports in the transport sector, seven of which focused precisely on the modernisation of the railways.
It is quite clear, however, that the committee is concerned by certain delays in the Council and has made this clear in more or less formal terms.
I, personally, have even written a letter to the Danish Presidency, and I will reiterate these same points to the Greek Transport Minister, Mr Verelis, who is coming to visit the committee and attend a hearing next week.
The first railway package is closely related to the second railway package and, just like the carriages of a train, they must move forward, or else there will be a real danger of a kind of rail traffic jam.
The second railway package is important, and I would like to say that our approach is not an ideological promotion of the railways, of which we are sometimes accused.
I believe that the case of freight transport is extremely significant: the use of the railways is continuing to decline, despite all the good intentions expressed.
When I consider specific cases which are particularly important to me such as the trans-Alpine routes, I find this totally unacceptable.
I regret to say that there is no genuine European rail network. We are building it with these directives.
It is strange that, with all their areas of sovereignty taken away from them, the only one remaining for the States in Europe is a kind of railway sovereignty, which we have got to break up and reshape in a European mould.
I am not very impressed by this second rail package given that I strongly support the public services. I voted against the first rail package also.
Its effects have yet to make themselves felt in practice.
It has not even been fully implemented. Nevertheless, we have already been presented with a second package, which is just as bad as the last previous one.
The aim of the Jarzembowski report is to speed up the development of competition. It attempts to apply road transport standards to rail transport with disastrous consequences.
It is actually stated clearly that opening up the rail freight transport market will lead to increased competition which is likely to entail job losses.
In short, this report means more liberalisation for fewer jobs.
As for the report on safety, its main aim is liberalisation; safety is just an excuse.
It is evident that the justification sections often use the safety argument to protect the internal market and exclude new players.
The market and safety issues are however clearly incompatible.
I will vote in favour of the next two reports, even though the funds allocated to achieving interoperability are meagre and insufficient, and even though the Agency will remain confined within the framework, in which it was established, namely liberalisation.
We would do well to remember the long list of environmental and human disasters that ensued from the complete liberalisation of the maritime transport sector.
The liberalisation of sectors that are currently regulated will spell profits for some, but for the rest it will mean accidents, poor working conditions, redundancy and for the passengers, a lower standard of service.
Sadly, we have already seen many examples of this, from the collapse of Sabena and that of Air Lib, to the state of the railways in Britain
I remain a strong advocate for the provision of a high-quality European public service.
I am for cooperation between different rail networks. I fully support the process of harmonising working conditions, safety standards, salaries and social rights.
I believe that the people and those employed in the public services should be in control. In short, I am opposed to this second rail package.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteurs.
Heavy words indeed: the railway industry drinking in the last chance saloon and ceasing to exist after a certain time.
Mr Jarzembowski was also talking about a balanced relationship.
We endorse that.
We also think that it is absolutely necessary to revitalise the railways, for environmental and other reasons.
Interoperability must be changed, safety must be improved, we must set up a Railways Agency, and so on.
Let us go back briefly to the core of the matter, however.
We actually disagree strongly with regard to the package that Mr Jarzembowski is talking about.
We have already had some experience with liberalisation in Europe - in the UK and in the Netherlands as well.
I would like to talk about the Dutch example briefly.
An article in this morning's newspaper. Mr Zalm, the Liberal front runner in the elections and a former Dutch minister, is now saying that it was a mistake to split up NS and ProRail.
In other words, Railway Directive 91/440/EC, the original separation of infrastructure and operation, is seen as being wrong.
The Dutch Minister of Transport, Mr de Boer, also came to this conclusion recently and is asking for an inquiry for this very reason.
Back to square one.
In other words, we think that liberalisation is an excellent opportunity for goods transport.
We think, however, that we will have to take a good look at what this liberalisation of passenger transport is going to deliver, because it is not going well.
For this reason we are asking most emphatically for an evaluation proposal and we hope that you will support the amendment.
How it is possible that the socialists in the UK, who after all have had the same miserable experiences with liberalisation and the other aspects of privatisation of the railways, can still be in favour of Mr Jarzembowski's proposals is completely beyond my comprehension.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Liberal, I am very satisfied with the railways package and our four rapporteurs' reports.
Particularly with the fact that Mr Jarzembowski has included passenger transport in his report and has outlined a plan for it.
The further liberalisation of Europe's oldest mechanised infrastructure, the railways, is an essential stimulus for a sector that is quickly losing ground in the European goods traffic market.
I cannot emphasis often enough that liberalisation is somewhat different from independence or uncontrolled privatisation, as was tried in the UK.
It is of vital importance - including for the sector itself - that we have more providers on the European railways.
Only then can we achieve a healthy railway market through genuine competition.
Why not let the NS-cargo/DB-cargo combination compete directly with SNCF.
There is nothing wrong with that.
It must all be safe, so we, the legislators, must assume our responsibility for this.
Mrs Ainardi's report is based on interoperability, acknowledging each other, the international recognition of regulations, the recognition of signals and the recognition of safety standards.
That is also why it is so important to pay attention to this. That is why the European Railways Agency, proposed the Savary report, is so important.
From an organisational point of view, I would like the European Railways Agency to be coordinated with the European Maritime Safety Agency so that all these matters are organised independently, transparently, unambiguously and logically for all parties concerned.
Foresight is the essence of government.
In order to achieve efficiency, perhaps we can combine everything in the European safety agencies for the various modes of transport at some stage in the distant future and in this way integrate the sector fully with other modes.
After all, this is all about railway transport being integrated with society, integrated with roads and integrated with water in order to get products and goods from A to B more easily.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are today dealing at first reading with both the development strategy and the interoperability of the trans-European rail system, including its safety, and the creation of a European agency responsible for its monitoring and which I believe should also be responsible for its control.
In my opinion, and since I am in favour of the liberalisation of rail transport, I am not sure that it is right to liberalise the infrastructures, that is, the railway lines.
I believe it would be better, as is the case with motorways, to only liberalise the operation of the railways, leaving the rail infrastructures under public ownership.
I believe this would be the best formula for sustainable responsibility for the appropriate maintenance of them beyond the restrictions which would be imposed by the objectives of economic and financial viability inherent in any private initiative.
And, in any event, I believe there must be an early assessment of the effects of liberalisation both in terms of safety, social and environmental repercussions, the effect on the interests of clients and users and on public service as well as the development of intermodality, and also its effect on the companies involved within the transport market.
I would ask the Commission to inform us regularly and periodically on all these issues.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at times in this debate you get the impression that we have been building a European Union for only a short time and are addressing issues that actually ought to have been dealt with long ago.
It is inherent in the very concept of the internal market that freight and passenger transport should have an appeal that gains them acceptance.
The national railway companies' actions in recent years have predominantly been characterised by the fact that they have continued to try to cordon off their markets, while at the same time coming to terms with the consistent and dramatic decline in their figures in the freight transport sector.
The only way of putting freight transport back on track at all is to ensure, firstly, that cross-border journeys can operate more smoothly in the future and, secondly, that the market is opened up and competition introduced, so that those who wish to offer attractive freight transport services have the opportunity to do so, and - so far at least -it has usually not been the national rail companies that have done this.
When I hear people argue that liberalisation would mean job cuts then I only have one thing to say in reply: if the current trend continues there will not be any jobs in the rail freight sector at all, a result of the railways' conscious decision to neglect freight transport because it is not worth their while.
I can only say that those who are well intentioned towards the railways have to ensure that the rail systems are compatible across Europe, that the highest safety requirements are put in place and, in addition, they must ensure that the railways are customer-friendly, which means that they should be reliable, that they should have attractive services on offer and that they should stick to their timetables.
I can only hope that we and the Commissioner can push this through together in the Council.
Measures in other areas - the Single European Sky to name but one example, when we wanted to have Europe designate airspace blocks in the future, because the national Member States had been failing to do so for decades - were repeatedly blocked by the Council, because they thought that all of this could be resolved bilaterally.
I can only say that the Member States should have done it long ago, and now we are going to do it instead!
Mr President, I shall take advantage of this second opportunity to address the House to comment in more detail on Mr Jarzembowski's report. This document contains two groundbreaking proposals.
The first involves the abolition of the Trans-European Rail Freight Network and contemplates the complete liberalisation of international as well as national, regional and local freight networks by 2006. The second involves the opening up and liberalisation of the rail passenger network.
As regards the first proposal, I share the view that we need to make a strong political gesture in support of railways. Though it may not be wise to be forever changing the dates, I personally support Mr Jarzembowski's proposals for freight, given that the issue is now so worrying.
I have many more reservations however about international rail passenger services.
Unlike freight, I do not consider the liberalisation of passenger services to be an absolute priority.
I regularly take the train and have not encountered any particular difficulties at border crossings. I am nevertheless aware that there are significant commercial interests at stake in this sector.
I do not support the view that we should restrict ourselves simply to creating a rail market. Rather, I think we should work towards a European transport policy, which is not quite the same thing.
To conclude, what has emerged clearly from today's debate is that, whether or not we open up the rail networks, we cannot restrict our work on a European rail network to liberalisation, competition or opening up networks.
If we do, we will have parts of the market that duplicate each other within the same area, and rail will constitute a substitute for road transport.
Other aspects of the transport strategy therefore need to be implemented.
The fixing of price scales has to be considered, as does the reduction of the social and fiscal disparities between different means of transport, especially between road and rail transport. I think that the latter should be a priority if we want to ensure that the opening up of the rail market gives the rail sector an advantage over road.
We must create an investment policy, not simply a rail market.
Consequently, I personally hope that this debate sends a very strong message from the European Parliament to the Council.
For many months trans-European rail network funding policy has been deadlocked in the Council. It has maintained a regressive approach to the matter and does not want to consider fiscal issues, fuel taxation or large European loans.
It is my belief that without a major and ambitious policy on rail infrastructure, our attempts at opening up the sector will not put a stop to the dominance of road transport but will only lead to a fight between the various rail companies.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the message I would like to send from the European Parliament to the Council.
Mr President, all these reports on Community railways are part and parcel of the recent tidal wave of privatisation aimed at ensuring that not one public sector escapes the clutches of private capital, at the expense of quality, public safety and the cost of the services provided.
Accounting tricks and baseless arguments are being used to persuade us that, as with road transport, which contributes nothing to the infrastructure costs of the road network but is open to the private sector, we should allow the private sector to run down railway infrastructures and services which they have done nothing to create and which were and still are paid for by the taxpayer, in the name of free competition.
In the middle of a serious recession in the economy, in energy, in road, air and sea transport and in the environmental sector, big business has seen the potential in the railways for saving energy and cutting costs - and hence making a profit - and has turned its attention to rail transport and is trying to penetrate it ''as an equal partner'', although in practice there is nothing ''equal' about it in relation to the nationalised railway companies.
In other words, the Commission proposals - and unfortunately these reports go along with them - care nothing for quality, the cost of transport or the safety of users, all of which have been blown out of the water by the philosophy of unbridled competition and the profitability of capital, leaving the way free for private investors to ransack the profitable rail transport sector and dump responsibility for exorbitant infrastructure building and maintenance costs and the unprofitable side of rail transport on the public sector.
As you will have gathered, we totally oppose proposals for any moderate, calculated liberalisation of the railways because it paves the way for full liberalisation with all the adverse consequences that will have on the travelling public.
Mr President, the process of opening up the European rail network to competition, as recommended by the Jarzembowski report, is a retrograde step. It represents a serious threat to the interests of both rail users and employees.
Voting in favour of this report amounts to behaving like a vulgar lobbyist for those private interests who want to do away with the public service railways.
Everyone knows that private companies are only interested in their profits and will therefore cut back on investment or staff.
Everyone is aware that the privatisation of British Rail has led to a series of disasters.
We will not neglect the interest of the people of Europe so that a small number of private organisations can make money on the backs of rail users, while possibly putting passengers' lives at risk.
Rail transport should be an integrated European public service. We reject this report and all other proposals for privatisation.
Mr President, I had actually intended to say something completely different, but in the light of the last two speakers' comments I will digress somewhat and take up another point.
We have heard things said that actually belong in the past - in a past that is, thankfully, long gone - a time when all that mattered was intervention and the class struggle, when people tried to create confrontation.
I believe that this was completely the wrong attitude.
History has condemned this approach and life punishes latecomers, as an extremely famous man once said, a man who had his roots in this system and then in the end also brought about its downfall because he knew it so well, I mean President Gorbachev.
We want better environmental protection, more goods to be transferred from road to rail, a better modal balance and thus better protection for consumers.
Better protection for consumers: let me give you an example of something that happened two days ago in my home region, in the cross-border Brenner Pass, where consignments of dangerous goods, which now have to be carried by road because there are no rail services that can handle them, caught fire, with very serious consequences for the environment and for the public.
We escaped an environmental disaster by the skin of our teeth.
This is our intention: we want to make transport safer, and here I am particularly grateful to my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, who has been fighting for these initiatives to be taken for years.
We hope that these reports - and his in particular - will mean that we can take a substantial step in the right direction.
I am also grateful to the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, who has a particularly good understanding of this issue and is endeavouring to achieve a modal balance.
We hope that we can continue further along this positive route.
Mr President, we of course support all measures designed to enhance the role of rail transport and to change the present situation, which favours road transport.
That is why we particularly support the reports by Sylviane Ainardi and Gilles Savary.
If we want to have a competitive European railway system, we must harmonise technical standards and remove bottlenecks in the international network, and at the same time create high safety standards.
Nevertheless, we will not achieve the interoperability needed by liberalising this sector.
In cases where this has happened, private operators have not responded, particularly as regards the high levels of investment required.
Nor has the Commission told us where it is going to find the finance needed to achieve this goal.
It will not help at all to increase the flow of traffic by stimulating competition between the various operators if all the trains are forced to run on the same tracks, because that will simply lead to greater chaos and congestion.
Furthermore, we are against the total liberalisation of the freight and passenger transport sectors by 2008.
We oppose this extreme position just as we oppose the Commission proposal to anticipate the opening up of the market in international freight transport, and we equally cannot accept the Member States being prevented from setting safety standards higher than those stipulated by the EU, simply so as not to create difficulties in opening up this market.
We are responsible to Europe's citizens.
We must have the courage to fight for a public rail transport service which is of a high standard and safe, which will encourage people to use it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like once again to congratulate the four rapporteurs on their excellent work and say that, in general, the amendments they propose support - as I said at the beginning of my first speech - the Commission's proposals. Furthermore, in some cases, they propose going further and more quickly in the reform of the rail sector.
That is why the majority of the proposals are acceptable to the Commission, either in their current form or in principle.
I believe that they clearly improve on the Commission's initial text: they provide it with detail, they improve it and they clarify some of the specific points.
I will provide Parliament's Secretariat with a complete list indicating the Commission's position on each of the amendments, but I would nevertheless like to make a few comments in relation to our discussions and some general assessments of the amendments.
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised that some of you are still raising the debate on whether or not the railways should be liberalised.
Ladies and gentlemen, to those of you who love the railways so much that they want nothing to be done, all I can say is that over the years we have seen what is taking place: the railways are disappearing.
If we do nothing - and I say this to those who are so worried that jobs will be lost with this supposed liberalisation - what will happen is that there will be no jobs, except for those which remain in the railway museums of the different countries of the European Union.
That is what we have to realise.
We are not talking about privatising the rail network.
That is an option which may be chosen by some countries, but I would like to point out to the honourable Member that for the only one that had adopted the fixed network, the fixed infrastructure, we have recently authorised a series of very significant State measures in order to renationalise that rail network.
The Commission is not adopting any action of this type.
We are proposing something different: the network is a natural monopoly, and therefore, the existence of non-public ownership would lead to many difficulties, and there should be a series of public controls of this natural monopoly.
We are saying that a natural monopoly, such as a European network, should above all be European, there should be no national concept, but a global European one, which requires common technological, administrative and safety rules.
Secondly, we argue that there should be competition between the various operators.
Ladies and gentlemen, some of you are concerned that there will be competition between the French operator - or the French operators, France will decide what to do - and the German, British or any other European Union operator.
The only alternative to this situation of competition is to create a single European operator, operating for the entire European rail network.
Do the honourable Members really believe that this can be done? That this is the way to make the railways more operative, more competitive and more dynamic, and to recover the market quotas and the sections of transport which correspond to them?
I frankly believe not; that is not the way forward.
The way forward is the one we are proposing: the conception and planning of the railways at European level - later I will discuss funding as well; European planning of the railways and for the different operators currently in the countries of the European Union to be able to compete within this network.
And, if there are new operators - because the legislation in the different countries authorise this - that they fulfil suitable requirements to be able to operate throughout this rail network, and that they also compete.
We are talking about introducing rationality into the rail sector and turning it into a rail sector which is European and appropriate for the twenty-first century.
I understand, as Mr Caveri, chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has said, that the Directorate-General for Transport has made them work hard on the railways.
As Commissioner responsible for transport, I would like to thank the chairman and the entire committee once again for their understanding, support and cooperation in all our work.
Mr President, I will refer briefly to the amendments tabled.
With regard to Mr Jarzembowski's report, in relation to the opening up of the market, I would stress his support for the Commission's proposal, with a view to completing the opening up of the market in the transport of goods by rail.
The amendments presented deal with coordination in the time between the entry into force of Directive 2001/12/EC, on the first stage of the opening up to competition of goods transport by rail, which must be incorporated into the legislation of the Member States so that, from 15 March 2003, we have a starting gun for the whole of the European Union, with the supplementary stages we propose and, specifically, the incorporation of all the networks of the Union countries into a European network.
In this regard, all these amendments are acceptable to the Commission.
With regard to the amendments which propose extending the opening up to competition of the passenger sector, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Jarzembowski, the Commission believes that, in order to produce positive effects, this opening up, which requires a differentiated pace, requires a more appropriate and stricter framework.
This opening up should therefore be considered not only from the point of view of the contracts signed by public administrations - something already regulated by the proposed regulations on public service obligations, which is still awaiting the decision of the Council, since Parliament gave its opinion on them some time ago - but also from the point of view of access rights and the protection of passenger rights.
Mr Jarzembowski, we cannot accept these amendments, because we are waiting to present a proposal this year specifically for passengers and which will deal in a coherent manner with the problem of opening up competition in the railways for the passenger sector.
I would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for his support for the proposals the Commission will shortly present.
With regard to Mr Sterckx's report on rail safety, we can accept the majority of the amendments, either in their current form or in principle, with some modifications of the text.
I am referring essentially to the amendments which strengthen the requirement for transparency in terms of safety and which advocate a more rapid and intensive convergence of the strictest possible safety rules.
I believe that that is the important point.
However, we cannot accept either Amendment No 18 nor Amendment No 48, because they would be contrary to a clear distribution of responsibilities; we also have difficulties in accepting Amendment No 34, since we believe that it could considerably reduce the European scope of safety certificates.
On the other hand, I must say that we attach the greatest possible importance to the independence of investigating bodies in the event of accidents, and we cannot therefore accept any restriction of this independence. We do not therefore accept Amendment No 56.
I share Mrs Ainardi's view of the problem of investments, because all of this is going to require considerable investments on the part of the Member States of the Union.
Each of the Member States has an interest in promoting this modernisation of the railways, but there is also a very obvious European interest in promoting the modernisation of the trans-European railway system.
This is something that we must bear in mind if we really want to achieve the objective and ambitions of the Lisbon European Council.
Therefore, I am going to make an appeal in this regard, with a view to the post-Berlin financial perspectives, that the budgets for rail transport infrastructures be increased, in a plan to create the trans-European rail network, which requires a special effort.
We accept the proposal of the orange box of recorders, which will be strengthened with the LRTMS.
Here also we can accept the majority of the amendments, but not all of them, since some of them are not in line with the principles.
With regard to the report by Mr Savary, who, like all the Members and myself, is one of the friends of the railways, the key element which completes the whole circle is precisely the agency.
I would like to thank Mr Savary for the improvements he contributes through his proposals.
Several amendments deal with the way the agency will have to work with all the countries involved, that is, companies, operators, manufacturers of materials, operators of infrastructures and also users and people working in the rail sector.
We support all these amendments, in particular Amendment No 14, which we consider to be very positive.
We naturally also support various amendments relating to the institutional organisation of the agency which deal, for example, with the new financial regulation, which did not exist when the proposal was originally made.
However, there are other amendments which cause us difficulties, for example those which would effectively confer decision-making powers on the agency, when we believe that it must only have the capacity to make technical proposals.
Other amendments are superfluous in view of provisions in force or proposals planned for 2003 and we cannot therefore accept them.
I would like to conclude, Mr President, by once again thanking the four rapporteurs and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for the work they have done, and I would like to thank this Parliament for its support.
Following my conversations with the Greek Presidency, I am sure that under its mandate, and very possibly at the Council in March, we will have a common position from the Council, and I hope it will allow us, if not at first reading, at least at the second, to reach an agreement on this extremely important package.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The economic capacity and productivity of Europe's economy is to an ever greater extent dependent on efficient interoperable transport which can rapidly move freight and passengers within Europe and onward to international transport links.
Nevertheless, we have failed to make significant progress on rail transport.
Decisions have chiefly been made at intergovernmental level, with each country trying to defend its own interests, and this has undermined the creation of a European railway market.
This situation is untenable, because we are reaching saturation point in road transport, which is imposing a very heavy burden on our economic and environmental systems. Political will and an appropriate level of funding are needed to tackle this problem.
Furthermore, the problems of rail transport in the peripheral countries, such as Portugal, need to be taken on board in providing solutions at European level if the EU is to function as a whole and to be economically efficient.
So the Council must follow the lead of the European Parliament by showing the required political will and by finding the finance needed to create an internal European market in rail transport.
The next item is the report (A5-0388/2002) by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (COM(2001) 573 - C5-0485/2001 - 2001/0241(COD))
Mr President, firstly, as Commissioner responsible for transport, I would like to express my gratitude for being able to present this proposal on the social field in the road transport sector which forms part of the Commission's policy aimed at increasing road safety and the quality of road transport.
There are social consequences in relation to safety in the road transport sector, and I believe we must deal with them.
The proposal includes measures which will promote the efficient and uniform interpretation and application of the current rules, as stated in the White Paper, which will harmonise even further the competition conditions in the road transport sector.
This proposal repeals and replaces the Regulation of 1985.
Its aim is to simplify, clarify and update a piece of legislation which was approved 17 years ago.
This modification favours effective application of the rules and in particular the introduction of digital speedometers.
In order to simplify these rules, we have had to reduce the degree of flexibility of the Regulation in force, complex rules on compensation for reduced rest periods have been eliminated and the duration of daily rest has been increased by one hour to 12 hours.
In order to update the rules, exemptions and exceptions have been reduced to the minimum and have been restricted to small and light vehicles, those used for short distances and those which offer a public service.
One of the main factors which has inspired this revision has been the increase over the last 17 years in the number of services offered by private companies.
In order to achieve this more effective application of the rules, the Commission wants to introduce certain new aspects into them, including the tightening of rules on the responsibility of companies and explicit provisions to facilitate the imposition of sanctions in a Member State on drivers who violate the Community rules in another State of the European Union.
Furthermore, an explicit provision is introduced so that all Member States adopt the seizure of vehicles as one of the penalties for failing to comply with the law.
Immobilising vehicles is a very effective way to penalise not only transport companies, but also transport agencies, which increasingly put pressure on drivers, demanding unreasonable and even entirely illegal driving times.
Finally, in order to promote the constant clarification of the rules, a fruitful exchange of experiences and practices in relation to respect for them and active participation by all the Member States in the application of the Regulation, the Commission proposes the creation of an advisory committee made up of national experts from each of the Member States of the Union.
This committee will work in collaboration with the existing European-level committee for dialogue with the sector.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to sum up, this is our proposal, the fundamental intention of which is to improve compliance with the rules currently in force, to clarify their content, to increase responsibility and therefore to improve road safety.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in which Parliament found itself when it was asked to draft this report was not a propitious one, because the Commission had drafted its proposal for this regulation without waiting for either the result of conciliation on the Working Time Directive or the Council decision on the digital tachograph.
Both documents are - as Mrs de Palacio said - obviously closely related, by virtue of their content, to this report.
I should like to thank Mr Andersson, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We had a number of preliminary discussions together.
Originally an Enhanced Hughes Procedure was announced, but a few months later this was dispensed with and responsibility for the report was transferred to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
My thanks also go to the Commission staff, Mr Darmis from the committee administration, many European and national institutions, which are affected by this regulation and have played an active part in the debate, and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups.
I believe that it was this cooperation that made it possible for a number of important compromise amendments to be adopted in the committee.
The regulation on the table has to take into account and interlink three different aspects. Firstly, improved road safety; secondly, social protection of workers, and thirdly, fair conditions of competition on the European Union's roads.
I believe that a compromise between the groups has been successfully reached and that these three premises have been successfully integrated, although a few Members are proposing to reject the regulation.
I would ask you not to comply with their wishes and instead to give the proposed draft the go-ahead.
What then are the most important points on which a majority of the committee has so far been able to agree?
One, the regulation applies to all drivers of vehicles carrying goods or passengers by road, regardless of whether they are employed or self-employed.
Two, the regulation also applies to vehicles from third countries when they are in the territory of the European Union.
Three, the Commission is instructed to table this regulation for negotiation with the contracting parties to the AETR.
Four, the concept of the flexible week that has been newly introduced by the Commission has not been confirmed and instead we retain the calendar week as a basis because this is more practical and easier to monitor.
Five, the concept of 'driving time' has been defined by the committee so as to create greater legal certainty.
Six - this is a very important point and I hope that it will be retained - all courier and express delivery services, which have contributed to a sharp increase in accidents in the transport sector, are included in the regulation.
Seven, the daily rest period has been increased from the proposed 11 hours to 12 hours, although some flexibility is possible as it can be divided into two portions, of nine plus three hours, in a limited number of cases.
Eight, the Member States are obliged to define a common range of sanctions to be applied in cases of infringement of the regulation, so as to harmonise the sanctions.
Nine, the number of proposed checks on compliance with the regulation has been doubled.
Ten, the transport undertakings are obliged to take the steps required to acquaint themselves with the total time worked, even where drivers are employed by several employers.
Eleven, the Member States have to take the necessary measures to ensure that relations between shippers, forwarding agents, main customers and subcontractors are regulated by the adoption of binding contracts which enable compliance with the regulation to be monitored.
Twelve, it was possible to delete some of the very numerous exemptions and also introduce some necessary new ones, such as, for example, for vintage vehicles and vehicles for humanitarian services.
Despite this considerable number of positive changes - and the ones I have mentioned are just a selection - there are also passages which I and a large proportion of my fellow Members are still not happy with.
That is why several amendments have also been tabled in plenary and I would encourage you to support them.
In particular they concern the permitted driving time of 56 hours per week, which is unquestionably too high, although there is also a limit of not more than 90 hours in two weeks.
We are proposing a maximum weekly driving time of 45 hours, which is still considerably more than the number of hours worked in almost any other branch of employment.
Secondly, I hope, like many of my fellow Members, that the number of exemptions in this regulation will be reduced still further.
I know that this regulation does not fulfil all of the wishes of those affected, but I am convinced that the new legislation will increase road safety, improve the social conditions of those concerned, and that it will enable companies to do their job of providing high-quality transport services.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Markov, for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report.
We are basically concerned here with three issues: health and safety in the working environment, road traffic safety and equal conditions of competition.
In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have mainly confined ourselves to health and safety, but these issues belong together.
Proper driver health and safety whereby, for example, drivers were thoroughly rested when they took the wheel, would promote road safety.
Minimum rules throughout the internal market would also guarantee that there was no distortion of competition.
It is rather odd that there should be proposals to reject this report.
There is considerable agreement between the Council, the Commission and, I hope, also the majority in Parliament that this 18-year-old regulation now needs to be changed, partly as a result of digital tachographs now being used.
The big problem, and one of the reasons why change is required, is, in actual fact, the poor compliance with the existing regulation.
I myself can see that there is poor compliance in my own country.
I wish therefore especially to draw attention to a proposal that is very important in the new regulation, namely that the Member States' supervisory authorities be able to take legal proceedings in cases of rest period infringements, even if the infringement has taken place in the territory of another Member State.
There are a number of aspects of the existing report that we Social Democrats, both in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, would like to see strengthened, for example the minimum rest period per 24 hours and the maximum driving time.
We have therefore tabled Amendments Nos 105 and 106.
We also think that the minimum requirement in terms of the working environment is that a driver must not be compelled to spend his long weekly rest period in the cab.
We have therefore tabled Amendment No 107.
This amendment has unfortunately been wrongly translated in the Swedish version, which is why the English version applies.
Amendment No 110 is about the need not to remunerate drivers according to a pre-arranged distance to be travelled.
Paying drivers on a piecework basis is quite unjustifiable.
In conclusion, Amendment No 113 is aimed at requiring the two sides of industry at European level to carry out regular evaluations of this new regulation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the rapporteur for his work, but also the other Members for the numerous coordination meetings.
With 300 amendments the work was not easy.
The main issue raised in this context was the necessity of a new regulation.
Opinions differed on the priorities to be addressed, and colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be taking the floor on this matter again today.
In principle, however, the PPE-DE Group is in favour of amendment.
The aim was to strike a balance between road safety on the one hand and, on the other, flexibility in a profession where even today there are labour shortages right across Europe, perhaps because the conditions are unfavourable, but also because demand is very high.
This was a challenge for us.
There was unanimity - and I should like to underline this here - on at least two points, the first being on checks.
All Members agree that we can adopt the best directives in the world here, but if there are no effective checks on compliance in the Member States then we will not achieve anything.
Less than 1%, as is the case in certain countries, is not enough.
The 2% minimum that has been suggested here should certainly be respected.
In addition, a report on implementation should be presented to Parliament at regular intervals, so that we, and also the Member States, can react in good time.
It must not be the case, as the French say, that, 'Celui qui triche gagne le plus d'argent', that is that those who do not comply with these directives make the most money.
That is precisely what we want to prevent: unfair competition at the expense of, amongst other things, safety.
Secondly, there was unanimity on the scope, namely that we should include third countries: we want to create a European transport area and anyone who uses this area must play by the same rules.
We know that for various reasons companies move their headquarters to third countries, not only for economic reasons, but for other reasons too.
That is why it is important over time for us to create this European transport area.
We wanted to build in flexibility.
Exemptions have been discussed and obviously I do not want to mention all of them.
We do however continue to attach importance to short-distance drivers and taxi drivers being excluded, although of course we also support exemptions in certain areas, such as for farmers, who do seasonal work, and for breakdown services.
The concept of safety should not mean that the regulation imposes restrictions on the people who are actually responsible for safety.
One area where we are still undecided is courier services.
Some think that they should be in, while others believe that the numerous accidents are not related to rest periods and driving times but are rather a question of speed.
We have also introduced flexibility to the breaks.
We did not just want weekends of between 24 and 45 hours, but also 36 hours.
We also want to take account of those countries that are not in central Europe, because tomorrow, with enlargement, we have to bear in mind that the centre is going to shift and that it is not only going to be rest periods and driving times that will determine whether a haulage business is efficient or not.
We do not call into question the 12-hour nightly rest period either, with the related flexibility of nine plus three hours.
This also applies to the daily rest periods and the short breaks.
We wanted a certain degree of flexibility here, to take account on the one hand of each driver's work rhythm but on the other of the needs inherent in the job.
Safety was the other aspect that needed to be brought into the equation.
Rest periods, daily rest periods and weekend rest periods are issues of safety and it is not unknown for overtired drivers to be involved in accidents.
Nevertheless, we should not exaggerate this either.
Some statistics show the risk to be very high.
Overall we work on the basis of realistic statistics showing that this is the case for around 15% of serious road traffic accidents.
This is not about singling out the roads yet again for wholesale condemnation.
The initiative being taken here by the Commission and Parliament will, I believe, improve safety.
As far as infringements are concerned, as we see it taking vehicles out of service is the best approach.
This is not at odds with the legislation in the various countries and only one thing is required, namely that the vehicle should be taken out of service until the failure is corrected.
In short, I would say that by adopting the stricter rules in this regulation, and by creating new conditions, we can have a positive economic impact on this sector.
This will, however, do nothing to change the fact that in the future road transport will continue to be one of the major players in transport as a whole.
I am referring here to the discussions that we had earlier.
This does not in any way mean that if we want to bring about a modal shift it can only be done by adopting legislation on road transport. Instead this must go hand in hand with clear initiatives in the other transport sectors.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, in the German press preview there was a headline that is very apt for this dossier.
It read: fresh goods need fresh drivers.
It is actually the case that we are usually more concerned with the economy and competition, and that all too often the issue of safety and the life and health of the public is given short shrift.
We recently experienced the Prestige disaster.
When there is an accident at sea or in the air the public in Europe is outraged, but the daily deaths on our roads are something that we have obviously become accustomed to.
We should not become accustomed to them, however, because there are - as the statistics show - two main causes of accidents on our roads.
The first is HGVs with overtired drivers, who are at the wheel for far too long, and the second, increasingly, is the express services, the so-called sprinter class, which represent the greatest potential for danger on our roads and motorways.
That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to include these express services, this sprinter class, in this regulation.
In the committee we arrived at a consensus on a series of sensible rules for driving times and rest periods that are realistic and geared to the needs of both drivers and companies.
I think it is sensible, if at all possible, for drivers to spend their weekly rest periods at home, where they live, with their families.
It is also sensible, if they are nearly at a ferry and can spend their rest time there, for the driving times and rest times to allow them to reach that ferry.
Obviously it is not sensible to spend a rest time in a travelling vehicle, and we have therefore stated this in the text.
As Mr Grosch has already said, we can adopt as many wonderful, detailed, even obsessively detailed, rules as we like, but if they cannot be enforced then they are just words.
For me, in any case, this is also one of the most important points.
At present we have an average inspection rate of barely 1% and it is actually only possible to carry out real inspections, real checks, if both the roadside check on what the vehicle is doing and the check on the undertaking are done in tandem.
However, practice in the Member States of the Community is very variable and it is for this reason, Commissioner, that the transitional period, between our bidding farewell to the traditional tachograph and introducing the digital tachograph, has to be as short as possible, so that we can inspect all of the HGVs in the Community by means of a digital tachograph as soon as possible.
The fact that this allows a period of 28 days to be monitored in a roadside check will make a huge contribution to improving safety on Europe's roads.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Helmut Markov, who has done a good job, was very willing to compromise and united us behind his proposals, and also the other Members who were shadow rapporteurs for this dossier.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Markov, for drawing up this report.
He has done a thorough job and, furthermore, listened to those of us who have a different opinion with regard to this issue.
Road safety is an important matter.
From the point of view of the transport sector it is also essential to improve the social status of drivers and the esteem they are held in.
The Commission proposal, however, was badly drafted.
In the committee debate we were able to improve the proposal, although, in the opinion of our group, the end result is still not acceptable.
The proposal would increase inflexibility and lead to practices that would be difficult to monitor and which would cause the sector to incur additional costs.
Furthermore, natural breaks at work cannot be taken advantage of.
The new regulation will not improve road safety either.
Our group is proposing that we reject the Commission proposal and ask the Commission to carry out a thorough study of the need to change current rest periods, taking digital tachographs into account.
We have also put forward important proposals for improvements in case the rejection proposal is blocked.
The basic idea behind them is that the provisions on rest periods in the current regulation are adequate provided that they are complied with and monitored effectively.
More effective monitoring will lead to better results than if the provisions are merely made more stringent on paper.
Mr President, Mr Markov has produced a sterling piece of work.
His report examines rules that will simplify a very complicated area.
Driving is one of the hardest and most pressurised jobs there is.
The seat behind the wheel in buses and lorries is a back-breaking place of work. The simple new rules proposed by Mr Markov would ease the burden of work.
It is to be applauded that Parliament can play a part in simplifying the rules.
Assaults are one of the major problems encountered by drivers when they take rest breaks on European motorways.
It is more urgent than ever to cooperate on preventing the increasing violence on our motorways.
Finally, I wish to draw attention to increased safety on motorways.
This is relevant not only to professional drivers but to all of us who drive on European roads.
All too often, we have seen accidents caused by tired drivers.
The simple new rules would mean that no one could be in any doubt as to when and for how long drivers were required to take rest breaks.
It would be easier for the police to monitor that the rules were being complied with.
I very much hope that the police would also increase the level of checks they made.
I must also say that I am very surprised that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is giving more consideration to the cost of equipping lorries than to the deaths of 40 000 people each year on European highways.
What the ELDR Group is displaying here is penny-pinching at its worst.
They should be ashamed of themselves.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we adopt the Markov report today then this new legislation will not only interest those directly involved in the transport sector but millions of people in Europe, because this is also about road safety.
Safety in road freight transport concerns everyone who lives in the EU, because - and the statistics are clear about this - overtiredness at the wheel kills!
A study by the European Safety Council shows that more than 50% of drivers admit that they have fallen asleep at the wheel at least once in their driving careers so far.
What then is to be done?
We Greens think that the working times in this sector, the driving times, need to be reduced.
We have tabled an amendment stating that they should be reduced to 80 hours every two weeks with a maximum of 45 to 48 hours in any one week.
What we have at the moment is 56 hours per week.
That is only the driving time.
On top of that there is loading and unloading.
There is no other job in industry that presents such a high risk for which we permit such long working hours.
In addition, systematic inspections need to be introduced.
As Mr Piecyk mentioned, when the regulation on the digital tachograph is implemented, we must exert pressure on all of the national governments to introduce checks on undertakings, the company card.
If you talk to police officers they will tell you that this company card is the only way of effecting systematic checks on undertakings.
Obviously we will have to ensure that this European legislation is respected in the competent overarching bodies, for example in the requirements for CEMT licences.
I have raised this with Mrs Isabelle Durant, who is currently chairing CEMT, so that this issue is put on the agenda of the CEMT ministerial meeting of 21 and 22 April.
Mr President, Commissioner, opinions on this harmonisation proposal differ sharply.
Shippers in particular say that the existing regulation is operating satisfactorily.
Changes would have far-reaching consequences for the sector.
On the other hand, plenty of reports are appearing which show that the provisions of the regulation are being completely disregarded.
On the basis of the first point of view, therefore, no changes are needed, although they are needed on the basis of the second.
I think that both interpretations are in some sense correct.
In the final analysis there is not so much intrinsically wrong with the regulation.
There is, however, something wrong with the way in which Member States interpret and apply the regulation.
Partly as a result of limited and inadequate opportunities for control, contraventions of the regulation are not uncommon, with all the consequences this has for road safety, competitive conditions and the viability of this sector.
In order to improve the situation, I believe that intervention in the existing regulation is inevitable.
Two starting points are crucial here.
Firstly, most of the current provisions can remain intact.
Only a few provisions have proved to be open to multiple interpretations.
A clear definition must be found for these elements.
I therefore support most of the amendments aimed at reinstating the original text.
I also support those amendments that clarify the existing ambiguities, like the separate rest periods.
