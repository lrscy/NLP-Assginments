For example, in the energy field it is perfectly clear what the applicable indicators would be.
However, it can be more difficult in other fields, for example, for Council constellations like ECOFIN or General Affairs.
The ambition is, however, to be as precise as possible in order for it to be possible to inspect not only what the Commission and the presidency are currently achieving, but also what future presidencies achieve.
Question No 7 by (H-0150/01):
Subject: Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit The Council is setting up a Provisional Judicial Cooperation Unit as a first step towards the establishment of the Eurojust unit.
Italy is now considering appointing Giancarlo Caselli, who was the Public Prosecutor for Palermo from January 1993 to June 1999.
However, the Italian Parliament is still trying to obtain more information on at least 368 journeys which Mr Caselli made in connection with meetings unrelated to official business, and on the costs incurred in connection with those journeys.
With a view to ensuring the credibility of the provisional unit currently being set up, would the Council not agree that before approving the appointments of liaison magistrates made by the Member States it should check the appointees' credentials, integrity and professional ethics?
Would it not agree that it will be useful to obtain from the national governments all the information required for a proper assessment to be made of the national appointments (including any parliamentary initiatives taken in this connection), and to consult the European Parliament on a non-binding basis?
I can answer that very concisely: this is entirely a matter for the Member States, which have the right to appoint national members themselves within the framework of the Council Decision of 14 December 2000.
Mr President, the Council' s reply seems to me to be somewhat cavalier.
This is a body of the Council; it is a body which was created within the Council.
Of course, like more and more things, this could be completely out of the control of Parliament, completely intergovernmental.
But it seems to me, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that not everybody shares this view, at least in this Parliament.
The European Parliament would at least like to have a power of consultation in this matter and to know what criteria the Council, and not just the Member States, adopts.
As it is a body of the European Union, these criteria are common to all Member States.
What are the criteria for the morality of candidates who will have to occupy this post?
I feel that this is not a question simply for the Member States; it is not a question for Sweden or another country; it is a question which concerns everybody and I would be very happy to have a reply from the Council.
Opinions may differ on whether or not it would be desirable to have common criteria.
However, it just so happens that even with regard to advisory bodies, the appointment of representatives is entirely a matter for the Member States.
It would therefore be a violation of current provisions to try in some way to prevent the Member States from appointing national members themselves.
The acquisition or loss of citizenship in a Member State is the responsibility of the Member States themselves.
Even though there are directives containing certain rules on the content and period of validity of identity cards and passports, these directives clearly state that it is the Member States which issue identity cards and passports to their citizens in accordance with national law.
It is up to each Member State to take the measures it considers appropriate with regard to confiscating these identity cards and passports if it is established later that the holder of the passport or identity card is not entitled to be treated as a citizen of that State.
I can also inform you that the Council has not requested information concerning the naturalisation process in Greece and that neither has the Council the authorisation to adopt a position regarding possible approximation of legislation regarding the acquisition of nationality in the EU Member States.
As has just been explained, this issue falls under the jurisdiction of national governments.
I should like to draw your attention to the reply given to Parliament last month by the Commission, which said that failing to state the nationality on Greek identity cards might be contrary to Community law and constitute an obstacle to the free movement of Greek nationals on the territory of the Member States, because it violated five directives.
I agree with you that, yes, the Member States are responsible, but there are certain rules.
What do you think?
Was the Commission' s reply wrong?
Can nationality be removed from all Greek identity cards and, in more general terms, can the residents of the European Union have identify cards which say nothing, not even European Union, nothing, no nationality whatsoever?
How will they travel and how will they prove that they belong to a Member State?
Perhaps you can advise me.
I have no reason to in any way review the reply the Commission might have given earlier regarding this matter.
As President-in-Office of the Council, I can only repeat what I said a moment ago to the honourable Member, namely that this is essentially a matter for the Member States.
Question No 10 by (H-0159/01):
Subject: US military presence in Europe Sweden's defence minister, BjÃ¶rn von Sydow, has said on several occasions recently that the security balance in Europe depends on a continued US military presence.
Does the Council agree with him and does it consider that the US National Missile Defense (NMD) programme is good for the security balance in Europe?
The Council's position with regard to the United States is expressed in general terms, for example, in the statement made in Bonn on 21 June 1999.
The Union and the United States stated at that time that, together, they could promote their common values, their common security and their common welfare in a more effective way than either of them could on their own.
This statement also notes that these two entities together constitute a powerful force when it comes to accepting the challenges they are faced with, for example, instability in regions that are important to them both and new transnational threats to their common security.
It was also pointed out that the new transatlantic agenda signed in Madrid in December 1995 has strengthened the opportunities for these entities to manage their tasks in Europe on a more structured basis on both sides of the Atlantic and elsewhere.
With regard to a European security and defence policy, it was noted more specifically in the presidency's report to the European Council in Nice that NATO, with regard to its Member States, remains the basis for the common defence of its members and will continue to play an important part in crisis management.
It was also pointed out that the development of the common European security and defence policy will contribute to the vitality of the renewed transatlantic connection.
As regards the second part of the honourable Member's question, several Member States have, as you know, expressed their national opinions regarding the USA's plans for a national missile defence programme.
A number of Member States have stressed how important it is to maintain global stability and contribute to disarmament and non-proliferation by means of an agreed framework for security.
They have also stressed that, in this matter, there is a need for complete and open consultation between the United States and its partner.
America has, in its most recent statements, confirmed its commitment in this respect.
At the conference last year on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the European Union maintained the importance of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, also known as the ABM Treaty, as one of the pillars of strategic stability.
The European Union also emphasised that it wants to keep this treaty.
Mr President, I did not fully understand the answer to the question about the Council' s view of the NMD programme.
I understood that there is now a project aimed at eventually developing a common European missile defence system in cooperation with the United States.
Has the Council no position at all on this?
As far as I understand, the Council is responsible for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, so it is presumably the Council that has to come up with a position on this matter.
And that is something I am still looking for.
As the honourable Member is surely aware, there are a number of contentious issues within the common foreign and security policy.
One of these issues is precisely this question of National Missile Defence.
This is why I called attention to the fact that a number of Member States have made comments regarding this issue, but there is nevertheless no common position on the part of the Union.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 46 will be replied to in writing.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Regulation of European securities markets (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the following oral questions:
B5-0016/01 by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Council, on the final report of the Committee of Wise Men on the regulation of the European securities markets;
B5-0017/01 by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Commission, on the final report of the Committee of Wise Men on the regulation of the European securities markets.
Mr President, I very much welcome the Lamfalussy report and the opportunity to comment on it, but I would like to start by putting on record my personal thanks to Mr Bolkestein for coming along at this late hour despite the interruption.
I know it is appreciated by all my colleagues.
We are all aware of the benefits of the single market in financial services but I will re-state them because they are so important: cheaper products for consumers, better returns for savers and easier and cheaper finance for business.
Sadly, this remains an aspiration rather than a reality.
One of the main reasons we are failing to achieve such a single market is poor implementation and inconsistent interpretation.
Both of these will be helped by Mr Lamfalussy's proposals, which are sensible and pragmatic.
We need further assurances and guarantees on transparency and market consultation and on democratic oversight, but I hope we and the other two European Union institutions can find a way to make these proposals work.
This is an important political opportunity which should not be wasted and I am glad to hear that the Commission is taking a pragmatic view on its right of initiative.
As Mr Bolkestein stated in his introduction, he does not have concerns about the role of the regulators' committee.
We need to see that kind of flexibility from the Council as well and if it is true that the Council is trying to roll back the European Parliament's limited role in the comitology process under present rules, that is unhelpful and regrettable.
All three institutions will need to show goodwill and make sacrifices and compromises if this arrangement is to work, but it is a prize well worth fighting for because the single market in securities will yield many benefits for the people we are elected to represent.
Mr President, I would like to add my voice to the comments of Mrs Villiers regarding the presence of Commissioner Bolkestein and I believe it is fortunate that, in a debate as brief as this one, we have the Commissioner present so that he can reply to us almost immediately.
I am not speaking as a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs but as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and I would like to express my agreement with the comments by Mr Cox, Mr Goebbels and Mr Herzog.
In short, we have a legislative problem.
We all agree that Community legislation is very complicated, very ornate and very complex, but the reason why Community legislation is so complicated and ornate is the intergovernmental procedure which is used to adopt regulations and the lack of a genuine Community legislative body which has the capacity to adopt clear regulations.
Therefore, while we agree basically with Mr Lamfalussy and the committee of experts, and with the need for clear and rapid Community legislation, we cannot agree with the solution they propose because that would mean more committees and more of the famous comitology procedure.
In this respect I must remind you of a famous saying that 'a camel is a horse drawn by a committee' , with many humps, and Community legislation is camel-like.
The comitology procedure currently proposed by the Lamfalussy report would create many more camels and would not create satisfactory legislation.
This type of proposal and the continued insistence on comitology is not therefore the solution.
The solution lies in creating a clear legislative procedure which allows Parliament to effectively exercise its powers.
Otherwise we would simply be allowing the governments to continue playing amongst themselves and drawing Community legislative camels.
Mr President, Commissioner, it must be rather dull to listen to these speeches here at this time of the evening, particularly when we are so unanimously agreed in matters. There is certainly a lot that is being repeated in these speeches.
I, too, think that the Committee of Wise Men, chaired by Baron Lamfalussy, has done an exceptionally thorough job.
The committee' s proposals form a coherent whole and also contain some practical and concrete measures to bring the system into effect.
It is generally rare in politics to make such clear proposals and I thank this committee for them.
We members of the European Parliament agree fully with the view that it is necessary to make regulation of the securities markets more efficient and faster.
This is a requirement that we should propose if we want to achieve a genuinely viable European internal market for financial services within the next few years.
We can never achieve the ambitious aims of Lisbon if the reform of one directive on the financial markets is to take ten years, as has tended to be the case with the present system, if we take the UCITS directive as an example.
Parliament alone cannot be blamed for the present system' s shortcomings, however.
Parliament has taken its role as the EU' s second legislative body seriously and responsibly.
During this parliamentary term in particular we have shown that there is no conflict between safeguarding Parliament' s powers of influence and adequate democratic control, on the one hand, and the call for greater speed and efficiency, on the other.
Parliament' s principal task is to determine what the core political questions are, and not beat around the bush.
For that reason, delegating the responsibility of technical legislation to the committee to be set up is basically not a problem for us.
The bosses do not do the work of the secretaries, and vice versa.
In the codecision procedure Parliament and the Council are the bosses and all the others the secretaries.
This, however, does not weaken the demand Parliament is making in plain terms in the form of the 'callback' mechanism.
Parliament must have the legally binding right to refer a matter back for further consideration if things are moving in the wrong direction.
Parliament is not the only institution that wants to ensure it is safeguarded in this way; the Council has also expressed a similar need to safeguard its own position with the help of the 'aerosol clause' .
This sort of system, which would take the concerns of both Parliament and the Council into account, must also be created on the basis of the Lamfalussy report.
To begin with I should like to answer some of the points that were raised this afternoon.
First of all, Mr von Wogau said that he welcomes the use of regulations and also the fast-track procedure.
I would agree with him in his sentiment.
Certainly regulations and a fast-track procedure would help to speed up legislation.
Mr von Wogau said that perhaps as a pilot project a pension fund could be used to show how quickly these procedures could be used.
Certainly, the Commission would like to see the pension fund directive become a reality as soon as possible.
However, certain articles in the Treaty concerning the internal market mention directives and not regulations.
Naturally we have to stay within the confines of the Treaty, so where the Treaty says "directives" we cannot use regulations.
But I agree with Parliament that regulations are usually - although not always - faster than directives.
Mr Goebbels asked if the new procedures would speed up legislation.
As I have explained, they would.
Also the comitology procedure provides for short deadlines and therefore it would also speed up the whole process.
Mr Goebbels then asked whether the Securities Committee would consist of Secretaries of State.
I am afraid I cannot answer that question.
The Securities Committee has delegates coming from various Member States and it is up to the Member States to decide who represents them on that committee.
So I cannot comment on that.
As I said, Member States will nominate their own representatives.
What is important is that these representatives should show a real European spirit, are prepared to work closely together and are technically competent.
I now come to the matter of transparency, which has been raised by a number of Members of Parliament.
I agree with all those who have emphasised the importance of transparency throughout the legislative process and indeed the report by Mr Lamfalussy and his colleagues makes various references to the need for transparency.
The Commission wholeheartedly endorses that.
Mr Herzog said this is a cumbersome intergovernmental procedure instead of a single European regulator.
The procedures set out in this report are not intergovernmental.
For example, the Securities Committee - which is an important committee in this respect - will not be a Council working group.
It will be a regulatory committee in the sense of the 1999 comitology decision; it will be chaired by the Commission.
So it is not an intergovernmental committee.
The decision of the Lamfalussy committee not to propose a single European regulator at this stage is the result of a full and thorough consultation process.
As the report states, it may be necessary to look at the possibility of a single regulator when the whole procedure is reviewed in 2004 if the process that is currently proposed is not satisfactory, but not before.
Let me now answer a few points that were raised this evening.
I am grateful to Mrs Villiers and Mr Medina Ortega for their kind words, although to me it is only natural that I should be present here when a subject falling within my portfolio is discussed.
Mr Medina Ortega said that the European Union's legislation is complex, which is true.
Normally there is a government and a parliament.
We have a triangular relationship, the Commission, Parliament and the Council. That makes it more difficult.
The fact that there are 15 Member States further complicates the procedure.
He said that the whole system for dealing with executive measures under the comitology procedure is like the horse designed by a committee which turns out to be a camel.
Indeed there was a committee, the Lamfalussy committee.
But the whole idea of a comitology procedure is to get the implementing measures through more speedily.
That is a purpose I share.
I must say, however, that the matter of secondary legislation is a very important one.
In many Member States - in Germany and the Netherlands for example - there is a definite procedure for dealing with secondary legislation, which the European Union lacks.
There is no provision in the Treaty for dealing with secondary legislation in this way.
Parliament, the Council and the Commission would be well advised to think about the need for a proper system of dealing with secondary legislation.
Since this whole process will be reviewed in 2004 let us hope that at the same time we can look into the matter of secondary legislation.
Then if we manage to work out a clear plan it can be taken up in the Intergovernmental Conference which will hopefully start in 2004.
The Commission is grateful for the support Mrs Kauppi has given to the report of the Lamfalussy committee.
There is no difference of opinion.
She want speedier legislation.
She is right.
The Commission wants it, Mrs Randzio-Plath wants it, everybody wants it.
She gave the example of USITs, which it look a long time to agree upon.
Fortunately, agreement has now been reached but I would agree with Mrs Kauppi that it has taken a very long time.
Central to this whole discussion is the possibility of having a callback mechanism as Parliament has requested.
I do not have to explain what it is; everybody knows.
The Commission firmly believes that we ought to find a solution within the Treaty - which means Articles 202 and 211 - and that we should stay within the confines of the comitology decision of June 1999.
Therefore we cannot see our way to granting Parliament a callback possibility.
Having said that, I would ask Parliament to remember what is on the table.
Firstly, the Commission will take full account of a resolution approved by Parliament.
Secondly, as Mr Cox said this afternoon, it is Parliament - and the Council - that decide on the scope of levels in implementing measures.
If the directive contains broad principles and executive measures and Parliament does not agree that a certain executive measure should be called that and relegated to level 2, then Parliament should say so and amend the directive to say that a particular implementing measure should be elevated to the status of a general principle and therefore be dealt with under level 1.
So it is in Parliament's own hands to decide on the distinction between general principles and executive measures.
That is the second point.
Thirdly, if Parliament thought the Commission was abusing the system, what do you think would happen the next time the Commission made a proposal concerning a certain directive?
Parliament would surely then be in a position to say "Look, you fooled us the last time, now we are going to be extremely strict with you".
So Parliament can be certain that the next time it is dealing with a directive under this whole plan it can tighten the screws.
The Commission knows that.
So why should the Commission frustrate the wishes of Parliament by doing something that is not really proper?
That is the third point.
Fourthly, in the year 2004 there will be a review of the whole process and this - my fifth point - will be steered by the Monitoring Committee, an interinstitutional committee on which Parliament will be represented.
The Monitoring Committee will not keep silent if it thinks that the procedures are being abused and the Commission is allowing itself too much latitude.
My sixth point is Parliament can pass a resolution saying that the Commission is ultra vires, that it is going beyond what is consistent with the law.
Again, the Commission would take full account of that opinion and reconsider the whole proposal.
These six measures should allay the fear, which I understand but which is not justified, that the Commission would disregard Parliament's opinion.
The Commission cannot and will not do so.
Therefore, I do not think there are any grounds for wanting a callback possibility.
I can find no provision for it in the Treaty or in the 1999 comitology procedure.
Lastly, two Members of Parliament have mentioned something they think has happened in the Council, namely that the Council wants to have a stronger position for itself than is consistent with a balanced relationship between the three institutions.
I cannot speak for the Council.
The Council proceedings are not open and therefore it is very difficult to comment.
But if there should be any attempt to lower the bar of a qualified majority vote to a simple majority vote, that would meet with the strongest objections from the Commission.
After all, a single majority vote is almost never mentioned in the Treaty.
We know what unanimous votes are and we know what qualified majority votes are.
Simple majority votes are perhaps used for procedural matters, but not for anything of substance.
So the Commission will firmly oppose any moves towards lowering the decision-making system from a qualified majority vote to a simple majority vote.
As I said, I cannot speak for the Council and it is only with great reluctance that I am commenting on something that may or may not be true.
Mr President, Commissioner, you have referred to numerous possibilities and impossibilities.
As rapporteur and committee chair, I should like to revert to the question which you did not answer and which is of crucial importance to our committee. I refer to the callback right.
No one wants to change the Treaty just now.
The point is, can we find a solution within the framework of the 1999 comitology decision?
Why not supplement Article 6 and give Parliament a guarantee which secures its callback right, Commissioner, if the Commission or the other institutions do not act as the European Parliament would wish?
I think that this would show willing on the part of the institutions and would prove that we live in a European democracy.
Mr President, may I express the gratitude of the Commission for Mrs Randzio-Plath's remarks.
I reiterate that the Commission is basing itself on two particular articles in the Treaty and on the comitology decision.
When I look not so much at Article 6 but at Article 5 and Article 8 of the comitology decision, I am sorry, but I see no room for a callback procedure.
Mrs Randzio-Plath referred this afternoon to a callback procedure or equivalent measure, or words to that effect.
The Commission is here to try to find a balance and if Mrs Randzio-Plath is willing to come forward with a new suggestion, the Commission will, of course, listen to it but once again it must be within the framework of the comitology decision.
If Mrs Randzio-Plath or any other Member of this Parliament then says it is time we changed the comitology decision, I am out of my depth.
It is not within my remit tonight to pronounce on the possibility of changing the comitology decision, although if we are considering the question of secondary legislation, we might also consider comitology.
However that is a big step and I do not think I can make any comment on changes to this delicate and complicated interinstitutional balance tonight.
Once again, if Mrs Randzio-Plath wants to put forward a new proposal which we might not have considered, we will certainly look at it and try to be positive in our reply, always provided that it is within the confines of the comitology decision,
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
European economy
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0082/2001) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the state of the European economy, report preparatory to the Commission recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines [2001/2008(INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mention has already been made of the fact that the rapporteur, Karl von Wogau, is unable to be here.
He himself explained why during his intervention on the Lamfalussy report.
Because the order of business was changed at such short notice, he was unable to change his appointments so that he could be here in person.
I should like to point out that the Lamfalussy report and this economic report were originally scheduled for the beginning of the day and that the rapporteur arranged this evening' s discussion with voters in his constituency some time ago.
May I apologise on his behalf once again.
I shall endeavour to do my best under the circumstances.
There are a number of points which I wish to address. First, this is the last year before euro notes and coins are introduced.
The internal market of the European Union will then become a real European home market, at least for the members of the euro zone.
Twelve Member States will belong to this European home market, in which individuals and companies will all share a common currency.
It is therefore right and proper that we should carry out a careful analysis of the European economy in this context.
This has now already begun: the forecasts for the current year and the analysis of the status quo are basically optimistic, although they do of course contain a number of risk factors, which I shall come to in a moment.
One positive factor which deserves a mention in any critique or proposed improvement is the relatively high rate of growth in our Gross Domestic Product.
Another positive factor is that the rate of unemployment is falling and we have created 2.5 million new jobs in the European Union over recent years.
Yet another positive factor is the improvement in public finances - and the concomitant reduction in the rate of inflation - and long-term price stability.
So much for the pros.
However, there are two factors which need to be mentioned which could give cause for concern: the first is the present economic climate in the United States.
Growth in the United States is slowing down and, given the impact of strong growth in the USA on European trade, this may undermine the EU economy although, on the positive side, we are becoming increasingly immune to economic developments in America and this represents a positive balance and positive justification for our measures.
The second factor is the slowdown in the European economy.
According to forecasts, the average rate of growth will be 2.8%.
I should therefore like to state quite unequivocally that we need to call on the Member States again today to do more to translate the will to engage in reform into practice and to implement sustainable structural measures.
We must be critical of the fact that consolidation efforts have come to a standstill in numerous countries.
I would just point out that we should be even more critical of consolidation efforts in that the majority of countries have still not met their self-imposed targets in the stability and growth package despite the boom in the economy.
The second area which we need to touch on is the fact that we must congratulate the ECB because its "steady hand" policy has proven to be the right policy.
The ECB should continue on this stability-oriented course and should also implement its own European stability-oriented policy.
We also have a few demands.
The rate of inflation must be kept below 2% in the second half of the year. The telecommunications, mail, energy and railway sectors must be liberalised quickly and in a balanced manner.
We need to step up efforts in education and training.
We need a more flexible labour market and we need structural reforms of the markets for goods, services, capital and labour to be speeded up.
Mr President, allow me to close by saying that the main request in Karl von Wogau' s report is contained in the reference to the common principles which derive from our social market economy principles, i.e. freedom and democracy, competition, price stability and sustainable growth, subsidiarity, solidarity and private property and the responsibility not only of the employer towards the employee but of both towards the future, and hence for ensuring that the social market economy evolves into an eco-social market economy.
Mr President, just under nine months to go and we shall witness the birth of what is expected to be a sturdy euro, a euro that will see the light of the world of real payment transactions.
Our citizens will finally hold it in their hands.
It has all the right talents: the economic clout of 12 of the 15 Member States of the EU, low rates of inflation, falling national debts and historically low interest rates.
It will be well protected by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main - which knows all there is to know about stability, and really has done what Othmar Karas said, i.e. operated a "steady-hand" policy, which is now paying off.
Anyone who has managed to withstand the pessimism, the years of being underrated like the euro has, is worth investing in.
The situation in the euro zone, with over 2.5 million new jobs in three years is good, although caution is needed in the face of the slowdown in the United States.
Growth and investment forecasts are being revised downwards everywhere.
There is the threat of weakening exports and increasing problems in funding social security systems.
The euphoria over the new economy has fallen into the abyss along with the fall in share prices.
Today it would appear that the old economy is not so old after all.
We must take strategic precautions: economic policy, monetary policy and social policy must be coordinated.
We must improve the framework conditions for innovative start ups.
We must make it easier to invest in information and communications technologies.
Now more than ever, the Member States need to get on and reform their education and training plans, which should be geared to the challenges of these new technologies and the increasing need for mobility.
Higher qualifications improve employability, especially in the knowledge society which we keep on talking about.
We also need to secure permanent and effective social protection, and this can only be done if those in political power put funding right at the top of their agenda.
The social partners' agenda needs to include maintaining jobs for older people, creating more jobs and giving employees a share in company profits.
The social market economy, which Karl von Wogau frequently refers to, is reflected in his excellent report.
We in the PPE-DE Group agreed with him unanimously.
It includes liberalisation and solidarity, competition and equal opportunities and environmentally-friendly growth.
The social market economy is more than just an economic model.
This social model will be the basis for the new European home market which Karl von Wogau has been forecasting, and that does have a future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat surprised to hear that the euro will be born in nine months.
I rather thought that the euro had already been born and thank goodness it has, because just imagine what would have happened between the European economies if the European currencies were still competing with each other now that the American economy has gone into decline.
But that is by the by.
As the rapporteur said, the year 2000 was a good year for the European economy, from the point of view of the rate of growth, from the point of view of price stability and from the point of view of employment.
Of course, nothing is perfect in this imperfect world and, as the rapporteur points out, the rate of inflation is set to exceed 2%, the stability criteria set by the European Bank, for the second year running, but not to a sufficiently serious extent to give us particular cause for concern.
From our point of view, we would have considered it more worthwhile to stress that, although certain progress has been and is still being made, unemployment is still at 8%, which is unacceptably high in a social market economy, the principles of which the rapporteur feels - and I agree with him - should guide our policy.
In this respect, I am surprised that, in listing the features of a social market economy, the rapporteur does not include full employment in his list, despite the fact that he comes from a country in which cooperation between companies and employees is, I think, the most advanced or one of the most advanced in Europe and does the German economy and German society proud.
As far as we are concerned, full employment should be the be all and end all of a modern economy.
Not, as you might assume, for ideological reasons, although of course ideological reasons are not easily dismissed, but for reasons of competitiveness.
An economy does not become competitive merely by achieving low costs or by having leading edge technology.
Competitiveness is judged by whether it makes full use of its wealth-creating resources in comparison with other economies.
Unless it does, it will not manage to become competitive, which is precisely why full employment - and not just full employment but increasing the ratio between the adult population and the work force by 60% for women and 70% for men - is not just a social, it is primarily an economic demand, and why it is at the epicentre of the policy which was announced by the Council summit in Lisbon and which will be reiterated, I hope, at the coming Council summit in Stockholm.
We should take every opportunity to remind ourselves and the citizens of Europe that our Union has engaged in a huge economic venture in order to gain its rightful place at the economic vanguard of the world.
This venture is based on the triad of a knowledge economy, full employment and renovation of the social state.
These three factors form a unit, each feeds the other and they express the exact link between social solidarity and economic competitiveness.
Just as there is no such thing as efficient solidarity without competitiveness, competitiveness will collapse if it is not built on social solidarity.
Our rapporteur insists on the technological aspects of economic superiority.
We believe that equal weight must be given to social aspects such as equal opportunities, a fair distribution of income and closing the gap between the rich and the poor.
And if we too had made an effort to impose self-control on the markets at worldwide level, at least to the extent to which we are able to exert an influence, we would perhaps not now have reached a point at which we are threatened by the imminent economic crisis in the United States.
I do not know what happened to close Wall Street. At lunchtime it was still in free fall and it is threatening to drag us down into a slump with it.
We must protect ourselves from the extremes of a non-social economy.
If we want a social economy, we must give it real meaning, based on solidarity and the fight against speculation; words alone will get us nowhere.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Liberal Group and on my own behalf, and offer our support for his report on an issue which, although it is very important - the broad economic policy guidelines - is nevertheless a substitute for what we would like to see.
We have always argued that, in the Europe of the euro, there should be a genuine and well-defined leadership for economic and monetary policy.
It is well known that, at the moment, it is produced by means of negotiations between ECOFIN and the Commission, with the intervention of Parliament.
The broad guidelines are clearly a fundamental element, but - I repeat - it is still in our view a substitute for what should be a genuine economic and monetary policy at European Union level with the opportunity to act in a more direct manner.
Of the different aspects dealt with in Mr von Wogau' s report, I would like to highlight three, which, from our liberal perspective, are particularly important.
The first is to push ahead with the process of liberalisation in sectors such as telecommunications, postal services, railways, etc., sectors which still hinder the possibility of achieving higher levels of competitiveness and a single market which functions better.
This process would also, as Mr Bolkestein correctly pointed out, lead to better functioning of the single market and the disappearance of barriers within it.
This better functioning - as Parliament approved in my report on structural reforms and liberalisation - would in particular guarantee a profound reform of the labour markets, an essential element, firstly, in better adapting to the economic and social needs of European society and, secondly, in achieving what we need, that is, higher levels of productivity in order to be competitive on an international level.
Mr President, it is true that the European economy appears to have grown quite solidly over recent years.
The main reason is the boost in exports to the US dollar area as a result of the current economic climate there and the weak euro.
So the basic principle reads: a weak euro is good for an export-oriented economy and hence good for Europe.
It is true that, at over 2%, the rate of inflation in Europe does not meet the stability criteria for the introduction of the euro, mainly as a result of higher oil prices, which are traded in dollars.
So then the basic principle reads: a weak euro is bad for the European economy.
This illustrates the absurdity of reducing economic policy measures to fiscal policy.
It is true that the number of unemployed has fallen over recent years.
But it is also true that unemployment in Objective 1 regions has not fallen, because they do not tend to have an export-oriented economy.
So we have no convergence, just continuing divergence, i.e. a deepening social divide.
It is true that investments have increased over recent years.
But it is also true that most were rationalisation and non-expansion investments and that public investment in infrastructure has fallen.
What has all this to do with a forward-looking economic policy?
The report does not contain a single proposal on strengthening domestic demand, on the specific issue of small and medium-sized enterprises, on strengthening regional economic cycles, on European tax harmonisation, on implementing the Lisbon employment summit, mentioning instead simply liberalisation, privatisation, falling social standards and the abolition of public-funded health and pension funds.
The von Wogau report must be rejected.
Mr President, the European economy is still doing well.
But we must admit that we did in fact expect more.
Less pleasing is the fact that the inflation rate has again crossed the 2% threshold and investments have fallen from 5.3% to 4.9% of Gross Domestic Product.
We must therefore continue to ensure that priority European objectives - promoting small and medium-sized businesses, cutting red tape, reducing overly high tax rates - are implemented consistently.
But we must also back and reform our education systems so that the lack of expertise threatening us does not in fact become a reality.
Finally, the only economic development which can be described as a success is one which manages to reduce the excessively high unemployment rate in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission' s report on the state of the Union economy in 2000 and, in part, the von Wogau report itself, do not fail to underline how the halting progress of the euro has been, even in the perception of the financial markets, attributable at least in part to the absence of sufficiently coordinated action by the eurozone governments to promote a policy of economic growth and development in the field of employment.
Nor can the Central Bank take all the blame for not including the stimulus of growth and the pursuit of full employment amongst its priorities in setting interest rates, in addition to the containment of inflation.
It is now becoming clear how urgent it is to bring into being a genuine form of closer cooperation between the twelve countries of the eurozone, so as to make a qualitative leap in the coordination of financial, economic and social policies, and overcome - as was called for at the Lisbon Summit - a rigidly sectoral approach which, ultimately, confines social policies to a role of mere assistance.
That might also be the way to establish a coordinated presence of the monetary Union as such in institutional decision-making forums like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank and, in addition, the relations of the eurozone with third countries, in particular with the producer countries of raw materials and energy sources.
For example, a long-term agreement with oil producers with a controlled price in euro would be not only possible but desirable.
Mr President, we are not having a very lively debate.
Why?
The impression we are giving is that the European Union is very passive.
There are the movements of the global market, there is the policy of the United States, and we are looking on.
With regard to these events we are far from having an economic policy. We do not have a doctrine of public economy in Europe and we are therefore a bit closeted here, I would say, in the Ministry of Words.
Allow me to make three observations.
Firstly, the analysis of economic conditions presented by the Central Bank and by the Commission could, in fact, be summed up more or less by a slowdown in the global space, even though, for us, the growth indicators are good for the next few months, that is for the coming 18 months, and do not encourage us to budge.
We are lamentably lacking initiatives to consolidate the potential and perhaps real growth of the European Union.
For my part, I would lay great stress on the need for public and private investments and on the accumulated delays in the matter of research and training.
Instead of that, the report unfortunately takes up the anti-inflationist obsession we also find in the discourse of the Central Bank, and the failure of the Galileo project would be disastrous.
Secondly, we have said that the social policy was necessary to consolidate growth.
In the words of Emilio Gabaglio, the impression is that we are witnessing a sort of derailment between Lisbon and Stockholm.
We should give concrete expression to our desire to develop knowledge and skills in the European Union in the form of a spectacular initiative.
Thirdly, we talk about an acceleration of balanced liberalisation.
The debate between competition and service of general interest has only just started.
I am convinced that the internal market will not come to fruition unless we impose obligations to provide services of general interest at the Community level.
Here too, we lack initiatives.
I hope that the next few months will prove me wrong.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr von Wogau for his report, Mr Karas for his presentation and all of you for your speeches.
This year, for the first time, the procedures for debating the broad economic policy guidelines have been modified as a result of the Lisbon procedure and you have had the opportunity to introduce a Parliamentary position on this debate which should, in principle, help us to define that economic policy which you - Mr Trentin, amongst others - have referred to and to which we are not attaching sufficient importance.
We in the Commission agree with the fundamental principles contained in the report, both paragraph one and paragraph two, relating to the social market economy and an economy based on a democratic model, price stability, sustainable growth, subsidiarity, solidarity etc., which are objectives we share fully.
I also agree with the point some of you have made in relation to the importance of this moment in time, since we are now less than 300 days away from the introduction of the euro.
However, as always, I must repeat that we often confuse the introduction of notes and coins on 1 January next year with the introduction of the euro which took place on 1 January 1999, and which has already brought us clear benefits and positive results, as some of you have pointed out.
Amongst these positive results is the healthy economic situation the European Union currently enjoys.
We must not rest on our laurels, because this healthy economic situation nevertheless masks certain deficiencies, certain problems caused by external factors, a certain lack of ambition in considering budgets and, above all, there are certain risks caused, in particular, by the development of economies such as the US economy.
In relation to this specific point, however, I would like to insist that the euro is also protecting us from the process of slowdown, which is affecting economies outside the European Union.
The Commission' s position, which is still relatively optimistic in relation to the process of growth in Europe during 2001, is based on the fact that currently we in Europe still clearly have an historic level of confidence in consumers and producers, employment is still clearly improving and inflation has reached its ceiling. In this context, we believe that the obligation of those responsible for economic policy is, above all, to maintain short-term economic expansion.
Therefore, according to our view of the issue, we insist that we need to continue to maintain a budgetary policy aimed at balancing public finances. We also believe that wage policy must be compatible with non-inflationist growth and the creation of employment and that monetary policy must remain committed to price stability.
There is no doubt that monetary policy would benefit from a coherent tax policy and greater liberalisation of the markets.
Some of you have also raised the concern that employment is the fundamental issue.
This is patently a key point.
We therefore also insist - as we have done in our presentations of reports for Stockholm - on the increase in the Union' s growth potential.
In our report on the 2000 review of the Union' s economy, the Commission studied the impact of expenditure and production in information and communication technologies and the advantages they could provide in relation to the possible increase in our growth potential.
Clearly, the structural reforms to which Mr GasÃ²liba referred are a fundamental point, but we must also focus on other shortcomings.
Firstly, in Lisbon we focussed on the knowledge economy as a key and fundamental element.
If we wish to make progress in this respect we must also create the right conditions for private-sector investment in research and development and in the new technologies.
We also have to improve research and, at the same time, increase professional training for the new technologies.
Structural reforms are regularly mentioned.
There is no doubt that we have made progress and that is clear from the report on the implementation of this year' s broad economic policy guidelines, but we must not view this progress as completely satisfactory.
The Commission still insists on the need to continue making progress on these issues and, as you know, the Commission just yesterday presented new proposals to move ahead on the liberalisation of the energy market.
We are aware that we have to seek a balance between liberalisation and regulation in order to achieve the best possible economic results from this process.
We also agree that we have to make progress on the whole issue of creating more efficient and more integrated financial markets.
You have just held a debate with Mr Bolkestein on the need to implement the procedures originating from the so-called Lamfalussy committee.
There is no doubt that this is a step towards speeding up the processes of liberalising the financial services, but we believe that this is not sufficient and we also have to continue to make progress in relation to risk capital and the improvement of risk capital in Europe.
The labour market must be another of our main concerns if we wish to make progress on employment.
A better combination of fiscal reforms and supply systems will certainly have a positive influence on the behaviour of the working population, as it must also help to create a better balance between wages and productivity on a local level, improve employment in certain areas and will also have a positive influence on certain factors such as the mobility of labour or better work organisation.
Another concern, which we do not believe is sufficiently highlighted in this report, concerns the problems of the long-term sustainability of public finances.
The problems relating to the ageing of the population are going to be one of the key issues and in order to deal with them we are clearly going to have to take measures on public debt and measures for improving the labour market, by achieving a greater level of activity, a greater level of employment, in particular of women and older workers, which can also help to counter some of these effects, as will reforms of the current social security systems which are coherent with employment and sustainability of the model.
I would like to thank all of you for your speeches, your comments and your positive contributions to the report, which we will take into account when it comes to drawing up our proposed broad economic policy guidelines for next year.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Swaps arrangements and forward rate agreements
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0071/2001) by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 on the reclassification of settlements under swaps arrangements and under forward rate agreements [COM(1999) 749 - C5-0018/2000 - 2000/0019(COD)].
Mr President, as you can see, this is not exactly a hotly debated issue in Parliament today.
When I was given this report in January 2000 I thought it might be quite easy. Unfortunately it was not.
As soon as we started the discussion in Parliament we heard from the Commission and Council representatives that there might still be some problems in the Council concerning this mainly technical initiative.
After listening to the Council's worries I decided to table some amendments to the Commission proposal in order to reach a wide consensus at first reading.
I hope these amendments are supported tomorrow by the other political groups.
This proposed regulation deals with the reclassification of settlements under swaps arrangements and under forward rate agreements.
It enables reliable comparison of government deficits within the framework of excessive deficit procedure.
It is of great importance that information on the Member States' accounts is comparable.
Comparison of this information is one of the prerequisites for economic coordination in the Union.
The differing statistics on unemployment are one of the best-known examples.
Different ways of compiling, calculating and documenting data on real unemployment renders comparisons between Member States difficult.
It also renders cooperation difficult.
The possibility of reliable comparison of statistical information on the accounts also increases the transparency of our public administrations.
Transparency is all we demand in Parliament.
We have a saying in Finland which describes three different levels of lying. The different levels are: lies, big lies and statistics.
I hope that we in the European Parliament can prevent this from applying to statistical information within the Union.
The Commission proposal initially gave rise to concerns in the Council working group.
The majority of the delegations expressed reservations about the proposed reclassification as it could lead to changes in the level of government deficit within the framework of the excessive deficit procedure. The proposed change would result in the effects of swaps and forward rate agreements issued by the national debt managers being excluded from the calculation of net borrowing or net lending by the public sector.
I essentially agree with the Commission proposal, as amended along the lines suggested by the national statistical experts and the Council working group.
The ECB has also approved this system of two definitions, even if they would prefer legal acts with only one definition for important statistical indicators.
Excluding swaps and forward rate agreements from the deficit calculations under the excessive deficit procedure would indeed place an unnecessary constraint on the market activities of the national debt managers.
Swaps, forward rate agreements and other financial derivatives may, in some cases, reduce the cost of government borrowing and are, as such, useful tools for debt management.
I introduced separate treatment for swaps and forward rate agreements, thus paving the way for a first reading agreement on this dossier.
My personal view is that I would not like to take this dossier to second reading or to speak on this issue again in this Chamber.
I hope this issue will be swiftly dealt with, not only in the sitting tomorrow, but subsequently in the Council.
The technical nature of this issue should make this possible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mrs Kauppi for her work and for her explanation.
I understand that this is a very technical and complex piece of work but I would say that, ultimately, what we are dealing with is a relatively straightforward matter: changes have been made, as Mrs Kauppi explained very clearly, to the accounting criteria for the swaps arrangements and forward rate agreements.
On paper, there are arguments for and against these changes, but the introduction of the new concept and the changes made to SEC 95 in order to enable us to adapt to the criteria that are widely accepted today definitely posed a problem with regard to the system for calculating public deficits. They also altered the figures that we had hitherto taken into consideration, which produced an imbalanced approach and those responsible for managing the public debt of the Member States have suggested that we continue with the previous system for excessive public debt.
The Commission feels that this is an acceptable approach because the alternative would be to modify the previous system.
We are not talking about deliberate, statistical lies.
We are simply talking about applying different criteria to different objectives.
In our view, the matter does not present major difficulties and will even provide greater coherence.
In the long term, we will certainly have to find a way to harmonise these two concepts, but we think that at the moment, the best approach is to maintain the criteria for excessive public deficits as they are currently applied.
In this respect, I can also inform you that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur are perfectly acceptable to the Commission.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
EU election assistance and observation
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0060/2001) by Mr Fava, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication on EU Election Assistance and Observation [COM(2000) 191 - C5Â­0259/2000 - 2000/2137 (COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, it goes without saying that we associate ourselves with the guiding spirit behind the Commission' s communication on election assistance and observation, namely the principle that encouraging genuine democracies is not only an ethical imperative but also a condition of sustainable development and lasting peace, a specific mandate of the Union in application of the Treaties, and the foundation of our foreign policy.
I would like to add that it is also something else: it is a commitment that is not formal, but is difficult, which cannot be relegated just to declarations of principle but which must be built through consistent, practical political acts.
That is therefore the role of the European Union and the European Parliament in election assistance and observation, given that free elections are a necessary precondition for democracy.
Two 1999 Council Regulations represent the legal basis for transforming our role into a substantial commitment.
In what way?
A consistent political strategy is necessary.
So far, we have chalked up eight years of totally generous election assistance and observation, often with excellent results: I refer to Zimbabwe and Russia.
However, it has been a matter of occasional interventions, so we are very much in favour of the Commission' s communication, which provides us with a coherent political strategy.
Another necessary step is to extend that strategy to every stage of the intervention in the observation which precedes and accompanies the elections, because the democratic process is not exhausted on polling day.
It involves establishing the proper connections between electoral support and development aid policies, a structured relationship with the international organisations, the NGOs and civil society, not using the mechanisms of the delegation, which we have often settled for, but rather the mechanisms of genuine political cooperation.
Our report has sought to make contributions in a number of areas, first and foremost on the role of Parliament.
Under no circumstances - especially not in this specific case - can Parliament be regarded as a mere notary, called upon to ratify an electoral process or the quality of an electoral process.
Our legitimacy and our function are political in nature and our presence in the Union' s observation missions - our proper political role - can represent added value for the European Union.
So it is useful for the European Parliament to be present at every stage, including the stages preceding election observation in the strict sense, and it is desirable - where the right conditions exist - to have the European Union mission led by a Member of Parliament.
What is more, our record is excellent: our former colleague, Mr Schori, led the mission in Zimbabwe.
Moreover, political role and visibility are being won in the field, and I see them as a resource not only for Parliament but for the European Union as a whole.
Another fundamental point is the need for institutional coordination between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
We advocate a permanent consultation mechanism, regarding this as preferable to an interinstitutional agreement which would be more cumbersome and require very demanding inputs of time and management and implementation methods.
Taking up the suggestions of certain Members, we advocate a half-yearly timetable allowing constant monitoring of what is happening, given the very violent accelerations political history records these days.
We advocate the creation of an adequately staffed election department within the Commission, and one of our amendments calls specifically for numbers equal to the task facing the Commission.
In our opinion, a greater and different kind of flexibility in the European Union' s commitment criteria is needed.
First, elections and regional elections may not be sufficient parameters for recognising when it is appropriate to intervene.
We are participating in the election observation in Peru and that is certainly not the first election.
Flexibility is definitely needed in the evaluation standards.
The two words 'free and fair' do not cover everything Parliament and the European Union should focus on in their election observation activities.
This is not rigidity; it is rigour, and a necessary rigour, because what has primarily been lacking over the last few years has been rigour in choices and approaches.
Moreover, strategy consists of rules and objectives.
In conclusion, we feel - as does the Commission - that democracy is a process, not a choice made on a single day.
We know that genuine democracy in many countries starts to be built on polling day and goes on from there.
We want to continue to make our resources available, and not just economic resources but the resources of our democratic heritage and our political commitment as well.
Mr President, I will begin by endorsing what my colleague Mr Fava has said.
Throughout our negotiations on this issue we have had very good cooperation.
He has always understood the importance of a strong development perspective since half of all the EU observer missions have been in developing countries.
And the European Union, as a multinational organisation of fifteen developed democracies, clearly has a duty as well as a significant role to play in all the global efforts to promote democratisation, sustainable development and peaceful progress.
I would like to welcome this communication from the Commission which provides the necessary clarity on these issues and a real focus on how the European Union should proceed and probably do these things better in the future.
The main point, as Mr Fava has said, is that simply holding periodic elections is not enough to guarantee democracy in any circumstances.
Elections are not just about a snapshot on a day; what is at stake is how we cover the whole electoral process.
This is the strong emphasis in the report that we are looking at this evening.
It is essential that any verdict given by the European Union does not inadvertently legitimise, endorse or give any kind of support to any kind of dubious electoral process.
The phrase "free and fair" should be avoided: it is loaded vocabulary which is always ruthlessly targeted by the media in any post-election circumstances.
As the European Union's representative in Cambodia I was very well aware of how difficult that phraseology was.
It is also very important for us to emphasise the need to support domestic observer teams.
These are the key people in developing countries who understand social, political and cultural issues which we, when we parachute in to observe elections, might not be aware of.
On the Parliament: we recommend that Parliament sets up an election coordinating group able to provide much faster and more efficient responses.
I also would like to ask the Commission what resources, particularly staffing, will be dedicated to the important task of delivering the aims of this very important communication.
Finally, the European Parliament is a central player in the Union's efforts to cover elections.
Our credibility is at stake here and I welcome the opportunity offered to us by the Commission to define a very clear and shared vision of Europe's role in the democratic process in countries all over the world.
Mr President, first of all, I should, also on behalf of my group, like to express my appreciation for the Commission communication and for the report and attendant resolution by Mr Fava.
I welcome the fact that the European Commission has screened the EU policy on election assistance and observation and has come up with proposals for a better approach towards this policy, and for updating the same.
Too often, this policy has been referred to as ad hoc and has been associated with last-minute delegations, with little impact and visibility on the part of the Union.
In those cases where impact and visibility did form part of the package, most of the time, it was because the European Parliament had been handed the helm from a delegation - a case in point being the sterling work by Mr Gahler in Zimbabwe and by Mr Cushnahan recently.
That is why the report by Mr Fava is so significant: among other things, it draws on the European Parliament' s extensive experience, and is receiving a great deal of support from our group, partly for that reason.
All our amendments have already been approved in the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and that is why we have not tabled any fresh amendments.
Despite this, I should like to emphasise a number of points in order to bring our position more into focus.
We support the setting up of separate election observation units at the European Commission and Parliament.
Not only should the units focus on the elections themselves, but also the period in the run-up to the elections, because it is often important to know whether candidates and parties are given fair chances before the elections.
I would in this connection refer to the recent re-election of President Museveni in Uganda: it is now no longer a secret that his rivals did not get a fair chance at all to run a campaign.
In fact, it is beyond me why, in Amendment No 1, the rapporteur and Mrs Kinnock propose to delete the phrase "whereas the election period is a democratic expression of political pluralism and must be organised in accordance with internationally recognised standards" .
I really cannot see the point of this, and we therefore oppose it.
My second point is that observers must be well prepared, so that all participants are aware of the potential problems they could run into in the country they are visiting.
This can, of course, be done by e-mail and internet, but it would be good if preparatory discussions were held in addition.
Furthermore, the delegations should preferably consist of MEPs mainly, and be sufficiently large in order to be able to gain a sound insight into the elections locally.
The members of the delegations must leave for the countries in question in good time in order to observe the electoral preparations.
They should preferably be headed by a prominent MEP or ex-MEP with sufficient clout to be able to stand up to people like President Carter, for it occasionally seems as if he is the only one who matters.
In addition, it is of course useful and necessary for the delegations to establish good working relations with other organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE.
Finally, the European Union should consider mixed observation delegations, for example involving members of parliament from the ACP countries, especially if ACP countries are at issue.
That can only benefit the strength and credibility of a delegation, and that is what it is all about.
Mr President, I should like to express our appreciation for the Commission and the rapporteur' s report, and we hope that, thanks to that report, policy in this area will really improve in the short term.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Fava on his report, which I believe addresses a key factor in the coherence and visibility of the European Union' s external action.
I think that electoral observation and support for electoral processes are an extraordinarily important factor for bolstering the European Union' s action to protect human rights, democratic freedoms, democratic values and the rule of law.
A point that Mr Fava made very well is that we must not isolate the processes of electoral observation from their overall context.
Citizens are required, on certain occasions, to cast their vote, but the process of building democracy is a daily task.
I therefore feel that the European Union' s action must be directed at ensuring long-term democratic stability in developing countries through the efficient funding of the corresponding programmes, in which the Commission has a crucial role to play.
I should like, Mr President, to focus very briefly on the role that the European Parliament should play in these processes.
I think that paragraph 9 of the motion for a resolution contained in Mr Fava' s report very rightly emphasises the fact that, ideally, these missions should be chaired by Members of the European Parliament.
There are three basic reasons for this: first of all, the European Parliament can contribute highly relevant experience, knowledge and vision on this matter, since, as Members of the European Parliament, we have all been elected in open and democratic electoral processes in our Member States. Secondly, the European Parliament gives legitimacy to our project of integrating Europe and I think that Parliament is therefore extremely well-qualified to represent the European Union.
I would say it is better placed to do this than the national parliaments.
Thirdly, the European Parliament is ultimately one of the two branches of budgetary authority.
The European Union is the world' s largest donor of development aid and I think it is therefore appropriate that the European Parliament should have a role to play in this type of process.
I therefore hope, Mr President, that this report by Mr Fava on the Commission communication on EU election assistance and observation missions will contribute to improving the European Union' s external actions in an effective, visible and coherent way.
Mr President, it is unfortunate that free and fair elections are still not a matter of course in many countries.
Especially in Africa, elections are often accompanied by intimidation, violence, fraud or the elimination of rivals via constitutional reform, as was recently the case in the CÃŽte d' Ivoire.
The sending of observers is therefore very useful, but can also entail risks.
Observers can be manipulated and played off against each other.
They can be used as alibis to legitimise a regime which has gained power via unlawful means.
We should therefore exercise the greatest caution, both at the time when we decide to send observers and locally during their checking and reporting activities.
There is still too much improvisation going on at the moment.
People are sent out without being properly briefed, knowing the background or talking the official language.
A compulsory brief beforehand is therefore a minimum requirement.
It is also necessary for the different observation teams to work together more closely.
Too often, observers arrive late and leave early.
There is a great deal of manipulation before the elections, by tampering with electoral registers or the banning of meetings of the opposition.
Sometimes, the process disintegrates after the event, when a Head of State refuses to accept the outcome, as was the case in Togo.
A small nucleus of long-term observers may be able to offer a solution here.
All of this is only useful, of course, if something is actually done with the observers' reports afterwards.
In the past, economic or strategic interests have too often got in the way of the interests of democracy and human rights, unfortunately.
Let us hope that the Commission communication and Mr Fava' s excellent report will be followed up and will lead to a more coherent and consistent attitude towards undemocratic regimes.
Mr President, Commissioner, I was honoured to be asked by Commissioner Patten to lead the EU electoral observation mission to Sri Lanka.
It was a challenging task and I would like to pay tribute to all the members of the team which I was privileged to lead and work with.
I would also like to acknowledge the great cooperation and support I received from the head of the EU Mission, Mr Ilkka Uusitalo, all the heads of the EU diplomatic mission as well as the government and opposition parties in Sri Lanka and particularly the Elections Commissioner.
Based upon my experiences there, I would like to make a few points in the context of the Fava report and the Commission communication, both of which I warmly welcome.
The credibility of an EU observation mission's final report will depend to a significant degree on the perceived and actual independence of its work.
It is absolutely imperative that neither the chief electoral observer nor any of the team pursues a political agenda in relation to the country they are observing.
The mission must, at all times, act independently and be seen to do so.
This means that the integrity of the team must never be compromised by actions which could be construed as having a bias towards any political party or grouping or NGO.
Furthermore, while it is important that the observation team should consult local EU diplomatic missions, it must be independent of them and EU missions must not interfere with fellow nationals or the mission as a whole.
I was fortunate that this was my experience in Sri Lanka.
It is also desirable that the composition of the EU team should not only draw upon youthful idealism and enthusiasm but should also have considerable depth and wealth of experience.
One final point I would like to make is that the value of an electoral observation exercise is seriously diminished if there is no follow-up.
If the final report of the observation mission concludes that there were serious flaws in the conduct of the election and makes recommendations as to how they can be prevented in the future, the Council and the Commission must act and both must be prepared to use sanctions in the fields of EU trade policy and donor aid to achieve this.
As Mr Fava said in his excellent introductory speech, democratic elections are the essential foundations for sustainable development, as well as of course for sustainable democracy and pluralism.
The Union supports and intends to continue supporting election processes in countries in transition towards established democracy as a key element in our external relations policy.
The Commission communication on electoral assistance and observation was a response to a request from Parliament and the speeches this evening have indicated that we responded in the right sort of way with the right observations and arguments.
The communication was designed to boost our performance in this whole area.
The case-by-case approach previously followed was, it is generally agreed, no longer acceptable.
Wheels were too often reinvented and roles too often confused.
In the Commission we want to see all three institutions fully engaged in the Union's support for democratisation, so I very much welcome this report.
It is a useful complement to the communication which highlights the European Parliament's unique added value as the European Union's own democratically elected body.
I would like in particular to comment on a few issues raised by the report.
First, a few remarks on coordination and information among the European Union institutions, which I consider to be absolutely essential.
I would certainly welcome the adoption of appropriate arrangements among the European institutions to reinforce our coordination and to better define our roles and responsibilities, including the establishment of a Parliament election coordination group.
Our coordination should begin with a definition of European Union priorities, based on an exchange of views on an election calendar which the Commission now produces.
We cannot and should not observe or support every election.
Human and financial resources are limited and many countries have no need for outside support.
So prioritisation is essential and Parliament should contribute to this.
A regular discussion, perhaps every six months as suggested by the report, would be very welcome.
Before we decide on how and whether to observe a particular election, exploratory needs assessment missions are now the rule.
We will share their findings with other institutions in order to involve Parliament at an early stage, as the report suggests that we should.
Such missions will determine the nature of our observation.
As stressed in the report and the communication, elections are not one-day events.
Observation of the different stages of the electoral process - registration, nomination, polling, counting and appeals - are crucial.
The Commission is not interested in election tourism.
Normally the advanced part of the European Union election mission will start at least five or six weeks before the polling day.
The core mission must be experienced and have appropriate technical expertise.
The involvement of members of this House in electoral observation missions plainly makes considerable sense.
As the Commission notes, MEPs, as elected representatives, have a profound knowledge of all aspects of electoral issues.
The Commission wants to cooperate fully with the Parliament in this respect and to integrate any parliamentary delegation, if it so wishes, into the European Union election observation mission.
It would also be involved in the training, briefing, de-briefing and deployment of observers.
When participating in missions observers are, of course, bound by the European Union code of conduct for electoral observation and the general principle that the European Union must speak with one voice.
So the chief observer must be the only spokesman for the EU election observation mission.
Mrs Kinnock asked how we intended to pursue this work in the Commission.
We are currently finalising a restructuring of tasks between the Europe Aid Cooperation Office, the Directorate-General for Development and my own external relations DG.
The idea is to establish, for each election in which we are involved, an election team comprising all the services concerned.
Once the restructuring is finalised we intend to inform Parliament of the exact sharing of tasks and, of course, we are prepared to provide a list of staff as Mrs Kinnock has asked.
I believe that the recent experiences where Members of this Parliament, for example Mr Schori and Mr Cushnahan, have been appointed chief observer have been extremely successful and should be repeated.
The visibility of European Union action is important.
The best visibility is obtained by running an effective and professional operation.
However, the chief observer should, I would hope, be reasonably media-savvy and politically experienced.
Sustainability is important too.
Support for democracy, as Parliament rightly points out, is a long-term process.
The Commission believes that the recommendations of our missions must be built into development strategies and also into our political dialogue with the country concerned.
For example, the President of Sri Lanka will be visiting President Prodi and myself later this week.
We will urge her to implement the recommendations made by successive observation missions, including the one led by Mr Cushnahan, above all for the establishment of a truly independent elections commissioner.
The aim should be to promote changes and build capacity so that international observation becomes unnecessary.
On coordination with other organisations and the building up of domestic capacities, I would like to stress that the European Union has worked with many international organisations and NGOs on election assistance and observation and we intend to use the same approach in the future.
Parliament's report deals with a hugely important subject.
The European Union stands above all for democracy and the values enshrined in the rule of law, pluralism and civil liberties.
We all know that democracy and democratisation, on which our development policy is largely based, are about more than just elections.
But properly held and freely conducted elections are a necessary if not sufficient condition for democracy.
So it must be right for this European Union, increasingly and rightly seen as one of the bastions of democracy in the world, to devote much greater effort to promoting free and fair elections in countries where the rights which we are too often inclined to take for granted are still fragile or under threat.
I would like to congratulate Mr Fava once again on his report which offers sensible and valuable advice as to how we can raise our game in this whole area.
We look forward to working very closely with Parliament in carrying this work forward and once again I want to commend those Members of the Parliament who have already played such a distinguished role in trying to ensure that democratisation is a reality in countries all over the world.
Common strategy on Ukraine
The next item is the report (A5Â­0083/2001) by Mr VÃ€yrynen, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Common Strategy of the European Union on Ukraine [C5Â­0208/2000 - 2000/2116(COS)].
Mr President, the European Council accepted the Union' s strategy on Ukraine in Helsinki in December 1999.
Now, more than a year later, we can say that the basic premise of the strategy is the right one.
The report that was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy only features certain proposals connected with the implementation of the strategy and some supplementary proposals.
In my report I have adopted the same general approach as Parliament did with regard to Mr Oostlander' s report as a basis for the Union' s policy on Russia.
Thus the report openly criticises Ukraine for its shortcomings regarding the implementation of democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the market economy.
On the other hand, it recommends that the Union should improve cooperation to help Ukraine solve these problems.
Ukraine, however, is very different from Russia.
It has a major strategic importance both for Russia and the West.
Ukraine is split internally.
The western parts of the country were, for a long time, part of Poland or Austria-Hungary, and there the Russian population is relatively small.
The country' s central and eastern parts have long been under the influence of Russia and many Russians live there.
The Union must seek to bring about a situation where Ukraine can unify and have balanced relations with Russia, on the one hand, and the West, the European Union and NATO, on the other.
Ukraine now clearly orientates itself towards Europe.
We have to encourage and support the country in this.
I have tried in my report to place Ukraine in a wider pan-European context.
My basic reason for this was the views adopted in Elmar Brok' s report on enlargement.
Paragraph 56 of the report reiterates the idea of a new European area that would be based on a market economy and free trade, protection of the environment, democracy, human rights and security.
Paragraph 57 calls on the Council to develop a comprehensive pan-European policy for the Union by combining the enlargement process with the bilateral and multilateral external relations of the Union.
It goes on to propose that the EU should make systematic use of both the Council of Europe and the OSCE for preparing the present and future candidate countries for membership and for promoting the goals of the CFSP and integration on the pan-European level.
These paragraphs are, to some extent, open to interpretation.
It is clear that Parliament hopes that a comprehensive pan-European policy will be created for the Union.
But the new European area' s connection with the proposal that the Union should start using the Council of Europe and the OSCE as a tool of pan-European policy remains open to interpretation.
My own thoughts are that creating a new European area as a separate organisation could easily come into conflict with the fora that already exist.
For that reason, we should first make use of existent organisations and act without prejudice in this regard.
Finally, I would like to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and, especially, the 'shadow' rapporteurs for their constructive attitude to the report.
I would like to make one criticism, however. The committee adopted too many amendments, in my opinion.
As rapporteur, I prepared a draft version which already exceeded the set length.
The 21 paragraphs of the draft contained everything that was essential, in my view.
In the vote on the report, however, 37 paragraphs in all were added - many of them against the recommendations of the rapporteur.
I think we should consider together ways of preventing adopted reports from being made too bulky or fragmented in committees and in plenary.
On this basis I am wary of amendments which would only serve to increase the report' s length.
Mr President, I very much welcome this balanced and thoughtful report.
It is a report which is very well worth reading.
My first visit to Ukraine was back in 1991, soon after independence, to attend a health conference.
More recently my visits have largely centred on nuclear issues.
Last week I met a group of ten members of the Rada who were in Brussels to learn of our institutional relationships.
In all the contacts that I have made over the years I have been struck by the desire for closer links with the European Union.
Ukraine has not found the transition to a market economy an easy process.
They have yet to bring their regulatory and financial structures closer to our own.
Privatisation goes ahead slowly.
But we should look upon these efforts in positive terms and with understanding.
It is almost impossible to talk about Ukraine without reference to nuclear power.
I believe I am the only Member of this Parliament who has visited Chernobyl, Khmelnitsky and Rivne, the three stations which have featured frequently in our debates.
The latter are the two sites where reactors are now being completed to western safety standards.
But we should recognise that Ukraine also has a coal industry and is pushing ahead to promote energy efficiency and renewable sources.
Our financial support should encompass the whole sector.
Concerning the report of the European Investment Bank, I would include support for tourism and agriculture.
The latter has plummeted in recent years and both can do much to drive the economy forward.
I hope that this report will be strongly supported tomorrow and that the Members of the Rada will see in its adoption an emphatic endorsement of their wish for ever-closer relations with the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the common strategy of the European Union on Ukraine comes before plenary at a time when it is no longer possible to keep track of the symptoms of crisis in this huge, important country at the crossroads between east and west.
The murder of the journalist Georgiy Gongadze and the subsequent demonstrations, some of which were countered with violence, highlight the inner weaknesses and democratic deficits in this country eleven years after its secession from the Soviet Union.
The rapporteur, whom I should like to thank, is equally conscious of these facts and of Ukraine' s economic plight, with its high foreign debt and even higher exodus of capital, where large sections of the population live in poverty and wealth is concentrated in a few hands.
That this is a breeding ground for corruption and international organised crime cannot be a matter of indifference to us.
Human trafficking in general and the trade in women in particular and illegal immigration have a spill-over effect on the European Union and need to be effectively combated, with the help of the European Union, especially as, once Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania accede, Ukraine will form the external border of the EU.
The common strategy on Ukraine and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with it rightly seek to consolidate democracy, the economy and society and bring Ukraine closer to the EU's system of values.
What has been done so far still falls short of the mark, despite the funds which the European Union has given Ukraine.
Ukraine itself has set itself the ambitious target of being ready for accession by 2007.
Even if this sounds more like pie in the sky under the present circumstances, the VÃ€yrynen report points in the right direction by finally giving Ukraine the prospect of accession and by mooting the possibility of a free trade agreement without precluding accession at a later date.
With the enlargement of the EU imminent, everything should also be done in the form of cross-border programmes and assistance with border management in order to avoid erecting new dividing lines in Europe.
This is all the more important in that Ukraine plays a fundamental role in European security, both as a result of its commitment in ex-Yugoslavia and its involvement in the Partnership for Peace, as the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership with NATO proves.
The Ukraine also plays an important role in the network of relations between the EU and Russia and as a regional force for order.
The VÃ€yrynen report shows how we can help Ukraine to help itself and extend our mutual relations.
Mr President, the words I am about to express are intended as a token of my friendship towards the Ukrainian people.
I am aware of my responsibility as Chairman of the Interparliamentary delegation, but I also believe that it is important for us to be critical on occasions.
The EU' s common strategy with regard to Ukraine is the practical expression of a clear, political stance, namely that Ukraine forms an integral part of our continent, that welfare and stability in Ukraine have a substantial impact on welfare and stability in the rest of Europe, and that, for that reason, the European Union is willing to assume part of the responsibility for the democratic, economic and social development in that country.
That is the good news.
However, let it be clear that the European Union cannot shoulder responsibility for building up the Ukrainian state and helping that country in its socio-economic development on its own, or even take the lead in doing so.
With this common strategy, the European Union and its Member States have demonstrated their willingness to give the necessary technical and financial back-up, provided that the Ukrainian political leaders are willing, and have the courage, to take control of a process of far-reaching reform.
That is a difficult, but not impossible task.
If we are critical, we are so in the interest of Ukraine.
Our demands of that country should be the government' s own.
Part of the EU' s responsibility is also to express our concern about the issues which relate to the fundamental human rights and civil rights in that country.
This includes, among other things, the investigation into the murder of journalist Gongadze.
As Delegation Chairman and co-chairman of the EU-Ukraine cooperation committee, I have already called for further investigations, also with regard to the brutal and harsh manner in which demonstrations have been broken up in Ukraine.
Governments are not formed on the streets, but democracy can be killed off on the streets if the right to the freedom of speech is taken away from the population by means of violence.
That is the bad news.
In the capacity of Chairman of the parliamentary cooperation committee, I will presently be joining my colleagues in a trip to Ukraine, in the hope that we, partly on the basis of the report which is being discussed today and adopted tomorrow, will enter into a fruitful discussion on the issues which concern us all and about which we need to be concerned as a group.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate Mr VÃ€yrynen on his report.
The explosive situation in Ukraine makes this report very much one of its time.
The Union now needs a clear common strategy for its policy on Ukraine.
The report offers a strong foundation for that strategy. Our group supports its main premises.
There is good reason to criticise the country for its serious shortcomings in the areas of human rights, democracy and freedom of speech, among others.
There are also problems there with the implementation of a market economy.
At the same time, however, we need more effective cooperation with the Union for Ukraine to be able to solve its acute problems.
Secretary General Solana recently reminded us that Union programmes should be focused and prioritised.
The committee, however, has apparently forgotten this instruction and has overburdened the report with numerous amendments, making it unreasonably bulky and fragmented.
This is something the rapporteur also referred to in his speech.
In the plenary we must prune these unnecessary amendments and focus on the essence of the issue.
In addition to ensuring that the human rights situation improves and that the rule of law takes root, the question of energy is something I would like to raise.
The worst safety problem has been eradicated, since Chernobyl was finally shut down.
It must be a condition of the Community' s financing of energy that proper care is taken of the environment and safety standards conform to western standards.
Ukraine also needs a comprehensive energy plan to which the country' s government and leaders can commit.
Cooperation and an increase in trade will require extending the trans-European transport networks as far as Ukraine.
At present the plans for, and implementation of, these networks stop at the Ukrainian border.
Mr President, when we talk of the strategy on Ukraine, the question of the finality of the EU resonates in the background and hence the question of whether or not Ukraine, as an important European country, has a chance of one day becoming a member of the European Union. There are two ways of looking at this.
Either we say no, economic and trade agreements suffice, in which case the EU will only be able to make a minor contribution to stability and will be unable to apply its strict criteria.
Or we give Ukraine the long-term prospect of membership and immediately start applying a comprehensive stability strategy which, first and foremost, strengthens democracy and then leads to social and economic development.
But then Ukraine must not become the atomic dump of Europe!
Mr President, the current political unrest in Ukraine is extremely ill-timed.
It is precisely at this moment that the country is climbing out of an economic trough in a most spectacular manner.
The highly-charged battle surrounding President Kuchma' s direct involvement in the sinister murder of the journalist Gongadze is threatening to thwart the undeniable reform course of the Yushchenko government.
This on-going scandal is also affecting the European Union.
The clear report by Mr VÃ€yrynen underlines the importance of the EU' s relations with its future neighbour, Ukraine.
It is in Europe' s interest to have effective democratic rule in Kiev.
And there is no sign of that yet, claims Mr VÃ€yrynen, and rightly so.
In fact, the political pandemonium surrounding the sinister Gongadze affair has widened the chasm between Ukraine and Europe.
What can, and should, Europe do about this depressing state of affairs?
Rapporteur VÃ€yrynen provides a realistic solution of granting European aid, as before, for actual Ukrainian reform efforts and consciously keeping the door open to full EU membership for Ukraine.
This option of entry is not least intended as a necessary incentive for the country' s reformists to persevere in their vision and policy.
Mr President, after the Soviet empire broke up, a Polish diplomat stated that if Ukraine remains independent, Russia has a chance of becoming a normal state.
This profound statement - probably a true Polish wish - is in line with the political desire of the Member States and candidate countries of the European Union.
The VÃ€yrynen report manages to illustrate this in a realistic manner.
Mr President, in Parliament earlier today there was some discussion about the future shape and direction of the European Union post-Nice.
There is much about these plans and ambitions to which some of us might object, but one of the strengths of the European Union at its simplest is its role as a pole of attraction for countries that have not had the benefits of democracy, the rule of law and economic prosperity.
The prospect of European Union affiliation or membership is a great incentive for countries that have lived under communism for many generations to put their political and economic house in order and to resolve long-standing problems with neighbouring states.
In the course of this present decade Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania will become European Union Member States.
They border Ukraine, a country of enormous geopolitical significance, whose very existence is a major factor in the security and stability of Europe, but where recent developments are cause for concern.
It is in all our interests that Ukraine should be helped in its consolidation as an independent, democratic country anchored in the west but with an open, vibrant and friendly relationship with Russia to its east.
In this regard we should not forget that, in addition to its association with the European Union, Ukraine also has a strong partnership with NATO, which has contributed to the sense of security of Ukraine, as well as much-needed military reform.
Mr VÃ€yrynen should be congratulated on an excellent report, even if it is somewhat longer than he had originally intended.
It is so important now for the European Union to improve the focus and implementation of its strategy.
Let me touch very briefly on one very specific aspect: the issue of anti-personnel landmines.
Ukraine signed the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition of the use and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines in 1999.
It has yet to ratify its accession. Meanwhile, it has the fifth largest stockpile of APL in the world, with an estimated 10 million weapons.
The Ottawa Convention places an obligation to destroy stocks of APL.
We should expect Ukraine to take action.
I hope the Commission and Council will place emphasis on this aspect in their dealings with Ukraine.
Mr President, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a most balanced report and then, if I may, I should like to comment on a strategic point which particularly concerns me.
Following the political upheaval in central and eastern Europe, association agreements were concluded in a bid to help these countries one day become members of the European Community or Union.
Ukraine was not one of them.
The question of the borders of Europe, which reappeared on the agenda with the fall of the Iron Curtain, has never been seriously discussed here, and hence nor has the fate of Ukraine.
However, the answer to the question of the borders of Europe is that Europe does not end east of Bulgaria because that is where Ukraine lies, and not just Ukraine.
Europe' s borders cannot be determined unequivocally, which is why the complete enlargement of the European Union is a contradiction in terms.
The current enlargement concept will inevitably bring about new divisive borders in Europe, for example between Poland and Ukraine.
This is a huge problem, which is why we need a new concept.
Since 1989/90, Europe has no longer been politically or geographically divided; it has become an open continent.
What sort of concept do I mean?
The principle of exclusivity, whereby a candidate country is either fully assimilated into the EU or is completely excluded should be replaced by the following concept: any country which thinks of itself as either partly or wholly European, such as Ukraine, should be given the opportunity to decide if, and to what extent, it is willing and able to subscribe to European policy.
This would maintain the vision of the founding fathers of a free Europe in the dialectic sense and allow us to focus again on the crux of the matter, as formulated at the time, namely to create peace in freedom for all the nations of Europe.
Mr President, I would like to sincerely thank Finland's former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr VÃ€yrynen, for his admirable work.
On 7 February this year, the Swedish Presidency commented on the general situation in Ukraine and, at that time, highlighted the disappearance of the journalist, Georgiy Gongadze, whose fate touches us all.
Ukraine will soon be a neighbour of the EU.
Mr VÃ€yrynen's report deals with our immediate neighbours once the EU is enlarged.
We can see a similar development in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, with increased political unrest, antidemocratic tendencies, economic recession, increasingly authoritarian regimes and reduced political pluralism.
As the first Vice-Chairman of the European Parliament's delegation to these three countries, I am concerned about this development.
I have had the opportunity to meet various representatives in the country, for example the young mayor, Natalia Gnatyuk, and the leader of the young people's movement of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, Andriy Yaniv.
Their message to us was: do not forget the importance of ethics and religion in our country's development.
I would like to direct two questions to Commissioner Patten, who is doing an excellent job for the EU as regards foreign policy.
Firstly, I wonder how the Tacis programme and the partnership and cooperation agreement can help to strengthen ethical and moral principles, particularly in the areas of commerce, politics and civil society - something that is necessary in a country like Ukraine.
Secondly, I wonder whether, in light of the fact that both countries are developing in the same direction, it is tenable or reasonable in the long term to treat Ukraine and Belarus as differently as we are at present.
Can we isolate one country, but not the other?
This is a good report.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
It gives an impressive overview of the situation in Ukraine at a crucial juncture in the country's history.
The current events there are of deep concern to all of us.
The regrettable violence in recent days and its causes underline the present risks to the political and economic stability that are so important for Ukraine, as our common strategy makes clear.
The situation is particularly worrying, given that Ukraine will share such a long border with the European Union after the first round of enlargement.
Ukraine wants to draw closer to the European Union and its neighbours.
We welcome that.
But, for that to happen, Ukraine must be able to demonstrate its willingness and ability to live up to basic values, European values, values which are also set out in our partnership and cooperation agreement. That means strengthening the rule of law.
It means making progress in the fight against corruption. It means adopting market-oriented legislation.
As the report points out, Ukraine has, alas, lost a lot of time, but it is a country with a vast potential in terms of economic and human resources.
With the creation of the government under President Yushchenko things have certainly improved but there is still very much to be done.
Several Members have referred to the Gongadze case.
It has brought to the fore not just the issue of journalistic freedom but of a pluralistic society and the way executive power is exercised in Ukraine.
The House will recall that in early December, shortly after the Kuchma tapes had been presented in Parliament, the European Union expressed its deep concern about the disappearance of Mr Gongadze.
In January, President Prodi had a long conversation on this case with President Kuchma when they met in Berlin.
I am sure Parliament will have seen the statement that the Swedish Presidency released prior to the recent ministerial troika visit to Ukraine.
I was part of that troika delegation.
I can assure Parliament that we made our position abundantly clear.
The only way to deal with this issue is complete transparency in the short term and adequate checks and balances in the longer term.
I want to emphasise this evening - it should not be necessary to do so - how strongly we feel about this issue.
The Swedish Presidency has included the European Union's support for the establishment of a free media in Ukraine in its working programme on the implementation of the common strategy.
It will organise a seminar on independent media in Kiev.
We are also ready to provide technical assistance.
The report rightly stresses the need to promote economic growth and trade in Ukraine, but for this the conditions must be right.
Recent reports drawn up by the European Business Association, the OECD and private bodies concentrate on the overall investment climate.
They make clear how far there still is to go.
In Ukraine the private sector still accounts for less than a quarter of GDP.
An EBRD study two years ago suggested that managers of Ukrainian enterprises spend up to 17% of their time just trying to find a way through regulatory requirements.
As stated in the excellent report before us, energy sector reform is absolutely crucial for economic stability and growth in Ukraine.
It is also a key condition in the memorandum of understanding of 1995 on the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
Together with our international partners we are following Ukraine's progress in reforming the energy sector very closely and we are providing substantial assistance in close cooperation with the Ukrainian authorities.
Gas and electricity market reform is also one of the priority projects in the TACIS Action Programme 2000.
I am glad that the report finds the main focus of the TACIS Programme for the Ukraine appropriate.
The report has proposed enhanced attention to certain activities.
I can confirm that a number of them are indeed being incorporated into both the TACIS Indicative Programme for 2000 to 2003 and the Ukraine Action Programme 2000.
This goes for projects concerning institutional, legal and administrative reform as well as assistance for private sector development, economic development, development of NGOs and civil society.
Addressing the social consequences of transition in the health sector and the labour market is another important part of TACIS activities.
So far our cooperation has concentrated mainly on technical assistance in the area of justice and home affairs. TACIS customs and border-crossing programmes are aimed at improving both operational capacity and the efficiency of customs and border controls to curb criminal activities.
More explicitly directed at combating organised crime is an anti-money laundering feasibility study which supports Ukraine's efforts to establish the necessary legislation and to create a financial intelligence unit.
For the future, following frequent requests from the Ukrainian side, more attention will be paid to the eastern borders of Ukraine, to control better the influx of illegal migrants who seek to enter the Union illegally.
I say to the honourable gentleman who spoke last in the debate that, as far as the overall purpose of the TACIS programmes is concerned, they do, of course, have to incorporate the ethical considerations, the democratic considerations, the market-oriented considerations to which he quite properly and quite eloquently referred.
We need to recognise and act upon the legitimate concerns in the Ukraine regarding the possible consequences of enlargement.
Overall I remain convinced that these will be largely beneficial to the Ukrainian economy but there will be problems, for example, on the movement of people between the Ukraine and its western neighbours.
We need to take the time to manage these issues so that they do not become a barrier between the enlarged European Union and our Ukrainian partners.
Mr Van Orden referred to the stockpile of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine.
The point he makes is entirely valid.
It is one which we were recently discussing with our Canadian colleagues at the ministerial meeting between the European Union and Canada and I hope that we can make progress on that extremely important subject in the months and years ahead.
The work that we - the presidency, the Commission and Parliament - have done so far is evidence enough of the seriousness of our engagement in Ukraine.
Despite the considerable internal problems in that country, some progress has undoubtedly been achieved.
The closure of Chernobyl, for example, has marked, I hope, a turning point but we shall still be deeply involved in the follow-up.
In terms of our political agenda we can now focus on other issues: on the rule of law, on democratic checks and balances, on stimulating trade and investment, on setting the framework for cooperation in justice and home affairs and on the relationship between Ukraine and the European Union after enlargement.
This is vital work on which all the European institutions will need to concentrate in the coming years.
I congratulate the honourable Member on his report.
I rather sympathise with his view.
I do not think that it required all the subsequent authorship to which it has been subjected but he showed a good deal of long-suffering charity in his remarks, which is also not surprising.
He has written an excellent report and our relationship with the Ukraine will benefit from his wise advice.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon.
Organisation and management of the Internet - Policy issues 1998 - 2000
The next item is the report (A5Â­0063/2001) by Mr Carraro, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on 'The Organisation and Management of the Internet - International and European Policy Issues 1998-2000' [COM(2000) 202 - C5Â­0263/2000 - 2000/2140(COS)].
Mr President, the report begins by welcoming the Commission' s communication, seeking, first and foremost, to take full advantage of the last few years' experience of the Internet, and hence of self-government through ICANN and its bodies.
As well as experience of self-government, there has also been experience of self-regulation, which certainly represents an excellent example of the role the Internet has been able to play in the progress of communications and the world economy over the last few years.
Even the criticism in the original outline of the report, on the need for all five continents to be represented on the governing body or on the ICANN board of directors, no longer applies, because at the very moment the initial draft appeared, the representative of the African continent was taking his seat on the ICANN board.
That is why an amendment has been tabled to paragraph 6 and a split vote is requested on paragraph 7, as part of it is now superfluous.
The report expresses our full support as regards the role the European Commission can play in terms of organisation and management of the Internet, representing all the Member States of the Union.
However, it also makes the clear recommendation that this should never take the form of interference by political authorities or, worse still, by the Commission and the European Union bureaucracies in the Internet' s governing and operational bodies, precisely because its positive experience of self-government and self-regulation must be fully respected.
Rather, the Commission is called upon to work alongside the US Government.
In recent years, the US Department of Commerce has given substantial backing and encouragement to the process of ICANN' s progressive independence from the US Government.
We therefore urge the Commission to cooperate with these positive tactics by the US Government in order to carry this process of independence and autonomy of the Internet and its governing bodies right through to a conclusion.
The key problem facing Europe, which must, of course, be dealt with by the competent party, is how to close the gap behind the United States in this sector and other more advanced parts of the world.
We therefore fully support the proposal to create the EU domain in the sector and we recommend homogeneous standards at European level on registration, protection of domain names and action to combat fraud, cybersquatting, and so on. A homogeneous European market is no small aspiration, even for the Internet, but I think it is one of the essential conditions to guarantee development and attract investment, including investment in infrastructure which is still in deficit on the continent of Europe.
In fact, we can only have a market large enough to be competitive with North America if we have a homogeneous market.
Finally - the last point made in the report - the process of telecommunications liberalisation needs to be accelerated and completed because that is obviously closely linked to the future and the progress of the Internet on the continent of Europe.
I do not think it is necessary to say anything further on that because the Commission and Parliament have done a great deal of work in that direction in the last few months.
I not only want to acknowledge the excellent work Commissioner Liikanen is carrying out in this field. I also want to express total faith and confidence in his and the Commission' s will to bring the process to a conclusion with consistency and determination, because it will constitute another decisive thrust not only for the development of telecommunications on the continent of Europe but also for the organisation, operational stability and development of the Internet in our Member States.
- Mr President, I would like to congratulate and indeed thank Massimo Carraro very much for an excellent report.
It gets to the heart of the matter.
It is very well analysed and I would also like to thank him on behalf of colleagues on my committee for being very open to us.
We worked very closely together and I hope he feels that our committee added value to his own efforts.
I wanted to focus on a number of key issues from the point of view of the Legal Affairs Committee. This whole issue of governance of what is becoming a crucial international resource is something that is of particular importance.
We are at a very important transitional stage where the European Union needs to play a crucial balancing role in moving the system of Internet governance from one that has been traditionally dominated by interests in the United States to becoming a truly global organisation.
The United States Government has played an important and benign role because the initial Internet developers and technologists came from a United States background.
This report quite rightly draws attention to the very crucial role that the European Union has to play in achieving this transition.
The other important issue is the role of public authorities.
Clearly there is an important role for public authorities but it must not become overbearing.
International governance of the Internet owes its success so far to the fact that it is not based on complex international treaties.
It has been the responsibility of a series of groups of experts.
It is very much governed by the individuals and users who are operating the system.
We should leave it that way but of course monitor it and make sure it works for the benefit of all the citizens that use it.
Alongside that, the other crucial issue for the Legal Affairs Committee is the question of domain name registrations.
This whole area is evolving very rapidly and with the development of the Internet, simple commodities like names, text, strings and characters have become very valuable.
There needs to be a body of governance which is based on competition law, to make sure that allocation is carried out in a free way and ensure that world international copyright laws protect the legitimate rights of citizens who own those names to overcome the problem which has been picturesquely described as cyber-squatting.
In conclusion, I would say that this is a very important report in an area which will become increasingly important to all of us.
Those of us that use the Internet everyday take the basic plumbing behind it for granted.
But we should not do that.
We have to take a real interest in a commodity - a utility - that is going to be increasingly vital to all of us.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today' s headlines read "Death.com" !
The new dotcom industry is in a real state of crisis and yet the markets have taken to it most enthusiastically.
Data volumes are currently doubling every three months, meaning that, in theory at least, there are two conflicting currents.
On the one hand the crash in share prices and a spate of bankruptcies in the industry and, on the other hand, a huge demand for and a huge fascination with this industry, which is extremely widely used.
Domain names have also proved to be valuable commodities.
The first stock exchanges are being set up on which you can trade, auction and sell your own domain name, which is why the question of intellectual property arises here: what is being done about licensing?
Will it be possible in future to grant compulsory licences if, for example, a compulsory link can simply be set up on one well-known web page to another web page?
How will we settle disputes if it comes - and it will come - to intercontinental disputes?
Will the WIPO alone have jurisdiction here or is this already a matter for the WTO?
I think that questions of abuse and questions of criminality need to be looked at primarily in an international context.
We need consumer confidence in electronic commerce and that can only be achieved with fair and proper registration.
In the final analysis, we can also signal acceptance of EU laws by creating an EU domain and this, in turn, will have enormous repercussions on e-commerce.
Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Carraro, for this competently prepared and timely report.
This ICANN manoeuvres the Internet' s information channels and determines who has the use of addresses and how they might achieve this.
Whole countries can fall foul of the organisation' s tyranny and be cut off from information if they do not agree to play the game.
Companies' profits can dive if a letter or dot is put in the wrong place.
The organisation' s power now extends to copyright and consumer matters, and that power is growing all the time.
But the organisation is supervised by no one and responsible to no one.
This is a peculiar combination!
Recently there was a vote to increase the Board of Directors to nineteen members.
Of the three billion of those entitled to vote in the network vote, just seventy-six thousand did.
It is a strange game!
This is an incredibly undemocratic system in an incredibly important role.
The Commission has quite rightly taken action, and so it must.
But we need something more.
ICANN cannot be the administrative organ of the networked world or its nerve centre without having any responsibility, led by a random group of people. Surely somebody must be responsible for something.
I would nevertheless like to thank the Commission and Mr Liikanen, who has worked hard to produce an excellent document for the Stockholm Summit at this serious point in time, which Mr Carraro, among others, referred to.
It is an important contribution, and it will give hope to the IT sector in its proposal for measures that would make it easier for companies to function, increase employment and, as a result, boost European competitiveness.
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament has reason today to be rather self-critical.
As early as 11 April 2000, the Commission submitted its communication on Internet policy 1998 - 2000 and we know that the ICANN meeting in Melbourne was concluded yesterday.
Mr Paasilinna, the Commissioner and I have had the privilege of being able to read newspapers which have reported something of what has supposedly taken place in Melbourne.
If you log on to ICANN's own home page, you find only scanty details of what has actually happened.
Has the putting of the domain names .bytes, .info and .pro into use been delayed?
Is it true that a Norwegian company has got the top domain name?
How are the negotiations going for the EU regarding our own top domain name?
Many such questions remain unanswered, and it is amazing that there is nothing to read on the matter on the net.
The Commission and the rapporteur correctly stress that openness is required in the administration.
Even Mr Paasilinna said that there could be cause for criticism in this area.
I also wonder what allies the Commission had in Melbourne.
Did we have any representatives at the meeting?
How representative can ICANN be considered to be?
The same question was asked by Mr Paasilinna.
I think that Parliament needs to take considerably greater advantage of the fact that the former Swedish Prime Minister, Carl Bildt, has been appointed to head a panel for the administration of ICANN.
We therefore have good reason to be self-critical.
We have reason to consider how, for one year, we have been able to delay the handling of this matter.
We need to work more quickly.
The report raises many other important issues, including those that were debated in preparation for the summit in Stockholm.
Here, I would like to express my agreement with the words of praise directed at the Commissioner for pointing out how to launch the e-Europe programme, while at the same time the Finance Ministers are snatching away the basis for the same programme.
I am extremely grateful that the Commission and other Member States want to raise this serious issue in Stockholm.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am all in favour, as the report says, of democratising the whole decision-making process in connection with the management of the Internet.
It is an important point but, unlike many of you, I am less concerned with EU location nationalism and more concerned with who can actually use Internet technology.
It is a new technology and it is only a good new technology if a lot of people can use it.
The digital divide mainly runs between north and south and this is a huge problem because in the south hardly anyone has access to the Internet.
This is why I think it is important for the EU to make a commitment to limit the north/south digital divide, for us perhaps to launch a programme for the purpose and, above all, for us to invest in public access, for example in schools and libraries.
Only then will as many people as possible be able to use the Internet in the south and only then shall we reach the point at which people can obtain information on their own initiative and develop their talents freely and without censorship, including on the Internet.
Mr President, we are talking about the Internet and the word that springs to mind after Internet is 'surf'.
What does that word evoke?
For me it brings to mind the sea, which reminds me of Christopher Columbus. And that is because Christopher Columbus was, as you know, born in Genoa.
He was Genoese, not Portuguese.
The tie I am wearing this evening bears the emblem of the city of Genoa, so I could hardly refrain from speaking on such an important matter.
I have asked to speak, Mr President, to point out that there is also a social Internet, not just a commercial Internet.
The social Internet means that, thanks to the computer and the Web, adults, older people and pensioners can continue to learn, be informed, and achieve that famous lifelong learning.
Secondly, the Internet provides an opportunity for disabled people to work. Someone who cannot walk can perfectly easily work on the Internet, and so overcome his disability.
Thirdly, computers installed in rest homes and linked to the Internet make it possible for sick and elderly people who cannot move to talk with their families, their children and their friends, and go on living in the world, so to speak, even if they are unfortunately guests of a rest home.
So I hope this Internet board - and Europe too - will remember that, as well as the commercial Internet, there is also a social Internet for old people and pensioners.
Mr President, the report involuntarily illustrates the extent to which the EU is lagging behind on two counts which are of crucial importance in today' s world: one is a working democracy and the other is Internet practicalities.
While we sit here discussing these issues until the witching hour, the Americans have already organised special senate hearings to look into the problems in detail.
Even as an ICANN director, having been elected a few weeks ago, I am having trouble finding out exactly what ICANN does.
We simply do not take time to stop and think about it.
A few technical points have been addressed.
I completely fail to understand why this Commission does not publicly stand up for the fact that we have dot kids, we have dot sex, that we have detailed subdivisions which make everything we have discussed here possible, a clear division between e-commerce and the public sector.
The decisive move will be to cut ICANN free from this American domination, not because it is dangerous per se, but because the management of the Internet is at stake and you must do here what you normally only talk of, Commissioner, and create openness and transparency.
Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Massimo Carraro, for an excellent report.
It is full of technical detail, but Mr Carraro has managed splendidly to raise the economically and politically important questions.
Malcolm Harbour also deserves our thanks for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
At the same time I wish to thank the members of Parliament for this debate.
There will come a time when the Internet will be spoken about by day and the Chamber will be full.
For that reason I congratulate you: you are an avant-garde group in this field.
The Commission began to monitor these matters closely in 1997, when discussions started in the United States regarding the future of the management of the Internet.
The Internet' s revolutionary impact on communications generally and ecommerce in particular later confirmed the importance of this area of policy.
Numerous questions arose in connection with the development of the Domain Name System (DNS) with regard to competition, freedom of speech, consumer protection, trademarks, rights to names, the reliability and transparency of transactions, the protection of privacy, the protection of data, and so on. The Commission agrees fully with the view expressed in the parliamentary report that these matters of public interest must be solved in a consistent and effective manner, with regard to the Internet.
At present the most important international forum, which has the powers and scope to begin discussions on these questions, is the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), which is an intergovernmental organisation.
The Commission and the Member States are involved in large-scale programmes of cooperation in this area.
The main aims of the EU parties involved are to ensure that the globalisation of the management of the Internet will also continue during the term of the new American administration, and make the job of the GAC more effective in the debate on political questions.
As Mr Carraro said, relations with the USA in this field are important, when we take account of the fact that the US congress and a part of the private sector is inclined sometimes to deny or ignore the Internet' s global dimension.
We shall maintain close contact in this matter with the new American administration and we intend to send Mr Evans, US Secretary of Commerce, as soon as Parliament has voted in the report, a letter in which I shall clearly explain the interests of the EU in this field, and I shall also make known to him the content of your report.
Last October, the Council of Ministers passed a resolution on this issue.
In it the Commission was empowered to coordinate positions within the EU, pursue the EU' s interests in international contexts, and establish a private sector network to support the work of the EU in this field.
It is most gratifying that Parliament' s report should be in agreement with this policy and that the Commission' s actions have the support of both Parliament and the Council.
This is important from the point of view of how effective we can be in international arenas.
I would then like to make a few observations and comments with regard to Mr Carraro' s report and Mr Harbour' s opinion. The report highlights the importance of defining the EU' s role, and I am happy that it expresses the desire to accord the Commission a strong position in these matters.
Similarly, I note the desire to restrict the intervention of governments in the international self-regulatory process. In this respect we must advance one step at a time and bear in mind that our goal is a truly international, balanced and impartial regulatory system.
But we have to recognise that we have not yet achieved this aim.
The US Government still has special powers and ICANN' s Board of Directors and staff are still not always necessarily aware of all the EU' s views.
For this reason, the Commission will follow the situation closely and inform our partners immediately of any problems that may crop up, for example, in the area of competition policy.
I am also ready to accept the general aims with regard to the administration of the ICANN, which have been set out in paragraph 8 of Parliament' s resolution.
In practice, however, it remains very much the task of those involved coming from the private sector and, in particular, the national ccTLD Registries, to express their views within the structure of the ICANN.
This is one reason why the Commission, back in 1997, urged players in the European private sector to get involved directly in action that would later take the shape of the ICANN process.
I have to say that this has produced some excellent results, of which it is worth mentioning Europe' s firm involvement today in ICANN' s Board of Directors and supporting organisations.
Many European organisations and companies were represented at the meeting this week in Melbourne.
Unfortunately, I still have not had access to any report on the meeting, but I will inform the members of it as soon as I do.
The delegates will have come back from Melbourne by now, but there was still nothing about it on the Internet when I left my room.
Paragraph 15 of Parliament' s resolution also refers to codes of conduct, best practice and legislation in this area.
The Internet operators and users have a lot of work to do in these areas.
The Commission obviously cannot do everything on its own.
We can take appropriate action to promote and speed up the self-regulation process with the private sector and other governments, for example, within the framework of the Governmental Advisory Committee.
I have also noticed that Parliament' s resolution expresses the will to allow Member States to take care of certain matters.
The national registries and the principles they are based on are very largely within the competence of the Member States.
The Commission, however, has sought, in unofficial working parties and in an advisory committee, to introduce jointly approved principles.
If the need arises, the Commission is obviously prepared to use its powers, for example, in the areas of internal market legislation and competition policy.
Finally, may I say that the Commission agrees with the rapporteur about the importance of liberalising the telecommunications industry and investing in the backbone Internet capacity both in Europe and internationally.
We are actively seeking, with the help of a framework research programme, both to promote the development of the second generation Internet and strengthen cross-border and international links with regard to European research networks.
Regarding the .eu proposal, it is at present being discussed by the Council and Parliament.
As soon as a legal basis is found for this, the Commission will take every practical step it can to ensure that European communities, companies and citizens have the use of this our own .eu facility, where the players will therefore obviously have to comply with European legislation, including the protection of privacy.
The Commission will notify the Council and specialists in the field in the Member States of the contents of Parliament' s report.
Thank you all once again!
Work of ACP/EU Assembly (2000)
The next item is the report (A5Â­0057/2001) by Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proceedings of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2000 [2000/2106)INI)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about the activity of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 2000 and this is perhaps a rather different type of report to those produced in previous years on this issue.
Firstly, because specific events occurred in 2000 which have had an effect on the workings and even the very identity of the Joint Assembly, but also because we deliberately wanted to give the report a somewhat innovative approach.
In addition, therefore, to the traditional reminder of hard data on the activity of the Assembly for that year, we opened a more politically-charged debate on the role of the Assembly itself and, what is more, on how we should view the role of the Members of the European Parliament in the Assembly.
In addition to any formal or legal considerations, we feel that as Members of this Parliament who are also members of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, we are not there as individuals. We are delegates and therefore our activity within that forum must be guided and then judged by our Parliament.
We therefore believe that, from a democratic point of view, it is crucial that this annual report on what has taken place in the Joint Assembly should cease being a largely routine and bureaucratic process and become a balance of accounts presented to the European Parliament by its delegates.
Similarly, the debate on this annual report should be an opportunity for Parliament to guide the work of its representatives in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly over the coming months.
Looking at the events of 2000, what marked the year was the approval, following extremely lengthy negotiations, of the Cotonou Agreement, which ratifies the legitimacy in law of the Assembly and brings it up to the category of Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Above all, 2000 marks a turning point in the European Union' s cooperation with the ensemble of the 77 States from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific that are already associated members.
The effective implementation of the Treaty is also, undoubtedly, the most significant development this year for the Assembly.
The catalogue of events is described in some detail in the report.
There was the Abuja Summit in Nigeria in March and the meeting in Brussels in October, together with the new designation of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
Important events took place at those meetings, such as the general report on globalisation, the hearing on AIDS and the notable presence of President Josselin and of Commissioners Lamy and Nielson. An unfortunate problem was also encountered, however: the presence of representatives of the European Parliament in plenary, and especially in the working groups, was lower than we had hoped for.
Amongst the challenges that remain, the Treaty provides for the mobilisation of civil society, which is the collaborative fabric required for its very implementation, and here we need to consider how we can ensure that this is achieved efficiently and without confusion, putting each person in the right position for him or for her.
Another challenge is to exploit the Assembly' s huge potential for coordinating positions of the associates of the ACP and the European Union, in order to make the process of cooperation and development and the Treaty itself more effective and perhaps also to establish positions of consensus for approaches in other forums such as the WTO, for example.
One of the prime conditions for achieving this is for the European Parliament to assume full responsibility for work in the Joint Assembly and to give this work the priority it deserves.
I shall conclude by saying that in the report' s conclusions, I included a few lines on how I think the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should operate.
Of course, decisions on this fall to the Assembly itself, but Parliament has the responsibility to state its criteria in order to guide the work of its Members in this Joint Assembly.
These guidelines coincide almost entirely with the proposals that have been agreed in the Assembly' s own working group on how it should operate.
Finally, I would add that our motion for a resolution includes many amendments by Members of various groups, which all make a valuable contribution, as well as two further amendments, which were tabled in the debate in Parliament by the European People' s Party.
I would ask you to vote in favour of the former.
The latter seeks to remove a paragraph that was added to my initial proposal in an amendment by Mr Van den Bos, of the Liberal Group, which was approved in committee.
I think that this paragraph addresses a series of important issues which could be debated by the ACP-EU Assembly' s own committees and I do not think it would be useful to remove it at this stage.
It does not hold us to anything and does provide a range of interesting ideas.
I would therefore ask the PPE Group to withdraw this amendment and, if they do not do so, I would ask you to vote against it.
To conclude, I wish to thank the secretariat of Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation for their considerable cooperation.
I should also like to thank my fellow members of that committee and all of you for your attention and for your votes, which I hope will be favourable tomorrow.
Mr President, in congratulating Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez on his report I reiterate that our major achievement in the last twelve months has been to support the signing of the Cotonou Agreement, a huge restatement of Europe's commitment to development against a backcloth of globalisation and liberalisation elsewhere in international relations.
Our task now is to act as the watchdog to ensure that those mutual commitments on trade and aid are fully realised.
On trade, it remains a concern that the European Commission failed to get common agreement with our ACP partners in the run-up to the Seattle WTO meeting.
The Commission failed to consult, through the joint EU-ACP trade committee laid down in Cotonou, in recent discussions on "Everything but Arms", whilst the long-running problems over the banana regime remain unresolved.
Trade access is the key to development for our ACP partners, just as it is the acid test for Europe's genuine commitment to put development first.
On aid, it appears that the good principles for civil society participation have not yet been realised during the first programming exercise under Cotonou.
The lack of mechanisms for civil society negotiations in some ACP countries poses real problems.
The Commission, through its quality support group, we in the Joint Assembly, and not least the beneficiary governments should all uphold our responsibilities in this respect.
This is not just an issue of support for non-governmental organisations; it is also about our support for the whole principle of good governance.
On this question, there is much in the resolution to commend in relation to promoting the role of directly-elected parliamentarians within the Joint Assembly.
But just as we often debate in this Chamber problems of abuse of human rights and of conflict, let us also give positive recognition to continuing moves towards peace and democracy in many African countries.
This includes, for example, recent welcome moves to national dialogue by Joseph Kabila in the Congo, the democratic alternation of power in Cape Verde, the tentative maintenance of the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea and, as we saw for ourselves in the Joint Assembly last year, the entrenchment of democracy in post-Abacha Nigeria.
Finally, on a lighter note, much of this may seem to be remote to Europe's citizens whose support is essential to our partnership with Africa.
So it is with great pleasure that I tell you that in my own country - the UK - this Friday, a biannual awareness and fund-raising extravaganza for Africa, called Comic Relief, will see otherwise serious citizens don red plastic noses to raise cash and a laugh in solidarity with Africa.
I, myself, will be serving quaint British cherry Bakewell tarts to users at the Suffolk Learning and Resource Centre in Bungay and will then go on to sell handshakes at 10p each to schoolchildren at the Highwood Infant School in King's Lynn, Norfolk.
And yes, I will be donning a red plastic nose in common with everyone else.
Not only should the European Parliament congratulate everyone involved, we should underline that through such creative public exercises our electors show us that they back the political commitment to development, embraced in our partnership with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific and marked by tonight's debate.
Mr President, the Cotonou Agreement establishes the parliamentary dimension of the Joint Assembly.
This means that only democratically elected representatives, without exception, have the right to participate and to express their views within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
But a single representative for each ACP country prevents opposition representatives from gaining access and expressing their views and hence obscures political pluralist expression in these countries.
Moreover, the principle of one vote for each country in the ACP group as opposed to one vote for each person on the European side is not a fair one.
The very structure of this Assembly is therefore unbalanced.
The European Parliament is an institution in its own right. The ACP group does not have an existence outside its appearance at the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and does not have an organisation in the form of political groups.
Secondly, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has taken on a new role, but decision-making powers are not everything.
It does not have the right to use European Development Funds; it does not participate in the procedure to ratify the Cotonou Agreement.
We will therefore vote for the report by Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez with conviction because it highlights these shortcomings.
But the Assembly must continue to reflect on its composition, its function and its powers so that, in 2001, it can become a joint, fair Parliamentary Assembly.
Mr President, I hope the lack of attendance at this debate tonight is due to the late hour and not to the way in which I have chaired the two Assemblies we are talking about over the last year.
I sincerely thank the rapporteur, not just for his report and the way he has presented it tonight, but for the very hard work he does both in the ACP and in the Development Committee.
I have prepared this report twice.
I know how hard it is to find fresh ideas and yet he has come forward not only with fresh ideas but with extremely good points that we have now tried to incorporate in our rules for the future.
The past year has been a watershed for the ACP/EU partnership.
There was a lot of resistance about going to Abuja, in Nigeria last year.
But I felt that it was vitally important that we were seen to support this fledgling democracy.
